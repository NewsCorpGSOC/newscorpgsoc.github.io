-And so it happened-: the occupiers restore the intact, leaving the ruins out of sight	reported this by the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor. At the same time, the occupation administration decided to start work in Luhansk, which almost unscathed by hostilities. The city plans to repair the roofs of nine apartment buildings. Other localities are likely to be left out of consideration for subsequent programs. In addition to real estate, the occupiers took up land. By January 1, farmers and sharecroppers in the occupied Luhansk region must re-register their land plots according to the legislation of the Russian Federation. Failure to comply with this requirement threatens to -nationalize- the land. Re-registration requires a full package of documents according to Russian standards, including a Russian passport. This creates additional pressure on local residents and forces them to accept the citizenship of the aggressor country. As reported by ArmyInform, in Alchevsk, as well as in other settlements of the temporarily occupied Luhansk region, the situation with the removal of garbage has remained critical for more than ten years. Spontaneous landfills continue to grow, and instead of solving the problem the occupation administration chose the path of repression, installing more than 100 video surveillance cameras to fine citizens for littering.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/21/i-tak-sojdot-okupanty-vidnovlyuyut-neushkodzhene-zalyshayuchy-ruyiny-poza-uvagoyu/	2024-11-21T01:08:44-08:00

Drone operator training: The Ministry of Defense is expanding the network of certified schools	The Ministry of defense of Ukraine. The project aims to test new approaches for increasing the training of future operators, instructors and external crew members of unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned aerial systems (UAVs/UAVs) for the Defense Forces of Ukraine. -Drones should fight, and people should control them from a safe distance. Today, driving a drone is no longer a hobby, but a requirement of the time. The number of units of unmanned systems has increased in the Armed Forces, there is a demand for such vacancies. That is why we have to increase the number of certified schools where people can receive professional training,- stressed the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General Anatoly Klochko. The process is directly handled by the Main Directorate of State Aviation of Ukraine, whose representatives have formed a certification commission. It is there that applications from organizations are considered and within five days a decision is made to issue a school certificate or to refuse it with reasons. Certified schools involve representatives of the training centers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, other components of the security and defense forces for the practical exam. Based on the results of the practical exam, school graduates are given certificates with recommendations for assigning a military accounting specialty (VOS). Graduates of schools who are not military personnel can receive VOS after acquiring the status of military personnel and passing basic military training (BZVP). Military personnel studying at certified schools can obtain a military accounting specialty based on the results of successfully passing a practical exam. It is envisaged to maintain a list of certified schools and their graduates. This will make it possible to know the potential of trained UAV operators, and the Defense Forces will be able to appoint specialists to positions related to the use of unmanned systems. As reported by ArmyInform, the OSCE held a course for Ukrainian specialists in mine countermeasures.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/21/navchannya-operatoriv-droniv-minoborony-rozshyryuye-merezhu-sertyfikovanyh-shkil/	2024-11-21T00:21:46-08:00

For example, the media cites the position of Polish President Andrzej Duda, who says that this could be a turning point on the front. But military expert Petro Chernyk has a different position. He explained to the correspondent of ArmiyaInform why the possible US permission for Ukraine will not be a turning point. -Permission for ATACMS strikes deep into Russian territory cannot and will not be a turning point in the war. With one single exception, if these missiles are given several thousand, and this is a fantasy. There will be no fiction,- says the military expert. And he adds that our country was given somewhere in the range of a couple of hundred of these missiles: -We used a certain amount, if they give a couple of hundred more, it will be very good. ATACMS will help to really hold the Kursk bridgehead. Because it is they who are called to destroy warehouses with ammunition, warehouses with fuel and lubricants: this is if we are talking about the cassette part. And the high-explosive part is the control points and communication nodes. Chernyk emphasizes that if everything goes like this, then everything will be complicated for the enemy in terms of knocking us out of Kurshchyna. -And this is already a big geopolitics. Our task is to hold out until next year's dry weather cycle,- the expert noted.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/21/atacms-kurskyj-placzdarm-ta-dozvil-ssha-ekspert-pro-te-chy-bude-zaraz-perelam-na-fronti/	2024-11-20T23:27:28-08:00

Fifty artillery systems and more than 1.5 thousand occupiers: the General Staff of the Armed Forces ...	The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine informs about this. The total combat losses of the enemy from February 24, 2022 to November 21, 2024 are approximately: As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy became more active in the East: most of the assaults fall on three directions .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/21/pivsotni-artsystem-ta-ponad-15-tysyachi-okupantiv-genshtab-zsu-oprylyudnyv-vtraty-rosiyi/	2024-11-20T21:26:49-08:00
The enemy has become more active in the East: most of the assaults are in three directions	The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine informs about this. The enemy launched one missile strike, 61 air strikes using 91 anti-aircraft missiles, more than 560 kamikaze drone strikes, and carried out more than 3,000 attacks on the positions of our troops and populated areas using various types of weapons. On the Kharkiv direction, there were four combat clashes with the Russian invaders in the Vovchansk and Staritsa areas, near Kozachai Lopan, the enemy dropped three guided aerial bombs. In the Kupyansk direction, the enemy tried 23 times to dislodge our units from their positions near Kolisnykyvka, Zagryzovy, Kucherivka, Kruglyakivka, and Zeleny Gay. Ten times the enemy attacked in the Lyman direction, trying to advance in the direction of Cherneshchyna, Zarichny, and Thorny. Actively used bombing and attack aircraft in the areas of settlements of Novoyehorivka and Zakitne. In the Siversk direction, the Russian occupiers dropped ten anti-tank missiles in the Siversk region. On the Kramatorsk direction, the enemy dropped five aerial bombs in the areas of the settlements of Chasiv Yar and Lypivka. The enemy tried seven times to wedge into our defenses in the Toretsk direction. The occupiers in the Toretsk and Shcherbynivka areas were fiercely repulsed by our defenders five times. Two attacks are ongoing so far. The enemy is intensively attacking the Ukrainian defenders in the Pokrovsky direction. Here, the aggressor carried out 33 assault and offensive actions. The greatest activity of the Russian occupiers remains in the areas of Myrolyubivka, Pustinka, Promin, Krutiy Yar, Krasniy Yar, Lyskivka, Yuryivka, Zhovte, Petrivka, Dachenske, Novooleksiivka, Hryhorivka, and Pushkine settlements. Twenty-two attacks in the direction of the Ukrainian defenders have already been repelled, eleven more clashes are ongoing.

In the Kurakhiv direction there are 23 combat clashes. The invaders remain highly active, trying to advance in the areas of the settlements of Berestki, Zorya, Sontsivka, Maksimilianivka, Katerynivka, Elizavetivka and Antonivka. Units of the Defense Forces repelled seven enemy attacks, 16 attacks are still ongoing. The settlements of Ulakly and Andriyivka were hit by guided bombs.

Today, the enemy did not conduct active operations in the Orihiv and Gulyajpil directions. Our soldiers repelled the attacks of Russian invaders five times in the Dnieper direction. Defense forces of Ukraine continue the operation in Kursk Oblast. Enemy aviation continues to strike with guided aerial bombs on the territory of Russia. At the moment, 20 air strikes with the use of 33 anti-aircraft missiles are known. There were no significant changes in the situation in other directions. The department also honored the soldiers of the 39th separate anti-aircraft missile regiment and the 124th separate territorial defense brigade, who in extremely difficult conditions restrained the attacks of the enemy's superior forces, causing him serious losses. As reported by ArmyInform, the -Sivalka-VM8- flamethrower systems of the RHC-defense units of the Support Forces carried out fire damage to the enemy's manpower with special thermobaric projectiles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/21/vorog-aktyvizuvavsya-na-shodi-bilsha-chastyna-shturmiv-prypadaye-na-try-napryamky/	2024-11-20T21:21:46-08:00
Encircled battles, destruction of alligators and revenge against the marines of the 155th brigade: a...	ArmiyaInform journalists visited the 82nd Bukovinsk Airborne Assault Brigade, which broke through the Russian border and is still performing tasks on enemy territory. In more detail about the participation of paratroopers in this operation, its commander Colonel Dmytro Voloshyn said: -In my opinion, there were several key aspects. First of all, secrecy in the planning and preparation of the operation. And also the secret movement of troops. We had several interactions with the Commander-in-Chief and were instructed to move to a new area. We moved to the Sumy region in three days at night. But they did it in such a way that even some of our units, which should have known about it, did not know. I even had a conflict with the head of the VSP, who should have known that I was moving and should have provided me with an escort. And he found out when we moved, about three days after that. It is a real skill to move unnoticed by an organism like a brigade. You yourself understand that personnel, heavy equipment, and shells were being moved. Already on the territory of the Sumy region, we disguised ourselves as much as possible. There was no -shuffling-. No one knew that the 82nd Brigade had appeared there. And this continued for about a week after the operation began. For example, Russian media reported that the 22nd Mechanized Brigade broke through the front line and went deep. For understanding, the 22nd brigade was moving behind me. She was in our second echelon. The second aspect is who was bet on to carry out such an operation. And I think the airborne assault troops did it for once. The third aspect is the territory on which we fought. If you look at it, it is a rough terrain, full of difficult sections. I do not think that the enemy saw it as suitable for large-scale operations. And it is necessary to hit where it is weak, where the enemy does not expect. Yes, it was difficult. But we coped with it. Of course, another aspect of success was provisioning. Sometimes I think that if the Commander-in-Chief had raised problematic issues at some regular interaction, then I would have said that I need some kind of intergalactic blaster, I think that it would have been found for us somewhere within a week. To be honest, they gave literally everything. So that you only perform tasks properly. He attacked, destroyed the enemy, took possession of certain areas and borders. And all this, in fact, was successful. After all, the credo of the airborne assault troops is that we do not back down in the face of difficulties, we move to the end. And the main aspect why we have succeeded in all this is the belief in what we are doing. My immediate, faith of my subordinates. No one said: -we have to go to Russian territory anyway.- When the soldiers were told that they had to go and fight in enemy territory, the reaction was quite expected: -finally we will go and slander these bastards on their territory.- Why not? Our country is destroyed every day, children die. So let them also feel what war is like, but for them it is somewhere far away. The first day was probably the most difficult, you had to overcome a barrier in your head. After all, the introduction of such large-scale offensive actions is a very difficult task, taking into account the enemy's use of various means of fire damage. These are high-precision weapons, anti-aircraft missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, military aviation, FPV drones, and Lancets. Of course, it is like that everywhere now. It stands on the stream in them. So I had to overcome this barrier in my head. Somewhere he adjusted himself to some extent, somewhere he adjusted the commanders. There was anxiety, but they went to perform the task. I thought that if we break through the front edge now, then everything should go according to plan. And we broke through the front edge. It was something with something, how we crossed the border. The entire brigade passed through one passage made in the mine-explosive barriers by the 225th assault battalion assigned to me. The car is moving, and I am thinking: now it should be hit by ATGMs, or now the Lancet should fly into it. And nothing comes flying in&#8230; troops enter in huge columns. The noise was so loud that probably the whole of Sumy shuddered. I was puzzled, because there is such a sign that when everything is going according to plan, somewhere ahead, the enemy has prepared something. The Wisent barrier machine was the first to pass. It has no weapons, just an armored car with a big bucket. He crossed the border and went to the enemy stronghold. I think, well, that's all for him. And he turned around and drove back. I had even more questions than I had. But the units went further deep into the enemy's defenses. Why we managed to break through the border in such a way became clear when I was already on the territory of Russia. They did not see us, because, as they say, no one mowed the grass in front of their positions. Literally. The grass was taller than my Hummer. And they just didn't see what was happening. They heard explosions, the rumble of equipment, but did not see. So we slipped past them and did not storm those positions. It was also nonsense for them that we do not storm positions where the enemy is, but move on. I'll be honest, when the actions started, everything just went, and we completed the tasks as I set them for myself. The tasks of the first, second, third day, we still did. They occupied certain areas, surrounded the enemy. Somewhere they bypassed him. And perhaps one of the key decisions that led to rapid success was that I did not task my units to enter populated areas. Before that, I spoke with the participants of the campaigns on Russian territory - RDK, GUR. They said that when they entered populated areas and knocked out the enemy, then they were simply mixed up with aircraft and that was it. That's why it was a failure. I decided that the enemy would build defense nodes in populated areas. Therefore, we simply bypassed them, and it was already incomprehensible to the enemy. As we passed through the front end, we thought there were maybe 200 people at most. It is clear that there were pre-prepared positions, but they looked uninhabited. And then, when the enemy was in our rear, it turned out that there were much more of them. Apparently, on the seventh or eighth day, I think you heard, the SBU special unit -Alfa- took about 120 prisoners at just one stronghold. And just so you understand, there were 30 to 40, sometimes 50 enemy military personnel at each stronghold. That is, in general, there were about two thousand servicemen in our rear. Yes, there were mostly conscripts who did not cause us much harm, and they were then taken prisoner. But such a number of personnel were in our rear, and, in fact, our soldier did not pay attention to this, but moved forward and performed his task. Of course, there were also some -slips-. The 225th battalion fulfilled its task, entered and blocked a number of settlements. In particular, the route that went from Korenev to Suja. The second battalion was supposed to go at the same time with it, but it was not possible to make passages in it. There were failures of engineering equipment. So while we were redeploying this battalion to a neighboring route, I decided to immediately bring the second echelon into battle. These units overcame the combat formations of the 225th battalion and immediately went to the first line of enemy defense. The first is because, according to the operational construction, we first overcame the echelon of the state border cover. And behind it, at a depth of 10-12 km, there was already another boundary. Again there were -dragon's teeth-, again an anti-tank ditch, again mines. Two battalions slipped through and went all the way to Novoivanivka, where they pressed the enemy and prevented him from occupying strong points on this line. With this, I set myself the task of the day - to get behind these -dragon's teeth-. If we did not do this, there would be no point in moving forward. Overcoming such barriers under enemy fire&#8230; it would be Zaporizhzhia number two. But the staff did not disappoint. &nbsp; Strong resistance was put up by the enemy's army aviation. Helicopters flew over the columns at a height of 50-100 meters. They fired from cannons, anti-tank missiles, unguided missiles. We immediately deployed anti-aircraft defenses. The first Ka-52 was destroyed with Strela MANPADS. We also damaged the Mi-8 with small arms fire. He fumed. As it turned out later, he flew a little further and also fell. That is, on the first day, we destroyed two enemy rotorcraft. They didn't fly the next day. Then they started working again. On one of these days, we destroyed another Ka-52. A paratrooper hit him with a Stinger MANPADS. The entire crew was destroyed there (ArmyInform already wrote about this episode. Read more can be read here - Ed.). About two weeks after the operation began, a large number of drones appeared here. Serious units arrived with trained crews who know how to use all this. They were constantly working on technology. Here, by the way, they encountered FPV drones in the 330 MHz frequency range for the first time. And at that time we did not have EW tools against them. But we found options. Their points were detected, fire damage was inflicted, and at this time they slipped wherever they needed. There were many different solutions that we constantly combined. While we were advancing, the enemy tried to throw at least someone to stop us. In fact, they threw their units into the tiger's mouth. The -scoop- once had such a thing as marching companies. Literally, from the wheels, they threw themselves at some boundaries with only small arms. We met such companies. They smashed them to zero. First with combat vehicles. And then the soldiers went to clean up if someone continued to resist and did not want to surrender. There were moments when our advanced units went deep into the defense, and the sweep did not have time. And the units found themselves surrounded by the enemy on all sides. But we are paratroopers. We are always in the rear of the enemy - surrounded. We were preparing for this, for a circular defense. And it does not matter whether it is a department, a company or a battalion. Everyone should be able to conduct an all-round defense. Determine dangerous directions, where to place grenade launchers or anti-tank weapons, how to -close- (mining the terrain. - Ed.). We have been trying to unblock one of the units for about a month. And they kept the defense all this time. The first real resistance was offered by the 810th Marine Corps Brigade. For understanding, its composition includes 13 battalions. And these are not security battalions at all. She arrived only by arrangement. The prisoners said that it was 96% manned and 90% equipped. My third battalion captured their APC. Yes, there was still polyethylene on the seats. New car. Only from the factory. There are also paratroopers here. 83rd, 51st, 56th, 119th Parachute Regiments. 73rd Reconnaissance. This is a Vedevesh battalion. Various -Akhmatians- are also here. Well, the most finished is the 155th Marine Corps Brigade. These are the infamous freaks who cut off heads, cut off ears, knocked out teeth, and shot prisoners. The most interesting thing is that they are so boring when they are all together. And if anything, they are afraid to admit that they are from the 155th brigade. They are called anything. I understand that this is a war. But torturing and killing an unresisting opponent is low. There are certain laws and rules of war. No normal commander would set such a task. But there are no moral boundaries in this swagger. Therefore, there is no mercy for them from our paratroopers either. We are trying to destroy them. An eye for an eye, as they say. In a certain period, units were withdrawn to rest a little. But as soon as they came out, literally in a day and a half, the enemy started his offensive actions. Of course, we were quickly brought back into battle. And so we fought for another month. For example, one of the battalions defended Lyubimivka. The enemy tried to drive in with 12 vehicles. I thought that he would just drive in and sell en masse, as was the case in some other settlements. But they immediately made mine barriers, put up a -jagoza-. The enemy blew up somewhere, started to turn around somewhere and blew up again. And the paratroopers have already finished off everyone with automatic weapons. Everything, -I wish you health-, as they say. Later, we still went for a short rest, to regroup. At that time, new personnel also arrived, because, of course, there were also losses. And we were preparing for new offensive actions. The enemy began offensive actions again to dislodge the Defense Forces from Kurshchyna. And my units returned there to carry out assault operations to dislodge the enemy from those territories where he managed to wedge himself in. Of course, it doesn't happen so fast these days. The enemy has accumulated a lot. We retook three settlements. And for the fourth one, we are -getting excited- now. Half of it has been cleared, and the enemy has been trying to attack us here all day today. In the airborne assault troops, the main thing is training and motivation. Some people say that we have some special fighters. That's not true. We take these servicemen from the same training centers as the others. We just have such an ideology - we teach them not to survive, but to kill the enemy. And we will fight to the last.

How much is paid for the destruction of enemy equipment: it's all about the monetary reward	According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, our defenders destroyed almost 100,000 units of enemy equipment during almost 3 years of large-scale invasion. The purpose of the survey is to understand how this is implemented in practice and what difficulties military personnel face. ArmyInform reminds how this reward should be paid and how much can be received, for example, for a destroyed tank or a downed plane. The payment of such remuneration is regulated by a special procedure, approved order Ministry of Defense of Ukraine dated September 18, 2020 No. 340. Yes, military personnel are paid a reward in the amount from 12,180 to 243,600 hryvnias, depending on the type of equipment. The decision to recognize the equipment as destroyed or captured is made on the basis of at least three documents. Next, a conclusion is made about the destruction (capture) of enemy equipment, and it is formalized in an administrative document (order) of the head of the troop group (forces). Confirmation of the destruction (capture) of the equipment is: An increase in the reward for the destroyed (captured) equipment is distributed by the commander's decision among the servicemen who took a direct part in the destruction (capture) of the equipment, depending on their personal contribution. Remuneration is paid to military personnel from the place of service on the basis of the orders of the commanders of military administration bodies and military units. We remind you that not only a monetary reward is provided for the destruction of enemy equipment. Also, from this year, it became possible to get additional vacation days. More about this can be read here.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/21/vynagoroda-za-znyshhenu-j-poshkodzhenu-tehniku-voroga-skilky-otrymuyut-zahysnyky/	2024-11-20T21:11:31-08:00
-Malyuk- Challenger in the service of DSHV: how a British tank beats Russians on their territory	These tanks were handed over to Ukraine by Great Britain in 2023. And now they serve in the 82nd Bukovyna Assault Brigade, which operates in the Kursk direction. Tank commander Oleksandr worked as an electric and gas welder almost all his life. After BZVP, he was offered to become a tanker, and he immediately got on the Challenger II tank. That is, he did not have experience working on other machines, so it is difficult for him to compare. But he does not have such a desire: -I once sat in Abrams.- I didn't like him. It is much smaller. In my homeland, I'll be honest, I didn't even climb. I looked at the driver's seat, looked into the tower and realized that there wasn't even enough room for me,- Oleksandr says. One of the main advantages of the Challenger II tank, the commander calls its accuracy, which is achieved thanks to the 120-mm rifled gun and the fire control system, which itself, depending on the conditions, makes all the necessary corrections: -It can work at a distance of up to 10 km inclusive. But it depends on the area. He works as a sniper. For example, if you shoot at a distance of 5 kilometers from a T-shka (a series of Soviet tanks - ed.), Abrams and Challenger, then it will hit the most accurately. It has a weather sensor that transmits information about wind, humidity and other factors to the computer. And he makes these corrections himself.- In general, the on-board computer is the brain of this tank, adds Stanislav with the call sign -Patron-, who is a loader in the crew: -He programs everything himself. For example, if two tanks leave. One at 1,800 meters, the other at 2,300. The laser is aimed at both tanks and the computer remembers two targets. And when the commander decides which one to hit, the gunner can switch between targets with just one button.- The loader is the fourth crew member, which is characteristic of most Western tanks. After all, the Soviet ones have a charging machine, so there are fewer crew members there. Here, although you have to charge manually, it is not difficult. -There is nothing complicated. Yes, everything is done manually for the first shot. I lower the shutter wedge, load everything, close it and move it to the right position. And after the first shot, everything happens automatically. You just need to throw in another projectile,- Patron says. And this tank is very strong and safe for the crew, says the commander of the vehicle Oleksandr. After all, even after significant damage, it can be driven. And it already saved the boys' lives: -Somehow he withstood the impact of a cumulative projectile during missile fire by Russian helicopters. The depth of damage was 720 mm. And the boys survived. They were the ones inside. There was another commander with them at that time.- The loading -Cartridge- was just in the tank during that shelling. He remembers that it was during the approach to Kurshchyna. -As soon as we crossed the border, 2-3 helicopters were already flying over us. And we had to take a stand. They drove and shot on the go. The distance to them was about 4 km. It is quite difficult to hit a helicopter. But something had to be done,- Patron recalls. Already when the tank was in position, the first rocket arrived. -It flew into the tower. Triplexes flew at the commander and the mechanic-driver. And when they -rolled away-, they were already driving along my triplex. I told where to go. Then there were a few more hits. They knocked out 2 rinks for us, punctured a tank. We drove through it at about 30 kilometers per hour.- Despite the damage, the tank was able to drive to a safe zone. He accomplished his mission, saving the lives of the crew. And already after the repair, he returned to the line and is again destroying the enemy on his own territory. First of all, the enemy is trying to hunt for Western weapons. That's why these tanks are the No. 1 target, says driver-mechanic Maksym with the call sign -Kalyna-. -As soon as we are spotted somewhere, all the fire is directed at us. Therefore, you need to constantly maneuver. All in all, it's a very powerful machine. And her defense is cool. But there are nuances of the engine - it needs constant maintenance. If it is done on time, then everything is fine. But this is not always possible because of the intensity of the action. And it would be possible to put an even more powerful engine here. Now it has 1,200 horsepower, but it would be great if they put 1,500.- Currently, the intensity of hostilities in the direction is very high. The enemy is trying to knock our units out of Kurshchyna. Constantly deploys large amounts of vehicles and infantry to attack. This is also felt by the tankers, who almost constantly have to advance to the task - to work both on equipment and on the enemy's manpower, covering our units. -We worked on the Zaporizhzhia and Vovchansky directions before this. I can say that every time it becomes more difficult. After all, the enemy is constantly studying us, our actions. Constantly introduces something new. But thanks to the interaction between departments, we manage everything. The result is mostly positive,- says tank commander Oleksandr. He also talks about his main fear when performing tasks. -I'll be honest, it's always a little scary before leaving. And this is a normal phenomenon. Everyone has it. But when you start working, you focus on the task at hand. Adrenaline is also on the rise. And the main fear is to let the team down. Failing to do something or doing it wrong. But then, when you see the results - how many enemies we destroyed, you already feel proud. That they didn't just leave to work, but also have a result,- adds Oleksandr. The guys' motivation is simple - it's better to stop the enemy here than when he gets to your house. Because then it will be too late.

Combat duo: what is known about the new UAV that will work together with French fighters	How informs The War Zone website, this project promises to increase the effectiveness of the French Air Force by 2033, ArmyInform reports. The industrial part of the drone program will be led by Dassault Aviation, building on its previous UAV prototype nEUROn UCAV already used in trials with manned combat aircraft. The program was announced by the French Minister of the Armed Forces, Sébastien Lecornu, during a ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of the French Strategic Air Force (FAS) at the Saint-Dizier air base. The new UCAV, which is being developed by Dassault Aviation in collaboration with the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA), will have a number of unique characteristics, including stealth technologies, autonomous control with the participation of the operator (man-in-the-loop) and internal weapons loading. These features will allow the drone to adapt to a variety of threats, as well as perform complex combat missions in support of the French Aerospace Forces. The basis of the project is the development of the nEUROn program — the first prototype of an unmanned aerial vehicle with stealth functions in Europe. The program, launched in 2003 under the leadership of Dassault Aviation, brought together industrial partners from six European countries. nEUROn demonstrated key technologies such as stealth, autonomous flight and the ability to use internal weapons such as laser-guided bombs GBU-12. As note analysts of the defense portal Army Recognition, nEUROn weighing 7 tons, with a wingspan of 12.5 meters and a length of 9.2 meters powered by Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour Mk. 951, which provides a speed of up to Mach 0.8 at an altitude of 14,000. meters Since its first flight in 2012, this demonstrator has completed more than 170 test flights, which allowed to confirm its technological and financial efficiency. The experience gained within the framework of the nEUROn program will be directly used in the development of a new combat drone. For now, the drone remains nameless, but its specs are already sparking interest. It will have stealth, which will allow it to effectively perform tasks in difficult conditions. The War Zone reports that the drone will operate in tandem with a Rafale fighter jet, which will be operated by a pilot. This interaction between manned and unmanned aerial vehicles opens up new horizons for combat tactics. Dassault has already stated that the drone will be versatile and able to adapt to future threats. Experts assume that this device will be able to perform a wide range of tasks, from reconnaissance to strikes on targets. Its internal payload space also promises to be substantial, allowing for the integration of various weapon systems. As for the Rafale Standard F5, which is expected to support the new drone, the plan is to keep the multi-role combat aircraft in the forefront until 2060. Initial research for the F5 Standard began last year, and full-scale development will begin in 2026-2027. Experts of the IKK Defense Express publication reminded that the law on defense planning of France for the period from From 2024 to 2030, the upgrade of the Rafale attack aircraft to the F5 standard, which should act as a carrier of a promising cruise missile of the type ASN4G as a means of delivery nuclear weapons. The French military stipulates that the Rafale F5 must be able to overcome various prospective threats, and accordingly this aircraft must have the necessary technological options to perform its tasks. In turn, researchers from the Opex360 portal indicate that as early as 2023 the French the military has recognized one interesting point about upgrading the Rafale to the F5 standard - for this aircraft to be able to independently perform all its intended tasks, it is necessary to increase the power of the computing equipment on board, which must process -hundreds of thousands of pieces of data-. But to achieve this, it is necessary to increase the length of the cables for various types of equipment so much that they literally will not fit in the plane itself with its current geometry. It seems, according to Opex experts, that it is against this background that the French Ministry of Defense came up with the concept of -tying together- the promising Rafale F5 and guided stealth UAV. nEUROn made its first flight in 2012 and has since completed more than 170 test flights, demonstrating its ability to remain undetected by modern air defense systems. During one of the tests in 2016, the drone successfully penetrated the defenses of the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, demonstrating its unique stealth capabilities. This experience will form the basis of the development of the new UCAV, which will play a key role in future joint operations. Presentation of the combat unmanned aerial vehicle nEUROn.

Brother for brother: a veteran gave a million hryvnias for prosthetics to a friend	About the State Border Service of Ukraine informs. Serhiy joined the ranks of border guards in 2022. During the defense of Kostyantynivka in the summer of 2023, as a result of rocket fire, he was seriously injured, due to which doctors had to amputate both legs. After being wounded, Serhiy underwent long-term rehabilitation in a Kyiv hospital, where he met another veteran, Oleksandr, who also had one leg amputated. Their communication grew into a real friendship. Serhiy's wife started fundraising for electronic prostheses, and with joint efforts, it was possible to collect almost a million hryvnias.

Because he's an idiot - Russian actor Volodymyr Mashkov was given 10 years and his apartment in Odes...	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on November 20. Since the perpetrator is hiding in the Russian Federation, the trial took place in a special court proceeding, in the absence of the accused.

Based on the evidence gathered by the investigators of the Security Service, the court found Mashkov guilty under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: Currently, comprehensive measures are underway to bring the convict to justice for crimes against our state.

Will the armistice save Ukraine: a military historian on a 100% repeat of Russian aggression in the ...	-In this situation, only we can save us. Neither Euro-Atlantic integration nor even the return of territories will save us. We must clearly understand that as long as the Russian Federation exists, it will be an existential threat to us. And, accordingly, it will not disappear even in the event of a truce. I don't say -end of hostilities- because it's not likely to be a peace treaty, it's going to be an armistice. The truce, everyone should understand, is temporary in nature and can be broken for both objective and subjective reasons at any moment. Here it is necessary to understand and immediately prepare for how and for what we will use this truce, because we must clearly understand that any truce ends in the next war. Therefore, in this situation, the Ukrainian population, the Ukrainian political community, and the world community must understand that the time that will appear in our country after the conclusion of the armistice should be used to make the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the military-industrial complex of Ukraine even more powerful Because only this is a guarantee of avoiding possible future aggression of the Russian Federation. It must be said right away that the future aggression of the Russian Federation, or at least an attempt at aggression, is actually a 100% option. And the Russians will not hide even that. They will say that they have completed the objectives of their 1st and then they will start their 2nd. We have already seen this on the example of the anti-terrorist operation that was completed by the Minsk agreements. We know this because the Russians never keep their word and are proud of it. All diplomats in the world know about this. It is written about in all history and diplomatic textbooks, everyone studies it, but no one draws any conclusions. The Victory Plan is the requirements of the President of Ukraine, which are the requirements of the Ukrainian State and are the requirements of the Ukrainian people. There is nothing surprising in these requirements. We simply demand ours back. The question is how we will succeed, how the world community will help us in this. The Victory Plan, most likely, is not an attempt to issue an ultimatum, but actions so that the issue of Ukraine does not disappear from the agenda, so that it is constantly in the circle of interests and in the sphere of interests of the leading states of the world, so that we could continue to resist. No more and no less.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/20/chy-vryatuye-ukrayinu-peremyrya-militarnyj-istoryk-pro-stovidsotkovyj-povtor-agresiyi-rf-v-majbutnomu/	2024-11-19T22:02:07-08:00

In a flock or alone: ​​Israeli aircraft manufacturers are promoting an unmanned missile-carrying hel...	How emphasized in their statement posted on the company's official portal, representatives of the company, this project is an example of unique cooperation between Steadicopter and Rafael and provides fast, maneuverable, accurate capabilities for striking heavy targets for tactical air operations, ArmyInform reports. The Golden Eagle HS unmanned rotorcraft is armed with powerful Spike missiles, which ArmyInform reported in one of its materials, designed for precision strike missions in a variety of environments, from tactical conflict zones to border protection, regional perimeter protection, and urban operations. These capabilities allow the wielder of this weapon to dominate the battlefield, providing an advantage, particularly in difficult or overcrowded areas. Experts of the defense portal Army Recognition point to the fact that, thanks to the integration of the Spike missile, the Golden Eagle HS helicopter ensures prompt and precise strikes on particularly important targets, allowing ground forces to operate from safe positions, regardless of time of day and visibility conditions. The Golden Eagle HS armament uses high-precision Spike missiles with the possibility of using -fire and forget- tactics. Equipped with a powerful warhead, this platform combines enhanced stealth with high combat effectiveness, expanding the tactical capabilities of assault forces. With a total take-off weight of 50 kilograms, Golden Eagle HS is compatible with Spike-SR missiles with a firing range of 2.5 kilometers and Spike-LR2 with a firing range of 5.5 kilometers, providing flexible applications thanks to a data link between the missile's homing head and the operator. These missiles belong to the sixth generation, capable of self-targeting with the help of an infrared homing head. As soon as the missile reaches the target, it destroys it with a powerful anti-tank high-explosive warhead capable of penetrating up to 70 cm of rolled armor. The Golden Eagle HS unmanned aerial vehicle is equipped with an advanced suite of sensors, including a high definition EO/IR tele/thermal imaging system for day and night use with target tracking capability. Integrated with advanced SightX artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the system can seamlessly detect, track and classify targets even in adverse weather conditions or difficult terrain. This advanced method of applying AI can distinguish between different types of targets, whether people or vehicles, providing ground forces with real-time situational awareness. -The launch of Golden Eagle HS in partnership with Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd is an important milestone for Steadicopter,- said Itai Toren, CEO of Steadicopter. This unmanned aerial vehicle meets modern operational requirements, providing exceptional accuracy and the ability to launch strikes in autonomous mode. -Combining experience in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles of the helicopter type with Rafael's extensive experience provides the military with a solution that increases the effectiveness of its use on the battlefield.- In turn, a representative of the Rafael Corporation added: -Our collaboration with Steadicopter in the creation of this unmanned aerial vehicle meets the changing needs of modern warfare, where innovation and advanced capabilities are critical. This partnership will allow current and future users of Spike missiles to be more versatile and effective, potentially game-changing on the modern battlefield.- Golden Eagle HS is capable of operating both independently and as part of inconspicuous swarm groups launched from different points for combined attacks on important targets. This UAV helicopter from Stedicopter is a new step in the development of rotary unmanned systems that combine compactness, autonomy and powerful weapons. With its ability to destroy heavy equipment and provide reliable air support, this drone has every chance of becoming an indispensable tool for today's armed forces.

F-16 as an air defense tool: how effective were the Fighting Falcons during the recent shelling of U...	Is it a lot or a little within the limits of the general statistics of Russian air weapons used by the enemy and shot down by the Defense Forces of Ukraine? What enemy munitions could not be shot down by F-16 pilots? How effective are the -Battle Falcons- as a component of air defense assets? ArmyInform answers these questions based on official data of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As reported President of Ukraine, on the night of November 17, with the help of F-16s, about 10 enemy air targets were shot down, without detailing which exactly the aircraft managed to shoot down the pilots of the Ukrainian -Battle Falcons-. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also noted that, in total, during the previous week, Russia used more than 900 guided aerial bombs, more than 600 attack drones and almost 140 missiles against Ukraine. Of this number, about 120 missiles of various types, including Zircon, Iskander, and Kinjal, as well as about 90 drones, including Shahed, were used by the Russian invaders on the night of November 17. The President informed, that during a massive combined strike on November 17, Ukrainian air defense forces destroyed more than 140 enemy air targets - missiles and drones, and thanked to Ukrainian defenders, separately mentioning military aviation pilots who piloted various types of aircraft, including F -16: -We are grateful to all our air defenses, which were involved in repelling this attack: anti-aircraft missile troops, our aviation - pilots F-16, -susok- and MiGs, mobile fire groups, EW - all worked out in an organized manner. Thank you for the reliable protection!- Official statistics of the results of the combat work of the Air Defense Forces in repelling the record-breaking Russian combined air attack reported in Air The forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces - defenders of the Ukrainian sky shot down 102 missiles of various types and 42 unmanned aerial vehicles. If we take the number of aircraft shot down with the help of F-16 aircraft mentioned by the President - about 10 units - as a basis, we find out that the pilots of the Ukrainian -Fighting Falcons- shot down about 7% of all enemy air targets destroyed on November 17. Is it a lot or a little? Depends on what data we can operate on and what factors should be taken into account. Back in the summer of 2023, the then spokesman of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Yuriy Ignat noted that the F-16 as an air defense vehicle has limitations - fighter jets cannot shoot down ballistic missiles: -It can cover the sky from kamikaze drones and cruise missiles, that is, bring the percentage of shooting down closer to 100, now we have 70-80% - this is with strong Russian attacks, with the F-16 this figure can increase to the maximum Plus, it will allow us to use cheaper missiles.- In view of this, from the general list of munitions used by the enemy, those that the F-16 cannot shoot down should be excluded. These are ballistic, aeroballistic and hypersonic missiles. There are at least 10 of them: It should also be taken into account that a significant proportion of the air strikes used by the enemy on November 17 - 85 units - were Kh-101 and Kalibr cruise missiles. Kh-101 missiles can fire dipole reflectors as obstacles against radar-guided missiles. Missiles with infrared (thermal contrast) guidance on such small targets, equipped with a compact turbojet engine, work much worse than on airplanes and helicopters. One should also take into account the share of F-16 used to repel an enemy attack among other means of the Ukrainian air defense forces, which cannot be significant. In view of the above, the estimated 7% of enemy air targets shot down by F-16s during the massive combined strike of the Russians on Ukraine on November 17 is a significant indicator. It testifies to the high efficiency of the -Battle Falcons- as an air defense vehicle.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/20/f-16-yak-zasib-ppo-naskilky-efektyvnymy-buly-bojovi-sokoly-pid-chas-neshhodavnogo-obstrilu-ukrayiny/	2024-11-19T20:43:06-08:00
A gun from Afghanistan, a 30-grade gunner and dreams of victory: how the calculation of the M777 gun...	While they were waiting, a large shaggy sheepdog came out of the darkness very quietly. The dog sat silently next to us, looked up somewhere. Then he left as silently as the shadow of sadness of a small village of Donetsk region, not far from the front. Here, at night, only the constant cannonade of explosions from the front line and the sound of the engines of military vehicles can be heard. We get into a pickup truck, a car with a night vision camera drives us in the dark to the position of the artillery calculation of the 148th separate artillery brigade of the Zhytomyr Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We are met by the commander of the calculation on landing, we quickly move to the shelter, highlighting a red flashlight. A large, tidy dugout welcomes you with warmth and light. Two-story beds with dark army mattresses are lined up along one of the walls of the underground shelter. On one of the beds, everything lights up and shines, it is the equipment of a signalman - 45-year-old Taras with the call sign -Tarik-. He himself is from the Poltava region. In civilian life, he worked as a construction worker, installing gas pipelines and heating. He has been serving in the 148th brigade since April 2023. He speaks simply about his duties: there must be communication and light at the position, maintenance of equipment, batteries, generators, and transmitters. - A lot of work. Why might there be no connection? The reasons are different. Something can fly in, fragments can damage the generator, the walkie-talkie will break, the equipment sometimes fails, my job is to make sure everything works properly, - Tarik explains. He adds that civilian work is almost no different from army work. . -It's the same, only a little scarier,- says the operator with a smile. At home, Taras is waiting for his wife and two schoolboy sons. They often talk on the phone, the family supports. He recently returned from vacation, he says that everything is fine, but not enough, he would like to spend more time with his family. - The only wish is for the war to end as soon as possible and to return home. I have many dreams, but the biggest one is victory. Taras's brother approaches us and sits down next to us. He has a gray beard, a red flashlight sparkles on his head, cheerful eyes, as they say, -with beads-, he smiles and introduces himself. Anton is 44 years old, call sign -Baker-, a senior soldier, has the position of senior howitzer gunner M777A1. He has been in positions and performing combat missions for over a year. I joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in April 2023, from the city of Berdychiv. — In 2022, I was not drafted into the army, because I have four children, and in 2023, when my eldest son turned 18, according to the first the summons went to the military commissariat. I have an older son and a daughter from my first marriage and two more sons. At the time when I was drafted, my wife and I had not yet been registered, - says the artilleryman. He says that he likes to serve in the artillery. Training with work on this Pekar gun took place in Germany. — The training lasted 10 days. Why so fast? Howitzer M777A1 is easy to maintain. After completing the courses, he received a 30-grade gunner's certificate, he says jokingly. He recalls that he really liked Germany for its order and cleanliness, as well as food for the military. And they were also impressed by the roads. -The baker- was abroad for the first time. He is a bricklayer-plaster by profession, but he was a baker for many years, hence the nickname: -Peak bread, buns, cakes in Berdychiv in a restaurant-. Pekar speaks with pride about the Pekar gun, a very powerful and accurate weapon, everything depends on the gunner and the accuracy of the coordinates. — Zaporizhzhia is beautiful worked, a little less in Donetsk region. It happens differently: mostly 40-50 shots, but when it’s 10. Here you can’t guess how the enemy will attack, there’s an assault, if it’s -forbidden- so that they don’t climb, don’t forget who we are, then a few shots are enough, he explains he. It is admitted that the first time was terrible in the war. Now he already easily distinguishes where the projectile flies, how it flies and where. - At first it was scary. Now it's just flying in, it's commonplace. The hardest part of the job is carrying shells, and also moving from place to place, it's several days with almost no sleep, says the gunner. silhouettes The boys are stomping, because the morning autumn coolness gives the first breaths of the coming winter frosts. A quiet conversation, almost in a whisper, over coffee and a cigarette while waiting for the team to fight. The first, first pink, then more and more saturated yellow rays of dawn. Suddenly, the command: -To battle!- The gunners run to the gun, with coordinated movements everyone does their job: remove the masking, get the coordinates of the target, aim, load — -Shot!- , so as not to interfere with the calculation. Within a minute the gun is cloaked again, everyone goes back to the dugout to talk and finally see each other's faces and take some pictures. One of the guys looks like Jesus from the painting, the other looks like an athlete. They are smoking again, smiling, drinking coffee. 42-year-old sergeant Dmytro with the call sign -Lion- from the city of Dnipro commands the cannon. On May 19, 2022, he went to the Military Commissariat with his brother and best man, applied for the elite troops and got into the DSHV. — I thought that victory would come sooner. I had no idea what it would be like. And everything turned out as it should be, I became the gun commander. First, I got the position of a gunner after training, and then I was in the 95th artillery brigade, which was disbanded, and I was transferred to the 148th brigade. He passed sergeant courses, then training in Germany, he says. -Lev- proudly mentions that the Germans and Americans were shocked that in such a short period the Ukrainians learned everything so quickly. - We have a war, there is no time to study for half a year. We are -rexes- of the DSHV, he says. This is already the third gun of the crew. They worked on the first boy for a long time and even gave her the name -Lyalya-. - She worked like a clock mechanism. She never let me down, unfortunately, she stayed in another unit, that's how it happened. This one is a little cranky. I know that this gun fought in Afghanistan. The barrel was changed, and, consider it as new, some mechanisms were updated, then it will work as it should, says -Lev-. They have been fighting with this team for a year, they went through training in Zhytomyr Oblast. - There is also a young addition, Oleg came to us a week ago, the main thing is that he is motivated, he learned everything quickly. Currently, I can choose people for the team, only those who are needed here. Because an unmotivated person does not have time or energy to shout, argue, explain. This is a war, everyone must clearly understand why he is here, - the commander proves his position. He controls the entire process, records the coordinates, gives orders. The gunner Viktor directs the gun to the target according to the coordinates, Oleg and Andrii load the projectile, Oleksandr loads the gunpowder and brings the gun into combat order. Anton gives the gunpowder, and the commander fires. - Our calculation is one iron fist.

The main thing is respect for each other. In general, we are already here as a family, - assures -Lev-. Before the large-scale invasion, Dmytro worked at a power plant. After the end of the war, he wants to return home, to civilian life, he misses his family. — What do I dream about, except victory? My wife really wants to go to Italy.

Propagandists invented a fake about the surrender: what is Trump doing here	This time, they spread, with reference to the Institute, a fake about the fact that the Ukrainian military allegedly began to surrender eight times more often after the victory of Donald Trump in the elections. This -news- was also allegedly commented on by the editor-in-chief of Euronews, Klaus Strunz, who called it an -absolutely natural- development of events, saying that now -it is finally clear to everyone that Ukraine is doomed.- However, this news and everything related to it was invented by propagandists. The Institute for the Study of War did not publish such information either on its website or in social networks. There is also no reaction to this hoax in any of the reputable Western media, including Euronews - obviously because it is a poor fake. In fact, there are no independent and reliable data on how many Ukrainian soldiers surrender as prisoners, because such statistics are available only to the Russian side, and it is difficult to trust them. At the same time, the Human Rights Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, Dmytro Lubinets, said that the government is aware of more than 100 executions of Ukrainian military personnel by the Russians, who have surrendered or are being captured. There may be many more real cases, but such crimes are difficult to verify and legally record.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/20/propagandysty-vygadaly-fejk-pro-zdachu-u-polon-do-chogo-tut-tramp/	2024-11-19T20:04:19-08:00
Syndrome of the Kursk operation: the troops of the Russian Federation are sick with Kursk - the symp...	told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- a> spokesman of OTU -Siversk-, Colonel Vadym Mysnyk. — Hundreds of kilometers [along] the northern state border, the enemy is [mining], increasing his minefields. They also carry out such defensive measures, and this says something - we call it the syndrome of the Kursk operation, he said. In the Kursk region itself, the Russian command is building up its forces and throwing its soldiers into reckless assaults with the aim of knocking out the Defense Forces of Ukraine from the territory of the Russian Federation as soon as possible. — The rest of the [Russians] forces were concentrated in the Kursk region. Here they are both in a hurry and nervous. They throw everything they can into the battle, transfer new units, new forces here to continue the onslaught, he said. The officer said that during the day, the fighters of the Defense Forces repelled more than 20 enemy assaults without losing a single controlled settlement. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that 5 drones destroyed a Russian assault group in Kurshchyna.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/syndrom-kurskoyi-operacziyi-vijska-rf-hvoriyut-kurshhynoyu-u-zsu-diagnostuvaly-symptomy/	2024-11-19T12:08:23-08:00

Russian stormtroopers demined the road to our positions near Kurakhovo. By myself	The video of the battle was released on November 19 on the battalion channel. A Russian armored fighting vehicle, together with the landing party, was quickly driving towards our positions. But she didn't make it, because she exploded on a mine.

Mortals in Chasovoy Yar: Russians run to -meat-reconnaissance under fear of being shot	told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- a> spokeswoman of OTU -Luhansk-, Major Anastasia Bobovnikova. — On the Toretsk direction, the enemy constantly storms the city of Toretsk. In addition, battles are taking place near Nelipivka and near Toretsk is the village of Shcherbynivka. In the Kramatorsk direction in the area of ​​Chasovoy Yar, the enemy is accumulating its forces, and in the Seversky direction literally today, the enemy has already shelled 13 times with anti-aircraft guns, she said. The officer said that despite constant assaults, the occupiers are not succeeding either in Toretsk or in Chasovoy Yar. — The enemy is not advancing. We will stop all his attempts, all assaults, both in Toretsk and in Chasovoy Yar, the military woman assured. The spokeswoman denied information about the advance of the occupiers in Chasovoy Yar. — I know you probably want to ask about the alleged advancement in the Rift of Time. However, I will say that this is not an advance, but rather a situation where the enemy is running across the channel and scouting our positions, she explained. Anastasia Bobovnikova described the tactics of the enemy. — They just run forward and whoever has caught up has caught up, and whoever has not caught up has not caught up. It is more like a -meat- reconnaissance, when the units just throw and try to feel where there are weak points, where there are strong points, where the enemy cannot come, said the military woman. The spokeswoman assured that the enemy's attempts to advance are detected and stopped. — Such attempts, of course, are revealed. The enemy is destroyed, the groups are hit and the enemy does not advance, the officer said. At the same time, the morale and psychological spirit of the occupiers, according to her, is very low - they run forward due to fear of punishment - up to and including physical execution - from their command. - Their moral and psychological spirit is very low. They do not want to run into such -meat- assaults. These are rather suicide bombers who were driven to certain death under the threat of being shot. Because we recorded such statements in our intercepts, when the leaders, commanders of the enemies simply told them that if they go into battle, they will be shot,- said the spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU. Anastasia Bobovnikova said that many such cases are recorded - sometimes whole units of the Russian occupation forces refuse to obey the order. — There are many such people. There are entire units that refused to go on assaults. However, unfortunately, they are forced to do just that. Of course, they are afraid of being shot, and in this way they have a chance to run and get captured and save their lives in captivity, the military woman explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that up to a hundred occupiers are killed in Toretsk every day.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/smertnyky-u-chasovomu-yari-rosiyany-bizhat-u-myasnu-rozvidku-pid-strahom-rozstrilu/	2024-11-19T11:08:55-08:00

Denmark will provide Ukraine with 130 million euros for the development of the defense industry	About this President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky reported on November 19 based on the results of a meeting with the Prime Minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, who came to Ukraine on a visit. The head of state thanked Denmark, the entire Danish people and personally Mette Frederiksen and her team for helping Ukraine. In total, Denmark has already provided more than 20 packages of defense support, and together with Ukraine created a special model for the development of Ukrainian industry. -It makes it possible to unite other countries around investments in the production of weapons in Ukraine. These are artillery, our -Bogdans-, also missiles, long-range drones. We will continue to develop such cooperation,- said the President. One of the main topics of the negotiations is the key areas of relations: bilateral and with partners. Particular attention is paid to joint work at the level of European institutions, because in the second half of next year Denmark will preside over the EU. -Our Ukrainian policy is to be as fast as possible in integrating into Europe. And finally, we all in the Euro-Atlantic community have to admit that we have to be quick. And every day, obviously, decisions are needed for Ukraine. In the entire Alliance, there is a decision on the invitation to Ukraine. The sooner it happens, the sooner Russia will realize, come to an understanding and make a decision that the war against Ukraine does not and will not make sense for them,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Separately, the President emphasized that the world needs to put pressure on the Russian shadow tanker fleet, as well as react to the involvement of North Korean troops in Russia's war against Ukraine. Mette Frederiksen said that Ukraine should win this war, so Denmark provided and will provide assistance and support the defense industry. -We already see what your defense industry is capable of. We understand that these investments lead to real impact on the battlefield,- said the Danish Prime Minister. She also added that the outcome of this war will determine the future not only of Ukraine, but also of Europe. -You belong to our Euro-Atlantic family, you belong to the NATO space, the EU, and we will support you in your next steps during Denmark's EU presidency, where the main priority will be EU enlargement,- concluded Mette Frederiksen.

Having lied, the Russian propagandists buried our rocketmen, and they escaped	Footage of combat work and non-trivial rescue was made public by the State Border Service of Ukraine. A few days ago, Russian propagandists began to brag about the shots of their FPV drone of our RAK-SA-12 installation, which was installed on a Humvee armored vehicle. The invaders boasted that they destroyed not only the car, but also the entire crew. But it turned out that the Russians lied. As usual. Our rocketmen told the story of their amazing rescue, when not only they themselves survived, but also their equipment, which is very annoying to the Russians.

More than 1,500 transfer reports have already been processed — the Ministry of Defense	About this reported on November 19 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. -The number of reports shows that the military was waiting for the opportunity to change the place of service without lengthy approvals, bureaucracy and groundless refusals. Instead, the number of agreed shows that the service works effectively. Digitization continues to transform our army into the army of the future, where any service is received simply, transparently and quickly,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, deputy minister for digitalization. Changing the place of service through Army+ has a fairly simple algorithm. It is necessary to submit a report, attach to it a military card or an officer's certificate, a letter of recommendation from another unit. In some cases, a VLK opinion is required, for example, if a soldier wants to transfer from a combat unit to the rear. Then the report goes to the Personnel Center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. If there are no grounds for refusal, an order is prepared, which is subsequently signed by either the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces or the Chief of the General Staff. -Also, what makes this service unique is that the place of service can be changed without the approval of the commander. It is needed only in certain cases and it will be received by the Personnel Center of the Armed Forces, not the military. We are doing everything to free people's time for efficient service as much as possible,- added Kateryna Chernogorenko. In addition to being simple, the new algorithm for changing the place of service is also transparent. If the serviceman is refused, he will receive the reason why it happened. Currently, the most frequent reasons for refusals are as follows: — the report is submitted by military personnel who do not serve in the Armed Forces; — lack of a conclusion of the VLK for transfer to the rear from the combat unit; — copies of all pages of the military document with records of service are missing. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense in 2024 secured the supply of clothing for female defenders at 158 million hryvnias	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/opraczovano-vzhe-ponad-pivtory-tysyachi-raportiv-na-perevedennya-minoborony/	2024-11-19T08:07:48-08:00

Denmark is a friend we can really count on. Together we protect the lives of Ukrainians. Together we produce weapons for Ukraine. And together we are working on recovery after the destruction caused by this war,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. &nbsp; As reported by ArmyInform, President discussed with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan the strengthening of cooperation between the countries.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/razom-z-daniyeyu-my-vyroblyayemo-zbroyu-dlya-ukrayiny-prezydent/	2024-11-19T07:51:21-08:00
In Sumy Oblast, 4 Russian servicemen received prison terms for theft	This was reported on November 19 by the prosecutor's office of the Sumy region. During the occupation of the village of Vorozhba of the Lebedyn territorial community in March 2022, four Russian servicemen broke into the house of civilians and, threatening them with weapons, forced them to leave their homes. At the same time, the soldiers fired at two cars parked in the yard. Therefore, the owner of the house, together with her son and her 81-year-old mother, were forced to walk and seek shelter from fellow villagers. Later, the Russians set up their headquarters in the house of the victims.

The enemy advanced an assault group on buggies and motorcycles. But the Russians were spotted in time by our reconnaissance drones, and kamikaze drones also flew in their wake. -FPV-drones, precisely according to the coordinates, began the destruction even before the attack aircraft could approach our infantry. In a few minutes, the attacking group was simply dismantled. This is what reconnaissance drones are for: they find the enemy in time, giving the opportunity to organize a precise response. It is not just a technique - it is a synergy of the human mind and technology. And thanks to such coordination, the attack was stopped at an early stage,- the battalion commented on the video. &nbsp; As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the 225th assault battalion filmed the consequences of the defeat of the armored assault group of the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/pokaraly-za-porushennya-osobystoyi-dystancziyi-5-droniv-znyshhyly-rosijsku-shturmovu-grupu-na-kurshhyni/	2024-11-19T06:57:57-08:00

The Ground Forces reported how many military personnel were trained abroad	This was reported by the Commander of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Oleksandr Pavlyuk in an interview Ukrinform. -If we talk about the Ground Forces, almost 30,000 military personnel have been trained on the territory of the partner countries. About 20,000 of them are under the basic military training program,- Oleksandr Pavlyuk said. The commander also emphasized that, in general, the quality of training of the mobilized has already changed, it has increased significantly. From November 1, 2024, the duration of the BZVP course in educational centers and training centers has increased — 45 days instead of 30. -That is, it has increased by one and a half times. In addition, the program became not only longer, but also significantly changed in quality. This is the fourth revision of the course since the beginning of the large-scale invasion. Now there are more practices, more anti-drone training,- Oleksandr Pavlyuk explained. He added that since November 1, recruits have been actively studying countering UAVs, EW, equipment and masking positions. Among the new exercises is shooting down a UAV with a pump-action shotgun. -Recruits practice it on a simulated drone. That is, on a target attached to a real drone. Simulated drops from drones are made on recruits so that they get used to the realities of modern war and, what is very important, understand how to counter it,- said Oleksandr Pavlyuk. According to the updated program, more attention is paid to actions during direct contact with the enemy, approaching trenches and clearing them, throwing hand grenades in various conditions, shooting at short distances. As reported by ArmyInform, from the beginning of 2022, Ukrainian defenders received and mastered otrymanyh-zsu-z-2022-roku/->hundreds of new models of weapons and military techniques.

A thousand days of resistance: the struggle for Gostomel, Zmiiny, Kharkiv... How it was: memories on...	Gostomel airport was considered a strategic object even before the war. Capable of receiving cargo planes, located only 25 kilometers from Kyiv, it became a key point in an attempt to quickly capture the Ukrainian capital. The airport was guarded by a brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, but most of its soldiers and equipment were in the east at the time of the invasion. And it seems that the enemy knew. What he did not count on was that even with small forces the National Guardsmen would take the fight. Trying to delay the landing of the Russian landing force as much as possible and prevent transporters with heavy equipment and main forces from landing at the airport. Armed essentially only with -needles- and small arms, the Ukrainian fighters held out for several hours, shot down several helicopters and disrupted the enemy's first plan. But the ammunition eventually ran out. I had to retreat from the airport. However, the National Guardsmen won the time during which the artillery from Bila Tserkva managed to pull up to the position. Which began to fire at the Russians, trying to disable their equipment, and most importantly, the landing strip. Or at least demonstrate that any attempt to land transporters still expected by the enemy on it will end fatally for the planes - they will come under direct fire. The Russians, who managed to report on the seizure of the airport, tried to expand the control zone, pushing the Ukrainians further, but they did not succeed. The defense forces counterattacked, and most importantly, they did not stop shelling in order to prevent the already damaged lane from being repaired. In the end, the invaders were forced to abandon the amphibious operation and wait for the arrival of their main forces by land. They captured Gostomel in a few days. However, they could not advance further. And on April 1, they left the city and the airport under threat of encirclement. Already on February 24, the Russian troops approached Kharkiv close, and on the 27th, one of their special forces groups with ten -Tigers- and several KAMAZ trucks broke into the city itself. When the breakthrough was stopped, they decided to seize the school closest to them at that moment - 134 school. But turn it into your stronghold, because it was located on higher ground. The Russians were blocked by the forces of the military, security forces and volunteers. But they did not dare to storm the building at first - in the first days, the usual experience was not enough. After some time, the invaders recovered and began to retaliate with sniper fire. It seems that reinforcements were also waiting. Wasting time was simply dangerous. So the brave men who volunteered to attack went to the school under the cover of fire from an armored personnel carrier. Later, the tank also pulled up - but it was able to fire only one shot. The melee was fierce. The Russians fought back desperately. However, the grenades they used to throw at the Ukrainian fighters soon ran out. They refused to surrender. However, in the end, two were captured. And these were the last invaders who set foot on the land of the city with weapons. The Russians were never able to break into Kharkiv again - in almost three years of war. Maybe that's why they continue to take revenge on him - destroying from a distance, Mariupol was threatened by the encirclement already a week after the full-scale invasion. The defenders turned the -Azovstal- plant into their citadel, in the bunkers of which both civilians and wounded soldiers were hiding. The sky above the city was controlled by enemy aircraft, the sea &#8211; fleet. The occupiers attacked the city with the heaviest bombs they had at hand - three-ton fabs. The Russians expected that the forces of the defenders would quickly be exhausted without support from the -big land-. But in the military intelligence of Ukraine, they decided on a desperate operation. Having information about the location of enemy units and their weapons, try to lay out a route for the helicopters. The risk was deadly - that's why only volunteer pilots were involved in the operation. Almost all weapons were removed from the sides. The cargo was more important - provisions, medicines, ammunition and means of communication for the defenders of Azovstal. They flew at maximum speed, but at a minimum height. They entered from the side of the sea, because of the smoke over the constantly shelled city, they simply could not break through. Defenders say that at first they did not even believe that it was theirs. Five minutes to unload, and how much will it cost to load the wounded. The engines were not silenced to take off at any moment. At first, the Russians did not even understand what had happened. But then the hunt for Ukrainian helicopters began. However, all 16 ships will deliver their cargo to Mariupol. Three helicopters were shot down on the way back, one was hit by a missile, but he made it with all the wounded on board. Thanks to the defenders of -Azovstal- and the helicopter crews that helped them, Ukraine won a month to equip the defense system. Mariupol shackled the enemy's forces and did not allow him to move immediately to the east - to Zaporozhye and the Dnipro. Okhtyrka is a border town. The enemy was near him already five hours after the start of the invasion. The sappers took the first blow. They had almost no anti-tank weapons, but they still organized a circular defense, set up positions on the roofs, ambushes, mine barriers&#8230; The advanced enemy group managed to break through to the city, but the Ukrainian fighters destroyed one of the tanks and a car with ammunition, which began to explode. The attackers were forced to retreat, abandoning their equipment. During this time, fighters from the Kholodny Yar brigade came to the aid of the defenders. It was they who repelled the second, tank attack. The battle lasted half a day - and the Russians withdrew again. with heavy losses. Convinced that they would not be able to take Okhtyrk from the move, the occupiers began mass bombardment of the city with -hurricanes-. The kindergarten, where civilians tried to hide, was not the first to suffer. The next day, thermobaric weapons were used for the first time. A direct hit to the location of the unit cost the Ukrainian military 70 lives. And then the systematic destruction of the city's infrastructure began. After the oil depot, they took on the CHP plant. When the -hurricanes- and rockets failed to cope with the task, bombs were dropped. 20 thousand citizens were left without heat. The next day, the water supply and sewage system were disabled. They deliberately tried to punish Okhtyr residents for their persistence - and the mayor is still confident. A doctor by profession, on the most critical days he himself performed operations - under enemy fire. The defenders, of course, answered the enemy with everything they could. The Russians soon realized that their planes could also be targeted and were already wary of bombing from low altitudes and during the day. Assault attempts did not stop. On March 16, the enemy even managed to enter the outskirts of the city, but at the cost of heavy losses. He was never able to break through the Ukrainian defense. And within a week he was forced to start withdrawing troops from Sumy Oblast. The strategic importance of the Snake Island is difficult to overestimate. The only island in the entire Black Sea at a great distance from the coast, it allows you to control the approaches to Odessa and the mouth of the Danube - and in fact all shipping between mainland Ukraine and neighboring countries - including Turkey. It is not surprising that the Russians were in a hurry to capture Zmeinyi as soon as possible. Already on the morning of February 24, 2022, it was blocked both from the sea and from the air. Communication with the border guards was lost. The enemy tried to intimidate the Ukrainian defenders, but they responded with an expression that became one of the symbols of this war. Annoyed by the response, the Russians subjected Zmiiny to a frenzied shelling, destroying all the buildings on the island. But the border guards continued to defend themselves, repelled two attacks, and only because of a lack of ammunition, the invaders managed to capture them. The defenders were freed on March 24 - during the first exchange of prisoners. The enemy tried to turn the island into his stronghold. But the Armed Forces did not allow it to be done. On April 14, two Neptune missiles hit the Moscow cruiser &#8211; the same one that was -sent- by the border guards and shelled the island. In two weeks, the Russian control post on Zmiiny itself was destroyed. Then they -thinned out- the personnel of the occupiers and sank the boats with which the enemy tried to maintain communication with the island. The tugboat carrying the TOR anti-aircraft complex also went to the bottom. The blows to the enemy became stronger and more regular. And the Russians understood that they were doomed. On June 30, they evacuated their soldiers from Zmiyny with two speedboats. And the remains of the equipment that they left on the island were destroyed by Ukrainian drones and ... Russian aircraft. On July 4, 2022, Zmiiny returned to the control of Ukraine. And the yellow-blue flag flew over him again. Before the large-scale invasion, it seemed that Bashtanka was located deep in the Ukrainian rear. And if the war comes to her, then not quickly. However, the locals did not sit idly by. Territorial defense and formation of volunteers were created. They even prepared -molotov cocktails- - it turned out that it was on time. Because already on March 1, the Russians were in nearby Yavkin. It was near him that peaceful residents came to the road. It seems that the invaders simply did not expect this. But they stopped in embarrassment. Not for long, of course. They listened to the people in silence for fifteen minutes - and after firing a machine gun over their heads, they moved on, past them. But even a short stop helped the defenders better prepare for the -meeting-. As soon as the first invaders entered the city, bottles with -cocktails- flew at them. The machines caught fire, the ammunition began to detonate almost immediately. The Russians were shocked, but continued to move. However, the deeper they broke through, the fiercer resistance they met. The forces of the defenders were not so large, but small groups were scattered throughout the city. Thus it was possible to create the appearance of a large garrison. When the Russians drove up and stopped, their column was cut up and began to be destroyed piece by piece. The end of the rout was put by a plane that appeared unexpectedly for the enemy and struck two devastating blows. The invaders finally realized that they had fallen into a trap and ran away to save their lives. Twenty-one Russians were captured. They -captured- more than four dozen units of enemy equipment, but most of it was burned during the battle. The second column of Russians was ambushed. And decided not to tempt fate and retreated. In the future, the Russians did not dare to attack Bashtanka -head on-. They dug in on distant slopes. And they tried to destroy the city with shelling. Or maybe they were just taking revenge for the defeat. Until the Ukrainian army went on the offensive and repelled the enemy as far as the Dnipro. And Bashtanka was not in the rear again. Control over the Black Sea is one of the strategic tasks of the Kremlin in this war. And at the beginning of the invasion, she was close to fulfilling this task. The initial balance of naval forces was also in favor of the Russians - the aggressor had more of them by an order of magnitude, and the quick destruction of the ships of the Ukrainian Navy. Even the disabling of the flagship of the fleet - the cruiser -Moscow- - did not seem like a critical loss. But everything changed already in the summer of 2022. It was then that Ukraine made a bet on the use of surface drones. And conducted their first tests - then it was about devices on hydrocycle platforms with high-explosive bombs. In September, they already tried to use them in a real battle. The operation failed due to communication problems. But the very fact of the attack forced the Russians to reduce the number of ships on the external raid and retreat to the port of Sevastopol. However, this was only the beginning. At the end of October, drones reached the Sevastopol Bay itself, damaging two ships and an oil filling station. The following spring, the attacks became regular, and in the summer, drones attacked the Kremlin dictator's favorite brainchild, the Kerch bridge. Within a month, Ukrainian drones caused noise on the approaches to Novorossiysk. The targets were ships capable of transporting military cargo to the occupied peninsula. In August 2023, a separate naval drone brigade was formed as part of the Ukrainian Navy - the first unit of this type in the world. A real hunt for Russian ships began - in most cases quite successful. Among the trophies were boats, and tugboats, and large landing ships. And the Russians... began to simply hide their fleet. The presence of ships in the open sea has decreased tenfold. Most of them were taken from the Crimea to the Caucasian coast. Moscow can still use its fleet to launch -calibres- over Ukraine, but the entire western part of the Black Sea is currently free. And this is a truly unique achievement – ​​no country in the world has yet managed to defeat the enemy fleet with the help of unmanned remotely controlled vessels. The Russian occupation of part of the Kharkiv region in 2022 ended with the Ukrainian offensive. The occupiers fled from the territories they occupied. One of the last they left was the city of Vovchansk, which is located very close to the Russian border. In May 2024, the enemy returned. Vovchansk again became one of the directions of his attack. The direction to Lipka became different. The calculation was obvious – while the Ukrainian defenders, dripping with blood, hold back the onslaught of the main Russian forces in Donbas, hit their flank and try to break through to Kharkiv again. Or at least get closer to the city at a distance that would allow it to be shelled at close range with artillery. The situation was really difficult. Ukrainian units were still waiting for reinforcements from the new mobilization, defensive structures in the border strip were not built. However, within a few days, having encountered resistance, the enemy's offensive stalled, and by the end of the month it was stopped. In Vovchansk, the Russians were never able to cross the Vovcha River. There was no question of an attack on Kharkiv - and the Kremlin leader even stated that this was not in the plans. However, the tactics of the Russians remained unchanged, not being able to completely capture the city, they destroyed Vovchansk with shelling. The bombing of Kharkiv also intensified. Ukraine's partners could not help but react to the aggressor's next war crimes - they lifted the restrictions on the use of their weapons against military targets in the border regions of Russia - from where, in fact, Ukrainian cities are shelled. Attempts of enemy breakthroughs in the north of Kharkiv region continue to this day. However, Ukrainian fighters managed to recapture some settlements from the invaders, and Russian soldiers blocked at the aggregate plant were eventually taken prisoner. Since the first days of the full-scale invasion, Russia has constantly bombarded Ukraine with missiles and attacked with drones - there is not a single area to which it does not -fly- from time to time. Instead, the possibilities of retaliatory strikes were limited - if only because the Defense Forces were inferior to the enemy from the beginning in terms of the number of long-range weapons and the -range-. Partners could help, but it took a long time to coordinate and deliver already agreed packages. In addition, in many cases, weapons were transferred with the condition not to strike deep into Russian territory. Without denying Ukraine's right to active defense, the allies made it clear more than once that there would be no restrictions on the use of their own, Ukrainian means of destruction, and domestic manufacturers accepted the challenge. The bet was made primarily on drones - they are cheaper, but often even more effective than missiles. The first strikes on objects deep in Russia were already carried out in 2022. The target was primarily the airfields on which the planes that launched the missiles over Ukraine were based. In the following year, the appearance of drones in one or another Russian city ceased to be perceived as a surprise or coincidence. In May, a drone exploded just above the Kremlin, causing a real commotion in the Russian capital. Since the beginning of 2024, strikes on Russian territory have become systematic. Russian oil refineries and related infrastructure were the first to feel it. Since March, they have been joined by enterprises of the Russian military industry - manufacturers of jet engines for aircraft, assemblers of drones, etc. The range of attacks also increased constantly - Ukrainian drones flew to the Volga region, the Urals and the Russian North. However, the most daring were the attacks on enemy arsenals, the loudest of which was the destruction of warehouses in Toropka, near Tver. And in the summer of 2024, for the first time, the number of Ukrainian drones launched on Russian territory exceeded the number of Russian drones that struck Ukraine. And this is certainly a success. What to be proud of. The operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region is called the most unexpected and perhaps the loudest event of the war in 2024. Until now, the defense forces conducted combat operations only on their territory. Raids on Russian territory were carried out only by fighters of foreign volunteer formations that support the struggle of Ukraine, and they usually lasted only a few days. Now the war has come to the land of the enemy for a long time. The success of the operation was ensured, in particular, by careful preparation and the fact that it was managed to be kept a secret until the last. The large-scale movement of troops was disguised as military exercises - the enemy was sure that the Armed Forces of Ukraine were preparing to repel their own offensive in Sumy Oblast. Only a narrow circle of those involved knew that it was an offensive on Russian territory: the officers were informed three days before the start of the operation, and the private soldiers - a day before the offensive. The offensive began on August 6, 2024 - and Ukrainian troops managed not only to crush the Russian forces near the border, but also to go deep into Russian territory. Initially, the enemy did not even understand what was happening, and I try to diminish the successes of the Armed Forces, even more disoriented with its soldiers. Many of which quickly realized that they had thrown and hurried to surrender. Without deciding to talk about the war in its territory, Moscow continued to pretend to be a small raid. Instead, Ukrainian fighters managed to take control of thousands of square kilometers in hostile territory in a week and to become entrenched in Sudzh and surrounding settlements. In fact, a buffer zone was created, which should not allow the enemy to fire the Ukrainian territory close. Equally important are the tasks of the operation - to cause maximum damage to the enemy, the intersection of his forces and the destruction of logistics. The transfer of hostilities to the Russian territory had a significant psychological effect. First of all, because she demonstrated the possibilities of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The partners, for whom the offensive also became unexpected, supported the right of Ukraine to active self -defense. It took the enemy to take a long time to get together with the forces, then to start attempting to counter -offensive in Kurkh. But most of these attempts were not successful. The situation on the collision line remains difficult, but the armed forces continue to fulfill their tasks.

In addition, according to the President, it is necessary to be ahead of Russia in technologies. -For this reason, the format of the Technological Stavka is being implemented in Ukraine. In this format, on a regular basis, we will collect the best specialists and the most useful technological ideas. The first meeting of our Stavka will take place at the beginning of December,- said the President. According to the head of state, it is the strong defense and industrial complex of Ukraine that is able to ensure our state's independence in choosing a military strategy. Even without nuclear weapons, Ukraine can find conventional means of deterring the Russian Federation. As ArmyInform reported, Volodymyr Zelenskyi said on the need to appoint a military ombudsman.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/neptuny-drony-ta-innovacziyi-glava-derzhavy-vyznachyv-te-shho-garantuye-krayini-stijkist/	2024-11-19T03:48:13-08:00
Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated the need to appoint a military ombudsman	The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, said this while presenting the Internal Stability Plan of Ukraine in the Verkhovna Rada. -A person who will enjoy, first of all, the trust of the military and the entire society. I expect this in the near future,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He emphasized that within the Defense Forces there should be confidential opportunities for soldiers to resolve issues arising from violations of their rights. -Changing approaches to people management in the Armed Forces, in the National Guard of Ukraine, as well as spreading the best management practices in units. Each commander now answers the same question - -What is needed first of all?-. It's the personnel, it's people, the composition of teams, effective real training,- said the President. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also emphasized that it is necessary to talk about difficult things in our army, because effective solutions are possible only if there is an honest conversation about mobilization, reservation, and the system of military personnel. -Problems should be solved, not silenced. The reasons are to be found out and removed,- he said.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/volodymyr-zelenskyj-zayavyv-pro-neobhidnist-pryznachyty-vijskovogo-ombudsmena/	2024-11-19T03:26:16-08:00
They are dumping in Lviv, and they are brazen in the Kyiv region - the General Prosecutor's Office r...	This was announced on November 19 by the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine. Criminal schemes related to the illegal acquisition of disabilities allowed conscripts to avoid mobilization and illegally travel abroad. In Lviv, four doctors of one of the inter-district medical and social expert commissions were informed of the suspicion. They falsified medical documentation, on the basis of which men of military age were unjustly given disability. In this way, at least five people left the country. The cost of -services- was from $1,300. In the Kyiv region, two doctors of a district hospital were exposed, who for $12,000 offered a man to organize influence on MSEK members to obtain a disability group. The doctors started a fictitious treatment of the patient, but were exposed while receiving a part of the bribe in the amount of 3 thousand euros. A criminal group of seven people was exposed in Odesa, which included the head of the trauma department, a neuropathologist, an official of the regional center of MSEK and four civilians. Doctors produced fake medical documents that allowed them to evade military service, and an employee of MSEK ensured positive decisions of the commission. The remuneration for such -services- ranged from $4,500 to $6,000. During the searches, a significant amount of material evidence, including forged documents, accounting journals and other materials confirming illegal activity, and cash was seized from the suspects. All participants of the schemes were notified of the suspicion. Depending on the crimes committed, they are charged with abusing influence, obstructing the legal activities of the Armed Forces, assisting in the illegal transportation of persons across the border, and issuing a knowingly false official document (Article 2, Part 2, Article 369-2, Part 1, Article 114- 1, part 3 of article 332, part 1 of article 366 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). The question of choosing preventive measures for them is being resolved. Investigative actions are ongoing, the circle of involved persons is being established. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/u-lvovi-dempinguyut-a-na-kyyivshhyni-nahabniyut-u-genprokuratury-povidomyly-rozczinky-na-medychni-shemy-uhylyannya/	2024-11-19T03:19:37-08:00

Then I had to run to Romania and build a new life there, I had to move my relatives there. I have a father, he is already retired. I was in Bakhmut, during the period when it was completely bombed,- said Alina, a resident of Donetsk. Adapting to new realities was probably the most difficult, shared Alina from Odessa. It remains the most difficult even now. -Of course, I would like the situation in the country to stabilize and the war to end as soon as possible. As it was before the beginning, it was not at all full-scale, as it was before the beginning of the war in 2014,- said Alina. Meanwhile, Odessans are in pain and it is difficult. -It is very painful that they are dying, they are bombing us to this day. We very much believe that it will all stop soon,- Anastasia noted in her turn. True, not everyone is optimistic. As for the end of the war, Kateryna from Odesa says that -not surrender- would be a good option for war. -To be honest, I don't think it will be more than 5 years from now. I think it will take a lot of time,- Kateryna said. In general, the people of Odessa state, the final can only be one - we will win. One way or another. After all, there is simply no other way out. How reported ArmyInform, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy shared a video dedicated to 1000 days of heroic struggle of Ukrainians against aggression and for the freedom of his state.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/my-peremozhemo-inshogo-vyhodu-prosto-nemaye-vijskovi-zhurnalisty-zapytaly-odesytiv-pro-1000-dniv-vijny/	2024-11-19T03:06:07-08:00
The President instructed to present a new system of contracts for service in the Armed Forces	The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said this while presenting the Internal Stability Plan of Ukraine in the Verkhovna Rada. According to him, these contracts will have a tangible, very specific motivational component. -And there is no need for any speculation: our state is not preparing to lower the mobilization age. On the basis of new contractual approaches, we should gradually move to the formation of the army to a greater extent thanks to contracts, and not only mobilization,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. As reported by ArmyInform, currently 44 recruiting centers operate in the regions and 3 operating centers in the vertical of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. Tens of thousands of people have already applied to recruiting centers. The number of volunteers in the total number of those who join the army every month is 20-30 percent. The new procedure for recruiting started working on October 1 citizens of Ukraine in electronic form. According to the new rules, the military unit selected by the candidate must clarify his intentions regarding the conclusion of the contract.

Natural selection in the Luhansk region: only the heat-resistant will survive	the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor, told about it. At the same time, those who do not issue a Russian passport by the beginning of 2025 will be significantly limited in their access to social, medical and administrative services. This is another stage of forced passporting of the local population. The occupiers also acknowledged the disruption of the heating season in Siverskodonetsk, Lysychansk, Hirsky and Zoloty. In these cities, people remain without heat and centralized water supply. The lack of repair of damaged infrastructure systems since the time of active hostilities leads to an aggravation of the humanitarian crisis. Local residents found themselves on the edge of survival, relying only on their own strength. Broken water and heat supply systems make winter especially difficult for people.

He invented some breakthroughs for himself: what the Russian commanders are lying about	This is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The commander of the 67th Motorized Rifle Division of the Russian Federation recently provided Major General Yusupov, the commander of the 25th Army of the Moscow Military District, with false information about the events on the battle line in the Lyman area, Donetsk region. In particular, in his report, the Russian commander announced the alleged fighting in the vicinity of Yampolivka and the breakthrough of occupiers to Torsky. However, this information is not true. Probably, in this way, the commander tried to hide significant losses from the strikes of the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine. Distorted or false reports on the state of affairs at the front are common practice at all levels of command of the Russian occupation forces. This once again emphasizes systemic incompetence and disorganization in the ranks of the Russian army.

The anti-drone regiment has arrived: how the American system neutralizes UAVs	In the official release from this manufacturing company from Virginia (USA) emphasizes that this system is the latest development, combining both kinetic and non-kinetic threat neutralization methods, providing a powerful and mobile solution for airspace protection, ArmiyaInform notes. The AirShield architecture is based on a multi-layered structure capable of operating in both stationary and mobile positions, covering all critical stages of protection: detection, tracking, classification, identification, prioritization and neutralization of threats. This complex chain of destruction allows the latest equipment to seamlessly integrate into existing air defense systems. -The threat posed by drones is rapidly evolving,- said Derrick Birdsell, AirShield Program Manager at Leidos. AirShield is designed to adapt to current systems and keep up with technological advances, allowing the addition of effectors for different types of weapons.- Once identified, the system prioritizes the threat and activates the appropriate effectors, which may include kinetic weapons such as missiles or non-kinetic effectors such as lasers or electronic jamming systems. This rapid and adaptive response not only neutralizes UAVs, but also includes cyber security strategies to counter any attempt to disrupt AirShield systems, providing comprehensive protection against emerging threats. Among the key elements of the system is the CUGAR (Co-axial Unmanned Guided Autonomous Rotorcraft) effector. This unmanned vehicle already demonstrates significant capabilities in the field of combating threats, but the company plans to expand its potential by integrating the APKWS (Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System) missile system. This will increase the accuracy and effectiveness of hitting targets. AirShield is easily compatible with a number of other technologies: high-energy lasers, turret guns, and powerful microwave systems. Such flexibility makes the system a versatile solution for combating a wide range of air threats. Leidos is actively exploring the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to further improve the AirShield system. These technologies can improve the system's ability to adapt and make independent decisions under complex combat conditions. An important aspect of AirShield's development is ensuring its resistance to cyber attacks, for which both offensive and defensive strategies are being developed. This project continues Leidos' work on C-UAS systems initiated by the US Defense Advanced Projects Agency's Mobile Force Protection (MFP) program (DARPA). After a successful demonstration, the program was transferred to the Air and Missile Development Center of the US Army Combat Capabilities Command (DEVCOM). Leidos plans to begin production of the AirShield in 2025, with initial deployment expected to the US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), which will be a significant advance for this innovative technology. As note analysts of the defense portal Army Recognition, the development of the AirShield system by Leidos is crucial due to the rapid growth of threats posed by unmanned aerial vehicles aerial systems (UAVs). As the use of drones for military operations and hostilities increases, the need for an effective and adaptive defense response becomes critical. AirShield is not only designed to protect military and civilian facilities from potential drone incursions, but also to provide an integrated solution that can adapt to new technologies and combat tactics. This positions Leidos as a leader in a growing market where air safety is a top priority. In addition, as geopolitical conflicts escalate and asymmetric threats grow, countries are looking for ways to protect their critical infrastructure and armed forces. As a versatile air defense system, AirShield offers real-time threat detection, tracking and neutralization capabilities that are vital to maintaining operational superiority. By integrating advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and various effectors, Leidos positions its system as an important response to the complex security environment, thereby helping to protect the strategic interests of its customers. At the international level, US allies that have problems with enemy UAVs, especially those participating in coalition operations, have expressed interest in acquiring such advanced C-UAS systems to strengthen their air defense capabilities. However, specific details about other foreign military forces interested in the AirShield system may not be publicly available at this time. AirShield is an advanced anti-drone system.

Winter is near. We check dugouts, prepare firewood and pet cats together with soldiers of the 44th O...	ArmyInform visited the soldiers of 44 separate mechanized brigades, who are fighting in one of the hot areas, to ask how they prepare for winter and adjust their life in conditions of constant danger of airstrikes. Do the dugouts leak, how much do mice interfere, how to wash in the field and how much firewood should be prepared for the winter - you will find out in the ArmyInform photo report below. We start our conversation in the field kitchen - this is where they gather to talk about life, to pet cats and dogs that nail themselves to positions, and to prepare food and even wash their hair. Recently, the soldiers insulated it for the winter - oilcloth around the perimeter was enough, because the -burzuyka- heats here almost 24 hours a day. There is an entrance to the dugout from the kitchen, which additionally makes it warmer and more protected. - The dugout was made by those who live here. There are five of us. Well, did Oleg -move- because he stayed in the forest alone in his dugout. He moved to live with us, the boys say. When asked if water does not flow from the kitchen down to the dugout during rains or when the snow melts, they explain that once it could collect at the entrance, but everything was still dry and warm below. At the beginning of the day, a bucket with water is left on the stove, it can stand like this all day long - so that, on occasion, someone who needs it can wash his head or take water for a trip to the bath. We go down from the kitchen to the dugout. From the conversation, it is felt that the guys made a good effort when they built their -housing-: the height here is about 2.3 meters, then there is a 50 cm -roll- and the ground. They show -heating- - the volume that can be placed under one -bunch- is enough for the winter. They say that there are stocks and they have time to chop more firewood. The immediate answer to the question of who is cutting down is everyone who lives. They do it when they are in the mood: -You know, sometimes you want to physically do something. So you take an ax and go chop wood.- They emphasize that they do not do any exceptional things about the dugout on the eve of winter, because it is already warm. Unless you often have to open the door to ventilate, but in general you can breathe normally. — The main thing is to periodically clean the pipe of the -burzuika- from soot. We clean once a week, because we smoke intensively in winter, - they explain. — We sleep in thermal baths, in the winter the -burzhujika- may take a little more firewood. But we did everything in such a way that on the eve of winter there is no need to prepare anything in particular, - says the soldier Valeriy. To avoid leaks, oilcloth is used everywhere. In general, this is a very useful thing in everyday life - it is also used to insulate the toilet and bath. All the remaining gaps are blown with mounting foam, which also helps retain heat. We ask the -Artist- about some features of everyday life that are not found in other of their peers. He immediately shows us a kitchen cabinet, which was made from a box from BC, as well as a -mashed- for potatoes with a grenade tip. Next, -Bob- picks us up - takes us outside and shows us an improvised refrigerator. At first glance, it's just a BC box stuck in the ground, but it's not. The technology, until the frosts hit, is as follows: the box is buried in the ground and the inside is decorated with a foil lining, which should keep the temperature. But in order to ensure the minimum temperature inside, bottles of frozen water are needed - the guys -order- them in advance at the store, and take them when they manage to go to the city. This is not all of the -chips- in these positions. Oleg and I leave the kitchen to see what the boys themselves say - -take a picture, because they won't believe it.- Indeed, it is hard to believe, but at the end of October, tomatoes grow here. The fighters do not know who planted them here and how, but nevertheless they tied up these tomatoes and visit from time to time to check if they have not withered. When asked whether it is realistic to harvest from this bush, he shakes his head in denial, but adds with a smile that the point is not to eat that tomato, but to take care of it as long as it is physically possible. The problem with electricity is solved by the battery, which was hidden under the -hole- in the dugout. A simple one, from a car, is enough for about a week. Guys have two of these: while one is working, the other is charging. Gadgets are -powered- by power banks. Also, the fighters emphasize that when it gets dark, they try not to use any light, they put the -airplane- mode on their phones. Starlinks are also not used, so as not to -burn- positions. At that moment, a dog runs past us, and the guys from the kitchen are yelling to keep an eye on things. Indeed, the dog wanted to chew on the pixel shoulder bag, which later would not be so easy to find in the yellow-green sheet. - They are always dragging around here - yesterday they grabbed a knife and hid it somewhere in the thicket. The other day, a stapler was taken and stolen. So why? Puppies love to cause harm, but once I hung up underwear and T-shirts, they gnawed some, and -dragged- the rest somewhere, - says Oleg. On the way to the next dugout, the fighter tells us about a woodpecker, who was not prevented by oilcloth from finding the desired log: he was so busy that he tore the -roof- at the entrance to the dugout for the boys. He also points to the forest road and says: -This is Festival Street, and over there on the side is Tykha Street.- This is how fighters jokingly call the combination between positions. The guys say that camouflage and distraction are very important in these places. By the way, the -swamp- camouflage net will soon be replaced by a -gray- one. Two brothers live in the second dugout. It is made somewhat differently: the entrance here is directly from the street, the dugout itself is three meters high, and the perimeter is covered with foil insulation. Heating is still the same -burzuyka-. There is an improvised -summer house- nearby. In this part of the forest, it replaces the field kitchen, because here people are going to make coffee, smoke and chat. It's getting dark. We have to gather, so to say goodbye to the boys, we return to the field kitchen. -The forester- says that we must see the bathhouse, which the fighters built in literally three days. - We don't have the conditions to wash properly. -They made a summer shower first, and now it's cold, then they wrapped that shower nicely with cellophane, and put a stove in the middle,- he says with delight. The soldier then explains to us the rules of use: 15 minutes before taking a shower, you must come and throw a few logs into the stove. While they are burning, you go to get water (the one that is heated in a bucket in the kitchen). — That is, the system is like this — you stand in this single bath, warm water pours from above little by little, you wash, drops of water fall from you onto a heated -bottle-, which creates the effect of a sauna in a cellophane-insulated cabin, -explains -The Forester.- -Perhaps what fairy tale will you tell as parting?- - we ask the soldiers. In response, there is a conversation about black army humor and the fact that lately the enemy is making a breakthrough on this part of the front, which is why the number of shelling has increased sharply. - Here the sky is very dangerous - everything is flying, and KABs, and -Lancets-, and artillery. It happened that for three or four days in a row, every hour, some kind of flight arrived somewhere nearby. And if it's quiet, it means that they're waiting for a -lift- and it's about to start again, says -Bob-. The boys add that there used to be a -Saharok- in the dugout, but over time it squealed more and more often. So, when enemy UAVs began to fly very often, it was simply turned off, because it interfered with sleep. They still remember a funny story in farewell. About mice. They say that there were a lot of them here in the beginning. Ants, mosquitoes, flies and ground fleas also bothered. So, over time, the local kittens began to be nailed to the positions, and, as it turned out, this was the best way to get rid of the mice. - It happened that the cat caught a mouse and brought it to bed. Like, look what I caught you, - says one of the fighters and immediately adds: - Anyway, it's better than when I was wearing a -burka-: I put my foot in, I feel something there, I look, I crushed three mice. After that, he constantly checks the shoes before putting them on. And in general, the boys say, there are many different animals here - for example, herds of wild goats run around at night. After that, we say our goodbyes and leave the position in near darkness, hoping that there will never be any more wild animals from the northeast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/zyma-blyzko-pereviryayemo-blindazhi-gotuyemo-drova-ta-gladymo-kotiv-razom-z-bijczyamy-44-ombr-fotoreportazh/	2024-11-18T21:07:24-08:00
-The highest degree of danger when I say -Svetka, pray--: the story of a professor who changed her j...	Oksana Chorna told the correspondent of ArmiyaInform about what she had to experience during these years. Oksana herself recalls these days with a smile: - I tried to return to civilian life in 2017. I was demobilized, started working at the Academy of Sciences, but I was never able to transition from military to civilian life. It is really difficult: here you save people, take out the wounded, and there is paperwork&#8230; I decided that I had to change something. Oksana started volunteering - she went to visit her boyfriends who were stationed near Volnovakha. Since she had a category C license, she drove trucks and took out the wounded. It so happened that she was invited to a university in Oman. Since the summer of 2017, she worked there as a professor of economics at the Modern College of Business and Science in Muscat. And in March 2022, she returned to Ukraine after the start of a large-scale invasion, abandoning everything. — My husband went to serve in his unit, and I am a combat medic in the 57th brigade. At that time, fighting continued near the settlements of Toshkivka, Novotoshkivka, and Lysychansk. I took out the wounded. In my opinion, these were the most terrible battles during the entire time of the large-scale invasion. Then there was the defense of Kherson, Bakhmut, and later Avdiivka. It was very difficult. There were very few of our artillery there, while everything was firing at them - tanks, -barrel-, jet systems. True, there were no KABs yet, but -nurses- (unguided air missile (NAR) - the outdated designation of air missiles as NURS from the Russian -unguided rocket-. - Author) were constantly arriving. And this thing is unpleasant: thin, long, like a needle, flies and sticks at 80 degrees. Oksana then drove a white Mercedes Sprinter. It was an ordinary -fast- brought from Poland, painted in white-red-blue color: - At first I thought of repainting, but I realized that there is no point, because everything is just scattered there. We had a corner where we parked our cars. I remember that when I served in 2014-2016, I had a nice gurney. We put the wounded on it, and everything was fine. But during the battles near Lysychansk, Oksana had to throw away that gurney, because there were always so many wounded that they were stuffed into the car. She found sofa cushions in destroyed houses, threw them in the -ambulance- so that the boys could comfortably sit and lie on them. There was no connection anywhere - only in Lysychansk hospital: Starlink was there. — I came to the hospital, handed over the wounded. They tell me: -don't come back, there is heavy shelling.- But I'm leaving. The thought flashed through my mind that the road was under fire. I hesitated for a while. She left I'm coming Terrible shelling, it is clear that everything there is exploding, burning, as usual - the Russians then threw magnesium bombs at us, which did not extinguish in any way. You can only throw them off the car if you have time, of course. You take the wounded, go back, all the couch cushions are soaked in blood. You throw it away, you take others. It's all difficult&#8230; Oksana constantly mentions the courage of our defenders. She remembered one girl the most: - We took her out with a concussion, gave her to the doctors. And in two days, when I came to pick up the wounded, I saw her again. She simply returned to her own. However, this time she was seriously wounded by shrapnel. We took her out then. I don't know what happened to her next. But I still remember her — One of our positions was shot by a Russian tank. We thought they were all dead. No one made contact from there, the position was lost. Ours retreated. However, within a day, a guy from this position came directly to our medical center from there. He was all dressed in white, so white: face, uniform. He came out with a weapon. He said that he dug himself out because it was buried. In order to survive, he drank water from the battery in the building where they were hiding. He passed without a fight to our positions, reached the first aid station. The doctor examined him, he had an injury only from chest compression. He had no serious injuries, fractures or such open wounds. He slept for two days because he was under a lot of stress. Later, he returned to his position with his boys. He didn't even want to be evacuated&#8230; Oksana also remembered abandoned pets - dogs, cats&#8230; People were moving out and simply leaving their dogs or cats behind. She recalls that there were a lot of injured animals and how doctor Svitlana tried to treat one of them. — But during the Kherson operation, in the fall of 2022, there were already FABs (high-explosive aerial bombs. — Author). They were dropped with parachutes&#8230; And when we searched the fields there and took away our dead, I flew a drone, because there were mines everywhere. So, we flew a -mavik- over the fields to look for our dead, and at first I thought that these were bodies, as white as a body in appearance, but parachutes. There, all the fields were strewn with parachutes from FABs, she recalls. Oksana talks about her trips on the front roads as if it were about ordinary work: - I remember the roads very well. And also, when I drove the -fast-, I started convoys of armored vehicles, that is, I was followed by BMP. We stayed in Avdiivka for almost a year, then I knew every path where you can drive, I knew all the detours. If there was a battle or shelling going on, or just something burning there, I always had a -plan B-. To my question, what Oksana felt during these trips, she answers frankly without hesitation: - It was very scary. The greatest fear was when you arrived at a position and the Russians were already there. We had another girl there, a doctor at the medical center, Svitlana Balenko. And she and I went to the positions in Bakhmut together. We were so scared that we held hands, I was driving, she was next to me. I tell her: -Sveta, the cap is on- - this is the first degree of fear. Then, when it has already arrived, the second stage begins - -the cap is fastened-. And then, when you drive and everything is on fire, burning, you drive there, we had the highest degree of danger when I say -Svetka, pray.- And she began to read some prayer aloud. I say: -give me another one, you've already read this one.- And she knew a lot of prayers, and judging by the fact that we are sitting and talking, it probably helped. In 2024, the situation has changed a lot. Now, taking out the wounded is a very difficult and one hundred percent man's job, because you have to pull them out, carry them to the car. And just sitting in the medical center and not making trips, in Oksana's opinion, made no sense. - I can be useful in other areas of military life. Then she moved to the position of public relations officer. I am talking about my brothers. And recently I made a calendar. The guy whose photo illustrates -January- died. His brothers still have it hanging on the wall. They don't turn it over&#8230; P.S. Currently, Lieutenant Oksana Chorna has received a new assignment in another brigade. Her war continues&#8230; Photo by Olena Khudyakova and from the archive of Oksana Chornaya	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/najvyshhyj-stupin-nebezpeky-koly-kazhu-svyetka-molys-istoriya-profesorky-yaka-prominyala-robotu-v-omani-na-sluzhbu-v-zsu/	2024-11-18T20:58:13-08:00
1000 days of the great war: about victory without illusions and despair. ArmiyaInform interview with...	And he also talked about why he chose the -Charter- brigade in particular, what the victory should be and what he plans to do the next day after it. — What is the greatest achievement of Ukraine to 1000 days of the great war? — The achievement, it seems to me, is that we hold on, that we did not give up, that we did not capitulate, despite the fact that at the beginning the balance of forces was not at all in our favor. I think this should be seen as positive. And some disadvantages - there are many of them. I think they should be talked about by specialists, experts who know more about military affairs. - And what is the biggest problem of Ukraine before 1000 days of the great war? - The problem of resources. Still, it is limited in our country. And if we talk about people who are ready to continue fighting, ready to continue to hold on and defend their country, then purely resource-wise, financially or, say, technically, or in the sense of the weapons that we have. But it seems to me that what we focus on is much more important. Do we focus on the positive without any excessive illusions, or do we still focus on the negative to the point of complete despair. — What is the most important question that Ukraine, the Ukrainian state and every citizen of Ukraine must answer now before 1000 days of a large-scale invasion? Is it the same question for all mentioned or can it be different, so, accordingly, different answers? — I think there are questions that further unite us. This is a question of what we are ready for for the sake of our country, for the sake of our future, how much we are ready to unite and what we are ready to do in this aspect. But I understand that the question is quite difficult, especially today, because now, as far as I can see, many people are emotionally tired. In addition, even the worldview is terribly misinformed, because our enemy works very skillfully and very effectively on our consciousness. — What advice would you give today to yourself 1000 days ago? Would you then and then for 1000 days do the same thing or would you do something different and different? - But in general the same. Perhaps I would advise myself to work more purposefully and in a more targeted way, after all, from then on, I should immediately set myself up for a long distance. I, like many compatriots, also experienced some emotional swings from falling into a certain euphoria when something was going well for us, to some dark days of despair. It takes a lot of effort. But hindsight is easy to be smart about. In fact, we all go through this path together, step by step. To make some mistakes, it seems to me, is natural. The main thing is to be able to draw some conclusions from them. — Since the first day of the war, since 2014, you have been volunteering, engaged in public activities. Why did you ultimately decide to join the Defense Forces as a serviceman?- I have always tried to be as efficient as possible. As long as there was an opportunity to work effectively as a volunteer - worked as a volunteer. But the law on mobilization was passed. I am a man of conscription age, a citizen of Ukraine of conscription age. As a law-abiding citizen, it was not even in my thoughts to dodge, hide or look for other options. Therefore, I immediately began to prepare for mobilization when I learned that such a law would be passed. —You have chosen the National Guard of Ukraine and the -Charter- brigade. Why NSU in particular and why -Charter- in particular? — The question of one's own effectiveness, one's own rational involvement was important to me and will remain important in the future. I know this unit, my friends and I created it, we saw how the unit was formed, how it grew, how it first turned from the DFTG into a full-fledged battalion, and then, actually, into a brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine. I know the leadership, the command of the brigade very well, I know many fighters personally. Thanks to this, I knew how I could contribute, how I could be useful, where I could be involved and where I could be effective. Therefore, for me, there was no special question regarding the -Charter-. —The experience of -Charter- is very positive, it is very media. How can this successful experience of -Charter- and other brigades be scaled to the entire Defense Forces of Ukraine? What should be done for this? - In fact, the -Charter- is not the only one. We have several divisions that perfectly understand that today both the autonomy of the division and the medialness of the division are important. And it's not about PR, it's definitely about efficiency. When you know how to build communications inside the unit and outside - both with business representatives and with representatives of the public - you have much more opportunities to provide your unit, to provide the soldiers with everything they need. It seems to me that this is definitely a positive thing, and it is probably not necessary to look for any negative here. It's important for Charter, it's a feature of Charter, and we actually try to be quite open in communication with society and to be honest. In my opinion, this creates a rather positive image of the brigade. Thanks to this, many people want to join the -Charter- today, in particular, fighters from other units are applying. I think this shows that the team is doing everything right. And how to transfer it to the experience of other divisions, is it possible to do it? I think it has to be done and, obviously, it cannot be done by the unit itself. It should still be an initiative on the part of the command, because, indeed, in many respects our Defense Forces need changes, need development, improvement. This should not be feared, it should be worked on, understanding that this is an improvement, that these changes will increase our efficiency, will make life easier for the fighter. — What should a real victory look like? What should we preserve in order to remain Ukraine? — Ukraine must preserve its statehood. Ukraine must preserve its citizens. This is the most valuable thing that can be - every human life, because every human loss, every human death is something irreversible, it is something that cannot be compensated in any way. And victory will be, it seems to me, future security, when the threat of defeat actually disappears, when the threat of human or territorial losses disappears. Therefore, I think that the issue of victory is not only purely physical, but also metaphysical. Here much will depend on what can be expected after the moment when the end of the war is announced. — Did you plan the day after the victory? What will you do after the war is over? - I have a lot of plans. In fact, I think it will somehow be further connected to the unit. -Charter- is not just a company of people who randomly got together, took up arms, and are going to disperse after the war is over. We create an environment, we create a community, a society. Regardless of whether this war ends, we will continue to have a lot of joint work, because we are united by our values, united by some common idea, common principles. Therefore, I think that I will meet this day in the company of my friends, with whom we are currently serving in the ranks of the brigade.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/1000-dniv-velykoyi-vijny-pro-peremogu-bez-ilyuzij-ta-zneviry-intervyu-armiyainform-z-sergiyem-zhadanom/	2024-11-18T20:32:00-08:00
Darknet in Russian: fakers spread lies about mercenary bodies	The Russians are also spreading information that they are allegedly selling the heart of a murdered 31-year-old German mercenary who served in the Armed Forces on the darknet. The price of such an organ is allegedly $70,000. Propagandists assure that the organ is in -good condition- and is sold exclusively to Germans. The -proof- is a screenshot of an ad from the darknet. The darknet (dark web) is a network of encrypted online content that cannot be accessed through conventional search engines. To access the darknet, users install a private browser and a virtual network that helps hide their identity and location. Because of this anonymity, this network is often used to sell drugs, share stolen data, and conduct other illegal activities. But Russian fakers faked not only the darknet announcement about the sale of the heart, but even the photo. It is not a human organ, but the powerful drug opium. -Black transplantology- is a favorite topic of Russian propagandists. They constantly lie that the military's organs are -illegally- removed in hospitals. Although in reality no such case has been recorded. In the fake about the sale of the heart, the Russians combined two narratives at once - about -black transplant specialists- and so-called mercenaries. In this way, they wanted to assert that foreign military personnel in Ukraine are treated as cannon fodder, and after that they will also -sell- them for organs. The goal is to undermine the confidence of foreigners in Ukraine and reduce their support. We emphasize once again that there are no -mercenaries- in Ukraine. Foreigners serve in the Defense Forces under a contract and have the full status of military personnel.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/darknet-po-rosijsky-fejkoroby-poshyryuyut-brehnyu-pro-organy-najmancziv/	2024-11-18T20:12:21-08:00
1000 Days of All-out War: A Timeline of Evil	1,000 days of time, during which Ukraine etched its name on the world map with blood and iron, cultivated respect and admiration for the colors of its flag, the flawless geometric forms of the national coat of arms, and the chivalry of the Warriors of Light — the Armed Forces of Ukraine throughout the globe. 1000 days that established us as a monolithic nation — ethnically, politically, spiritually. Of course, in a war that has lasted 10 years and 9 months, more than a quarter of which is already large-scale, it is somehow no longer commilfo to speak such pathetic meanings. After all, on the 1000th day, one feels general fatigue from what is happening: from the daily statistics of losses, shelling, destruction, from the enemy's advances in the populated areas of eastern Ukraine that have been wiped off the face of the earth. In addition, every day everyone has to filter out hostile IPSOs from objective news in the information space, which is imposed on those who are mostly awake due to constant -shakhed- attacks of the night&#8230; But even though there is a war, life goes on. And everyone who lives this thousandth day will certainly remember all those stages of confrontation, which cause not only sadness, but also pride, respect, inspiration for further struggle towards our inevitable Victory. Let's remember and try to systematize the periods of the Russian-Ukrainian war and we, together with the military historian, head of the NGO -Military History Center- Vasyl Pavlov. -This war is the most informational of all the wars Ukraine has waged throughout its history. In connection with this, we have a large number of materials, information, testimonies that have completely different origins. These are official documents and unofficial videos on Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, etc. These are scientific studies, journalistic studies, articles in information resources, documentaries, stories in the news. All this creates a huge array of information that really needs to be systematized,- says Vasyl Pavlov. It is very important to remember and understand how a war develops, because every war has its stages. The large-scale one was preceded by a -hybrid- phase that began with the occupation of Crimea. Then, from July 2021, there was preparation for the -great war-, which, unfortunately, was inevitable. And when on February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation carried out an open, large-scale attack on Ukraine, a new period of Russian aggression against Ukraine began, which scientists also divide into parts. In particular, specialists of the National Defense University of Ukraine single out several strategic defensive and offensive operations, and Vasyl Pavlov prefers periodization by years. -Since we are in a new information society, where events develop faster, are analyzed faster, even history is written faster, then ordinary people, and information resources, and even scientists need much faster periodization. We de facto periodize this war by years, or by campaigns: the campaign of the 22nd year, the campaign of the 23rd year, the campaign of the 24th. Yes, the 2024 campaign can be conventionally divided, as is traditionally done, into winter-spring, spring-summer, summer-autumn, and now we have already entered the autumn-winter campaign. Each of these periods has its own peculiarities and characteristic features related to the climate, the territory, and nature, but at the same time they have features related, for example, to the mobilization campaign in our country, the completion or opening of hidden mobilization in Russia. They coincide with the provision or non-provision of military-technical assistance to us. That is, there are a lot of factors that can affect one or another periodization, no matter what it is - whether it will be calendar, or event, or symbolic, that is, it will be based on some individual symbolic events, from which we will count. For example, the periodization of 2022 was significant. In fact, it was all based not so much on the calendar as on significant events that could be celebrated (the Battle for Kyiv, the escape of the occupiers from Zmiiny Island, the Kharkiv and Kherson offensive operations.— Author). But such periodization is possible only during the active phase of hostilities, when both opponents are active. At the moment, due to a number of factors, we are forced to respond to Russia's actions. If we talk about the 2024 campaign, then the question of any war arises here: how do we write its history? Do we write history through our actions or do we write history through the actions of the adversary? I want to explain this. The description of any war is that it can be done in different ways: how the enemy acted and how we countered him, or how we acted and the enemy responded to our actions. And there is a significant difference in this. It consists in who sets the initiative, who describes and how he describes. They say that history is written by the victors (and in this war, I hope, we will win), but the situation demands that the history of this war be written before its end. And we do it, but the Russians do it too,- Vasyl Pavlov explains. In particular, the destruction of the Russian A-50U long-range radar detection aircraft over the Sea of ​​Azov and the Krasnodar Territory, the signing of Security Agreements and the Global Peace Summit, battles in the north of Kharkiv region and in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation were significant for us in the current year. -The Kursk operation is really a completely new milestone, a new element. This is not the liberation of the occupied territories, but the transfer of hostilities to the official territory of the enemy, which is recognized as international borders. But, as in our case, no international organization could influence these actions. Frankly speaking, Ukraine committed an act of aggression. There is nothing wrong with that. We committed an act of aggression in response to an act of aggression. But we did do something that is very difficult to do in defensive wars — we moved the fighting into the enemy's territory. In this way, as they like to say, we turned the board upside down. That is, we changed the rules of the game, changed the approaches to them. And thus, many plans of the Russians for the summer-autumn campaign, for the second part or for the end of the summer, were fundamentally confused. After all, they were forced to respond to this, and to respond, perhaps, not so much on the front line itself, but in the information plane, for their citizens. They can advance as much as they want on the territory of Ukraine, but they still cannot get rid of the fact that Ukrainian troops are on the territory of Russia itself. This territory is quite large. And what to do with these troops, Russia has not invented at the moment,- Vasyl Pavlov notes. Historically, people remember the -last blood- - the war closest to them in time. Such was the Second World War for many of us before the events of 2014, and then in 2022. Once, when I was a schoolboy and learned that the period of German occupation of Kyiv lasted 778 days, I thought for a long time about what it was like to live in prison for so long, without rights and freedoms, under the threat of being shot at any moment. Old people in the 1990s, recalling the -last war- — the Second World War, said that any troubles can be survived if there was no war. But she is. Every day for 1000 days, the enemy has been trying to destroy us. Mariupol, for example, has been under occupation longer than during World War II. Now the collective memory of Ukrainians is building a grandiose canvas of images and symbols, events and phenomena, heroes and anti-heroes, which became decisive in the Ukrainian resistance to Russian aggression and will form the image of the -last blood-, the -last war- for future generations. Therefore, the Russian-Ukrainian war and the Victory in it will remain the core of the national memory of Ukrainians for a long time. I want them to stay like this forever.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/1000-dniv-shyrokomasshtabnoyi-vijny-hronologiya-zla/	2024-11-18T20:00:23-08:00
The navies of Ukraine and Great Britain will improve unmanned technologies	This was announced on November 18 by the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Among the main topics of the conversation are the results of the work of the Coalition on the development of maritime capabilities of Ukraine, the strengthening of the defense potential of our Navy and the development of promising directions, in particular, unmanned technologies. -Thanks to the support of Great Britain and other partners, we continue to improve our capabilities,- said Oleksiy Neizhpapa. He also informed his British colleague about the operational situation in the Black Sea, the participation of marines in combat operations on key areas of the front and the consequences of today's Russian attack on Odesa. Admiral Ben Key expressed his condolences to the victims of the Russian aggressor and assured that the partners will continue to do everything possible for Ukrainian victory. As reported by ArmyInform, the Commander of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Vice Admiral Oleksii Neizhpapa met with the commander of the Royal Danish Naval Forces Rear Admiral Henrik Rüberg.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/18/vms-ukrayiny-ta-velykoyi-brytaniyi-budut-vdoskonalyuvaty-bezpilotni-tehnologiyi/	2024-11-18T12:08:16-08:00
The Armed Forces reported the number of shells spent in 2023	About this in interv& #8217;yu RBC-Ukraine said the Deputy Commander of Missile Forces and Artillery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Serhii Musienko. He said that the Soviet caliber of 152 mm is currently being superseded. -However, first of all, there is still production of these ammunitions in the world. And there are quite modern artillery systems that are currently in use in our troops of this caliber, and they are supplied with 152 mm shots. These are Czech DANA-M2 self-propelled guns and a Soviet Msta-B howitzer, Serhii Musienko reported. In 2022, the Defense Forces used about 1.5 million artillery munitions, ranging from 120 mm mines to rockets to MLRS. Half of them are of 152 mm and 122 mm caliber. A third were 155 mm shots. According to him, at the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Russia, the Armed Forces of Ukraine used 152 mm and 122 mm guns at the front. And starting from the middle of 2022, 155 mm and 105 mm howitzers, which were transferred by partners, began to appear in the Ukrainian troops. &#8220;Already in 2023, we spent more than 3 million shells.

Doctors of last hope - a plastic surgeon and a pediatric oncologist save wounded soldiers	The video was released on November 18 on the brigade's channel. The headquarters of the brigade is a place where wounded, bleeding, shocked and contused soldiers from the front are taken after heavy battles, shelling, and explosions. If they're here, it means they've been through hell, but still have a chance at life. At the headquarters, the wounded are given medical assistance, their condition is stabilized, and then they are taken to the hospital. Currently, the medical team of the 93rd brigade employs military surgeons who have proven themselves to be among the most experienced. They know how to deal with critical bleeding, lacerations, multiple debris and military stress. But they did not always have such special skills. One of the surgeons, Oleg Kolomiets, in civilian life was a pediatric surgeon and oncologist, treating children from cancer. And Viktor Rodin was a plastic surgeon before the war: he reduced noses and bellies, rejuvenated the face, enlarged breasts and performed other operations in the field of aesthetic medicine.

-Gunsmith's guide-: why private arms manufacturers need it	TSU specialists created it based on the experience of companies working in the defense-industrial complex of Ukraine. Executive Director of the Technological Forces of Ukraine, Kateryna Mikhalko, told ArmiyaInform correspondent why there was a need to publish the -Armorer's Guide-. — As an association of private manufacturers, we have seen that enterprises at different stages of development are still faced with a misunderstanding of the sequence of state procedures.

According to her, TSU received many requests for clarification on the mechanisms of state regulation in the arms supply processes: — And we decided to form it into a single book. Where all the regulations would be collected, their sequence was described step by step, and what the manufacturer should do at the moment when he had the idea to make a new type of weapon - until the moment of passing all the procedures of the Ministry of Defense inspections. And then, actually, about signing a state contract and supplying these weapons to the army. Kateryna Mikhalko says that the -Gunsmith's Guide- was also published so that experienced manufacturers could give this book to their team members, and to make it easier for new employees to understand the field of weapons. - Also, this book was created so that small manufacturers who are just starting their journey could take the -Gunsmith's Guide- and understand what path awaits them in interaction with the state. To our partners and manufacturers who are part of the -Technological Forces of Ukraine- association, we made it publicly available for everyone. If there is any company outside our community, they can find it online with us at sites and read. That is, this is such a gift from our manufacturers to the entire industry, - stressed the executive director of the Technological Forces of Ukraine Kateryna Mikhalko.

-Gerbery- made of plywood and foreign electronics: the GUR told about a drone that imitates -Shahedy...	This is stated in message GUR MOU. The aggressor state of Russia assembles such multi-tasking UAVs at a factory in the city of Yelabuga. -Gerbera- can carry a combat unit as a kamikaze and carry out radio-electronic reconnaissance, in particular, to detect air defense positions and record the hits of other strike drones. This UAV imitates the Shahed-136/Geran-2 and is widely used by Russia to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. Due to the use of simple materials (plywood, foam), -Gerbera- is ten times cheaper than -Shakhed-. However, the structure of this drone contains a set of components of foreign manufacturers, which is already familiar for Russian weapons. The research of the downed samples proved that the Russians are making these UAVs according to the Chinese prototype using foreign components imported from China. The developer of the UAV is the Chinese model aircraft manufacturer Skywalker Technology Co., Ltd., which also produces fuselages and organizes the delivery of kits to Russia. Delivery is carried out through third-party companies. The anti-interference antenna (CRPA) contains chips from Analog Devices and Texas Instruments (USA), NXP Semiconductors (Netherlands). The universal flight controller also includes components manufactured by Texas Instruments, Atmel (USA), STMicroelectronics, U-Blox (Switzerland), NXP Semiconductors (Netherlands), XLSEMI (China). For targeting by the pilot (according to the FPV-drone principle) of the barrage version of the UAV and conducting aerial reconnaissance, the Gerbera is equipped with a Chinese camera with a three-axis suspension Topotek KHY10S90 and a Xingkai Tech Mesh Network XK-F358 modem. The DLE60 engine is manufactured by the Chinese Mile Hao Xiang Technology Co., Ltd. In the summer of 2024, this company came under US sanctions for supplies to Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/18/gerbery-z-fanery-ta-inozemnoyi-elektroniky-u-gur-rozpovily-pro-dron-shho-imituye-shahedy/	2024-11-17T23:17:44-08:00

Junior Sergeant -Hunger-: the story of an anti-aircraft gunner from the DSHV who destroyed an enemy ...	— I'm -Hunger- because that's what the boys like, and to be honest, I'm always hungry for everything - movement and adrenaline. Well, sometimes I don't finish my meal or overeat, as happens on duty,- Ivan jokes. A paratrooper from Bila Tserkva, he has been serving in the brigade for the second year, which he calls his second family. And when he is asked what he does in the service, Ivan simply answers: -Everything — training of personnel, and inspection of property, ammunition, missiles, weapons. And, of course, I motivate the boys. Sometimes with a word, sometimes with a pronoun. The main thing is to set them up so that they don't want to die, but want to kill and come back.- One of Ivan's major achievements was the 2024 raid on Kurshchyna, during which he shot down a Russian Ka-52 Alligator. -The third day of the operation. The guys broadcast on the radio: pinwheels are flying, running for destruction. I'm in position, taking the Stinger MANPADS. The helicopter was flying straight at me. Only the power grid got in the way - I was afraid that the rocket might catch on. But everything went smoothly. A shot, and in a few seconds I hide in the landing so that the enemy does not capture the position. I hear on the radio: -Hit!- The guys are happier than I am, because I'm in shock. Then came the feeling of maximum joy and satisfaction. After that, the enemy did not fly so brazenly,- he says. -Hunger- emphasizes that the -Stinger- is a powerful tool, but not all MANPADS are so -smooth-: -I had 4 missiles for the older MANPADS that simply did not fly - old equipment. You want to cover the infantry, but you can't. Therefore, Stinger is a solution to many problems for us. Everything is simple there: the target in the crosshairs - a second and a half - a shot. There is no time to think.- Now there are slightly fewer combat missions, because the enemy has realized that it is dangerous to fly in. But, according to Ivan, they are always ready. -If it is a UAV of the Zala or SuperCam type, we are working on the situation. If it just flies by, we don't waste the resource and don't -burn- the position. If it flies specifically at us, then we shoot it down with small arms. With MANPADS, we only go for the -big fish-. When Ivan joined the service, at first he planned to join the 95th Brigade of the Military Police, because his friends served there. But he got into the 82nd and did not regret it: -When I started studying, many of my fellow students wanted to study art or be tank drivers. I thought and realized that it would be cool for me to destroy enemy aircraft as much as possible. And so it happened. I am constantly learning, improving my qualifications. I dream of becoming the chief sergeant of the platoon and not only teaching the boys, but also running with them, destroying enemy turntables.- Ivan's words resonate in hearts. He lives for Victory and does everything so that the enemy is afraid to even appear in the sky over Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/18/molodshyj-serzhant-golod-istoriya-zenitnyka-z-dshv-yakyj-znyshhyv-vorozhyj-ka-52-na-kurshhyni/	2024-11-17T21:00:05-08:00
Sergeant's Day of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: about military art, refusal of officer positions and ...	Why do sergeants sometimes have to act as officers at the front? How many sergeants have received state awards since 2014? And in general, how is the sergeant corps living in the third year of a large-scale invasion? Chief Sergeant of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksandr Kosynskyi told ArmyInform about this. — Sergeants’ tasks today essentially remained the same: preparing personnel for combat, keeping weapons in constant readiness, preparing positions, managing people during combat, their moral support, maintaining discipline, says the chief sergeant of the Armed Forces. According to him, quite often sergeants and senior officers perform the duties of officers. This is sometimes due to the absence or inability of such persons to manage the personnel, to manage the battle. After all, some of these officers were drafted into the army only because they have a higher education. — Sergeants, who perform the duties of platoon commanders, manage the unit during the battle. Some even serve as company commanders. So war is not about education, it is about ability, training and experience. Oleksandr Kosynsky claims that sergeants and senior officers are practitioners. Because they were all soldiers, they know how to work with them. Sergeants are always closer to people, and therefore they manage to adapt faster to the conditions of the constantly changing environment. — The main thing is that there should be support, interaction and freedom of action, choice of methods and ways of completing tasks. As for the challenges, one of the most critical for us sergeants is the lack of entry into the personnel units, as well as the physical and moral qualities of those who come. He explains this by the fact that during the fighting of such intensity as now, servicemen fall out of formation every day. First of all, due to injuries and contusions. Many return to duty after being wounded, but it takes time: - Even after some wounds, no matter how motivated a sergeant is, he can no longer physically perform the combat tasks he used to perform. — The sergeants in the units are also today accepting newcomers who come from the training centers. Who after BZVP, who after professional training. The sergeants carry out their additional training and adaptation, Kosynskyi says. And he adds that this training is conducted by sergeants with combat experience, specifically for the types of weapons that are in the unit. And these are not only automatic rifles and submachine guns, these are also machine guns and portable anti-tank vehicles: - Sergeants teach the art of survival on the battlefield, train for the type of combat that is relevant in this area of ​​the front. But many of those who are called -young recruits- often lack the proper physical shape, endurance, have diseases and injuries, or are morally weak, not warriors. The chief sergeant of the Armed Forces claims that during the training of recruits, both motivation and confidence increase, skills and abilities increase. But you cannot go against certain physical or psychological limitations. And to carry out a combat mission, strong and brave men are needed. — And they are a potential for filling sergeant positions. After all, sergeants also fall out of the ranks. Or they go to higher positions, after the detachment - to the positions of chief sergeants of platoons, companies, battalions. This is important so that they can apply their experience at the highest levels of military management. But sergeant positions must be constantly replenished, and there are difficulties with this. There is no soldier - there will be no sergeant, says Kosynskyi. Separately, he notes that many sergeants and foremen are appointed to officer positions: - Why do they take the best of the best. Yes, it is important to replenish officer positions as well. It is important that there are experienced, adequate military personnel. The success of the battle, the survival and health of personnel, the survivability of the unit itself, and its cohesion depend on them, on their decisions and actions. At the same time, the chief sergeant of the Armed Forces notes that it is very difficult to maintain and grow in these conditions the -bone- of professional, experienced and motivated sergeants who would form the basis of the foundations of the sergeant corps. Because no one but a sergeant will train a soldier. — We have more than 250,000 non-commissioned officer and sergeant positions, which are approximately four-fifths full. This is what I say for all types and types of troops. -Unfortunately, the worst staffing is precisely in those combat units and units that fight the enemy on the front line every day,- says Oleksandr Kosynskyi. And he clarifies that now about three quarters of sergeants are mobilized. That is, the personnel potential of professional sergeants, who have been raised since 2014, bearers of the -sergeant idea-, is decreasing: - Although I must note that a lot of mobilized servicemen are mastering the sergeant's business, taking over the foundations that were laid in the formation of the modern professional corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, reach a level no worse than that of professional sergeants. I meet a lot of such mobilized sergeants and chiefs while working in units, in areas of combat operations. I am often surprised at how quickly some of them are permeated by our sergeant's ideas, values. The master sergeant emphasizes that many of these soldiers have already completed various non-commissioned officer courses, and abroad as well. — I meet many and those who refused to move to officer positions, although they have a higher education, some even more than one. I think, I believe, I know that the future of the sergeant corps lies with such sergeants and chiefs. Because only the faithful are worthy. Our sergeants and senior officers are modern heroes, supermen, those on whose shoulders rests this thin and extremely long battle line of our nation's battle with the evil coming at us from Moscow, Kosinsky notes. Since 2014, more than 25,000 sergeants and officers have received state awards, 105 of them the title of Hero of Ukraine, unfortunately, 76 of them posthumously. — But they are our Heroes forever. Those who inspire us to continue the struggle, those who define the meaning of this struggle, our brothers in arms who are waiting for us and look at us from the sky. We have no right to betray them, must fight, must win. Sergeant Day for us, it is not just a professional holiday&#8230; rather, it is not even a holiday, especially at this time. This is a day when we can pay tribute to our fallen brothers and feel our identity and our unity in this battle.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/18/den-serzhanta-zsu-pro-vijskove-mystecztvo-vidmovu-vid-oficzerskyh-posad-ta-udostoyenyh-zvannya-geroya-ukrayiny/	2024-11-17T20:48:52-08:00
Noah's Ark for Kim: North Korea is likely to build its largest warship	Project details investigated specialists from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). As stated in the expert report, North Korea has built a new slipway 170 meters long and 30 meters wide at its shipyard in the city of Nampho. The direct construction of the facility started in May 2024. Such volumes of the construction site are a third larger than the dimensions of the recently launched Amnok and Nampo class corvettes for the DPRK military fleet, which were the largest military ships of the North Korea, built after the Najin-class frigates, delivered in the 1970s. Thanks to the appearance of such an object, the regime of -Rocketman Kim-, as the leader of the DPRK was nicknamed by the newly elected US President Donald Trump, will be able to build a particularly powerful, as according to its dimensions, a ship. However, experts do not yet have an understanding of what kind of combat vessel it might be. Available satellite images show that the North Korean regime is already building some kind of ship on this slipway. In particular, you can see something similar to sections of the hulls painted with a red oxide primer. You can also see two gantry cranes that can be used to move sections of the ship's hull along the slipway. But since the North Koreans have stretched a frame with a camouflage net over this slipway, it is impossible to see the construction of this ship in more detail on satellite images. Researchers from the IKK defense portal Defense Express (DE) singled out an interesting detail, which is that the shipyard in the North Korean city of Nampo essentially has a -dual purpose-: civilian vessels were also built there. However, it was at this shipyard that two missile corvettes under the Amnok project were also built, which are currently the most powerful warships of the DPRK Navy. that these ships have a displacement of up to 1.5 thousand tons and a hull length of 80 meters. And it is on this comparative basis that the two versions are further based on which task North Korea could build a huge, considering its scale, a slipway as long as 170 meters. The first version - the North Korean regime has the ambition to build a more powerful surface ship for its Navy, for example, a &#8220;missile frigate&#8221; class. The second version is that the DPRK wants to use this facility to build a new ballistic missile carrier submarine. On this background, ICC DE mentions the report that North Korea and Russia may work, including segment of technologies for the construction of nuclear submarines. Which, in turn, leads to the conclusion that in this story, Pyongyang's new project was not without Moscow's advice and help. While Nampo Ship yard can produce a vessel with a larger hull, which in mirrors the design of a modern warship, North Korea is unlikely to be able to single-handedly reproduce the relevant modern combat systems and capabilities. This is another proof of the presence of the -hand of Moscow-. kp/en/article/q/bb7704b49447dd80b52c60420f45e9dc.kcmsf->reported that during a September 2024 visit to a new naval base under construction, dictator Kim said , that the country's Navy -will soon receive large surface warships and submarines that cannot be anchored at existing warship mooring facilities. And the construction of a naval base for the operation of the latest large warships has become an urgent task.- One of the possible explanations for what kind of ship may be under construction is that a floating shock platform is being built with placing cruise missiles of a certain type on it. Also, in September 2023, Pyongyang test-launched long-range cruise missiles from an Amnok-class corvette. Thus, a larger platform will allow the transportation of more cruise missiles and will also potentially allow short-range ballistic missiles to be included in its arsenal. At the same time, experts note that although the North Korean fleet is formally large enough in terms of the number of vessels, it mainly consists of from small patrol and coastal ships, which have extremely limited combat capabilities. Thus, the hypothetical -frigate- (if it really is) will be a giant step forward for North Korea's military ambitions. A visual presentation of the North Korean missile project.

Human shield tactics in Kurshchyna: the enemy mirrors its own crimes	Thus, Russian and Belarusian propaganda resources coordinatedly disseminated false information, arguing that the Armed Forces in Kur Region allegedly use a live shield tactics. In fact, the tactic of a live shield is typical for the Russian army, which since 2014 has been repeatedly covered by civilians in occupied territories and prisoners of war. For example, in December 2023, the Ukrainian Prosecutor's Office opened criminal proceedings on the use of Ukrainian prisoners as a living shield in the Zaporozhye region. The Kremlin's propaganda resources are also spreading excerpts from an interview with a Ukrainian prisoner of war about the threats of -shooting in the back- that he heard from the commanders. Ukrainian prisoners are forced to fulfill the requirements of the invaders: confess to the crimes invented or committed by the Russians themselves, to speak under a record of frank lies, etc. The torture and murder of prisoners, other violations of the rules and customs of war is a common practice for Russians. Like the practice of thighs, invented by Stalin and revived in the Russian army. This function is currently performed by the Kadyrov special unit -Akhmat-. Back in March 2022, the SBU published intercepted negotiations by the Chechen language of Rosgvardia's fighter with his wife, where he confesses that his key task is to restrain the Russian military: -Our task is to drive back of those east soldiers who begin to run away from the blows of Ukrainian artillery.- Therefore, the current accusations of the Ukrainian military are another attempt by Russian propaganda to erase reality and justify their own crimes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/18/taktyka-zhyvogo-shhyta-na-kurshhyni-vorog-viddzerkalyuye-vlasni-zlochyny/	2024-11-17T20:03:48-08:00

-Plus or minus 30 years- - the Russians are throwing young fighters into the offensive	Andriy Otchenash, a serviceman of the 4th operational brigade of the National Guard -Rubizh-, told about this on ArmyTV stream. -When we destroy the enemy, we try to fly around and see how the enemy is equipped and stuff. We can see that quite young guys are really going into battle. And this youth gives them many chances to survive. Because, objectively, it is much more difficult to destroy a young enemy than to destroy some grandfather who will be half fatter and half slower,- Andrii Otchenash said. According to him, captured Russians of this age group explain that they went to fight because of money. Added to this are the consequences of propaganda, because Russians believe that they are defending their country on foreign land. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the -Svoboda- battalions of the 4th operational brigade of the National Guard -Rubizh- caused great losses to the occupiers who tried to break through our defenses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/17/plyus-minus-30-rokiv-rosiyany-kydayut-v-nastup-molodyh-bijcziv/	2024-11-17T10:57:09-08:00

-It blew so much that everything in the world sparkled-: Druzhkivka in Donetsk region suffered a ter...	reported this by the head of the Donetsk OVA Vadym Filashkin. Correspondents of ArmiyaInform recorded the consequences of the occupiers' devastating attack on civilian residential buildings and infrastructure. Local residents say that the shelling took place at night around 11:30 p.m. - 11:35 p.m. The impact of the enemy ammunition was extremely powerful. - It blew so much that everything in the world sparkled! - says one of the women. — God had mercy that there were no dead or seriously wounded, they all sigh together, answering questions about the victims. It was the hardest for a 90-year-old woman, whose house is located closest to the epicenter of the explosion - she has numerous bruises and stress. - On the head, on the hands, on the knees, fragments fell, the leg was completely blue, - says her daughter. After providing help, the children took their mother to their home. — She is 90 years old, it is very difficult for her mother, — adds the son. The impact was so powerful that, in addition to the place of impact, it destroyed dozens of residential and commercial buildings on three nearby streets. Even in buildings several tens of meters away from the place where the ammunition was hit, the roofs were damaged and the panes in the windows were broken. The destruction of buildings near the impact site is catastrophic. In them, as well as in the house of a 90-year-old woman, not only the roofs were demolished and the windows and doors were knocked out along with the frames, but also the ceiling and walls were moved. Some of them are already unrecoverable. Despite Sunday being a day off, representatives of the Salvation Angels Charitable Foundation, which works with the support of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, arrived at the site of the explosion early in the morning. — Just as an -arrival-, we immediately arrive, help so that people can be repaired. We will find out about the need for help from the local administration, says Oleksandr, a representative of the foundation. Boards, chipboard, plastic film, construction foam, nails, screws are unloaded from the arriving trucks - everything necessary for quick installation and temporary repairs capable of protecting the buildings damaged by the explosion from the weather. Residents of destroyed houses are queuing for registration and receiving materials. Difficult days are ahead of them, because the received materials still require skilled workers - if almost anyone can cover shutters with a film, even temporary roofing requires a skilled worker. No less than the most damaged private houses, the enterprise located in the building of the former school suffered. — All 36 windows were broken, the roof was demolished, the doors in the offices were smashed. This building is over 90 years old. There used to be a stable here, after the war there was a school, says the director of the enterprise, Volodymyr. The destruction inside the building is no less than outside. Of particular concern is the equipment - will it be possible to restore it, will it work after such an impact and damage? The company's production was important for the Ukrainian energy system, which is under regular attacks from the Russian occupiers, so its shutdown would cause significant damage. The occupiers once again struck a blow at the civil infrastructure and housing development. Without any military purpose, it is purely designed to continue to terrorize the civilian population, both directly through the destruction of residential buildings and indirectly through the destruction of an enterprise that produced important products.

The church was not hit: about the Good News after the shelling of Sloviansk	Summary of the devastating consequences of the enemy strike reported by the head of the Slavyansk City Military Administration Vadim Lyakh. Chaplain Oleksandr told ArmyInform correspondents more about the destruction caused by Russian shelling. From 10 a.m. in the main hall of the -Good News- Church in Sloviansk, the service is already underway. The pastor talks about today's shelling and the Lord's will. Citing the -Epistle to the Romans- (8:28), the apostle Paul emphasizes several times that God supports those who love Him in everything, so according to His Will, -all things work together for good- for them. It is hard not to agree with this - during today's shelling, an enemy ammunition hit the road asphalt a few meters from the Church building, due to which there were no victims, wounded and injured. As a pastor at the service, Chaplain Oleksandr agrees to talk about the explosion and its consequences. — This morning, at seven o'clock in the morning, it -flew- near the road to Shevchenko. We thank God that at that time there were almost no people in the building and that the Lord saved those who were here, they were not hurt. Maybe they were scared, but everyone is alive, healthy, unharmed, he says. -Road to Shevchenko- is Mir Street, the asphalt pavement of which was hit by a Russian munition. A little further, it adjoins Taras Shevchenko Street, at the beginning of which there is a monument to the poet. The building of the -Good News- Church was less fortunate - the explosion occurred just a few meters away from it. Debris and the blast wave destroyed part of the roof and floors, broke the panes in the windows, mutilated the doors. The destruction inside the building is also significant. Oleksandr says with comfort that before the service, many believers who live nearby responded to the request to come early and clean up the debris, put things in order in front of the church and in its mutilated premises. — Many thanks to the members of the church, people who come here to praise God. We just gave a little cry that help was needed, and people came. At 7 o'clock in the morning it -flew in- - and by 9 o'clock in the morning we had already removed the garbage. We have restored order in the hall, closed some broken windows on the floors and are conducting services, he says. The chaplain says that the -Good News- Church is an important center for the local community, which helps and supports the needy and internally displaced persons during the difficult times of the war. — When there is an opportunity, we provide humanitarian aid. We are trying to somehow influence the community, to help, because times are difficult and it is necessary to stick together, help each other, says the chaplain. The Good News Church played an important role in the life of the community even before the large-scale invasion. As early as 2020, an elementary school started working in its premises, and a Sunday school operated. The main impact of the powerful blast wave after today's impact came precisely on the wing of the church building in which the children's classes are located. Alexander shows mutilated classrooms with books scattered about. — Today we have a Sunday school, we provided them with another room, but those rooms intended for children suffered the most, he says without hiding his sadness. The blackboards in the classrooms have the same inscription: -February 23. Cool job.- It has not been erased since 2022 as a reminder of when the day school was suspended until a solid peace. Since then, classes with children took place only on Sundays within the Sunday school. Now they too are under threat, because many children, frightened by the shelling, did not come today. This is how the Russian occupiers continue to destroy centers of peaceful life in Ukraine - hitting children and adults, school classrooms and the Church. However, the way the believers rallied to eliminate the consequences of the enemy shelling testifies to the strength of the Slavic community, and the expeditious filling of the hole from the explosion by local utility workers shows the responsibility and effectiveness of the local authorities. &nbsp; This is good news from Donetsk region.

According to Andrii, the fighters of his brigade repeatedly recorded cases when Russians cut their own lives short in order not to be captured. -They are horrified as much as possible, they are told that we cut off the genitals of captives, abuse them, do some absolutely terrible things in the style of terrorists. And they are so afraid of it that it is easier for them to shoot themselves or blow themselves up with a grenade. Because of this fear, the occupiers do not surrender as often as they shoot,- said Andriy Otchenash. According to him, when the Russians do get captured, they are very surprised that they are not abused, but the norms of international law are applied to them. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the -Svoboda- battalions of the 4th operational brigade of the National Guard -Rubizh- caused great losses to the invaders who tried to break through our defenses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/17/vam-vidrizhut-statevi-organy-rosijski-komandyry-zalyakuyut-svoyih-bijcziv-shhob-ti-ne-zdavalysya-u-polon/	2024-11-17T06:03:48-08:00

Huge losses of the Russians, IPSO and whether Pokrovsk will fall: an expert on possible scenarios of...	&#8220;The general characteristics of the situation at the front should be considered in the context of major geopolitics and the outcome of the presidential election in the United States. It really is. The front line of the Russian-Ukrainian war now has three large complex sections. The first is the Kurakhiv direction. Is a tactical withdrawal of the Defense Forces of Ukraine possible from there? It is possible, you should not be afraid of this, because battles can be lost, the main thing is to win the war. I really like historical parallels. Napoleon brilliantly won the Battle of Borodino, but lost the war. Ukrainians were heartbroken when our soldiers left Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, and especially Bakhmut. But the war is not lost on this. Indeed, this is a very difficult and difficult direction, but nevertheless such a scenario can be. Pokrovsk is next. There is a lot of speculation here that, they say, the city will fall, and then Donetsk will fall. This is not true. After all, Pokrovsk is a rather complex agglomeration, dense urban development and so on. Let's turn to illustrative examples. Avdiivka, in the active phase of a large-scale war, was stormed by the Rashists from October 7 last year, that is, they took it for more than six months. The enemy could not capture Bakhmut for more than 10 months. At the same time, they advanced beyond the city itself, there, the main hills, and could not. Reaching Pokrovsk does not mean taking it. The battle itself can be very long and not necessarily successful for the enemy. There will be huge enemy losses. Reconcentration of the enemy's forces and means in the Zaporozhye direction is logical. There is a very fundamental rule of war: the attacking side, if it slips at some point, must inevitably change the vector of the blow. Because if this does not happen, then a moment of balance occurs and the defending party gets a chance for counter-offensive actions. the Russians cannot allow this. According to their logic, the Zaporozhye direction is also a working one. Now speculation about the borders of Dnipropetrovsk region. It is very unfortunate that all this is happening in the information space. It is at least 30 km to the administrative borders, well, that's a lot. Indeed, according to the results of this year, the Russian Federation has the highest indicators of captured territory of Ukraine. But if these indicators are compared with the losses, then this is something incredible. According to the results of 2022, the losses of the enemy amount to 90 thousand, in 2023 more than 220 thousand, and this year I estimate them in the perspective of more than 350 thousand occupiers, because there are already 300 thousand, 21,940 people in October alone. This is simply a phenomenal figure. Therefore, it is still necessary to go 30 km to Dnipropetrovsk region. And this is a very serious distance, wet weather must also be taken into account, so you can only move on roads. The Ukrainian defenders are shelling large columns of firecrackers like nuts. The enemy from IPSO actively joined these speculations around the Dnipropetrovsk region, dispersing panic, betrayal and fakes. Why do we associate the situation on the Russian-Ukrainian war front with the victory of Donald Trump in the USA? Trump really declares a quick freezing of the conflict. But only after his inauguration on January 20 will any concrete conversation begin. A brief historical example: the Taliban and the Americans have been talking for more than a year, these are very low geopolitical stakes. And with such huge geopolitical stakes, which are now in the Russian-Ukrainian war, God forbid that in six months they would find some points of contact. Moreover, in these two months before Trump's inauguration, world geopolitics may turn around more than once. Let's not forget, Iran threatens to strike Israel already in the land part. This can really make a big difference. And if this happens conditionally, then the Russian Federation will experience a colossal reduction in the supply of explosives. The Iranians provide the Rashists with unmanned systems and ammunition. In my personal opinion, the front is moving towards a fiery equilibrium. Wet weather sets in, a cycle of rain and sleet. There will be, as in the previous two winters, endless counter-battery artillery duels. And here the Defense Forces of Ukraine are head and shoulders above the enemy. That is why he is raging now, he wants to capture as many kilometers of our land as possible.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/17/velychezni-vtraty-rosiyan-ipso-ta-chy-vpade-pokrovsk-ekspert-pro-mozhlyvi-sczenariyi-rozvytku-podij/	2024-11-16T21:04:06-08:00
Almost like SpaceX: Israel has developed a vertical takeoff barrage munition	In a brief description of the ammunition, the Israeli arms manufacturer positions ROC-X Weapon System as a hand-launched VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) electro-optical missile that provides troops with new opportunities for attack and maneuvering, ArmyInform reports. This innovative munition is designed to increase the accuracy and speed of hitting a wide range of targets, both stationary and moving, providing new opportunities for quick response on the battlefield. As indicate analysts of the defense publication Army Recognition, ROC-X stands out against the background of others of ammunition as the world's first VTOL missile that can be manually launched by a single soldier. The device is designed to solve tactical tasks, allowing the operator to independently control the flight, select targets and return it safely after completing the mission. The ROC-X design includes a one-meter-long fuselage and X-shaped wings with a span of 0.8 meters. An innovative system of engines with a channel screw without moving parts provides the product with silence, stealth and high maneuverability, which makes it practically invisible in combat conditions. Particular attention should be paid to the accuracy of the device: the probable deviation from the point of impact is only one meter, which makes the ROC-X an effective tool for destroying targets at a distance of up to 10 kilometers. Such accuracy is achieved thanks to advanced electro-optical and GPS guidance systems, which allows the operator to do without special launchers. One of the key advantages of the ROC-X is its ability for rapid manual launch, which allows it to respond instantly to changing combat conditions. This feature makes it a versatile tool for modern tactical applications where speed and flexibility play a crucial role. In combat conditions, the ROC-X demonstrates high maneuverability and rapid readiness for deployment, and also has features that reduce acoustic and thermal signatures, facilitating covert operations in enemy territory. The device weighs only 6.8 kg and is equipped with a warhead weighing 2 kg, with the possibility of using shock and non-contact detonators, which allows to effectively hit targets. ROC-X can stay in flight for up to 20 minutes, supporting both manual and automatic control modes, giving the operator the ability to adapt to changing combat conditions. Thus, this device is a versatile and highly effective tool that significantly improves the capabilities of ground troops in the conditions of modern combat conflict. The development of systems similar to the ROC-X by other defense companies is aimed at creating accurate and versatile munitions that can be controlled by individual soldiers. However, the ROC-X stands out for its true portability as it is fully manually operated, unlike other systems such as the US-based Switchblade 300 previously reported told our agency, or the Chinese CH-901, which require special launchers for use. This feature makes the ROC-X particularly suitable for dynamic environments, providing quick response and flexible operation in the field, giving soldiers greater autonomy compared to similar systems. It should be noted that in January 2023 the US Department of Defense concluded with the Israeli company Israel Aerospace Industries a contract for the development and delivery of a new portable barrage drone with electro-optical guidance. IAI, as a prime contractor, received a multimillion-dollar contract from the Office of Irregular Warfare Technical Support (IWTSD) of the US Department of Defense for the rapid development and delivery of POINT BLANK systems in the ROC-X version.

-They drove to -Otchenashi--: 2 thousand km along the front line to -Funtyk-. How the driver took th...	Artem, a senior soldier of the 21st separate special purpose battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, with the call sign -Pavlyk- at the front since March 2024. Since then, he has driven more than two thousand kilometers on the front lines in a Hummer with the call sign -Funtik- and -rolled- more than 60 thousand km in pickup trucks. And there was a rapid mission on an armored Ford and experience on a Turkish Kirpi. The driver Artyom -Pavlyk- told ArmyInform correspondents about why being a driver on the front line is important and honorable, but dangerous, how fear helps to fulfill the mission and about the heroic rescue of Ukrainian drones from a semicircle. Artem has been in the Armed Forces for over 20 months. He went to serve without hesitation as soon as the summons came. But he did not get to the front right away, at first he guarded the administration of the Pechersk District of Kyiv. However, he then transferred to a combat brigade and has been on the front line for more than half a year since then. In civilian life, -Pavlyk- worked as a tractor driver, and not so long ago he served his term as a driver. The acquired experience came in handy during the service - Artem was appointed to the position of a driver. Since then, -Pavlik- had to perform numerous logistical and rescue missions, delivering fighters and cargo for them to the front line and taking the wounded from there. - Driving in, bringing in, taking out - all this is my work, my tasks. I fly -to the point-, drop off or pick up guys, deliver them water, food, etc., he says. It was possible to drive -Pavlik- on different vehicles, but most of all - on a pickup truck and a Hummer. The pickup truck, he says, is faster and has higher cross-country ability, but it has virtually no protection. - You can drive at a speed of 100-120 kilometers per hour, even on mud, but there is no protection - except that you can install a REBchik, - says Artem. On the other hand, the Hummer is slower, its cross-country ability is worse. The driver explains that this armored personnel carrier is more suitable for the desert plains than for the Donbas mud, where the ground is viscous and sticky, like plasticine. But instead, this armor has powerful protection. — -Hummer- drives slower - 80-90 km/h, and -guzzles- a lot - 35 liters per 100 kilometers, and the passability is worse. And here the ground is like plasticine - such that the car simply floats, not on the ground, but floats on it. But -Funtyk- is strong, withstands many -arrivals-, protects against debris and even a direct hit, it has a good armored capsule, - explains Artem. — I had to relearn a little, because the car is like a car, but the dimensions are wider. And it is very heavy - five tons, says -Pavlyk- about -Funtyk-. And it also shows the padlock on the door. The Hummer does not have a standard factory lock, so it is impossible to lock it. The ignition key is also unnecessary - the car starts with half a turn of the toggle switch. -There were cases when Hammers were stolen, so we came up with a way out - to lock the door with a padlock,- explains Artem. An unusual device on the door of an American armored personnel carrier makes it look like the entrance to a basement converted into a bunker - armored doors were installed, and a lock was attached to them forgot to mount. As evidence -Pavlyk- shows the impact sites of debris from the explosions of grenades, mines and the explosive charge of the FPV drone. Deep scars in the armored doors and the body of the -Hummer- testify to the force of the explosions, and the laminated glass, apparently, withstood a direct hit from an automatic grenade launcher. — They said that -Funtyk- also traveled to Bakhmut. And the FPV shot flew behind me under the frame and exploded there. But the car survived, I hit the gas and drove away with two flat tires, Artem says. At that time, it was necessary to drive on a -docket- - pressed rubber inside the wheels, which allows you to move even after the road has -eaten- the rubber of the tires. The driver explains that under fire the main thing is not to get confused, not to reduce speed and to maneuver sharply. Then the chances that they will be able to hit the car with precision drop sharply. To do this, you need to be a true specialist in your field, a skilled driver. And yet&#8230; — Fear helps. Because when there is fear, the reaction is sharper - you understand everything faster, assess the situation, maneuver. In a calm environment, you drive relaxed. And there you go - -whoosh-whoosh-whoosh!- - run! Reaction, maneuvers, more gas - you know, you feel what you need to do, how to leave - explains the driver. You also need to be very fast and not linger anywhere, not stop longer than a couple of minutes, and even better - a few tens of seconds. That's why he always drives the guys, especially those who come out of positions, because when they load into the car for the trip, they often calm down and relax too much. — He who is not afraid will drive slowly, relaxed. And everything will catch up with him, motherfucker. Need more reaction to everything. Guys need to be coached to load and unload faster, because they lose their fear when they get out of position. And you need to be afraid until you leave, says -Pavlyk-. However, fear and adrenaline alone will not get you far - you must always carefully prepare for each mission and never violate the basic rules - drive only at night or at dusk, in no case turn on the headlights, carefully study the driving route. — I ride in a -night lamp- so as not to reveal myself. I drive very fast, at the maximum possible speed on this road. Also, before leaving, I carefully study the map in order to remember the route, I count the number of turns, says Artem. He does not have a navigator, so he carefully studies the entire route before leaving on a map, keeps it in his memory and orients himself to the local area at breakneck speed. Accidentally, due to oversight, jumping into a -turn that is not there- is deadly, because there may not be time to turn around and take the correct route. — In half an hour you have to -get stuck in.- And it is better to drive, unload and load in 20-25 minutes, and return, Artem explains. -Pavlyk- recalls that during his missions he had to take out the bodies of three dead and more than 30 wounded fighters. The mission was the most difficult, when one dead and three wounded had to be taken out at the same time, but the driver coped with it as well. — I had to drive by three -300s- and one -200- on a road where I had never driven. I looked at the map for almost two hours thinking about how to do all this, how to bypass the dangerous section. And, in the end, everything worked out - drove in, picked up, took out, - recalls the fighter. He recalls that he had to drive along a broken country road, on one of the sections of which a mortar often hit. However, in the end, skill, experience and thorough training helped accomplish the mission. Artem says that a car on the front line is the main target for all the enemy's weapons, because everyone is interested in aiming at a car. But it is not possible without it, because the infantrymen -at ground zero- are critically dependent on -last kilometer- logistics. — The car that goes! Everyone is interested in knocking her down, destroying her, because she is carrying someone or something - fighters, supplies. That is, the idea that a driver is such a safe profession in the army is false - on the -front- we are the first target, he explains. However, -Pavlyk- only partially agrees with the definition of himself as a -special purpose- driver. He emphasizes that not all of us are made for war, but someone has to do this hard work - and he does it. — It is necessary to protect, because who else will protect? And if you are smart, fast, and know how to do something, then you will simply be able to do it well, says Artem. Artem can have from one to 3-4 departures per night. Sometimes you have to wait for hours for a mission, being in full readiness to start the same second the order is received. Even after completing the mission, the driver says, he can wait for several hours until the fighters delivered by him reach their positions and report their arrival. - They can go for 3 or 4 hours - during this time I don't sleep because I'm worried about them. I understand that nothing depends on my waiting, but I'm still waiting for a message, he says. This attitude of Artyom was noticed by the fighters themselves, among whom -Pavlyk- gained extreme respect, because they know that he will never leave them to their own devices and will do everything possible to help. Artyom recalls one of his many missions, during which he had to take out drones from a semicircle in an unfamiliar car - an armored Ford. The enemy had already appeared behind their positions, so if they were not taken out before morning, they would inevitably have to engage in a direct shooting battle. The driver of the Ford then refused to go, and Pavlyk and the commander drove in an unfamiliar car, flew to the position of the drones and pulled the boys out. All this took about 40 minutes. — For forty minutes there and back, loaded in about a minute. The guys were very pleased, everyone thanked us for coming. They were already waiting for the car to arrive, they had already packed their things, and I turned around. They jumped in - and we chased them, - says Artem. Later, the drone operators told how relieved they felt not even when they broke out of the semi-encirclement, but also when they received a message that Pavlyk was coming after them: -If Pavlyk is coming after us, then we will leave!- Photo by Ruslan Tarasov	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/17/pognaly-na-otchenashi-2-tysyachi-km-po-peredovij-na-funtyku-yak-vodij-vyvozyv-dronariv-z-otochennya/	2024-11-16T20:29:14-08:00

It was the Russians who faked the video, because the Institute for the Study of War has never released such information. Such statistics were not disseminated by Ukrainian officials and the media either. Fakeness is also indicated by the fact that Russians have traditionally made a lot of grammatical mistakes. In particular, -territorial recruitment and social support centers- were translated into the video as TRSSCs. Whereas in English it is correct TCR and SS (Territorial Centers of Recruitment and Social Support). In addition, they used a fake final frame of the Institute for the Study of War. At the end of each entry, the Institute calls for a donation to their organization (-Donate today-), while the propagandists only have a list of social networks instead.

Ministry of Defense: Every defender of Ukraine will receive improved nutrition in medical institutio...	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informs about this. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has initiated important changes in the system of providing servicemen during treatment and rehabilitation. Thanks to the Resolution adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers, the mechanism of providing improved food to servicemen in health care facilities of all forms of ownership has been improved. The resolution allows to provide our defenders with food according to the standards of military medical institutions of NATO countries even in civilian hospitals. -Every defender who risks their lives for our freedom deserves the best conditions for recovery. Not only do we provide our troops with the care they need, but we also work to ensure that each one of them feels supported and respected. This initiative is our response to their dedication and courage,- said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General Serhiy Melnyk. According to the new regulations, food in civilian hospitals for servicemen will be served according to a specially designed diet, which, in particular, determines the list of products, their quantity and weight required for one serviceman per day, taking into account the specific needs of the body during recovery. -The new standards ensure the complete nutrition needed for a quick recovery. For example, they take into account the increased need for protein, vitamins and calories needed to heal injuries or illnesses. The cost of such food is calculated on the basis of a special product catalog approved by the Ministry of Defense. This Catalog contains current prices for products, and they are taken into account when determining the cost of food for one bed-day in medical facilities,- explains Serhiy Melnyk. According to him, this ensures that each soldier will receive the proper ration for a quick recovery. The resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers also provides for a clear mechanism for compensating costs for civilian medical institutions, which will allow maintaining high standards of service. The new financing mechanism provides for the conclusion of a standard contract that will ensure transparent compensation for the costs of improved nutrition. Thus, civilian medical facilities will receive adequate funding, and military personnel will receive quality treatment and rehabilitation. We remind you that recently in the structure of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine the department for intellectual property issues was launched and the technology of detection of enemy FPV drones -Vitryak-M- was patented.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/kozhen-zahysnyk-ukrayiny-otrymaye-pokrashhene-harchuvannya-u-medzakladah-nezalezhno-vid-formy-vlasnosti/	2024-11-16T08:11:42-08:00

Artillery Coalition member countries discussed the needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine until 2027	About this notified the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Representatives of 14 states, as well as the EU and NATO, took part in the online meeting of the Coalition, which is co-led by France and the USA. The representatives of the participating states discussed the potential contributions of each of them to meet these needs, as well as the possibility of investing in the Ukrainian defense industry. The Artillery Coalition was launched in January of this year in Paris. Its participants are countries that have advanced technologies for the production of the best artillery systems, ammunition, artillery reconnaissance, unmanned targeting systems, and fire control systems. The purpose of the Coalition's activity is that by the end of 2027, the Defense Forces of Ukraine should acquire sustainable complex artillery capabilities and interoperability with NATO. This is necessary in order to strengthen the ability of the Ukrainian army to resist Russian attacks and deter potential new invasions, as well as to neutralize Russia's fire superiority, its combat capabilities, and to establish operational interoperability with NATO. The Artillery Coalition was created within the framework of the Contact Group on Defense of Ukraine (-Ramstein- format).

The Ministry of Defense explained the tasks of the new intellectual property department	About this told Ilya Kostin, Head of the Intellectual Property Department of the Main Department of Military Justice of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. According to him, this is the first time that the state, represented by the Ministry of Defense, has received the rights to a technological product. -This has never been done before in the Ministry - when the manufacturer, a specialized military unit (Center for Scaling of Technological solutions) invented this product. This technological solution is of very high quality. And this was confirmed by state registration and a patent for a useful model was issued. This happened only in the MOU system. I repeat: this has never happened before. Thus, the state, represented by the MoU, has obtained the rights to this product and will now give permission to manufacturers to scale this product. But the fact that state money was invested — it remained with the state,- said Ilya Kostin. Vitryak-M is a detector that scans different ranges of FPV drones, automatically turning on EW systems. -This allows the fighter to know that there is an FPV drone nearby and to turn on the EW only when it is needed, instead of creating a dome curtain that prevents not only the enemy from working, but also us.- - explained the head of the intellectual property department.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/u-minoborony-poyasnyly-zavdannya-novogo-viddilu-z-pytan-intelektualnoyi-vlasnosti/	2024-11-16T03:52:53-08:00

Rustem Umyerov: The Ministry of Defense has created a new system of patenting military technologies	This was reported by the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov. Thanks to this, clear rules of cooperation with Ukrainian and international partners appeared, and innovations are now protected by patents. -The future of war and defense is not only the power of weapons, but also the power of innovation. It is important not only to create new technologies, but also to form a sustainable system that protects and supports their development,- the minister noted. For our partners, this system is a signal that Ukraine is ready for responsible cooperation. Their technologies are protected here, and the support of the defense sector gives them guarantees of development and security. An example of this approach is the patent on Vitryak-M FPV drone detector developed by our Technology Scaling Center. This development helps the Armed Forces to detect enemy drones and warn of their approach. -Thus, patenting is a feeling of protection of our inventors' developments, the confidence of partners and the foundation of a new defense culture, where every discovery becomes a step towards victory,- added Rustem Umyerov.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/rustem-umyerov-minoborony-stvorylo-novu-systemu-patentuvannya-vijskovyh-tehnologij/	2024-11-16T02:02:22-08:00

To implement the plans, the enemy created the -time of heroes- program, which was supposed to select a sufficient number of -veterans- who should have at least a secondary education and desire. However, even such a low level of requirements became an obstacle, because most Russian fighters do not have even the minimum skills for training. As a result, the Russians extended the program for three months due to the critical small number of participants.

In occupied Mariupol, there is a lot of damaged equipment, the Russians are collecting it for repair	This was told by the adviser to the mayor of Mariupol Petro Andryushchenko in airSuspilnogo -On the territory of this combine there is one of the largest repair bases that exists in the territory of the Azov region (these are the Mariupol-Berdyan and Novoazov regions agglomerations)&#8230; Therefore, they no longer bring it (the equipment &#8211; ed.) as before to Novoazovsk or the territory of the Rostov region, but began to repair it directly on territory of Mariupol. And that's why we see what this number is: several units drop by every day. Both tracked and wheeled vehicles,- Petro Andryushchenko said. At the same time, according to him, there is no increase in the number of Russian troops in the temporarily occupied Mariupol, but on the contrary - their decrease. -The Russians currently do not have enough new contract workers to fill all camps (from Mariupol to Berdyansk) by 100%. I am referring to those camps that serve to train units that leave for replenishment, rotations, etc. Currently, these camps are filled with new contract workers by about 70%, and by 30% — those who are assigned to rotation from the front line. This is the first time, because before that the camps were filled to 100%, and those allocated for rotation were located either in the north of the Mariupol district or on the territory of the Ilyich plant. Now the trend is different, and this means that the Russians do not have time to replenish their manpower in accordance with the losses they are suffering,- Petro Andryushchenko summarized. As ArmyInform wrote, in June 2024 the first enemy tanker entered the port of Mariupol since the Russian occupation, probably to provide fuel for military equipment and equipment on the front line.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/v-okupovanomu-mariupoli-bagato-pidbytoyi-tehniky-rosiyany-styaguyut-yiyi-na-remont/	2024-11-16T00:31:15-08:00

The occupiers began to bring military equipment to the Kurakhiv direction by an unusual route	Such observations were shared by the adviser to the mayor of Mariupol Petro Andryushchenko in Efiri Public on Saturday, November 16. -We haven't seen such activity for a long time, at least a year and a half. This activity is quite unusual and sometimes looks chaotic. What is the difference from what was before? We see that all kinds of military equipment (tanks, armored personnel carriers, armored personnel carriers) are being pulled.

Driver drill: the GUR told how Russia solves the problem with the shortage of junior officers	This was reported to the GUR of the MOU. On the basis of civilian higher educational institutions, the aggressor state creates military training centers where basic training of platoon commanders, artillery batteries and deputy company commanders is to be conducted. A junior officer of the enemy army primarily performs the function of an infantry chaser for an assault directly on the battlefield, which explains the high level of casualties and, as a result, the acute shortage of lieutenants in Russia. The Kremlin began to establish a mechanism for training and uninterrupted supply of junior officers for the war against Ukraine in the first year of the full-scale invasion. According to the enemy's plans, by the end of 2024, 33 new military training centers were to be launched in Russia in addition to almost a hundred existing ones. Another activation of leaders in Moscow to drill even more fresh lieutenants shows that the personnel crisis of the command staff of the Russian occupation army is deepening.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/mushtra-pogonychiv-u-gur-rozpovily-yak-rosiya-vyrishuye-problemu-iz-deficzytom-molodshyh-oficzeriv/	2024-11-15T23:13:24-08:00

Transformers go into battle: the British army was offered a new version of a light protected patrol ...	How howled not without advertising bragging representatives of the manufacturing company in a release on their official portal, thanks to the modular design Foxhound is the best vehicle for light infantry and special operations forces during combat missions. The vehicle provides a high level of field-proven protection, reliability and availability, as well as the ability to adapt, ArmiyaInform reports. This project is under development. And as informed by the company General Dynamics Land Systems - Great Britain, which has been operating since 2012, its enterprises previously supplied the British Army with 400 basic Foxhound models (also known under the global brand of General Dynamics Land Systems - -Ocelot-). About these armored vehicles, reporters of our editorial office mentioned in one from defense industry reviews. The Foxhound GMRV is designed to operate in the most challenging environments, demonstrating a combination of protection, mobility and flexibility. Experts of the defense publication Army Recognition, who got acquainted with the new armored vehicle at the Defense Vehicle Dynamics (DVD) arms exhibition held in the British Millbrook in September of this year, announced that its modular design offers a significant advantage in allowing the vehicle to adapt to different mission requirements. The platform can be configured for multiple roles with the help of a newly developed mission module, which provides, according to the machine's developers, -unparalleled operational efficiency-. The GMRV variant includes a highly secure crew compartment with advanced self-defense weapons that can be controlled directly from the inside, ensuring optimal crew safety. In addition, the vehicle's design has been shaped to accommodate a NATO-standard pallet in the rear, offering endless transformative possibilities for integrating complex mission systems. They can include weapons for short-range air defense (SHORAD) and other mission-critical technologies that go beyond the traditional patrol car. By improving protection and firepower while retaining the core capabilities of the original Foxhound, the GMRV is set to be a game changer for military operations. General Dynamics UK is keen to use this new option for both the British Army and international allies, focusing on export opportunities for partners around the world. The vehicle is entirely designed, engineered and manufactured in the United Kingdom, ensuring quality control and compliance with the national defense industrial strategy. The original Foxhound LPPV has long been renowned for its protection and mobility in high-risk environments. This new variant of the GMRV carries on this legacy, but with significant improvements in operational flexibility and modular integration. The ability to seamlessly switch between roles — from patrol to air defense — without the need for a completely different vehicle underscores its value on the modern battlefield. As military forces around the world face increasingly complex operational landscapes, the Foxhound GMRV is poised to offer a solution that can evolve with these changing requirements. With design and manufacturing firmly rooted in the UK, the car is also a testament to its defense capability and commitment to innovation. A total of 52 new GMRV vehicles will be delivered to UK Army units by March 2025, according to a statement from General Dynamics Land Systems - UK.

Battles in the Kursk region: how the artillerymen of the 82nd brigade of the DSHV organized the Kurs...	A key role in the destruction of the forces and means of the Russian Federation in Kurshchyna is played by the artillery of the ZSU, which works almost 24/7. ArmyInform visited units of the 82nd separate amphibious assault Bukovynia brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which are carrying out combat missions in Kurshchyna. The commander of the artillery division, Major Ivan Bakrev, told our correspondents about the first days of the Kursk operation, how artillery calculations manage to destroy military targets of the Russian Federation, what artillery systems are used by our defenders and what is the most difficult part of the artillerymen's work: -In July, we received a combat mission from the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the shortest possible time, planning was carried out, a plan was developed. After that, it was necessary to move the artillery from the concentration area to the future area of ​​combat missions as soon as possible. Artillery was transferred covertly so that the enemy would not find out. One or two cannons at night, so that they did not notice that we were gathering forces here. Before the beginning of the Kursk offensive operation, with the help of aerial reconnaissance, we identified the front edge of the enemy, planned the objects of attack and their detailed fire damage. Everything has been thought through to the smallest detail. The sector of fire of my artillery division was determined. And as further developments showed, the enemy was not ready for this. In the first hours of the offensive of units of our brigade, the enemy was hit by fire. Moreover, it is quite effective, because the enemy retreated, at some points simply ran. Our gunners hit enemy platoon and company strongholds and even individual combat positions very quickly and accurately. The offensive developed quite dynamically. Next, they hit manpower, military equipment, and places of concentration of enemy personnel. The Russians were not given a single chance. Even later, after we started advancing in depth, the enemy did not know where we were exactly. This helped us a lot. Then the enemy began to transfer his reserves. And we, accordingly, destroyed them. They worked in convoys of motor vehicles, where they mainly transported personnel and mortar weapons, hit armored combat vehicles. Our drones very often detected the enemy's field artillery depots. the Russians just accumulated a certain number of shells, and we immediately destroyed them. On the armament of my artillery division is towed artillery. These are Soviet-style D-30 guns (caliber 122 mm) and British M119 howitzers are NATO-style 105 mm. M119 shows good combat capabilities: a very mobile gun, takes up little space, so it is convenient for camouflage and movement. Its most important feature is that it accurately hits the targets. The range of combat use on standard ammunition is 11.7 thousand. m. Also, projectiles can reach the cannon up to 20 km. But the 105-caliber ammunition itself would like better. Unfortunately, it gives few fragments and an impressive effect on the enemy. On the other hand, if working for counter-battery, rockets are a pretty good option. After all, the M119s are located at a short distance from the front edge and, accordingly, they can be used normally at a long range, in the depth of the enemy's battle formations. D-30 cannons are mainly used to destroy the enemy's manpower and firepower located in trenches, trenches, communication passages and strongholds, as well as outside shelters. We also work with them on the accumulation of enemy troops. The effective firing range of these guns is up to 15 km. Here, in Kurshchyna, in the modern conditions of the combat situation, we do not work in the classic version in the composition of platoons and batteries. A reconnaissance fire complex (RVK) is used to destroy the enemy's manpower and equipment. It consists of means of detecting the enemy (quadrocopters, Mavics, outlays, etc. - ed.), artillery means of destruction, and the third element is the management of units, which is carried out during the execution of combat missions. Ideally, this is how it works: there are calculations of UAV operators who conduct reconnaissance of enemy targets and provide through communications means of targeting for use in combat calculations of guns. A fire damage decision is made and boom, shells fly where they need to go. An interesting moment with the movement of the RVC deep into the territory of the Russian Federation. At first, the gunners worked from the border area on targets, then some RVCs remained in their places to cover the units of the airborne assault battalions, and other fire groups have already begun to move deep into the Kursk region. They quickly moved, took up firing positions, disguised themselves and inflicted fire damage. Then, in a chess order, other artillery units that were behind were gradually moved. In this way, it was possible to destroy the enemy quickly, without revealing one's location. At the beginning of the operation, the Starlink system helped us a lot in combat work. This is for general situational awareness, i.e. where the enemy is and transmitting the coordinates of targets to hit them. But Starlink no longer operated on the territory of the Russian Federation. Therefore, there were difficulties with communication, they worked at radio stations. This problem had to be solved as soon as possible. After all, the situation in Kurshchyna was developing quickly and it was necessary to establish cooperation in the battle with other units of the brigade and our neighbors. A system of military communications repeaters of domestic production was deployed. These repeaters then performed quite well in data transmission and situational awareness on the ground. Therefore, already in the process of such intensive hostilities, we solved the issue of communication. There were no problems with the supply of ammunition at all. Art shells were always delivered in plenty. The results of combat work eloquently testify to this. When the enemy performs his actions effectively, I already understand accordingly how I need to improve to reduce his effectiveness. This applies to countering FPV drones, various types of drones, counter-battery. Another important question. Use of EW means against enemy drones. Our priority targets are the enemy's reserves, air defense systems and ROPs, manpower concentrations, combat vehicles used to transport personnel and weapons to the front line. The exact number of enemy vehicles and personnel affected is difficult to determine. Fighting continues. From what is confirmed: our fire groups destroyed five artillery pieces, 4 mortars. This is within the limits of counter-battery only. In terms of manpower and armored vehicles, I can't tell you until the end, because the number of losses of the Rashits is simply huge. We try to destroy the enemy even on the approach to the front edge. We determine in what ways they throw up personnel, plan -meeting points-. The cannons are already aimed at us. If one gun does not have time to work, another joins in the work. The work is very hard, but it is worth it. The other day we discovered about seven or eight enemy armored vehicles. Some cars were driving in a chaotic manner, it was clear that they were lost, while others were moving purposefully. So, in just one day, the consumption of shells on these targets amounted to 270 shells. I think the consumption of ammunition in other artillery units was no less. They worked very powerfully, destroyed everything that moved in our direction. Before the beginning of the Kursk operation, it so happened that in my division, the full-time personnel complement was slightly more than 50%. Completed combat calculations actually from wheels. But the guys who were already here in the art division and those who came to us were very motivated, they all wanted to beat the occupiers on their territory, in a word, they were charged for success. Therefore, those who joined us quickly learned to act as part of calculations, mastered the intricacies of artillery in order to effectively strike the enemy in battle. There is no need to motivate the boys in any way, everyone is conscious and responsible, and most importantly, they are professionals. Personnel training is conducted constantly in concentration areas. If the situation permits, when one gun remains unengaged, the training is conducted by the battery sergeants-majors. We analyze the experience of combat operations, enemy tactics, analyze our shortcomings in combat work. I will give you an example. There are experienced gun commanders in the division who came from other artillery units. And they pleasantly surprised me with their work, their attitude to their duties. So, we give them targets, and they completely perform accurate calculations of data to shoot, adjust fire and, as a result, destroy the enemy and his important objects. Worked with one gun commander who had recently arrived. His guys know everything and are able to do all the necessary measures at firing positions. The main thing: they work exactly according to their goals. Where there is a responsible commander, there is discipline and efficiency. This is very gratifying. Once, enemy FPV drones wanted to hit the cannon of this commander three times. Thanks to the concerted actions of his team, the cannon was kept in operational condition and the soldiers themselves survived. The howitzer was well camouflaged. Countering enemy drones in general is key right now. Well done guys! The hardest part, unfortunately, was the loss of our personnel. The Kursk operation is very hard daily combat work. It's not easy here. At the beginning, of course, there were constant worries and sleepless nights. It was necessary to effectively establish a system of combat control and communication deployment. It was very difficult for the personnel at the firing positions in the Kursk region. There, gunners work at their maximum. Plus, the correct choice of fire positions, adjustment of moments for logistical support. There was a lot of useful information for us. Taking into account the experience of combat operations, we -entrusted- some points in preparation, in the general conduct of combat operations, as well as in the construction of battle orders: what to include in this battle order, what to add, and what, for example, we do not need and the like.

Loss of a combatant's ID card: how to restore it	ArmiyaInform tells how to restore the document. Currently, there are several options for obtaining a new ID. If we are talking about an active serviceman, then a report to the commander of the military unit is required. If you are released from military service, you should contact the TCC and SP in which you are registered. You can also contact the Ministry of Veterans, if you received the status of UBD through the interdepartmental commission created under this ministry. Certain documents must also be attached to the report or application. The type of report, as well as which documents need to be attached to it, depends on the circumstances. In such a case, the following documents should be attached to the report: This happens periodically, taking into account the realities of military life. So, if the certificate has become unusable, then the following documents are attached to the report: This also happens from time to time, because no one and nothing is safe from shelling. So, if the certificate was destroyed, first of all, an official investigation should be conducted in the area. And on its basis, recovery will be carried out. You will only need to submit two 3 x 4 cm color photo cards on matte paper. Samples of all three types of reports can be found here. Also, ArmyInform has already written about how to UBD status, at what benefits can a combatant expect and how to use these preferences.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/vtrata-posvidchennya-uchasnyka-bojovyh-dij-yak-vidnovyty/	2024-11-15T20:28:12-08:00
propaganda spreads a fake video calling for a fight against the DPRK military	This animated video is about Ukraine's victory over the Mongol-Tatars. And the emphasis is on the phrase -They were able to then! We can do it now!-. However, this is a fake, reports by Gwara Media. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine did not make any videos with appeals to fight against the North Korean military. The characters in the video are stock artwork that anyone can download to use in their animations. Moreover, such animated characters had already been used by propagandists earlier in a video that was distributed in the Russian segment of the Internet at the end of January 2024. At that time, Ukrainian farmers were offered to -send their roosters to the front- to make them combat fighters. Cartoon animation is voiced by a female voice recorded with the help of Google Translate. The fake number is also indicated by the incorrect number of the Ministry of Defense hotline. With such videos, the enemy tries to ridicule Ukrainians and discredit the Defense Forces of Ukraine. And also to sow fear about the possible participation of Korean military personnel in the war.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/rospropaganda-rozganyaye-fejkove-video-iz-zaklykamy-shhodo-borotby-z-vijskovymy-kndr/	2024-11-15T20:11:07-08:00

In order to get to the territory of the -lnr-, people have to go through a long filtering process	This reports the head of Luhansk OVA Artem Lysogor. The vast majority of people do not pass these checks. In addition, FSB employees recently began to warn all men about urgent military registration and ask for their consent to enter into a contract with the Russian army. Personal data of those who refuse are entered in a separate list. Before the large-scale invasion, the residents of Staro Bil, like other residents of the free Luhansk region, received hundreds of public services either online or within a few minutes at the National Center for Public Health. In the territories occupied by Russia, digitization takes place only on paper. And the more pieces of paper, the better. Therefore, an extract from the relevant register is not enough to receive a certificate of family composition. To confirm the number of people living at the specified address, you should bring neighbors who must certify this in writing, if, of course, they want to help for free.

Ukrainian FPV drones have passed tests for resistance to enemy EW	This was reported by the Deputy Prime Minister for Innovation, Education, Science and Technology. Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine Mykhailo Fedorov. The tests took place during the DEMO DAY training ground, organized with the support of the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Andrii Lebedenko. Drones from 20 development teams took part in the testing. The drones were checked on a 6-kilometer area with the active operation of EW devices. As Mykhailo Fedorov pointed out, EW-resistant drones demonstrate the ability to fly to the target and perform combat tasks, which is critically important for increasing the effectiveness of strikes on the front. -Enemy EW is one of the main problems on the battlefield: it can stop our drones or prevent them from completing their missions. The creation of REB-resistant drones is a breakthrough that will significantly increase the number of successful operations,- the minister emphasized. A video of the tests is available for viewing, which shows how the drones cope with the impact of enemy EW systems. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukraine has become one from the world capitals in the field of drone technology and now offers its experience to Europe as a foundation for European security.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/ukrayinski-fpv-drony-projshly-vyprobuvannya-na-stijkist-do-vorozhogo-reb/	2024-11-15T11:17:25-08:00

20 billion hryvnias for food for the Armed Forces: new tenders for 2025 have been announced	About this informs the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. -Providing the military with adequate nutrition is not only a matter of health and comfort, but also a factor that directly affects the morale and combat effectiveness of our defenders. We must provide servicemen with high-quality and varied food, in particular by improving its quality and implementing modern standards and the latest technologies. We continue to improve all aspects of rear support so that the army has everything it needs to effectively carry out combat missions,- said Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. Currently, tenders are announced according to the current model: the supplier independently determines the manufacturers of goods for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. At the same time, to improve the quality of products and strengthen control, the new contract already provides for a number of changes: detailing product descriptions, expanding the scope of audits and inspections, updating transportation requirements, revising fines, etc. Subsequently, it is planned to announce procurement for the new pilot procurement model, which was presented in September 2024. Framework agreements have already been announced this week for signal bidding for producers in certain categories, namely: vegetables and fruits, sausage products, meat, dairy products and fish. It is these categories of goods that have been selected as requiring increased attention in terms of quality. The pilot supply project will operate simultaneously with the current model in 2025 in five oblasts: Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Cherkasy and Kirovohrad. Currently, the DOT is selecting counterparties for further qualification and holding, in fact, signal auctions, which are scheduled for mid-December. -This year, we are announcing purchases in advance, as early as November, to ensure continuity of supply for military personnel. The current logistics model is well-established, familiar and understandable to market participants, so it remains primarily in areas where the collision line passes. At the same time, the -pilot- has a number of advantages, which will allow to increase the quality control of goods and direct contact directly with producers,- said Halyna Litosh, director of the food program of the DOT. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine strengthens cooperation with manufacturers and suppliers of physical support for the Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/20-milyardiv-gryven-na-harchuvannya-dlya-zsu-ogolosheno-novi-tendery-na-2025-rik/	2024-11-15T05:44:50-08:00
There is no threat of an invasion of Chernihiv Oblast, there was no breach of the border - CPD	This was reported by the head of the Center for Combating Disinformation, officer of the Defense Forces Andriy Kovalenko. He noted that the Russians did not even cross the destroyed bridge from the border, so the information was a lie from the beginning. He also reminded that in June a very similar story happened with Ryzhivka in Sumy Oblast. -Someone appeared somewhere, took down the flag and ran away. There is no threat of an invasion of Chernihiv Oblast. There is an extremely limited threat of the DRG,- said Andriy Kovalenko. He emphasized that the story about Gremyach is false and is exclusively an information operation of the enemy. -At the same time, after such an informative story with Ryzhivka, the enemy lost Suzha in Kurshchyna,- Andriy Kovalenko recalled.

The Ministry of Defense explained whether a driver's license can be revoked for failure to appear on...	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. In practice, a driver's license cannot be revoked due to such non-appearance. However, the law provides for the following: Temporary restriction of the right to drive can be applied to citizens who evade military duty only by a court decision. For this: The procedure for filing a lawsuit must include a detailed description of the requirements that must be met and documentary evidence of the citizen's evasion of duties. After considering the lawsuit, the court makes a decision on the temporary restriction of the right to drive transport only on condition of confirmation of the fact of evasion and non-fulfillment of military duty by a citizen. Therefore, the decision on the temporary restriction of driver's license is made only after the case is considered in court and upon confirmation of the violation of the requirements for the performance of military duty. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/u-minoborony-poyasnyly-chy-mozhut-pozbavyty-vodijskyh-prav-za-neyavku-za-povistkoyu/	2024-11-15T05:18:44-08:00

As reported ArmyInform, Russia is forced to raise large forces for air defense and other military infrastructure to maintain control over the temporary occupied Crimea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/u-bilshosti-vypadkiv-100-bude-znyshheno-v-rosiyi-zrozumily-neefektyvnist-kalibriv/	2024-11-15T00:52:21-08:00
It turned out to be a canned mole: the detained commander of one of the units of the SSO	This is stated in message of the SBU. The attacker turned out to be a lieutenant colonel, commander of one of the units of the Special Operations Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who was recruited by the occupiers even before the start of a large-scale war. In the spring of 2024, it was remotely -activated- by a personnel employee of the Russian game and defined the task: to transfer the plans of combat operations of the Defense Forces behind enemy lines to the Russians. The aggressor was most interested in intelligence about sabotage and reconnaissance raids by Ukrainian special forces behind the front line in the Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Crimean directions. To carry out the enemy's task, the -mole- used his official position, thanks to which he received information about the planned routes of movement of the soldiers of the Defense Forces, their weapons and -targets-. The occupiers planned to use this information to eliminate Ukrainian special forces on the front line or outside its borders - in the temporarily captured part of the territory in the south of Ukraine. Also, the agent -leaked- data on other units of the Defense Forces to his Russian curator. As a result of the special operation, the military counter-intelligence of the SBU gradually documented the traitor's crimes and arrested him. At the same time, comprehensive measures were taken to secure the locations of the Defense Forces. According to the investigation, the person involved was recruited by the military intelligence of the Russian Federation through his acquaintances in Russia, with whom he maintained contact. During the searches, conspiratorial means of communication, computer equipment, a mobile phone and data storage devices were seized from the detainee. The investigators of the Security Service informed him of the suspicion under part 2 of Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The perpetrator is in custody. He faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/vyyavyvsya-rozkonservovanym-krotom-zatrymanyj-komandyr-odnogo-z-pidrozdiliv-sso/	2024-11-15T00:36:15-08:00

This was told by the commander of the Achilles unmanned aerial systems battalion on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- Captain Yury Fedorenko of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the Kosh chieftain Ivan Sirk. — There is an algorithm, I will not tell the general public about it. This is always difficult, but it is achieved through negotiations and tactics on the battlefield, directly taking control of this or that representative who is in the form of a -pixel- but unknown to you, he said. The military man emphasized that the insidious tactic of dressing up in the enemy's military uniform is not new for the Russian military. — This tactic for the enemy is not new. It is used by them from other wars in which the Russian Federation took part, the officer said. The commander of the drones explained the main goal of the invaders. - In the last year, we can watch quite richly when the enemy wears a -pixel- and tries to infiltrate into our rear communications in order to sow chaos in the rear and introduce the maximum imbalance as possible, - said Yuriy Fedorenko. However, occupiers who are -red- in the -pixel- are detected quite effectively. - We know the [enemy's] tactics, so such cases are becoming fewer and fewer every day. Systematic work in order to distinguish between -own and foreign- is carried out and sufficiently well implemented in the Defense Forces. It will be different in each aspect, for the sake of truth, but the vast majority of commanders clearly understand and are aware of how it should be done and how to teach the personnel to distinguish between -own and foreign-, - emphasized the commander of -Achilles-. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that under the cover of thick fog, the Russians managed to penetrate to the outskirts of Kupyansk, but all armored vehicles and infantry the enemy landing force in the city destroyed the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/ryadzheni-u-piksel-perevdyagnutyh-v-ukrayinsku-formu-okupantiv-efektyvno-vyyavlyayut-na-poli-boyu/	2024-11-15T00:21:34-08:00
The Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Justice returned almost 3,500 hectares of land and real ...	About this notified in the MOU. The violation was discovered during the systematic monitoring of state registers. To restore legal rights to property, the Main Department of Defense Lands and Funds of the Ministry of Defense sent more than 15 complaints to the Ministry of Justice. As a result of their consideration, the illegal registration actions were canceled, and the land plots returned to the disposal of the defense department. -Protection of state property is one of our priorities. We are making every effort to prevent the illegal alienation of defense lands and other military property belonging to Ukraine. Together with the Ministry of Justice, we are actively working to guarantee the return of these assets to the state,- said Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. The head of the Anti-Raiding Office of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine, Ivan Korodyuk, emphasized that the return of state property, especially defense lands, is a fundamental issue for the protection of Ukraine's national interests in the face of Russia's ongoing armed aggression. -We pay special attention to the consideration of complaints regarding registration actions that could lead to illegal alienation of state assets. The Ministry of Justice, together with the Ministry of Defense, actively uses all available legal mechanisms to return property to the state. We stand guard over the interests of the Ukrainian people and will not allow anyone to seize state resources contrary to the law,- Ivan Korodyuk stressed. Previously, the Ministry of Defense, together with the State Geocadaster, restored the state's rights to 69 land plots illegally removed from the state fund. 30 of them were returned thanks to cooperation with the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine. The Ministry of Defense continues to cooperate with the Ministry of Justice to protect state interests and prevent illegal removal of property from state ownership.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/minoborony-ta-minyust-povernuly-derzhavi-majzhe-3500-gektariv-zemel-ta-obyekty-neruhomosti/	2024-11-15T00:14:05-08:00

According to Andrii Demchenko, the activity of enemy sabotage and intelligence groups has now decreased, but the enemy has not given up attempts to penetrate. They cross the border most often in Sumshchyna. -All units of different components of the defense forces act together. They use various technical means and surveillance of local areas and unmanned aerial vehicles in order to timely expose such groups and knock them out of our territory,- said Andriy Demchenko.

This was told by the commander of the Achilles unmanned aerial systems battalion on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- Captain Yury Fedorenko of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the Kosh chieftain Ivan Sirk. — The defense forces, in a united and coordinated work, manage to significantly destroy the enemy's shock-assault potential. In one of the landings, its length is up to 200 meters, 139 occupants were killed during a certain period of time, he said. The military emphasized that such losses of the occupiers are completely disproportionate to the minor tactical successes they manage to achieve. — Now the plantings are very clearly visible, because the leaves have fallen. Imagine what the enemy is suffering while trying to achieve tactical results and tactical successes on the battlefield. The losses are disproportionate to the results the enemy got, the officer emphasized. It should be noted that in the calculation carried out, it is only about the bodies of those dead enemy soldiers that the occupiers did not manage to evacuate. The number of wounded is also not taken into account. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that under the cover of thick fog, the Russians managed to penetrate to the outskirts of Kupyansk, but all armored vehicles and infantry the enemy in the city was destroyed by the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/skilky-rosiyan-gyne-v-lisoposadczi-kilkist-vorozhyh-trupiv-na-200-metriv-porahuvaly-u-sylah-oborony/	2024-11-14T23:52:49-08:00
The Navy of the Ukrainian Armed Forces told how the Russians collect resources for their defense in ...	This was told by the spokesman of the Armed Forces Navy, captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk on the air -Public Radio-. Dmytro Pletenchuk noted that in connection with this, the Russians are even diverting resources from other directions, trying to protect their strategic infrastructure in Crimea. -They constantly, especially before the period of storms, maximize all means. These are hydrotechnical structures, these are pontoons, these are various extensions. Last year, for example, 10 to 14 ships and boats were guarding the bridge at the same time. Now there are zero of them. They translate that into the aerial component,- he said. According to him, for defense against unmanned boats, the occupiers use, for example, helicopters, first of all. Because they have approximately the same speed and, accordingly, it is easier to patrol such an area on them than on an airplane. Ukrainian troops also continue to work actively to block Russian warships trying to pass through the Kerch Strait. Although Ukraine has officially closed the area to civilian shipping, Russian ports on the Sea of ​​Azov continue to operate, providing international trade. Ukraine, in turn, does not touch civilian vessels that comply with international standards. -This is also an important case, which for some reason is not often mentioned. But trading ports, for example, in the same Temryuk, in Azov, continue to work. Yes, the occupied ports of Berdyansk and Mariupol are illegal, as are the Crimean ports, of course, but those ports on Azov, which officially belong to the Russian Federation, continue international trade. And you see, we do not touch the civilian vessels that enter there. Although it is actually the Kerch Strait, it is officially closed by Ukraine, which had the right to do so,- Dmytro Pletenchuk said. As reported by ArmyInform, the ships of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation >do not enter the waters of the Black Sea due to a number of factors, the enemy uses only aviation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/u-vms-zsu-rozpovily-yak-rosiyany-styaguyut-resursy-dlya-svogo-zahystu-v-okupovanomu-krymu/	2024-11-14T23:35:04-08:00

Up to 70 magnetic -strays- per night: remote mining from a UAV is carried out by -Achilles-	About how mines with magnetic sensors work on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyvi- the commander of the unit told Captain Yury Fedorenko. — This -stray- is not new at all. It was conditionally secret for a very long time, but after certain events that took place, the enemy already understands what we apply, what we use. Therefore, we have come out of the shadows and are already collecting on it officially. It's very simple, he said. The military emphasized how important remote mining is for destroying the enemy. — The amount of equipment the opponent has &lt;&#8230;&gt; it is necessary to stop not only FPV drones, night bombers, means of fire influence - guns, anti-tank means. Mining itself plays a very significant role, the officer emphasized. The commander of the drones explained how explosive devices with magnetic sensors work. — Dangerous zones are irradiated, in particular, due to the use of unmanned systems, so as not to risk engineers, sappers, and people. For this, it is necessary to have a certain sensor, which then comes into action when a lightly armored, armored vehicle or just something made of metal passes by, he explained. Yuriy Fedorenko reported how much one sensor costs and how many mines Achilles drones can set per night. — One sensor costs 1,200 hryvnias. Sometimes we can deliver up to 70 min per night. It happens differently. You can calculate the cost yourself, but it is very effective in terms of efficiency, he said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that The defense forces reliably control tank-dangerous areas in the north of Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/do-70-magnitnyh-pryblud-za-nich-dystanczijne-minuvannya-z-bpla-zdijsnyuye-ahilles/	2024-11-14T23:19:56-08:00

Shampoo -Strength of Victory- and sweater -Last Ukrainian-: Russians talk about non-existent goods	However, this is a photo fake. Such a shampoo has never been sold in Ukraine and is not being sold. However, this does not prevent enemy couch potatoes from taking advantage of Ukrainians because of this. Presumably, the image of the shampoo was taken in a photo editor. Fakeness is indicated, in particular, by the lack of information about the manufacturer, as well as a strange description of the product. After all, it is the Russians who most often use the name of Stepan Bandera in their anti-Ukrainian propaganda. The phrase -bandera spirit- is a typical example of this. This is not the first time Russians have tried to -make fun- of allegedly Ukrainian goods that have never been in Ukraine. Yes, before the New Year holidays last year, they spread information that sweaters with the inscription -last Ukrainian- were sold in Ukraine. In fact, these photo fakes are elements to promote hostile narratives. -Power of Victory- in the form of shampoo is an attempt to mock the unity of Ukrainians and their desire to win over the aggressor.

From the F-16 veto to the supply of 16 of the latest combat vehicles: Ukrainian experience is taken ...	How important it is to receive F-16 for a country from outside NATO, the example of Bulgaria allows us to understand - a country that joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization two decades ago, but still does not have F-16 fighters in service. About how Bulgaria initiated the purchase of the F-16 Fighting Falcon five years ago, and now is in a hurry to get the Fighting Falcons from Ukraine at least until the end of 2025, ArmiyaInform tells. Bulgarian F-16 Block 70 first successful test flight on October 24, 2024 (Video: Lockheed Martin) F-16 acquisition is difficult among several reasons These include obtaining appropriate approvals, the need to train pilots and support personnel, and to prepare and secure the appropriate infrastructure. It is also necessary to allocate considerable funds from the state budget for the purchase and maintenance of aircraft. It is also necessary to find on the market free F-16s of the latest modifications or combat vehicles suitable for modernization with a flight resource preserved at a level sufficient to justify modernization. The most optimal option, of course, is to purchase new fighters directly from the manufacturer, but the backlog of orders is drawn up for years, so it will not be possible to do this quickly. Moreover, during the execution of the order, circumstances may arise that will force the manufacturer to postpone the previously planned delivery time of combat aircraft by months or even years. This is exactly what happened with the first F-16 Fighting Falcon order, which Bulgaria made back in July 2019. Bulgaria then concluded an agreement to purchase eight F-16s of the latest Block 70 modification, six single-seat and two two-seat fighters. In addition, the contract provided for the purchase of regular aviation ammunition, equipment and spare parts for aircraft, as well as the training of Bulgarian pilots. The value of the 2019 F-16 purchase agreement was $1.265 billion, making it the largest military purchase in Bulgaria's history since the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact Organization. Then, in order to conclude the agreement, the members of the People's Assembly of Bulgaria, the Bulgarian parliament, had to overcome a veto from Bulgarian President Rumen Radev. He motivated his decision by the lack of public consensus on equipment, as well as the fact that the order did not provide for the receipt of a full set of regular F-16 weapons. As a former military pilot, Rumen Radev knew what he was talking about, because due to the desire to reduce the astronomical amount for the Bulgarian state budget, the initial plans had to be revised and limited to the purchase of only part of the equipment and ammunition. Then, as Andrii Haruk reports in the book -Fighting Falcon. History of the F-16-, Bulgaria was forced to abandon the purchase of guided aerial bombs in favor of conventional ones, purchase only two AN/AAQ-33 Sniper ATP sighting pods, and purchase only 12 AIM-9X and 13 AIM-12OC-7 missiles. An equally important role in determining the position of Rumen Radev was played by the pro-Russian orientation of that part of the Bulgarian political system, which tried to oppose the further integration of Bulgaria into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In any case, Bulgaria failed to receive the first F-16 fighters from the 2019 order on time - by the end of 2023. The execution of the contract was postponed until the end of 2025. Judging by everything, one of the reasons that led to the postponement of the contract, in addition to the corona crisis and the failure with the supply of components, was played by the large-scale attack of the Russian Federation on Ukraine. Already in November 2022, Bulgaria concluded a second contract, according to which it is envisaged to purchase eight additional F-16 Fighting Falcon Block 70 - this time four one- and two-seat fighters each. The delivery of aircraft under this contract will begin in 2027. The second contract is similar in amount, but its terms are somewhat more favorable for Bulgaria. Judging by everything, the Bulgarians were able to get better conditions primarily due to the postponement of the implementation of the first agreement. In particular, under the new agreement, the Bulgarians were able to acquire additional spare parts, engines, radar stations, targeting containers, as well as guided aerial bombs and an additional batch of air-to-air missiles. Russia's large-scale attack on Ukraine significantly intensified the country's activities within NATO, affected the political situation in Bulgaria and affected the position of Bulgarian politicians. September 13, 2024 President of Bulgaria Rumen Radev made a demonstration flight on the F-16 fighter. He spoke highly of the combat vehicle's flying qualities, recalled his experience as a military pilot and his first flight on the Combat Falcon in 2005 shortly after Bulgaria joined NATO. The President of Bulgaria also noted the fruitful cooperation between the Air Force of Bulgaria and the United States of America, in particular regarding the training of Bulgarian pilots to master the latest advanced tactics and methods of combat use of military aviation. Separately, Rumen Radev emphasized the importance of Bulgaria receiving F-16 Fighting Falcon Block 70 fighters, which will allow the country's Air Force to overcome the limitations of outdated Soviet equipment. On October 24, 2024, Lockheed Martin announced the successful flight of the first Bulgarian F-16 Block 70 fighter. During it, a test pilot checked the combat vehicle and certified its readiness for operation. This became a significant event for Bulgaria, witnessing the further strengthening of the country's defense ties with NATO, as well as a step that allows not only to catch up, but also in the future to try to overtake Ukraine in the acquisition of F-16 Fighting Falcon fighters. This will be possible due to the fact that Bulgaria will receive today's latest modification of the Block 70 Combat Falcons directly from the manufacturer. Ukraine will be able to maintain its primacy in the development of the F-16 only thanks to the acquired experience and the purchase of the latest combat vehicles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/vid-veto-na-f-16-do-postachannya-16-novitnih-bojovyh-mashyn-ukrayinskyj-dosvid-vrahovuyut-u-bolgariyi/	2024-11-14T21:03:41-08:00
More deadly and environmentally friendly: new shells have been prepared for Leopards and Abrams	How stated in the presentation release of this Düsseldorf-based manufacturer, the Neo cartridge is intended to counteract modern technologies of armored protection, ArmiyaInform reports. KE2020 Neo (Enhanced Kinetic Energy, eKE), defined by their manufacturer as enhanced kinetic energy (eKE) projectiles, represent the latest innovation in Rheinmetall's kinetic energy (KE) ammunition series. Utilizing decades of design experience from a well-known German manufacturer, these 120mm x 570 caliber ammunitions feature a high-strength tungsten penetrator designed to defeat the latest defense systems with increased penetration. The experts of the defense publication Army Recognition announces that Rheinmetall's KE series of projectiles has been significantly improved over the initial DM13 model. It was followed by the DM23 in the 1980s, then the DM33, and later improved versions such as the DM53 and DM63, designed to meet the needs of the upgraded Leopard 2 A6 tank. Separately, it is noted that the latest cartridge continues the evolution of a series of projectiles such as the DM63, which has been updated to meet the strict European REACh environmental regulations. These changes ensure compliance with safety standards for the environment without compromising combat effectiveness. The DM73 is currently the most advanced munition in the series, used by the Bundeswehr alongside the L55A1 high-pressure gun. The official qualification contract signed in September 2020 between the Bundeswehr Federal Office for Equipment, Information Technology and Internal Support (BAAINBw) and Rheinmetall Waffe Munition GmbH underlines Rheinmetall's leading position in smoothbore and tank weapon technology. Rheinmetall's 120 mm smoothbore technology, including the Rh120 guns and ammunition family, became the NATO standard for main battle tanks such as the Leopard 2 and M1 Abrams, and was integrated into the Challenger 3 tank, improving its combat capabilities. In addition to qualifying munitions, cooperation between Rheinmetall, Germany and Great Britain is progressing towards the modernization of tank munitions in NATO forces. This partnership, including the British Army's Challenger 3 and Germany's Leopard 2 platforms, aims to standardize ammunition types between NATO members, improving interoperability. This agreement not only strengthens Rheinmetall's position in tank weapons technology, but also opens the door to future cooperation with other NATO allies, creating important export opportunities for Rheinmetall and its partners in the UK. The new KE 2020 Neo rounds will also support the Challenger 3 upgrade programme, where a smoothbore gun will replace the Challenger 2 rifled gun. This change brings the British tank into line with standard NATO configurations, with full combat capability expected by 2030. Ammunition is planned to be prepared by that time. How ArmyInform reported, in July of this year, the German company Rheinmetall received the first order from the Ukrainian government for the construction of an ammunition production plant in Ukraine. Plans to build the plant were announced in February 2024. The order for the Rheinmetall technology group covers the complete technical equipment of the plant up to commissioning.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/bilsh-smertonosni-ta-ekologichni-dlya-leopardiv-ta-abramsiv-pidgotuvaly-novi-snaryady/	2024-11-14T20:55:55-08:00
The story of Taras, a soldier of the ZSU: in Spain, he sunk the yacht of a Russian official, now he ...	Why did he decide to sink the yacht of the head of Rosoboronexport? But is it difficult to work with the Bradley engine? He told ArmyInform about this: -At the time of the large-scale invasion, I was working in Spain as a senior mechanic on the yacht Lady Anastasia.- The salary was $250 per day. At that time, I had only one desire: to earn a good amount of money in order to secure my pension and return to Ukraine and become a grandfather here. In the first days of the invasion, I saw on video how a rocket hit a high-rise building on Lobanovskyi Street in Kyiv&#8230; Then I finally made the decision that it cannot be like this anymore and something must be done. I decided to sink the yacht I was working on. Why did I decide to sink this particular yacht? Because its owner - Oleksandr Aleksandrovich Mikheev - is the head of the Russian company Rosoboronexport. And it is precisely he who is involved in the production of missiles that fly at us. I am a senior mechanic, I have 24-hour access to the engine room. I opened the Kingston to sink the yacht. Water went into the engine room&#8230; But we still had three crew members on board the ship: our boys from Odessa. And here, as they say, -the countrymen helped-: they started to make noise that, they say, we will lose our jobs&#8230; Well, they notified the local police. The repair crew from the port brought a trailer with a huge pump, they managed to block the Kingston, which I opened. It was not possible to sink the yacht, but I did sink it well. She was then arrested and is still standing in the port of Hadrian motionless. That is, disabled. In general, this is a super yacht, 50 meters long, it has luxury cabins, salons&#8230; Of course I was arrested. Detained, or rather. They brought me to the police station, where I had to wait for the trial. But the judge made a decision: there was no damage to the Spanish side, so there is no legal reason to detain me, and I can go home. When I made this story in Spain, I said to myself: what is this job for me, if I may not have a country? Therefore, I can say to everyone: first, let's defend our country, and then we will think about our own business, about our own interests. &#8230;When I already entered Ukraine, I was accompanied by Roman Ratushny. This is our hero, he died in the 22nd year. Kyiv activist. My son's friend. My son, by the way, also serves in the Defense Forces. And on March 1, I came to the Dnipro TCC. And now I have been serving here for 2.5 years, repairing military equipment. I will be 58 soon. Now, if all the spare parts are available, on average I spend 5-6 days to issue one high-pressure fuel pump for the UTD-20 engine. Why so long? Because I do a complete overhaul, that is, I disassemble the pump to the last cog. In parallel with these tasks, I also worked on fuel pumps for the -Kamazov- engine, which is on the BTR-80. I have already repaired the Bradley: I repaired the fuel equipment. It is interesting, more complicated than the classical principle of fuel equipment. The engine in the -Bradley- is an ordinary V-shaped, eight-cylinder, four-stroke engine, like all engines, there is nothing particularly cosmic about it. The Bradley engine is comparable to the KamAZ, although the American one is a little bigger, a little more complex, and much better quality. &#8230;I will tell you this: at the age of 50 or more, you can both live and serve. And it even needs to be done, someone who has a specialty, who has a profession, can help with repairs and some other help. Guys, help our army, help our country, because don't bring it, Lord, we will lose it. Therefore, I call on everyone to defend.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/istoriya-voyina-zsu-tarasa-v-ispaniyi-prytopyv-yahtu-rosijskogo-chynovnyka-nyni-remontuye-amerykanski-bredli/	2024-11-14T20:22:57-08:00

Ukraine trains specialists for environmental audit of post-war territories	notifies the Main Administration of Mine Action, Civil Defense and Environmental Security. In particular, 20 representatives of the Department of Environmental Safety of the State Administration of Mine Action, Civil Protection and Environmental Safety, as well as the Center of Excellence in Mine Action and Environmental Safety continue to undergo advanced training courses at the State Environmental Academy of Postgraduate Education. During training for future military environmental auditors, Colonel Oleg Shuvarskyi, head of the Mine Action Department, spoke about the direct and indirect consequences of humanitarian demining on the environment. According to him, humanitarian demining is carried out in accordance with national and international standards with the aim of minimizing the impact of harmful substances on the environment. -Explosive ordnance can pose a threat for decades after the end of active hostilities, posing a long-term risk to the environment and human health. Ammunition explosions can lead to soil contamination with toxic substances, such as heavy metals, chemical components of explosives, which limit soil fertility and endanger the lives of the population,- said Colonel Oleg Shuvarskyi. Upon completion of the courses, future specialists will be able to conduct environmental audits, draw up acts in accordance with EU legislation, and also determine the possibility of using territories free of explosives for agriculture and other sectors of the economy. As reported by ArmyInform, a course was held in Kyiv Results-oriented management in mine action-, organized by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/14/ukrayina-gotuye-fahivcziv-dlya-ekologichnogo-audytu-pislyavoyennyh-terytorij/	2024-11-14T11:43:07-08:00

Defense forces destroyed 2 enemy tanks, 3 armored fighting vehicles, 5 artillery systems, 10 vehicles, 6 special equipment units, 54 unmanned aerial vehicles. In Vovchansk, hostilities continue within the city limits. - Battles are taking place throughout the city and the surrounding area. Ukrainian troops are controlling the situation, the fighting continues, the military officer said. Almost no civilian population remained in the city. - There is no civilian population there, just as there is no surviving building. The enemy is trying to move towards the village of Staritsa, Yevhenii Romanov said. Near Vovchansk, the occupiers targeted the settlement of Staritsa, which opens the road to Kharkiv. — This direction is very important, as it is the road to Kharkiv. The enemy should not get there under any circumstances, the officer emphasized. Also, the Russians do not abandon their intention to capture Liptsi. — Servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other components of the Defense Forces are also defending there. This direction is reliably controlled by Ukrainian defenders, the lieutenant colonel assured. The military explained the importance of maintaining control over Liptsi. — This is the approach to Kharkiv, which gives the enemy the opportunity to deploy artillery positions and shell the city with barrel artillery. But it must be understood that the positions of the barrel artillery, which are deployed, are also vulnerable. This, of course, should not be allowed, but any artillery, as well as any other enemy forces that appear, are immediately destroyed by the fire of Ukrainian weapons, Yevgeny Romanov explained. Yesterday, after a long break, the Russians resorted to the use of armored vehicles. — The difference from previous days was that the enemy used armored vehicles, including tanks and armored vehicles. Before that, he advanced exclusively with infantry forces - small infantry groups that advanced in the dark, under the cover of rain or fog, so that they would not be noticed by Ukrainian intelligence. They could not [achieve success, so] they decided to throw armored vehicles into battle. She remained on the battlefield, the spokesman said.

In the TOT of southern and eastern Ukraine, the Russians conducted a series of raids on villages with the aim of seizing Ukrainian satellite equipment as -unlicensed-. In reality, the occupiers are depriving the residents of television broadcasting as part of the fight against alternative sources of information. Instead, the enemy is giving away satellite equipment for free within the framework of the -Russian world- project (the name of the Kremlin's Nazi ideology, which involves a belief in the uniqueness of the Russian nation and its supremacy over other peoples). That is why equipment is seized from those who refuse to take Russian equipment. Earlier ArmyInform reported , that the Russians will build a training ground in Luhansk, where they will train young people to operate UAVs.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/14/vorog-konfiskuye-ukrayinske-suputnykove-obladnannya-u-meshkancziv-tot/	2024-11-14T10:57:50-08:00

Russian airlines are in a steep rush due to the threat of bankruptcy	About this reports the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Due to restrictions on currency settlements, the Russian authorities allowed air carriers to transfer funds to special accounts in rubles, but foreign lessors do not accept such payments due to non-compliance with the terms of the contracts. As a result, the companies stopped paying debts, and the released funds were directed to support the technical suitability of the aircraft fleet, the cost of which has increased significantly due to sanctions restrictions. The government of the Russian Federation allowed to write off debts for payments in 2025, but according to current tax rules, these amounts will still be subject to a 25% income tax, which air carriers will not be able to pay. The possible bankruptcy of small and medium-sized Russian airlines will have serious consequences for the aviation industry and the Russian economy in general. It is about reducing the availability of air transportation, reducing the level of their safety, losing jobs and reducing the investment attractiveness of the industry. The increase in the tax burden in the context of the Russian government's measures to fill the budget due to the war against Ukraine is a systemic factor that is gradually destroying various sectors of the Russian economy. We remind you that the cost of loans is rapidly increasing in the Russian Federation and inflationary processes are accelerating, which is inevitable ->approaches the economic crisis in the country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/14/rosijski-aviakompaniyi-v-krutomu-pike-cherez-zagrozu-bankrutstva/	2024-11-14T10:08:26-08:00

The head of the planning department of the 13th brigade of operational assignment -Charter- told about this on the air of the -Kyiv 24- TV channel Lieutenant Colonel Anton Baev of the National Guard of Ukraine. — The operational situation of the defense brigade's strip in the north of Kharkiv Oblast remains unchanged - under control. Over the past day, no enemy assaults have been recorded, he said. Currently, there is no significant accumulation of enemy forces and assets in the section of the battle line north of Kharkiv. — We are not recording a large accumulation now, as it was a couple of weeks ago. This, first of all, is due to the deterioration of weather conditions in Kharkiv Oblast. We see that now Kharkiv Oblast is covered with snow, the officer said. Despite the fact that the Russians do not use armored vehicles in the north of the Kharkiv region, the fighters of the Defense Forces are in constant readiness to repel enemy armored assaults. - As for the use of equipment, the enemy's tactics remain unchanged for the time being: movement and actions in general by small assault groups. Armored vehicles are currently not in use and do not travel, but we see trends along the entire front line and we are constantly preparing, the military assured. Charter fighters pay special attention to identifying and destroying the enemy at the stage of accumulation and concentration, including on the territory of the Russian Federation. — We are starting to hit equipment across the border, because we see that we need to destroy those armored groups that are kept by the enemy for reserve or for assault. It is necessary to work at the stage of their concentration and accumulation. In our country, this happens mainly across the state border of Ukraine, that is, it is necessary to search, identify and destroy. We are doing this little by little so that it will be easier later, the guardsman emphasized. Thanks to coordinated combat operations, the enemy has no success in the north of Kharkiv Oblast. — The adversary does not stop trying, constantly tries to carry out some accumulations, advances in order to acquire the potential to go into offensive actions. We see all movements, most premises, we control all tank-dangerous directions. The defense forces of Ukraine have become very dense here and are working well, said Anton Baev.

Prostitutes, apartments and more: what Ukrainian activists found on the hacked computer of the comma...	About this reports Center of National Resistance. At the same time, the general managed to spread a computer virus on equipment at the headquarters of the command of the Russian group in the Zaporizhzhia direction. Also, while sending Russian soldiers to their inevitable death, he sent his own son abroad with a military education. Hackers-activists -Cyber ​​Resistance- and -KibOrg- managed to download a spy virus to the personal computer of the commander of the forces of the Russian Federation in the Zaporizhia region in 2023, Colonel-General Alexander Romanchuk. He spread the malicious program on a number of devices in the main headquarters of the Russian group. The surveillance operation lasted more than a year and a half and made it possible to obtain information about the enemy's plans, the location of his forces and intelligence. Part of the obtained material was handed over to analysts of the CNS. Since the active period of the operation has ended, it became possible to familiarize with a number of its details publicly. Also, the motive for the publication was the rhetoric of Russian propaganda regarding Romanchuk. Some of its elements cause sharp fits of laughter in people who are informed from primary sources. If you compile a portrait of Romanchuk from the publications of some of the Russian -military forces- in Telegram, then a real Rimbaud with the mind of Clausewitz or Sun Tzu appears, who almost personally stopped the Ukrainian offensive in the Zaporozhye direction in 2023. Romanchuk receives the epaulettes of colonel-general from the hands of the chief of the general staff of the Soviet Union Gerasimov and in the presence of the then commander of the invasion forces of Ukraine Surovikin on the eve of being sent to the Zaporizhzhia region. February 2023. Photo from Romanchuk's personal archive, to which CNS analysts were given access. It follows from the publication of the -Rybar- channel that Romanchuk seized a tank during a business trip to Syria, -set up a carousel of fire- and -pulled 40 fighters out of the cauldron.- Another popular channel -Children of the Arbat- adds Romanchuk to the top ten most talented Russian commanders, and the -Neighbor- channel writes that Romanchuk is a key element of Russian defense in Zaporizhzhia in 2023. With such a reputation, Romanchuk received the right to open the parade until May 9, 2024 in Moscow. In fact, under the leadership of Romanchuk, the Russians traditionally bombarded the front line with cannon fodder in the Zaporozhye direction. This became clear in detail thanks to the publication of statistics by Captain Vyacheslav Dondokov from Buryatia, who then headed the tactical group of the 42nd medical battalion of the Russian Federation in the relevant area. Only one tactical medical group of the enemy (stable point) received more than 1,100 wounded for a month. According to Ukrainian intelligence, there were at least 11 such groups in the Zaporizhzhia region. This means that in 2023, Russian troops lost more than 12,000 wounded there every month. Did Romanchuk try to improve the position of the fighters and resort to non-standard steps, continuously studying the situation on the line of contact? The most impressive discovery of the CNS analysts was that the -heroic- colonel-general, while in the position of head of an entire direction, did not show any interest in the affairs at the front. There is no exaggeration here. Romanchuk literally did not deal with the matters entrusted to him. The defense forces had full access to Romanchuk's personal computer and recorded everything he did when he used the device, as well as full access to the colonel general's mail and social media accounts. Romanchuk had a very peculiar occupation during working hours. Judging by the actions on his computer, the lion's share of time was spent choosing on the sites of ads for cottages and apartments for the needs of the family. Romanchuk also engaged in the selection of girls on the dating site for personal needs.

mass bankruptcies and corporate defaults await Russia	This is reported by /a> Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The number of loans with a dynamic rate, which critically depend on the discount rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, is constantly increasing: at the end of 2023, their share was 44% of the total number of corporate loans, but by the end of 2024, it reached 53%. Economists close to the Russian government expect unsecured money issuance, explosive growth of inflation and the collapse of the ruble in the near future. The critical point of this scenario is considered to be mid-2025. In addition, the regulator's tight monetary policy creates risks of recession and transition to stagflation in the short term. The further situation may develop according to the -shock with a decline in production- scenario, which will be accompanied by mass bankruptcies and corporate defaults.

The head of the planning department of the 13th brigade of operational assignment -Charter- told about this on the broadcast of the -Edyny Novyny- marathon Lieutenant Colonel Anton Baev of the National Guard of Ukraine. -The presence of civilians on the battlefield is always a problem for us, for the Defense Forces of Ukraine,- he said. The officer said that if there are civilians next to the soldiers of the occupiers, the fighters of the Defense Forces are forced to cease fire. On the other hand, the appearance of civilians in the combat zone does not pose any problem for the enemy. - Our enemy is not as humane as we are. Therefore, it is not an obstacle for him, but for us it is a very big obstacle. When we see the movement of the enemy from the drone and start using means to defeat him or use artillery - and when we see from the drone that a civilian (usually elderly people) comes out on the way or near the target where the enemy is located - then, accordingly , we understand that there is no question of any fire injury. We have to wait until either the civilian disappears or the enemy moves to another place, - explained the soldier. Moreover, the Russian occupiers deliberately and specifically use civilians as human shields. - Unfortunately, the enemy also knows that we treat our civilians this way. Sometimes it happens that [the enemy] resorts to vile acts, taking cover of civilians, settling in civilian houses. They settle and do not drive civilians out of their houses, they force them to live on, but they themselves settle in basements and in this way protect themselves, because they know that at this time nothing will fly into this house, - said Anton Baev.

Liquidation of the headquarters of the Russian Navy in Sevastopol: what will be the consequences for...	He shared his thoughts on -We are Ukraine-. -The relevant officers are senior personnel. Given the position, these are the people on whom the organizational core of the entire structure rests. The chief of staff is a person who actually manages all processes,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. He explained that the commander makes decisions, the general strategy, but all staff work rests with the chief of staff and it can be said that he is an irreplaceable person. -There may be many applicants for such a position, but there may not be people with the appropriate skills and experience. And considering that in the Russian army there is still a problem of cronyism, a component of corruption, such positions may go to people who are not professionals. Any similar cases are positive for us,- Dmytro Pletenchuk emphasized. The spokesman added that part of the command of the Russian fleet had already forcibly moved to Novorossiysk in the Krasnodar region of the Russian Federation. -If I were in their place, I would start to worry, of course. Yes, of course, some part of the leadership should already be in Novorossiysk, just as some families of servicemen have actually moved to Novorossiysk forcibly. Because in fact now both the fleet and the personnel are serving in Novorossiya and I cannot say with any guarantee where exactly their staff is located, but in any case, in the place of his colleagues, one should probably start looking around.- — noted Dmytro Pletenchuk.

He admits that full wings have an advantage, they fly further, they see targets standing at a distance from the line of combat. But it is Mavik that provides information about what is happening a dozen meters from our infantry.

Repression, torture, executions, a sea of ​​blood: the historian reminds the Zhduns what to expect f...	— We have at least a dozen historical examples, so to speak, of the occupation of Kyiv either by Russians or by Soviet troops. But, unfortunately, the whole experience is exactly the same. It all boils down to the fact that after the occupation of the city, mass repressions take place, both against that part of the population that was ready to resist, and that resisted, and against that population that, in the opinion of the occupiers, was not loyal enough. Therefore, I would like to remind everyone, first of all, to address the so-called -Zhduns- so that they do not have any illusions about how the Russians will behave. They will behave the same as they behaved in 1169, 1659, 1918, 1919. We have many such examples. This will first be the absolutely deliberate destruction of people who take a pro-Ukrainian position, and then they will take care of everything else in order to simply level the landscape and change it, populating the city with its own absolutely loyal population. Therefore, no one should have the illusion that the occupation will be peaceful, that -great Russian culture- will come here, humanists in the form of Leo Tolstoy and others. No, it won't. Absolutely peaceful occupation does not exist. There will be repression, there will be torture, there will be executions, there will be a sea of ​​blood. And Kyiv has already experienced this many times. I hope this will not happen again. For this, we have the Armed Forces of Ukraine and, I hope, the consciousness of our population as a guarantee.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/14/represiyi-tortury-straty-more-krovi-istoryk-nagaduye-zhdunam-chogo-chekaty-vid-okupacziyi/	2024-11-13T20:55:49-08:00
Who can become a combat medic: the takmed instructor -Lastivka- told how much time it takes to prepa...	Lastivka told ArmiyaInform correspondent about how important quality training in tactical medicine is, who can become a combat medic and how much time it takes to train him -from scratch-, as well as when and why practice is more important than theory, and motivation determines the result. The boys gave their callsign while still in the brigade. There were many Russian-speaking boys, so they called me -Lastochka- - Ukrainian -Lastivka-. They said I looked like a swallow - small, thin, fussy, sharp and fast. I fly everywhere, I run everywhere, I try to be in time everywhere. My husband also said that I remind him of a swallow, because he once watched swallows in his childhood and saw how they protect their home, their offspring. The swallow is a small bird, and it fearlessly pounces on any threat much larger than itself. That's why he said that I look like a swallow. In the Armed Forces of Ukraine, I am from a large-scale invasion. I wanted to leave back in 2014, when the anti-terrorist operation began, but my husband did not allow me, he said that someone should stay at home with the child alone. In 2022, the child had already grown up, so it was no longer possible to keep me at home under this pretext. And the threat became much more terrible, so I could not stay at home anymore. I am a doctor by education, by 2022 I already had 21 years of medical experience. I worked in a maternity hospital, helped deliver children. And now my children have to defend their home with automatic weapons and I couldn't help them. I'm not afraid of blood, I'm not afraid of hurting people to make them better, to save them. I had to hurt even newborn babies in order to save their lives. That's why I'm not afraid to hurt an adult to make him feel better, to survive. From March 2022 to February 2024, I was in a combat brigade. At the beginning of the invasion, no one taught us what tactical medicine was, what and how we should do it - there was no time, no opportunity. Now I'm at the training center and I see how high-quality training in tactical medicine has become. Now is the time, there is an opportunity to train people to provide adequate assistance on the battlefield - this is very important. Due to this, we have much better trained combat medics who go to the brigades. There they not only provide medical care, but also train fighters. We are training combat medics - these are the people who will continue to teach the boys tactical medicine in the brigades, because, in my opinion, only the basics of the necessary training are laid down during the BZVP, and they are not enough. Any motivated thinking person can become a combat medic. Medical education would be an advantage, of course, but it is not a mandatory requirement, as we primarily train people who have never worked professionally in medicine. We explain in such a way that our students understand why exactly such actions should be taken in this or that situation. We teach them this and try not to use any complicated medical terms. We always prioritize practice, not theory. If a combat medic can work on an algorithm without thinking about it, it is much more important than when he knows how to beautifully explain what he is doing and why. Our graduates may not remember complex medical terms, but they will determine exactly what should be done and what should not be done in any case. And their hands will never forget how to properly make a bandage or apply a tourniquet. Preparation requires a high-quality material base, equipment, and consumables. We have good sponsors who help a lot with all this. There are necessary mannequins, systems, dummies, turnstiles - everything you need. Of course, it all wears out, runs out, and needs to be replaced and replenished. But in general, everything that is needed for quality education is enough. The most important resource is time. We constantly -drive- and train our students. So that they do not get confused, how and where to turn that bandage or tourniquet, so that it is done at the level of automation. Training a combat medic requires intense training and time to train muscle memory. For this, one month is definitely not enough, two is better and you can manage in general, but the best option is three months for preparation. After completing the training, the combat medic receives the corresponding VOS number with a record in the military ticket that he successfully passed the combat medic course with a positive evaluation, that is, he can assume the position of a combat medic and provide assistance on the battlefield and in shelter conditions. We also train paramedics. They are trained according to a more simplified program, but they also know and are able to do a lot to help the wounded and save his life. The most capable, responsible and motivated can later go to the courses of a senior combat medic, when the training program has already been approved. This will be the next step in professional development. A senior combat medic must know and be able to organize, set up a stabilization point - this is a higher level of knowledge and responsibility when it comes to organizing the care of many wounded in a specially equipped place. Being a combat medic is very responsible, so random people are not needed here. You cannot become a doctor by force. Unmotivated students are very difficult to teach.

Military at disposal: about the grounds and amount of payments	Most often, servicemen who are on long-term treatment after an injury, or those who have been recognized as unfit or limited fit for service in such a unit, are taken into command. That is, they cannot perform the duties of their position, and at the same time they cannot resign from the Armed Forces. So they have to wait for a certain time, for example, to be released or transferred to other units. Of course, this is not a complete list of grounds for inclusion in the ordinance. For example, this is also allowed if: With in full the list of grounds can be found in the Presidential Decree -On Provisions on the Military Service of Ukrainian Citizens in the Armed Forces of Ukraine-. Servicemen on active duty should receive the following financial support: We would like to remind you that if the removal to service is related to long-term treatment after an injury, during treatment in a hospital, or during the time on leave for treatment, servicemen are paid an additional remuneration of 100,000 hryvnias. You can read more about payments for the wounded here. ♬ original audio recording - armyinform &#8211; armyinform In most cases, enlisted servicemen continue their military service. Therefore, they must perform the duties determined by the commander under whose command they fall. Exceptions are military personnel on long-term treatment, parental leave, or those on precautionary measures.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/14/vijskovyj-u-rozporyadzhenni-pro-pidstavy-ta-rozmir-vyplat/	2024-11-13T20:28:51-08:00
Cheap and can be angry: the Republic of Korea has made cardboard drones for aerial reconnaissance an...	Assaid on the official portal of the Peach development company from South Korea, this fixed-wing drone is designed to perform reconnaissance missions with minimal production and deployment costs, which makes it an attractive solution for military tasks, ArmiyaInform reports. A significant reduction in production costs is achieved due to the materials used, because they are light and cheap, and the drone itself is not large in size. Its wingspan is only 80 centimeters, and the maximum take-off weight is up to 1 kg, so the drone is record small. However, this does not affect its flight capabilities. PapyDrone-800 can be launched manually, that is, simply by the operator, whose hand acts as the -runway-. Once in flight, the drone can reach speeds of up to 100 km/h for a maximum of 20 minutes. The drone is able to provide real-time reconnaissance because it is equipped with a high-quality camera that transmits a video signal in real time and thus gives the operator direct access to information about the environment. At the same time, the control system supports not one, but up to five UAVs. The PapyDrone-800 also has an integrated avionics system that handles navigation and data processing. KCNA/P's built-in authentication module ensures the security and integrity of mission data, preventing tampering or unauthorized access. A high level of data encryption ensures that reconnaissance missions remain confidential and secure, even if the drone is intercepted or shot down. Combined with the low price and ease of production, PapyDrone-800 can be considered as a disposable UAV. It does not require ideal flight conditions and, thanks to the IPX3 standard, it can work effectively in various environments, including high humidity. While many drones used by the military have relatively expensive and labor-intensive systems to maintain, the PapyDrone-800 stands in stark contrast. As defined experts from IKK Defense Express, although the drone is positioned by its developers as a reconnaissance device, it has the description states that the internal volume of the fuselage allows carrying a warhead. -As for operational capabilities, it is declared to be used up to a wind speed of 10 m/s, which is the standard -civilian- limit. As for protection against moisture, the cardboard used has protection at the IPX3 level, and the developers showed the possibility of flying in the rain,- DE experts said. In the promo video, you can also see several details, such as the use of hot-melt glue to attach the fuselage elements, as well as the fact that some power elements of the body are still made of carbon, the equipment compartment is made of foam, and the drone also has metal rods. At the same time, the use of electronic components, as seen in the video, is reduced to a minimum number of boards. It should be noted that the South Korean startup Peach also has a larger development, the Papidrone-1800, the parameters of which are not disclosed, but the payload of the drone is obviously larger. Its conceptual idea is similar - to use the cheapest possible components. Thus, according to defense market analysts, the low price of the PapyDrone-800 allows even small military units to have access to advanced intelligence technologies without the financial burden associated with traditional and more complex unmanned systems. This opens up new opportunities for countries and organizations operating within modest budgets, especially in regions with limited military resources. Video: Presentation of PapyDrone-800 UAV.

Letters on behalf of the US non-governmental organization Freedom House with alleged calls to the Ukrainian military to leave the service are fake.

Freedom House also quickly reacted to this manipulation, calling it part of a campaign to discredit the Ukrainian army: -We have noticed cases of sending fake e-mails pretending to be messages from Freedom House. These letters contain false information directed against the Ukrainian military and are aimed at undermining trust in our organization and the morale of the defenders of Ukraine,- the message reads.

Within the framework of the exhibition, a panel discussion was held, in which officials of the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Environment, deputies of the Verkhovna Rada, scientists and representatives of public organizations took part. They discussed modern technologies and solutions to minimize this problem.

The head of the communication group told about this in an interview with -Suspilne Poltava- Roman Istomin of the Poltava regional territorial center of recruitment and social support. According to Roman Istomin, the visits of the TCC and the police to coffee shops and clubs are regular notification measures. In fact, they can be held at any time and in any public place. -It may sound shocking, but TCCs do not conduct raids at all. The very word -raid- is such an interesting case when the media picked up on a Russian ploy and started spreading information about -raids-, Roman Istomin said. According to Roman Istomin, it is easy not to be afraid of notification measures - to update your data in the TCC. -There is no such thing as a citizen who has clarified his data, who complies with the rules of military registration, and a car suddenly drives up to him and he is detained without checking his documents. How can this be seen on some anonymous Telegram channels,- said the head of the communication group of the Poltava Regional Territorial Center for Recruitment and Social Support.

The Cabinet of Ministers has changed the conditions for receiving aid for the families of missing an...	About this informs the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Corresponding changes to the order of payments were approved by the Cabinet of Ministers at the proposal of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Previously, the three-year deadline for submitting documents to receive a one-time cash benefit was calculated from the date of death indicated in the certificate. It is noted that this led to the fact that close relatives of military personnel, whom the court declared dead after a long period of absence, could lose the right to assistance due to the expiration of the terms even before the court decision itself was passed. Now the counting of time for registration of assistance starts from the day of entry into legal force of the court decision declaring the serviceman dead. This will ensure social guarantees for the families of the fallen defenders. The Government has also introduced an extraordinary payment of one-time cash assistance to persons with disabilities of the 1st group. This is due to the fact that such people need urgent and expensive treatment. Often, due to the long waiting period in the general queue, they do not have time to receive assistance in their lifetime. Amendments are made to Resolution No. 975 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of December 25, 2013 -On approval of the Procedure for the appointment and payment of one-time cash benefits in the event of death (death), disability or partial loss of working capacity without establishing disability of servicemen, conscripts and reservists who are called up for training (or inspection) and special meetings or for serving in the military reserve-. Resolution No. 168 of February 28, 2022 -Issue of certain payments to military personnel, rank and file officers, police officers and their families during martial law- was also amended.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/13/kabmin-zminyv-umovy-otrymannya-dopomogy-dlya-rodyn-znyklyh-bezvisty-ta-zagyblyh-vijskovyh/	2024-11-13T04:21:55-08:00

-Road prayer-: in -lnr-, an intersection was consecrated to fight road accidents	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, head of the Luhansk OVA. In particular, the military of the Russian Federation is often confident of impunity, even in the case of fatalities. In addition, there are no traffic lights in the front-line cities captured in 2022. For example, in Severodonetsk, the first traffic light is promised to be repaired only in 2026. In order to reduce the number of traffic violations, they decided to involve representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church.

The offensive of the occupiers was stifled in all directions: the Armed Forces repulsed more than 15...	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The invaders launched one missile strike with two missiles, 69 airstrikes, shot down 106 anti-aircraft missiles, and also used 873 kamikaze drones on the territory of Ukraine. At the same time, the enemy fired 4,178 shots at the positions of our troops and settlements. In the Kharkiv direction the enemy stormed the positions of our units near Vovchansk eight times. according to calculations, the losses of the enemy in the direction amounted to 85 servicemen killed and wounded, Ukrainian soldiers destroyed seven units of enemy vehicles and 23 UAVs. 12 cars and a unit of special equipment were also damaged. Seventeen times the enemy stormed the positions of the Ukrainian military on the Kupyansk direction in the districts of Kolisnykyvka, Zagryzovo, Kruglyakivka and Lozova. On the Lyman direction, the Russian invaders tried to advance six times in the Novomykhailivka, Grekivka, and Torsky districts. The defenders of Ukraine steadfastly hold the defense, inflicting significant losses on the enemy. In the Severskyi direction, Ukrainian soldiers repulse an attack in the Verkhnokamyansky area, the situation is under control. On the Toretsk direction the aggressor attacked ten times for aviation support near Toretsk and in the Shcherbinivka area. Currently, two clashes are ongoing. In the Pokrovsky direction, a high intensity of hostilities is maintained. The number of clashes has increased to 28. The invaders continue to attack our positions in the direction of Myrolyubivka, Promin, Lysivka, Hryhorivka, Pustinka and Novooleksiiivka settlements. By this time, our defenders have repelled 19 attacks, nine clashes are ongoing. Preliminary losses of the aggressor amounted to 445 occupiers killed and wounded. Two tanks, two cannons, three cars and three motorcycles of the occupiers were also destroyed, while another two cars and four motorcycles were damaged. In the Kurakhiv direction there were 47 combat clashes of varying intensity. The occupiers most actively tried to advance in the districts of Illinka, Novoselidivka, Voznesenka, Novodmytrivka, Dalniy and Antonivka. The fighting continues. In the Vremivka direction, the aggressor, with the support of aviation, stormed the front edge of our defense 13 times in the area of ​​Trudovoy, Maksimivka, Makarivka, Rivnopol and Novodarivka. Six clashes are still ongoing. In the Dnieper direction, five enemy attempts to storm the positions of our soldiers failed. The defense forces hold back the onslaught of the Russian occupiers. The department honored the soldiers of the 44th separate artillery brigade named after Hetman Danylo Apostol and the 126th separate brigade of the Territorial Defense Forces, who bravely held their positions, skillfully repelled enemy attacks, inflicting significant losses on the invaders. As reported by ArmyInform, The Defense Forces of Ukraine hit the enemy formation PMM on the territory of the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/13/nastup-okupantiv-zahlynuvsya-na-vsih-napryamkah-zsu-vidbyly-ponad-150-atak-voroga/	2024-11-12T21:07:30-08:00
Next, probably, cavalry, bicycles: an expert on stocks of military equipment in the Russian Federati...	-If we talk about the replenishment of the enemy's troops with combat equipment, then, for example, the entire tank repair industry of the Russian Federation with joint efforts produces about 150-160 tanks every month. About 30% of them are the newest - those assembled from scratch at the Uralvagonzavod. All the rest are cars that have been restored after they were wrecked in Ukraine. Or these are machines that were taken from storage, reanimated and sent to the front. Accordingly, if the enemy produces 150-160 vehicles per month, they will collect 1,920 tanks in a year. The Dutch site Oryx counts the losses of this war. But he counts not just the ones shot down in battle, but the completely destroyed machines that can no longer be restored. So, the Dutch counted a total of 3,494 destroyed tanks from the Russians for the entire time of the fighting. That is, with a production rate of 1,920 tanks per year, the enemy covers its losses without problems. But there is one caveat. The tanks that are now being delivered to the Russian army are older years of production. Because this is what is taken for storage, reanimated and supplied to units. If we receive cars from the allies somewhere in the 70s, 80s - if we are lucky, the first half of the 90s, then the enemy has them in the 60s. The difference in technical capabilities is obvious. the Russian Federation does not produce tank sights at all. They buy them in Belarus. Joint-stock company -Peleng- takes care of their production. It collects 145 -Sosna- sights and 40 of the latest -Sosna-U- sights in a year. On the eve of a large-scale invasion, the Russians purchased optical sights from France. All this was sanctioned. Accordingly, it is necessary to buy in Belarus. According to the sights, it turns out that the Belarusians are able to provide for the Russians. The Russian Federation even has the ability to change broken sights on tanks and keep something in stock. The situation in the Russian Federation is worse with artillery, because cannon barrels, first of all, are long. Second, it is a laborious process. Thirdly, the machines that are needed for drilling and cutting are high-precision equipment that cannot be bought so easily in the market. There were rumors that 10 machines were purchased by the Russians through Austria. But there are fewer than a hundred such machines throughout Russia. And the need for cannon barrels is thousands. Therefore, you can take what you have, repair it and give it to the troops. Accordingly, no one cancels the concept of -fatigue- of metal. The laws of physics apply. What was in storage will definitely have a shorter service life. Separately, it is necessary to say about the means of anti-aircraft defense of the enemy. It was already known in 2022 that the Russians do not have enough workers at factories. Russia produces such devices, but these are high-tech systems that require a lot of components, radio electronics, processors. And they are not produced in the Russian Federation. Accordingly, all this is imported through gray routes, very long supply chains are used. This is far from always military products, it can be purely civilian radio electronics, and it has other, for example, temperature ranges&#8230; And, accordingly, they can do something with air defense, but it will take a long time. And as we knock out their anti-aircraft missile systems, it becomes more and more difficult for the enemy to replenish them. Plus, friends from Iran urgently asked for S-300. the Russians took them to Crimea and sent them to Ayatoli. Then Israel flew there, crumbled everything into a fine vinaigrette. All five of the five long-range radar stations were destroyed. Ayatollah says: -Well, guys, give me more, because I need it, because they will fly again.- And the Russians are on such a normal split now: either for themselves or for their allies. But the Allies gave the Russians ammunition of scarce denominations, for example, 115 mm shells for T-62 tanks, which have a specific gun with such a strange caliber. British intelligence estimates that the adversary will exhaust its reserves of armored vehicles, meaning tanks and armored fighting vehicles, by the fall of 2025. Next, probably, cavalry, bicycles, what else could be there&#8230; We have already seen electric scooters. But we cannot yet talk about the fact that the Russian defense industry is on the verge of collapse. It still has considerable potential. Their much bigger problem is the lack of skilled labor. Also, these are problems with components, which are becoming more and more difficult to get. After all, the expert community and volunteers monitor what and where it comes from, and through diplomatic and not-so-diplomatic ways, partners are provided with data about it, and such schemes are cut off wherever they can be detected. Therefore, this is exactly what will restrain the Russian defense industry. They are now at their best. Because they should implement the fourth shift? Well, the day is not rubber. Switch to an eight-day work week? But they have already switched to a seven-day one. In the area of ​​the same Uralvagonzavod in Nizhny Tagil, in the 23rd year, they began to build a zone where it was supposed to concentrate specialists with technical skills, who are serving sentences for any articles. Probably in order to attract them to work at the tank factory. Therefore, they have already exhausted all the possibilities that the Russians have. There is no possibility to increase something. In particular, also in aviation: because they are already involving Belarusian specialists to restore the MiG-29. Therefore, I think that we will not see the collapse of the Russian defense industry, but we will see a certain stagnation. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/13/dali-mabut-kavaleriya-velosypedy-ekspert-pro-zapasy-vijskovoyi-tehniky-v-rf/	2024-11-12T21:01:44-08:00
-Cossacks- in the service of the Defense Forces of Ukraine: how they created the well-known armored ...	It is about the family of these BBMs, its history and development that the correspondent of ArmiyaInform talked with Andriy Kharuk, a well-known researcher of military equipment and armaments, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaydachny. — Andriy Ivanovych, in accordance with the distribution of machine-building production capacities in the former USSR, Ukrainian enterprises, in particular, manufactured formidable tanks and tractors, while the republic's car factories could only boast of rather clumsy -Zaporozhians- and -scary- Volynyankas. Therefore, during the collapse of the Union, our state did not inherit enterprises for the production of wheeled armored vehicles. Where did the -Cossack- genealogy begin? — If we recall the history of the company producing the current BBMs -Kozak-, the private joint-stock company -Praktika Scientific-Production Association- was founded in Kyiv in 1993. Initially, it was engaged in the production of civilian armored objects - bank safes and vaults, secure server rooms, etc. In 1998, the company mastered the production of collector armored cars, and ten years later tried to enter the market of military armored vehicles. — And what was the start of this enterprise in the defense market? — In 2009, -Praktyka- produced a prototype of an armored car on the Iveco Daily 55S18W all-wheel drive chassis. The machine, which received the name СРМ-1 -Козак-, had a welded body of MILUX steel armor (Finnish production) with four side doors and one aft. A 7.62-mm or 12.7-mm machine gun, or a 30- or 40-mm automatic grenade launcher could be installed on a manually operated turret on the roof of the hull. SRM-1 was relatively light - 5.5 tons. This indirectly indicates a not too high level of armored protection (armor thickness was only 5 mm, armored glass in the windows - 56 mm). Designers paid attention to mine protection: the passenger capsule has a double V-shaped bottom. Additional protection against the blast wave is provided by the batteries and the fuel tank located in the double floor. That -Kozak- was equipped with a four-cylinder Iveco F1C turbodiesel (3-liter displacement, 176 hp) and a six-speed ZF6S gearbox. The prototype was displayed at the Independence Day parade on August 24, 2009. The firm launched an extensive marketing campaign, showing -Cossack- at various exhibitions. Interest in the armored car was apparently shown by Nigeria, Pakistan and about a dozen other countries, but it was not possible to receive a single order. The low price did not help either - the company declared that the price of the SRM-1 in the basic version will be only 125 thousand dollars. Even cheaper should have been the version on the chassis of the GAZ-66 truck (with the replacement of the carburetor engine with a diesel one). - That is, at the prototype level, the activity of the manufacturing company in the field of defense then stopped? - Interest in the -Cossack- grew after the beginning of Russian aggression in 2014. On September 2, 2014, the prototype was demonstrated at the National Guard training ground in Novy Petrivtsy, Kyiv region, and on September 24-27, in Kyiv, at the exhibition -Weapons and Security - 2014-. However, in its current form, SRM-1 did not interest the military. In the end, the prototype -Cossack- was bought from the company by the US Embassy and handed over to the Ukrainian border guards on January 20, 2015. - However, a powerful enemy onslaught clearly cannot be stopped with one machine, let alone a prototype. How did events develop further? — The beginning of Russian aggression in 2014 became an incentive for many Ukrainian manufacturers to offer their products to the Defense Forces. However, SRM-1 did not suit the military. The main drawback of the first -Cossack- was insufficient protection, and it was not possible to strengthen it due to the weak chassis. So in 2014, when Praktiki specialists started designing a new armored car, they chose a heavier Iveco Eurocargo 150 E28 4×4 chassis (in the Iveco line, the Eurocargo family occupies an intermediate place between the light Daily cars and the heavy Stralis). The prototype, known as -Kozak-2014-, retained the general features of the SRM-1, but the use of a different chassis made it possible to strengthen the armored protection - it corresponds to level 2 according to the STANAG 4569 standard. The combat weight increased to 15 tons, but the dynamic characteristics did not deteriorate thanks to the diesel 250 hp engine Depending on the purpose of the car and the layout of the internal volume of the body, it can transport from 5 to 11 soldiers plus two crew members - a driver and a commander. — But this armored car, as far as is known, was only an intermediate option, right? — In the spring of 2015, a new version of the armored car appeared on the Iveco Eurocargo chassis — -Kozak-2-. It was distinguished by a significantly improved body, a six-cylinder Iveco Tector diesel engine with a working volume of 5.9 liters and a power of 279 hp. and a number of other improvements. The front suspension is an independent spring, the rear is a dependent spring. The armored body is welded from MILUX steel sheets. Italian anti-trauma seats with five-point seat belts are installed for the crew and landing party. The machine is equipped with a filter ventilation unit of Turkish production and a radio station of the Ternopil plant -Orizon-. Armament in the basic version was mounted in an open tower of the -crown- type. The first two copies of Kozak-2, shown on March 14, 2015, at the training ground in Novy Petrivtsi, were armed with 12.7-mm NSVT-12.7 machine guns. However, other weapons options were also allowed - a 7.62 mm machine gun or an automatic grenade launcher. And in May 2015, the Kozak-2, additionally armed with the Stugna-P ATGM, was demonstrated at the training ground of the 169th Desna training center. - And how did this BBM sample perform in field tests? - Tests of the Kozak-2 armored car were conducted simultaneously in the interests of the National Guard and the Armed Forces. In January-February 2016, the machine passed state tests at the training grounds of the State Scientific and Testing Center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Chernihiv, the training center of the National Guard of Ukraine in the village of Stare of the Kyiv region and on the basis of PJSC -NVO -Praktyka--. In particular, on February 17, one of the prototypes at the National Guard training ground underwent practical tests for anti-mine and anti-bullet resistance. A charge of TNT weighing 6 kg was detonated under the bottom of the cars, and the armored car was also fired at with a 5.45 mm AK-74 machine gun, a Dragunov sniper rifle, and a PKM machine gun (7.62 mm caliber). Although the armored car was damaged, the crew in a real battle would definitely survive in the event of such damage. These tests were the first in Ukraine to be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the STANAG 4569 standard. - So the -second- Kozak satisfied the military? was officially adopted by the National Guard of Ukraine under the designation SBA (specialized armored vehicle) -Kozak-001-. The Ministry of Defense was more scrupulous when making decisions: on November 3, 2016, Kozak-2 was admitted to operation during a special period (Order No. 588), and on March 21, 2017, it was taken for armament by Order No. 158. This document justified that -Kozak-2- is designed -for the transportation of personnel, samples of weapons, military cargo and property on all types of roads and terrain; conducting tactical operations such as patrolling; escorting vehicles during special tasks; transmission of orders and provision of communication; fire support of personnel in battle, as well as for the protection of the crew and cargo, personnel from the fire of small arms caliber 7.62 mm, fragments of ammunition and mines.- - And when was their serial production started? - The National Guard ordered the first 22 Kozak-2 armored cars in June 2015 - a year before the official acceptance for armament, and even before the completion of state tests. Obviously, the production of these machines was already underway, because the customer received the first ten of them already at the beginning of July. On February 11, 2016, the first six -Cossack-2- were handed over to the State Border Service of Ukraine. The Armed Forces of Ukraine received the first batch (ten Kozak-2 vehicles) in November 2017. At that time, the National Guard and the State Border Service already had more than 100 such armored vehicles. In August 2019, the general director of Praktika reported that more than 200 Kozak-2 armored vehicles have already been handed over to law enforcement agencies, and another batch of 40 vehicles is being prepared for handover. Another batch, which included more than 40 armored vehicles, was handed over in December 2020. — Regarding the Ministry of Defense: where did these BBMs come from? — In the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Kozak-2 armored vehicles were supplied primarily to units of the Airborne Forces - assault troops. For example, in March 2019, 33 such vehicles were transferred to the 13th separate airborne assault battalion of the 95th separate airborne assault brigade (Zhytomyr), and in December of the same year, Kozak-2 was delivered to the 81st separate airborne brigade (Kramatorsk). In December 2020, the 88th separate marine infantry battalion (Bolgrad) of the 35th separate marine infantry brigade received about 40 armored vehicles of this type, and in 2021, the 36th OBrMP also received such vehicles. Twelve -Cossacks-2- from this brigade took part in the parade in honor of Independence Day in Kyiv on August 24, 2021. The cost of Kozak-2 in 2017 was UAH 8.4 million, and for the contract concluded in December 2019, it reached UAH 9.28 million. This was explained by the increase in the minimum wage and the increase in energy prices. - If it's not a big secret, do you know how much special car data has been collected? Did they take part in the battles in the east of Ukraine? - The total number of Kozak-2 armored cars produced is not known for sure, but it can be estimated at about 300 units. In 2020, two of them were exported to Indonesia for testing, the rest are actively used by the Defense Forces of Ukraine. The National Guard tested its Kozak-2 vehicles in combat conditions in the area of ​​the anti-terrorist operation back in 2015. Later, the armored vehicles of the Armed Forces also visited the battle, in particular, in January 2020, 35 OBrMP vehicles arrived in the zone of operation of the United Forces. - But the most active and serious tests awaited these BBM already during the large-scale invasion of the Russian invaders - After the beginning of the large-scale Russian invasion, Kozak-2 armored vehicles are actively used in battles on all fronts. At the same time, as a result of the redistribution of Kozak-2 equipment, new units appeared in the arsenal - for example, in April 2023, two such armored vehicles were handed over to the 101st Territorial Defense Brigade. - However, even production vehicles need improvement. During operation, the military sees certain defects and expresses its wishes for modernization. And how was it, Professor, with this sample? — A significant drawback of the Kozak-2 armored car is the frame structure with the use of a civilian chassis (albeit with four-wheel drive). This limits the vehicle's ability to pass. Therefore, the next stage of the evolution of armored cars from their manufacturer was the creation of a car with a monocoque supporting body. This variant was called -Kozak-2M1-. It uses the same units (diesel engine, six-speed manual transmission) as on the Kozaku-2, but the undercarriage is completely redesigned. The suspension of all wheels became independent (its elements are supplied by a specialized company from the Czech Republic), and the ground clearance increased from 392 to 430 mm. At the same time, thanks to the rejection of the frame, the overall height of the car even decreased. -Kozak-2M1- differs from its predecessor in significantly better cross-country ability, smoother movement, higher speed of movement over rough terrain. The capacity of the armored car and armament correspond to the -Cossack-2-. The Kozak-2M1 prototype was first presented at the -Arms and Security-2016- exhibition in the fall of 2016. From October 2018 to July 2019, the machine underwent state tests, which were completed successfully. On April 3, 2020, by order of the Minister of Defense, the -Kozak-2M1- was adopted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is classified as an -armored combat wheeled vehicle- - BBKM. — And what decision did the military leadership make regarding this vehicle? — In January 2020, there were reports of an intention to purchase 140 Kozak-2M1 armored vehicles for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Ministry of Defense has officially announced that starting in 2020, the purchase of Kozak-2 and Varta vehicles will be stopped, and Kozak-2M1 will be purchased instead. Public opinion -expressed dissatisfaction- with the significantly increased price, which amounted to 10.5 million UAH (above, we indicated that -Kozak-2- cost 9.28 million UAH; for comparison, we cite the prices of other armored vehicles: -Varta- - 6.9 million , Novator 8.1 million, Oncilla 8.3 million). However, as it seems to me, an explanation can be found: unlike the Kozak-2 and Varta, the Kozak-2M1 armored car does not use a civilian -militarized- chassis, but is a special military design with much higher performance characteristics. In November 2021, tests of the Kozak-2M1 armored car equipped with a remotely controlled Sarp Dual module (with 12.7 and 7.62 mm machine guns) produced by the Turkish company Aselsan were completed. However, serial machines were delivered with an old version of armament - a -crown- type turret. — That is, literally on the eve of the great war, these machines entered the troops. Where exactly? - December 6, 2021. The first batch of Kozak-2M1 armored vehicles - 44 armored vehicles - was handed over to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 20 of them went to the 122nd separate battalion of the 81st OMBr, and the rest went to the Special Operations Forces: 14 to the 3rd Separate Special Purpose Regiment and 10 to the 73rd Naval Special Operations Center. Data on the supply of new batches of these machines after the start of the full-scale Russian invasion were, for obvious reasons, not published.

According to the investigation, the suspect concluded contracts with enterprises controlled by the Lviv businessman for more than UAH 1.5 billion. According to these contracts, the enterprises were supposed to supply the Ministry of Defense with military clothing within a certain period. However, at that time, these enterprises did not even have the production capacity to fulfill the terms of the contracts in a timely manner. In order to avoid the imposition of large fines, the entrepreneurs asked the suspect to list them and reduce them as much as possible. For this purpose, the official of the Ministry of Defense unnecessarily concluded additional agreements, which extended the terms of delivery of goods. In this way, fines issued for overdue contracts were reduced from almost UAH 98 million to UAH 4.5 million, i.e. by UAH 93.5 million. Currently, the question of selecting a preventive measure for the suspect is being resolved. Pre-trial investigation and operational support is carried out by the SBI.

- You will be either for the army or in the army. All. Otherwise we won't survive-: the story of a t...	— 2014 was a shock for everyone. I couldn't understand what was going on. I served and was discharged from the Soviet Army at the turn of the century, 1991-1993. Well, how is it: to find yourself with former comrades in the service on different sides of the barricades? This puzzle did not come together in my head. But time passed and I understood: there is no way back for us. We had perhaps the only chance in history to become a truly independent and integrated state. Because we had no way of dealing with the state. All this time we had small, as I call them, -states-: Khmelnytskyi, Hrushevskyi&#8230; Now I understand why, according to history, Khmelnytskyi was framed for us, and not Mazepa, considering him a traitor. Although in reality it was the other way around: it was Peter who betrayed Mazepa, not Mazepa Peter. Peter promised Mazepa a hetmanate and a separate state, but he did not fulfill his promise&#8230; Yes, I had volunteer friends. And then I strummed something for myself on the guitar. Well, they persuaded me to go. It was in 2016. I drove it once, drove it twice, and -got sick- of it myself. It's like in zombie movies: I was bitten by a wild volunteer - and became a volunteer myself (laughs - Author). At first, they carried some staples, banner film, and all kinds of things. Well, he sang, of course. And then there was the festival -Songs born in ATO-&#8230; — If we take the classic volunteer path, many of the volunteers during the ATO period themselves eventually joined the army for a contract. Didn't think about it then? - I thought. But I was not taken. They said it was old and no one needed it. Yes, I can't run long distances. But I won't run away at the same time (laughs - Author). Therefore, at that time, I only had to ride with songs and raise the fighting spirit. I didn't count how many concerts I did. I just collected chevrons and now I have over 400 of them. I was in some units several times, but I don't count it. All boys are heroes to me. I do not separate combat positions and non-combat positions. Here are the guys at the RAO warehouses. Someone has to ship shells or rockets for -hail-. They have hard labor. But they are often forgotten. Or cooks, drivers. A hungry paratrooper does not win for a long time. And the cook, in order to feed the paratroopers, has to wake up at 4 in the morning, heat up his stove and cook almost until night, regardless of whether something flies nearby or not. People are all wonderful. They just need to be reminded of it. Moral support is very important. People seem to straighten up after stress. Eyes burn again. They approach, thank - and that's it for an hour of the concert. There were units where things were difficult at first. The boys are depressed, depressed. There are commanders who consider it unnecessary to praise or encourage their soldiers. But this is wrong. A person should feel that he is respected, valued. So, along the way, the functions of the MPZ were also replaced somewhere. We drove exclusively on -zeros-. The main condition was that the combat unit had to be. There is enough entertainment in the rear even without us. We used to gather in dugouts, where the booths are 800 meters away. Now the war has moved to a new format - drones, cabs. It is not even possible to go out, not to sing songs. —Nevertheless, now you are a soldier of the Special Presidential Brigade. It's not so old and useless after all? - And it couldn't be any other way. You just do what you have to do. On February 20, 2022, he played a concert at the Docker G pub, returned to Vinnytsia, collected his -anxious suitcase-, documents and began to wait. I didn't know exactly when it would be, but I knew it would happen for sure. On the 24th, my friend helped to take the family to the private sector, and I went to the Public Health Service. Well, as a TrO — in fact, it turned out to be the DFTG under the mayor's command. We were expecting an attack from Moldova, from Transnistria, where Russian troops were. A reserve assault company was formed, somewhere around 60 men, half of whom had fought and half who had not. Those who did not have - took experience from veterans. They fired from automatic weapons, from machine guns, from grenade launchers. Weapons were taken from the TCC. They just came and took boxes. The time was such that everyone understood that we had better not refuse. And in about three months we were disbanded. We surrendered our weapons and went home. I tried to live a normal peaceful life for a while, I went to work. However, I understood - no, I can't. He went to Kyiv, joined the Presidential Brigade and went to the medical commission. - Why did they choose the Presidential Brigade? - Because they have an orchestra. The main thing that motivated me was that I should benefit the army, not be a pawn for it. I can raise the morale of the soldiers, earn money for the brigade, donate to its charity fund. Now the intensity and nature of hostilities is completely different. It is almost impossible for civilians to get to the front lines. And now I ride not just as Sanya Klets, but as a representative of the Special Presidential Brigade, a representative of the Honor Guard Orchestra. - And how did you manage to pass the medical board, if the brothers refused earlier? - The doctor initially refused to sign, saying that you are of limited fitness. I say, I have armor at all, I could sit at home, but I can't. I have to do something. The head of the VLK looked at me and said to the doctor: -Write what is suitable- (laughs - Author). — Has the repertoire changed now compared to the ATO times? — Yes. Of course. Became tougher. I began to hate the Russian woman. The whole If before there was hatred only for the military - for Debaltsevo, for Ilovaisk, then after Buchi, after Irpen, after the people in the wells, I hate them all. Together with civilians. Although I understand that it is better for the military to sing not about hatred, but about life and love, about the same fishing. So that they remember why they are here. That at home they are awaited and loved. The war will affect everyone. There will not be a single family in Ukraine without either a soldier or a volunteer. You will either be for the army or in the army. All. Otherwise, we will not survive. - And what songs are the most popular, the most popular? - -4.5.0- is a popular song. What in the time of ATO, what now. I don't know how many times I've sung it. It is about everything: about love, about war, about brothers. He himself prefers -Envelope- - -envelope in me, envelop yourself, as if there is no other in the world- (sings - Author)&#8230; I'm a lyricist at heart. Well, he recently wrote a lullaby for children. —How does a lyricist feel in the army? Don't you feel like you've been a little overheated? Because quite often we had to hear from creative people that they were -not born for war-, that the army is only for warriors, not for poets? - And no one is born for war. War is the opposite of human nature. However, what to do if we have such an annoying neighbor? For which we have no right to exist at all, as a state, as a nation? To obey and become like them? Should I choose my independence? Everyone should do what they can do. You can hold a weapon in your hands - keep it. Can't - help others hold. Now in the army, even in the rear, almost half of the positions are vacant. What, lyricists can't type on a computer? Reports can't type? At the same time, can't MPZ (moral and psychological support - Author) maintain fighting spirit? I got lucky with the crew. Good luck with the commanders. And the brigadier general, and the deputy brigadier general from the MPZ, and the head of the orchestra are all responsible people who do not care what is happening in the unit, who are focused on the development of the unit, and not on any personal career growth. That's why we always find a common language. Our brigade fights in battalions along the entire front line. The boys took part in the toughest competitions: Bakhmut, Klishchiivka, Avdiivka, Soledar, Vovchansk. Pride takes such people! And here's what I would like to say: guys! Don't wait for summons! Now there is an opportunity to mobilize without TCC directly into the brigade. So look for a department you trust, look for a position where you can handle the tasks and where you will be useful. Understand, the way things are going - everyone will fight. Someone to shoot, and someone to carry the cartridges. Now you have the opportunity to choose what you will do. However, when the summons comes, get to where there will be the greatest need for people. So act! This is the greatest challenge of our lives today. We are not fighting for power, not for some amorphous state. We fight to stay who we are.

Type tests are an important stage in the process of evaluating the effectiveness of changes made to the design or production technology of serial products. They are conducted in order to assess the impact of changes on the technical and tactical operational characteristics of the product. Tests are carried out on samples of OVT, in the design or technology of which the proposed changes have already been made. The scope of such tests is determined by the program and methods developed by the manufacturer in accordance with DSTU B 15.211. Typical tests can be carried out both at the test bases of the manufacturers themselves, and at specialized testing organizations, such as the State Research Institute for Testing and Certification of Armaments and Military Equipment, or at enterprises with an appropriate test base. Test results are recorded in the form of an Act and protocols that reflect all test results. If the results confirm the effectiveness of the changes, they are included in the working design documentation in accordance with DSTU B 15.902. To register changes in the technical conditions for the OVT sample, it is necessary to contact the Main Directorate for Life Cycle Support of Weapons and Military Equipment via e-mail mdalc@mil .ua.

The crew destroyed two Russian tanks with three shots, the Leopard survived 8 drone hits: -Marine- a...	Andrii meets the ArmiyaInform correspondent at dawn. The training ground spread across the boundless steppe, illuminated by the golden glow of the morning sun, glistening with the pinkness of the grass. The feeling of being in a fairy tale... But this fairy tale quickly ends when a giant car drives up with a roar, the military installs equipment on the muzzle, sets up a box of shells and one by one begins to look into the device, exclaiming crew teams. After the exercise is completed, the tank fires several shots. Andriy is in charge of the entire process. Andriy explains that the boys are currently engaged in calibration and firing of shells. The fact is that Ukraine receives various ammunition from its partners, each EU country has its own factories. Each country has its own gunpowder, its own shell, its own metal quality, ballistics are different. —Unfortunately, a batch of ammunition does not always come with the appropriate documents, so calibration and firing is a mandatory procedure in order to clearly target the enemy during a combat mission, he notes. - Also, each cannon has its own shot. The more the cannon fire, the greater the error. And that is why we are now using practical shooting to reveal the size of this error. Look, now they were shooting at a target - a circle with a diameter of 30 cm, from a distance of one and a half kilometers. Two shots with armor-piercing projectiles were clearly hit, this was confirmed by our drones that monitor the work. Although these are shells manufactured in the 80s, the quality is impressive! According to Andriy, it is important to coordinate crews so that everyone knows what and how to do in certain combat conditions. — And it's not the way we were taught in Europe. The instructors there are theorists, most of whom have no idea of ​​real combat, especially in our conditions. They say: you should come to the training ground, check from right to left, the targets should clearly be 90 degrees, level. And we are in hostilities, we don't have that. Therefore, we should listen to their advice and at the same time learn and develop on our own, - he explains. This crew, which was the first to work on the training ground today, has to its credit destroyed enemy BMPs, and literally a week ago it eliminated an enemy tank. In addition, the tankers also work on foot, that is, they come and dismantle dugouts from 10-15 meters up close. — The main job of a tank is to destroy the enemy, the enemy can be different. We have a trump card on these tanks: speed and accuracy, the tankers explain. Andrii's call sign is -Marine-, because he actually started in the marines. At one time, he served his military service, then, during the anti-terrorist operation/OOS, he got into the sixth wave, served for a year and three months, and was a marine in an amphibious assault company. — At the beginning of the large-scale invasion in 2022, he got into the 95th Battalion of the Reserve Corps, and there were only conscripts there. There is a war going on in the country, and they have a temporary war there. You get up in the morning, and there the curbs in the yard are white. We wanted to fight, defend our country, decided to move. Then the combatant says: -Do you want to transfer? Everything, no questions asked.- Only me and my godfather were transferred to tankers. I rode a tank only while participating in anti-terrorist operations. And yes, cleanly on the training ground and just ride on the armor. They translated, and my first thought was: -But where did I end up?-. Well, that is, with my dimensions in the T-72 tank, I did not understand where I was and what I was doing. But our combatant with the call sign -Philosopher- was very good at motivating people, - recalls -Marine-. Later, together with his comrades, he took a direct part in the counteroffensive in the Kherson region, then he got to Donbas, and in the winter of 2023, the crews went to master Leopard tanks. — One group studied in Poland, and I was part of the second, which was studying in Spain. After the exercises, they returned to their 4th tank brigade. Then we were transferred to the newly created 33rd mechanized brigade, specifically to the Leopard, on which we trained. And already during the formation of the brigade, equipment came to us little by little, - says Andriy. According to Andriy, the Russians now keep their more modern tanks, and mostly work with them from afar: they arrived, fired and quickly retreated. — Enemy tanks enter such a sector that it is impractical for us to go to them, so as not to reveal our positions. Because as soon as we start working, -Krasnopoli-, -Lancets- fly out, looking for us. While we were talking here, a -Krasnopol- (radio-controlled projectile of the Russian army. — Ed.) flew over the tank. Thank God, everything is fine, the crew was just leaving, then the projectile just flew by. Because it works only on stationary targets, at a distance of up to 30–40 kilometers, says the tanker. He characterizes the intensity of modern combat as follows: when crews were working under Robotyn (Zaporizhia region), then they were fully loaded - 42 shells. The tank fired these shells in one night and came to the neighboring crews for shells in order to continue working. There were times when 60 shells were fired per battle. The tank of diesel fuel was regularly -left- during the night, and this is more than a ton of fuel. — There was a case that the tank was hit. Well, guys, everyone is alive and well. The difference is that when something hits the Leopard, it is almost impossible to destroy this tank with one shot. Previously, when we did not have active armor, all the destruction was carried out by the enemy anti-tank missile -Kornet-. This is a powerful system. But we started to develop, to change something. And if you hit a Russian car, that's it. My crew destroyed two Russian tanks with three shots. First we hit, stopped the tank, 5–seconds — and the second shot, its turret flies up, and in 15 seconds the second tank leaves. We destroy him with the first shot! In Leopard, there is no such thing as a collapsing tower. There is a problem if they are fired with thermobaric projectiles. But everything is done for the survival of the crew: the tank has a titanium plate that separates the crew from the ammunition, - explains Andriy. With a smile, he adds that you get used to good things quickly. - I I worked first on the T-72, and then the Leopard came, so I say that I will not get into a Soviet tank again. And although I don't have a combat position now, I manage the battle, command the tanks, instruct where to work, from where, at what distance, directions. But if you have to return, then only on Leopard. Just so you understand, it is very difficult to destroy a Leopard. It can be damaged, it will be stopped, it will stand. And then it starts: FPV drones, drops, thermobaric ammunition. We have one tank that was hit by all the FPV drones. We then chased him away, he is currently being repaired and will be restored, says the tanker driver. In the conversation, Andriy also tells how he was injured. Then the task of his crew was to stop the enemy armored group. — We rolled out at the expense of speed and accuracy, fired three shots, destroyed two Russian tanks, began to roll back, and an ATGM came to us. I don't remember how it happened, I was unconscious for some time. Then he came to his senses, we evacuated the tank, quickly got out of it. It turned out that the chargers were also wounded. But all survived, thank God, are already healthy, everything is fine. I underwent rehabilitation at home, in Rivne. I have a wife and two sons there: the eldest is 5 years old, the youngest is 3 months old...

Firepower, mobility and protection: the Australians adopted a new howitzer that fires at 60 km	As stated the authors of the publication Defense Connect, Australia will acquire a fleet of 42 AS9 Huntsman and AS10 armored vehicles for the supply of ammunition, which will be built at the Hanwha Defense Australia plant, ArmyInform reports. This is a modern Australian-made self-propelled howitzer, which is based on the South Korean K9 Thunder system, about which ArmyInform already told in one of her publications. This defense original system was developed specifically for Australia based on the Hanwha K9 howitzer, which is currently in service with the artillery forces of South Korea, India, Norway, Poland, Finland, Turkey and Estonia. The Huntsman is equipped with a 155 mm 52 caliber gun, which is in service with many countries and is compatible with all standard NATO-standard 155 mm ammunition. The main purpose of the Australians' adoption of this artillery installation is to provide highly mobile fire support capable of delivering precision strikes at long ranges while maintaining a high level of crew protection and to replace obsolete towed artillery systems General tactical and technical characteristics of the AS9 Huntsman: AS9 Artillery System The Huntsman is equipped with a powerful 155mm cannon capable of firing both conventional and guided projectiles. As inform experts of the defense portal Army Recognition, this weapon provides an effective firing range of up to 40 km using standard ammunition and more than 60 km when using guided projectiles with a rocket engine. The main characteristics of the AS9 Huntsman 155 mm gun: Thanks to its powerful diesel engine and modern suspension, the AS9 Huntsman has excellent cross-country characteristics. This allows the artillery unit to quickly occupy new firing positions and avoid enemy counter-battery fire. The AS9 is equipped with a semi-automatic loading system, which significantly increases the rate of fire, especially during long artillery operations. The machine is equipped with an active protection system and modular armor, which makes it resistant to mortar fire and anti-tank hits. The fire control system is integrated with the GPS and inertial navigation system, which allows for high-precision firing of targets at long distances. In addition, the installation supports network capabilities to coordinate fire with other artillery and infantry units. The AS9 Huntsman is designed to support troops on the battlefield by suppressing enemy artillery, destroying fortified positions and neutralizing enemy fire points. Due to its high mobility and the ability to quickly change positions, the Huntsman can operate in dynamic combat conditions. The Australian howitzer AS9 Huntsman is a modern and technologically advanced self-propelled installation that combines high firepower, mobility and protection. It is ideal for modern combat conditions, providing artillery support with high accuracy and efficiency. Due to its design and capabilities, this system has an important place in Australia's arsenal and may be of interest to other countries looking for effective artillery support.

Fake Telegram bot in action: residents of Sumy are campaigning to evacuate dogs due to the threat of...	On behalf of the Sumy Regional Military Administration and enterprises, institutions and organizations, a fake letter is sent with a request for help to military units. In social networks, information is being spread that Ukrainian volunteers allegedly tried to transport -almost one hundred kilograms of heavy drugs-, which were intended for the 82nd brigade of the Armed Forces. At the same time, residents of Sumy are offered to report stray dogs in a false Telegram bot, ostensibly to evacuate them due to the threat of the arrival of soldiers from the DPRK. the Russians create such fakes to sow panic among the residents of the region, to make them believe that the Ukrainian authorities alone cannot cope with the provision of the Armed Forces forces So that the Ukrainians were afraid that the North Koreans were participating in the war on the side of Russia and agreed to Russia's negotiating terms. Also to discredit the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the eyes of international partners and reduce international support for our state. And the Sumy region is the focus of attention of propagandists precisely because it borders Kursk. The fact that the Armed Forces have been keeping part of the Russian territory under their control for more than three months is very annoying to the Kremlin dictator. The enemy wants to destabilize the situation in Sumy Oblast in order to return Kursh Oblast as soon as possible.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/12/falshyvyj-telegram-bot-v-diyi-sumchan-agituyut-evakuyuvaty-sobak-cherez-zagrozu-prybuttya-soldativ-z-kndr/	2024-11-11T20:11:23-08:00
-The enemy sneaks in from all cracks-: the Russians stepped up in the Lyman direction	Maksym Bilousov, head of the communications department of the 60th OMBr, told about this on Army TV . -And it just sneaks into our positions from all the cracks. -They began to bombard us with anti-aircraft guns almost every day, enemy artillery and drones are also working,- he said. Maksym Bilousov suggested that the Russians were probably given the task of achieving a certain goal by a certain date. -What's more, I noticed from the video that quite educated people showed up. But receiving injuries, they began to commit suicide more often. This may indicate that the attitude towards them there is such that they understand that even the wounded will go on an assault later,- he said. The spokesman added that Russian equipment attacks very infrequently, maybe once every two weeks, and this is usually the case for foot assaults without mechanized support. According to the information of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, in the Lyman direction seven combat clashes took place near Grekivka, Nevsky, Terni and Serebryanka. Until now, one battle is ongoing in this direction. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/vorog-sune-z-usih-shhilyn-rosiyany-aktyvizuvalysya-na-lymanskomu-napryamku/	2024-11-11T11:57:04-08:00
The Defense Forces explained why the enemy uses a minimum of equipment in the Pokrovsky direction	This was reported by a representative of the public relations service on Army TV Serhiy Okishev of the 25th OPDBr. -The enemy does not stop trying to seize our positions, but the paratroopers stand firmly on their lines and repel any attempts of assaults. Our gunners and UAV operators hit all of this on the sly, so now the enemy uses a minimum of equipment, because he knows that it will not reach,- Serhii Okishev said. The spokesman added that the Russians make isolated attempts to land their infantry directly on the positions, but each time it ends fatally for them. -For the most part, they disembark the infantry earlier and they are already moving on foot in small groups,- he explained.

Rustem Umyerov told the EU delegation about the possibilities of Ukrainian production of UAVs	This was notified in the MoU. -I highly appreciate Mr. Borrell's personal contribution to the diplomatic, economic and military support of Ukraine. As a sign of gratitude for these efforts, which strengthened our defense capabilities, he was awarded the -Cross of Honor,- Rustem Umyerov said. The European Union has already provided Ukraine with military aid in the amount of 44 billion euros and intends to continue increasing its support. One of the most effective steps to help our defenders is investing in the Ukrainian defense industry. Rustem Umyerov told the EU delegation about the possibilities of Ukrainian production of drones, which is currently estimated at $11 billion. Of this, Ukraine can invest about $3 billion on its own, but for the maximum development of our potential, financial support from partners is needed. -We hope that a significant part of the next tranche of frozen Russian assets will be aimed at strengthening our defense-industrial complex. I am deeply grateful to the European Union for its leadership and support in many areas. I believe that our joint efforts will help overcome all challenges on the way to peace in Ukraine and Europe,- said Rustem Umyerov.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/rustem-umyerov-rozpoviv-delegacziyi-yes-pro-mozhlyvosti-ukrayinskogo-vyrobnycztva-bpla/	2024-11-11T11:16:05-08:00

President: Defense Forces of Ukraine are restraining 50,000 Russian troops in Kurshchyna	About this he said in the evening address. -The front, first of all, is our Kurakhiv direction, other directions are also in Donetsk region,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. There was also a report on the Kursk operation, where the Defense Forces of Ukraine restrained a fairly significant group of Russian troops — 50,000 personnel of the occupying army, who, thanks to the Kursk operation, cannot be directed to other directions of Russian attacks on our territory. -We greatly appreciate the bravery of all our soldiers, every unit involved in these battles,- the President emphasized. The head of state also noted all our forces that strike at Russian bases, logistics, and rear areas. He emphasized that the strikes of our forces on Russian arsenals reduced the amount of artillery used by the occupier, and this is noticeable at the front. -That is why we need far-reaching solutions from our partners - from America, from Britain, from Germany; this is what is vitally necessary.

The EU reported how many shells were transferred to Ukraine this year	About this in interview - To the European truth,- said EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell. -We have already delivered more than 980,000 shells, and very soon we will hand over 1 million shells. I know that we made a commitment to reach this level by spring - and we failed. But we will be able to by the end of the year. And for this, we have accelerated significantly,- said Josep Borrell. He noted that, in addition, many ammunitions were delivered to Ukraine under bilateral agreements with member countries, as well as within the framework of the Czech initiative. -In general, by the end of the year, we will deliver more than 1.5 million rounds of ammunition to Ukraine,- said the head of EU diplomacy. Josep Borrell also assured that the European Union is doing everything possible to continue supplying Ukraine with the same amount of ammunition next year. -The problem was not in transferring what was available, but in production. When we promised to reach the level of 1 million shells per year by the spring, we did not know what the real production capacity was, and it was not as large as we thought. Now we already have this production capacity,- he explained.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/v-yes-povidomyly-skilky-snaryadiv-peredaly-ukrayini-czogo-roku/	2024-11-11T09:32:42-08:00
How important are Liptsi for Kharkiv: the Armed Forces spoke about the importance of controlling the...	Control over the village would not only open the way for the invaders to Kharkiv, but would also allow them to shell the city with barrel artillery. About the situation in the Lipetsk section of the Kharkiv direction on the broadcast of the telethon -Suspilne Novosti- the deputy commander of the shock battalion of the BPAK spoke -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirko Oles Malyarevich. — At the beginning of May 24, the enemy wanted to reach Liptsi and move on. This is the shortest way to Kharkiv, he said. The military said what is the importance of control over this settlement for the security of Kharkiv. — If they pass through Liptsi, they receive artillery fire from barrel artillery, which is regular in the city of Kharkiv. This cannot be allowed, because if the city can be affected by conventional barrel artillery, this city will hardly be able to live fully, because it will be a constant shelling, the officer explained. However, despite the fact that the enemy then managed to break through the border, reach and gain a secure foothold in Liptsi, the invaders were not allowed by the Defense Forces, so the invaders' plans were not implemented. — Their task was not accomplished. The situation was stabilized there, the enemy was stopped, destroyed, pushed back. They reached Liptsi a little on the outskirts at the beginning of May, but they were all eliminated, Oles Malyarevich reported. Currently, the line of combat in the Lipetsk section has been stabilized, and the initiative in this section of the Kharkiv direction is entirely on the side of the units of the Defense Forces. — The front line is now passing in the Hlybokoye region. The village of Hlyboke is more north of Liptsi, about 8 kilometers from the border, they are currently located, the military said. Now the drones of the -Achilles- assault air defense battalion of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket commander Ivan Sirk continue to work also on the Lipetsk sector of the front. — The situation there has been quite stable for a long time. The enemy is trying to maneuver, pull up reserves, conduct reconnaissance. Our task there is to identify any movements of the enemy, logistical chains and destroy them so that the situation remains stable and the enemy does not have the opportunity to break through our defenses, said the deputy commander of the Achilles battalion. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, when the Russians postponed their desire to capture Kupyansk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/chym-vazhlyvi-lypczi-dlya-harkova-v-zsu-rozpovily-pro-znachennya-kontrolyu-nad-selom/	2024-11-11T09:19:28-08:00

In two days, our paratroopers destroyed 28 units of enemy equipment and more than 100 occupiers, another 100 were injured. A separate mechanized brigade successfully eliminated the Russians in Kurshchyna and 47. Two Bradley crews mowed down the landing in which the enemy landed. The occupiers managed to knock out our infantry vehicles with a grenade launcher and FPV, but the Bradleys continued to move, successfully landed the infantry and returned to our positions. A rocket flies towards the Pskov paratroopers. The occupiers gathered together with military equipment in a forest plantation in the Zaporizhzhia region and were preparing for an offensive. the Russians were discovered by the GUR fighters of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, and the fighters of the -Tavria- anti-aircraft missile defense system fired a rocket with a cluster charge at them. After the arrival, two heavy Russian trawlers and personnel were destroyed. Four more armored personnel carriers with the Pskov landing force tried to escape, but soon they were also attacked. These and other topics are discussed by our presenters - lieutenant colonel Serhii Misyura and captain Artem Golub.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/raketoyu-po-desantu-voroga-bredli-vykoshuye-posadku-robota-madyara-strim-iz-pryfrontovogo-mista/	2024-11-11T08:56:44-08:00
Constant duty and -window of opportunity-: how drones work in the Kupyan direction	About this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- telethon told the deputy commander of the 92nd separate -Achilles- air defense battalion Oles Malyarevich of the assault brigade named after Ivan Sirko, the head of the basket. — Most of the unit is working in Kupyansk now. The situation there is much more dynamic and hot. You can see that the enemy has squeezed into the left bank of the Oskol River in the Kruglyakivka area and is now trying to move north and south [along] the Oskol River in order to completely seize the left bank, he said. The current task of the Defense Forces is to prevent the occupation of the left bank of Oskol by the occupiers and to inflict maximum losses on the enemy. In their turn, the occupiers strike in the direction of the positions of the units of the Defense Forces with anti-aircraft guns, artillery, drones and launch infantry assaults. — They use the full spectrum, but the emphasis is usually on guided air bombs, artillery and infantry assaults. Sometimes such armored breakthroughs happen - it happens very powerfully once every 10 days, but the equipment does not survive for a long time, because the air from our side is very saturated with drones - The cheapest resource of the occupiers, according to the military, is their manpower. Unmanned aerial vehicles of various types significantly help destroy the enemy, despite worsening weather conditions. Oles Malyarevich said that Ukrainian drones help the infantry as much as possible, using the smallest window of opportunity: - UAV forces are developing and have priority both for us and for them. These are full spectrums - reconnaissance, bombers, night, FPV, reconnaissance wings, and kamikaze wings. The weather does have an effect, but our calculations are constantly in positions, they don't have someone to look at the weather and they don't go out Constantly on duty, if there is an hour or two somewhere, a window where you can fly and do your work - we do it. Because without air cover, without the support of infantry drones, it is very difficult to hold a defensive line. We understand this and carry out combat tasks to destroy the enemy, and reconnaissance, and we also actively deliver humanitarian cargo every night for our infantry, for our units that are on the ground, we provide them with all the necessary drones. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, when the Russians postponed their desire to capture Kupyansk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/postijne-cherguvannya-ta-vikna-mozhlyvostej-yak-praczyuyut-dronari-na-kupyanskomu-napryamku/	2024-11-11T08:42:32-08:00

Minus three illegal schemes: MSEK officials and VLK doctors are among the detainees	This was informed in the SBU. Among those detained are officials of medical and social expert commissions and hospitals. For bribes from 2 to 10 thousand US dollars, they helped conscripts avoid the draft on the basis of fictitious medical reports.

They didn't manage until November: when the Russians postponed their desire to seize Kupyansk	About the real situation in the Kupyansk direction on the air of the -Espresso- TV channel, told the deputy commander of the BPAK shock battalion -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirko Oles Malyarevich. — In the Kupyan direction, the situation is changing very dynamically, it is tense. Attacks and assaults by the occupiers are constantly taking place. From our side, separate operations are taking place to restore the condition and conditions, he said. The military commented on the situation, drawing attention to the map. - You see on the map how they rested on the left bank of the Oskil River and they had long planned to completely capture it. At the moment, the fighting is going on, if you look at this ridge, north of Kolisnykyvka, the enemy is trying to go there and capture it, the officer explained. However, the enemy does not succeed. - On the left bank on our side there are sufficiently powerful forces and they are doing everything to ensure that they do not spread either down or up there. The task of holding the left bank, the task of preventing the capture of Kupyansk and Kupyansk-Vuzlovoi. The city lives and is holding on, the deputy commander of the drones emphasized. Oles Malyarevich commented on the statements of Russian propagandists about the encirclement of units of the Defense Forces in the Kupyan direction. — We were in danger of losing the possibility of evacuating our settlement. [However], all issues regarding this have been resolved. I will not say how, but we have worked out several protocols in case the situation develops in any direction. So we're holding on to each of our soldiers, protecting our lives and our health, and doing everything we can to keep our work there and our personnel alive. That is, there is no encirclement of our troops, Malyarevich stated. The occupiers did not cope with the task of capturing Kupyansk by the beginning of November, and now they have moved the date of occupation of the right-bank Kupyansk to the New Year. -From the interceptions that we have, and we are constantly conducting reconnaissance, they set themselves the task of capturing even the right-bank Kupyansk by the New Year,- said the military officer. At the same time, in his opinion, the tactics of the enemy will remain unchanged. — If we talk about the Kupyan direction, then on our side it is the Oskil River, on their side it is quite large open spaces along which they move. Tactics will not change, it will be live assaults, it will be sometimes armored breakthroughs, as they did a couple of times, and everything was destroyed on their side, the officer predicted. Oles Malyarevich assumed that the occupiers' tactics will remain unchanged: - They have no options but to attack with infantry. But they are actively working with aviation, they are destroying literally the entire Left Bank - not a single house, not a single building, like theirs in Avdiivka, the whole of Vovchansk. And on the Right Bank it has already been completely transferred from the destroyed Kupyansk, Sinkovo ​​- these are the settlements on the right bank immediately beyond the river. So artillery shelling, air shelling, and -meat- assaults, as they are called, not counting casualties. These are the conditions in which we are working now. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Russians are trained better, but go to inevitable death just the same.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/do-lystopada-ne-vporalys-na-koly-rosiyany-vidterminuvaly-zabaganku-zahopyty-kupyansk/	2024-11-11T07:28:36-08:00

-Fatality-: Russians are better trained, but they go to inevitable death in the same way	About this on the air of the TV channel -Espresso- told the deputy commander of the battalion of shock air defense systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault Oles Malyarevich of the brigade named after the head of the basket Ivan Sirko. — They have now reached 35 thousand mobilized and 25–30 thousand lost -200-–-300- per month. They support these balances. In order to somehow even them out, they brought in more North Korean soldiers, who are mostly used for the second line, he said. The Koreans, he said, can most likely play a supporting role as additional forces so that the Russian command can throw as many of its own soldiers as possible to the front. — I heard that they were engaged in battle somewhere, so we are also waiting in our direction. If they appear, then there will be information immediately, while there is no information, the military said. The Russians are immediately preparing their own soldiers to be sent to the front. -Because they have trained all of their own people who were mobilized - go ahead,- the officer emphasized. According to him, the enemy fighters are trained and equipped better than before, but this does not help them and the tactics of the occupiers remain unchanged - -meat- assaults. — They teach well enough, better than it was a year and a half ago. That is, they are progressing in this aspect, both in terms of military training and technical support. There is no such thing as an inexplicably running [enemy soldier] with a machine gun in some kind of helmet. Their soldiers are fully equipped, although sometimes they fight for a day and a half, no more, - noted Oles Malyarevich. The military man explained that he controls the enemy soldiers: - First of all, they are driven not only by some conditional patriotism, but also by fear. Because if the whole platoon goes forward, and a few turn back, they will be shot. They have -departments-, they really work. At least - to prison, and it is not known what will happen to him there. So they move forward, I think, mostly out of fear. Secondly, indeed, their propaganda worked in such a way that they believe that there are demons on our side, fascists who must be destroyed, and there is a place for heroism. They are determined that in the next life they will be saints there, probably if they destroy at least one Ukrainian there. Earlier, ArmyInform explained why suicide assaults will become more and more difficult for the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/fataliti-rosiyany-navcheni-krashhe-ale-bizhat-na-smert-tak-samo/	2024-11-11T06:37:58-08:00

The morning scares of the dictator of the Russian Federation did not lead to a volley: a signal to T...	How special were these air maneuvers of the enemy and how it is related to the big world politics, said military expert Petro Chernyk: -A large missile salvo with the use of enemy strategic aircraft Tu-95MS and Tu-22M3 was in August. Since that time, the Russians have accumulated a large combat potential. And here is a very strange moment today: 13 missile carriers and several MiG-31Ks, which are carriers of the Kh-47M2 -Kinjal-, took off - but there was no big volley. This is all tied up in big geopolitics. Trump won the presidential election in America, and Putin is giving him a signal that he may not launch missile strikes on Ukraine, but it is necessary to sit down at the negotiating table and look for some points of contact to freeze the front line in the form in which it is. Did Trump hear this signal?.. Because there is an opinion - I am not a supporter of it, by the way - that allegedly Trump already called Putin. Why I think it didn't happen: Americans don't have the habit of making any very serious decisions before the president takes office. And he will do it only on January 20. So, for the moment, we have pure geopolitics, which has not been implemented into a military tool. I repeat for the second time: this is a signal to Trump. But there is a certain danger here. Nevertheless, Putin believes that it is possible to agree on something with Trump...-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/rankovi-lyakalky-dyktatora-rf-do-zalpu-ne-pryzvely-sygnal-trampu-chy-gra-myazamy-dumka-eksperta/	2024-11-11T06:21:07-08:00
-Zombie-attacks- and -Zelenka-: why suicide assaults will be more and more difficult for the enemy	However, soon the situation will change not in their favor, because the leaves have almost fallen and it will be almost impossible to take shelter under the trees in the plantations. About this on the air of the TV channel -Espresso- told the deputy commander of the battalion of shock air defense systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault Oles Malyarevich of the brigade named after the head of the basket Ivan Sirko. - They continue not to count with [losses] in manpower - they run forward, die and their next soldiers, who run along these same paths, run between their wounded and killed and do not even take them away, run further, - he said. The officer explained the danger of such suicidal enemy attacks. — That is, such -zombie attacks- take place on the part of the occupier, but it is very effective and dangerous, because the occupier, who does not value his own life and also runs with machine guns and grenade launchers, is sometimes a problem to destroy him, to find him, because they crawl through all the basements, burrows, landings, - he explained. However, with the change of season, it will become more difficult for the Russians to storm, because natural shelters will significantly decrease. - However, now the leaves will fall, it will be a little easier, but it will be more difficult for the infantry, because they will be visible even in landings. Earlier, he ran into the landing — and that’s it, he disappeared, because we can’t destroy the entire landing with drones, — noted Oles Malyarevich.

How many dodgers does it take to cross the Moldovan border? Eight!	This was reported by 11 November State Border Service of Ukraine. As it turned out, residents of Vinnytsia, Volyn, Rivne, and Kyiv regions turned to the Telegram channel administrator for help in order to implement their plan. The latter promised to remotely lay a route to a neighboring country online. In the event of a successful transfer, the organizer would receive $3,000 from each traveler. According to the instructions of the administrator, the men were supposed to meet at a designated place and from there go together to the border. However, the route did not last long. Thanks to the technical means of border protection, the tourists were quickly detained. For the attempted illegal violation of the border against the men, protocols on administrative offenses were drawn up under Part 2 of Article 204-1 of the Code of Administrative Offenses, the cases were sent to court.

Chemical weapons or ammunition with poisonous substances: the Armed Forces explained the difference	About whether it is correct to call them chemical weapons in an interview with ArmiyaInform the spokesman of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine told Captain Dmytro Lykhoviy: — This is, in particular, about the enemy's use of hand-held gas grenades of the K-51 and RG-VO types, which are means of fighting riots and are prohibited for use as means of waging war. The definition of -chemical weapons- for these munitions is incorrect, but the use of munitions containing poisonous substances in war is also expressly prohibited by the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling, Use and Destruction of Chemical Weapons. Mostly Russians use chloracetophenone. Formally, it is not a chemical weapon. It is a combat toxic irritant. The Chemical Weapons Convention defines chloroacetophenone as a chemical anti-riot agent. It is a chemical that can quickly cause sensory irritation or physical disturbances in the human body, which disappear in a short time after the action ends. That is, tears, snorts, fogging and the like. The enemy, in addition to violating the Convention, is clearly aware of the effectiveness of these applications. Because the very means of fighting street riots is to arm the police to get the protesters to disperse and cease their actions. In the event of the use of dangerous chemicals at the front, the serviceman remains at his position - continues to be in a chemically dangerous environment. These are deliberate actions of the enemy to violate and injure our troops through the use of dangerous chemicals. * * * In an ArmyInform interview with the spokesman of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Captain Dmytro Lykhovy read also about Krynyk, the left bank of the Dnieper in Kherson Oblast, the Gulyaipil and Orihiv directions and the Robotyn ledge. Earlier, ArmyInform published a long interview with Dmitry Lyhovij about how to be a military spokesman, and also about mobilization, civilian media and the meme of the Turkish Olympic shooter.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/himichna-zbroya-chy-boyeprypasy-z-otrujnymy-rechovynamy-u-zsu-poyasnyly-vidminnist/	2024-11-11T05:08:06-08:00
Get rid of dependence on Chinese drones: demonstration flights of Ukrainian UAVs for reconnaissance ...	It is these UAVs that are used by the Armed Forces at the front, but almost all of them &#8211; foreign production, in particular &#8211; Chinese Therefore, the issue of development and production of UAVs of this class in Ukraine is one of the most urgent. The other day, the Ministry of Strategy and Industry held an event dedicated to innovations in the field of drones for reconnaissance and correction, where Ukrainian versions of the most common Chinese drone -mavik- on the front were presented. Eight non-state manufacturing firms presented their developments. During the event, the developers demonstrated drone flights, target finding and talked about their developments. One of the -Shmavik- drones has already passed codification and has been approved for purchase by the MoU and for use by the military. Another codified PTAKH-S product (in terms of performance close to DJI Matrice 30 &#8211; ed.) was also presented at the event. As noted by the Minister of Strategic Industries of Ukraine, Herman Smetanin, -today, it is impossible to completely replace the fleet of -maviks- that are operated on the territory of Ukraine in a short time, but our gunsmiths already have experience and designs, which satisfy our Security and Defense Forces. Now it is necessary to scale up production and reduce the number of foreign analogues as much as possible and switch to domestic samples. The domestic production of drones will reduce dependence on foreign purchases, as well as leave a large amount of funds in Ukraine, which will be spent on domestic production, on the purchase of weapons for the security and defense forces within our country. It is known that there was already quite a successful experience of financing the production of weapons at the expense of foreign funds, this scheme is possible. Today, both the Government of Ukraine and the Office of the President are working on attracting foreign investment to finance defense enterprises that produce defense products, including reconnaissance drones. We are grateful to our partners for every hryvnia with which they finance the production of domestic weapons.- Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Colonel Andriy Lebedenko noted the importance of the development of Ukrainian drone production: &#8211; The Ministry of Strategy and Industry supports the search for new capabilities for units of the Armed Forces in the development of domestically produced unmanned aerial vehicles that can compete with Mavik, which is in great demand today. We need to reduce our dependence on imported supplies, so in order to be able to choose the best manufacturers, we make every effort to codify developments. We have created the entire infrastructure, manufacturers through the Ministry of Strategy and Industry will be sent to specialized institutes for our tests. Today, the system, which has already been built, provides an operational opportunity to check them for the approximate combat conditions, to admit them to a soldier, to an officer who is fighting.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/pozbavytys-zalezhnosti-vid-kytajskyh-droniv-vidbulys-demonstraczijni-poloty-ukrayinskyh-bpla-dlya-rozvidky-ta-koryguvannya-vognyu/	2024-11-11T04:51:57-08:00

GUR told about the Russian drones -parody- that fell in Moldova	This was reported to the GUR of the MOU. During October 2024, Russia used more than 2,000 UAVs against Ukraine. About half of these drones are decoys or false targets, with which Russia tries to distract attention and overload Ukrainian air defense. -Parody- is one of the main decoy drones that the aggressor uses en masse in air attacks. These UAVs do not have a combat unit. They are much smaller and cheaper than the Shahed-136/Geranium-2, but due to the Lüneberg lens they mimic them in radar. The study of Russian -parodies- proved that Russia is not capable of producing even a primitive -plywood- drone on its own. The -parody- flight controller module contains components manufactured by companies from China (Ebyte, Jiashan Jinchang Electron, Yangzhou Yangjie Electronic Technology), USA (Texas Instruments, Cypress Semiconductor, InvenSense), Switzerland (STMicroelectronics) and Taiwan (SONiX Technology). As reported by ArmyInform, 5 people died in Mykolaiv a> as a result of hitting Shahed. In addition, in Zaporizhzhya due to Russian shelling a man died, another 22 people were injured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/u-gur-rozpovily-pro-rosijski-drony-parodiya-shho-vpaly-u-moldovi/	2024-11-11T04:18:52-08:00
-Shahedis- and saboteurs in the North: who and why manages to break through	toldabout what the situation is at the borders of Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv regions, on the air of the telethon -Social News-. /a> spokesman of OTU -Siversk- Colonel Vadym Mysnyk. — In recent months, such attempts [happen] not very often. First of all, we practically do not allow [DRG] measures, because the defense system has already been built, and the personnel at the border has also significantly improved combat capabilities, he said. Technical innovations are also used to detect enemy saboteurs. Therefore, despite the enemy's attempt to penetrate into the territory of Ukraine, he is not successful. — We also use technical capabilities, which allows us to timely detect such [attempts by the DRG] even under difficult natural and weather conditions. The activity of the enemy's use of anti-aircraft guns remains constant, but we keep this situation under control and do not allow penetration deep into the territories, the military officer assured. Instead, the enemy also uses the north of Ukraine to launch -Shahedy- deep into Ukrainian territory. — Also, the northern direction, namely Sumyshchyna and Chernihiv region, is a strategic direction for the enemy regarding the approach of the -Shakheds- to the territory of Ukraine. This constantly happens every night, if they come in - mostly in the dark, but they can come in during the day as well, - said the spokesman. The defense forces are doing their best to shoot down enemy UAVs, but the length of the border is long, and the enemy is constantly improving methods of penetrating into Ukrainian airspace. — Over the past few days, we have observed significant such mass actions of drones. We are hitting them, but it is hundreds of kilometers [of the border] and the enemy is also trying to change routes, they are changing tactics, Vadym Mysnyk explained. Despite this, the Defense Forces are doing everything possible to protect the airspace of Ukraine. ArmyInform previously reported that in the north of Ukraine, the occupiers attack primarily with long-range weapons.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/shahedy-ta-dyversanty-na-pivnochi-komu-j-chomu-vdayetsya-proryvatysya/	2024-11-11T03:57:24-08:00

From the depths of enemy territory: the occupiers are striking with long-range weapons in the North ...	talked about what exactly the occupiers are hitting along the Ukrainian border on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- telethon spokesman of OTU -Siversk-, Colonel Vadym Mysnyk. — The enemy uses the entire available arsenal of weapons whenever possible. They mostly strike from deep within their territory. These are air strikes, FPV drones, dropping explosive devices from UAVs. They also use MLRS, he said. According to the military, this is the kind of weaponry that allows the enemy to attack the North of Ukraine from deep within its own territory. However, currently most of the shelling still falls on the aggressor state's own territory — a section of the Kursk region temporarily controlled by the Defense Forces of Ukraine. As the spokesman reported, the intensity of shelling in Kurshchyna is consistently twice or even three times higher than the intensity of shelling in the territory of Ukraine. — That is, we also transfer these indicators there. But the enemy is constantly striking both along the border and deep into our regions, they are trying to exert this pressure, - noted the officer. Depriving the Russian aggressors of the ability to shell the territory of Ukraine is possible only with the help of their own long-range weapons. -We desperately need a long-range weapon with the permission of our partners for its full use, so that we can already have a concrete influence on this,- emphasized Vadimy Mysnyk. Earlier, ArmyInform explained, for what purpose the enemy does not reduce the intensity of shelling in the North.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/z-glybyny-vorozhoyi-terytoriyi-po-pivnochi-ukrayiny-okupanty-byut-dalekobijnoyu-zbroyeyu/	2024-11-11T03:27:09-08:00
They wanted to burn a combat helicopter - 3 arsonists were detained in Kirovohrad Oblast	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on November 11. In addition, the perpetrators wanted to destroy one of the key electrical substations in the region in order to leave tens of thousands of local residents without electricity. The law enforcement officers detained the attackers in time, and thanks to this, they saved the combat helicopter of the Defense Forces and an important energy facility. In addition, in Poltava Oblast, a recidivist was exposed who burned a military jeep that was involved in the performance of tasks on the Eastern Front. According to the investigation, the suspect was previously criminally responsible for stealing a car, and in the fall of 2024 he received an order from Russia to set fire to the vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine . And in the Cherkasy region, a 34-year-old resident of the region was detained, who set fire to a transformer substation that provided rail traffic in one of the regions' sections. All the detainees were recruited by the enemy when they were looking for -easy- earnings in Telegram channels. However, instead of the promised funds from the Russian Federation, the suspects received suspicion from Ukrainian law enforcement officers. Currently, all detainees have been notified of suspicion (according to the crimes committed) under three articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: — Part 2 of Art. 113 (sabotage committed under martial law); — Part 1 of Art. 114-1 (obstructing the legal activity of the Armed Forces); — Part 2 of Art. 194 (intentional destruction or damage to property).

At this time, it is known that seven people were injured, among them two children. The emergency rescue operation is ongoing, the maximum is being done for rescue. There may be people under the rubble,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote. . He reminded that every day, every night, Russia commits the same terror. -Unless an increasing number of civilian objects are becoming targets. Russia seeks only the continuation of the war, and each of its blows refutes any statements from Russia about diplomacy.

The length of the border is shorter within the borders of Chernihiv Oblast, as well as within the borders of Kharkiv Oblast, the border guard noted.

Almost always, the occupiers hit civilian infrastructure and local residents. - These shellings, unfortunately, fall on populated areas, as a result of which civilians living in border areas are killed. There are deaths, injuries to people, and destruction of infrastructure. In fact, Russia does not cease to confirm its status as a terrorist state by taking such actions, he said. At the same time, the spokesman of the State Border Service of Ukraine noted that in the Sumy region, attempts by hostile subversive and reconnaissance groups were also observed, although the number of such attempts or the activity of enemy DRGs has significantly decreased in the last period.

In the Moscow region, an attack helicopter Mi-24 — GUR was burned	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on November 11. The burned enemy helicopter belonged to the 92nd squadron of the 344th center of combat use and retraining of the air force of the army aviation of the Russian Federation. The GUR reminds that for every war crime committed against Ukraine, the occupier will receive a fair punishment. As ArmiyaInform reported, on November 9, 2024, Ukrainian military intelligence intercepted radio talks the North Korean military involved in the war against Ukraine by Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/u-moskovskij-oblasti-spalyly-shturmovyj-gelikopter-mi-24-gur/	2024-11-10T22:54:05-08:00
The commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces worked in parts and units in the Kursk direction	He wrote about this on his page on the morning of November 11. -If it weren't for the resilience of our soldiers, these tens of thousands of enemies from the best Russian shock units would have stormed our positions in the Pokrovsky, Kurakhiv or Toretsk directions, which would have significantly worsened the situation at the front. Now, following the order of their military leadership, they are trying to dislodge our troops and advance deep into the territory we control. Our task in this direction is to deter and destroy the enemy on his land,- said the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to him, the work was devoted to providing assistance to commanders in the organization of combat operations, increasing the effectiveness of fire damage to the enemy, and solving issues of comprehensive support and preparation of reserves. -I am grateful to our soldiers for their steadfastness and bravery in the fight against the Russian aggressor. Glory to Ukraine!- Oleksandr Syrskyi wrote. As reported by ArmyInform, General Alexander Syrsky held another telephone conversation with the commander of the US armed forces in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/golovnokomanduvach-zsu-praczyuvav-u-chastynah-i-pidrozdilah-na-kurskomu-napryamku/	2024-11-10T22:42:24-08:00
The Left Bank, cable crossing and chemical weapons: how the South of Ukraine was defended in the sum...	In the continuation of ArmiyaInform's interview with the spokesman of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Captain Dmytro Lykhoviei, read about Krynky, the left bank of the Dnieper in Kherson Oblast, the Gulyaipil and Orikhov directions and the Robotynsky ledge, as well as the difference between chemical weapons and ammunition with poisonous substances. The first part of the interview: What it's like to be a military spokesperson: Captain Lykhovy on mobilization, civil media and the famous Turkish Olympic shooter - What was the situation in the South of Ukraine in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Tavria- air defense missile system when you were there on a business trip and acted as a spokesperson? - This year I had two business trips. The first - in the operational and strategic group of troops -Tavria-, to the zone of responsibility of which the Avdiyiv direction belonged, the second - in the operational group of troops -Tavria-, in the zone of which were the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions. If in the East during the first mission the situation was tense and controlled, then in the South it was controlled and stabilized. In the huge zone of responsibility of the Tavria anti-aircraft missile system, from the sea to Donetsk region, in August and at the beginning of September, there were sometimes even days when no enemy assaults took place. Often there were several enemy infantry attacks that could be counted on the fingers of one hand. At the same time, about 50 combat clashes per day could take place in the Pokrovsky direction alone, which refers to the Khortytsia air defense system. According to my conclusion, the Russians lacked (and now lack) the forces and means to conduct active offensive actions in many directions at the same time. Although this does not mean that we in Tavria had some kind of -lull-. After all, the enemy actively used artillery, attack aircraft, guided aerial bombs, unguided aerial missiles and other means of destruction every day. —What was the Ukrainian society interested in then, which news reports about the situation in the South attracted the most attention?—The media was most interested in the situation with the withdrawal of units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine from the village of Krynka on the left bank of the Dnieper in the Kherson region. This is actually what started my rotation. It was also about the prospects of the enemy's offensive in the Zaporizhzhia region and details about the nature of the Russian assaults, the results of the combat work of our units in terms of defeating the enemy's personnel, weapons and military equipment, and capturing them. I can single out the regular comments I gave for regional media. We have developed very high-quality cooperation with Zaporizhia and Kherson media regarding the situation in specific regions. I prepared for them special information reports on shades in these areas, which took into account the specifics there. I would like to single out the local editorial offices of -Suspilny- as an example of the high-quality work of regional media. —You mentioned Krynyk. Was it possible to communicate this moment with the bridgeheads on the left bank of the Dnieper, to explain to society what is happening there and why exactly this is happening? — The beginning of my rotation at the Strategic Communications Center of the Taviya Air Force Base fell on the period when, in July, units of the Defense Forces — marines and others - finally withdrew from the village of Krynky on the left bank Dnipro. After all, this settlement was completely destroyed by a long-term complex fire attack on the part of the Russians, there was no longer anything to hold on to. Actually, Krynky ceased to be a settlement a long time ago. At the same time, our troops continued to hold other designated positions and bridgeheads on the left bank of the Kherson region, not allowing the enemy to take control of the Dnieper riverbed. In particular, intensive combat operations by units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine continued with the Russian invaders on the islands in the Dnipro river delta - Milky, Kozatskyi, Bilogrudiy and a number of others. The specifics of the terrain there are such that it is difficult to use a significant force of attack aircraft and armored vehicles, instead, you have to use boats, jet skis, etc. for logistics. These enemy vessels were regularly destroyed by our forces. At one point, even a rope crossing across one of the straits was affected. - And how did the occupiers act in other areas - where there were no such water obstacles? - As a rule, the Russian occupiers carried out assault operations in small infantry groups of up to a detachment. Sometimes it was from 3-4 to 8-10 people. Attacked without the use of armored vehicles, but with extensive use of light equipment, ranging from motorcycles, buggies and the like. For the first time to resort to such tactics, in my memory, they started in February-March 2024. Half a year later, mass use of this tactic began. All this happened during my rotations at OSUV and OUV. The same can be said about the use of ground robotic platforms - in six months, from March to August, it went from the first attempts to mass use. That is, being a member of the military administration, I was able to see for myself how the tactics of conducting military operations change in half a year, how technological innovations become common tools for use on the front line. — How did the situation on the Gulyaipil and Orihiv directions change during this time? —In the Gulyaipil direction, from mid-July to mid-September, the enemy actually avoided infantry attacks (for example, in August there were only two). Announcements by some Western media, in particular the German newspaper -Bild-, about the preparation of a massive offensive by Russians from Pologhi to Gulyapole, although they alarmed the inhabitants of the Zaporizhzhia region, did not come true. In fact, there were no drastic changes in the nature and actions of the enemy, and no signs of the formation of an offensive group were detected. Then I kept stressing it, calming the audience down. I believe that I have fulfilled my mission, and this was true and objective information. In August, several units of brigades and battalions of the armed forces of the Russian Federation were redeployed from Zaporozhye to the Kursk direction. Thanks to this, the threat to Gulyaipol has decreased. In the Orikhov direction, the main fighting took place around the Robotynsky ledge. There, the enemy had little tactical success in some places, but for more than half a year of attempted assault actions, the Russians were still not able to completely -drain- the salient, which was deoccupied by the Defense Forces of Ukraine in 2023. In some cases, on the contrary, our units improved their tactical position, established or restored observation posts, firing positions. It was in this direction that the Russians suffered the greatest losses in manpower and equipment. In the Dnieper operational direction, as I have already mentioned, at the beginning of my term of office, units of the Defense Forces were withdrawn from the village of Krynka to other positions and continued to conduct a defensive operation, also on the left bank of the Dnieper, about which there was appropriate communication. At the same time, in all directions, the Russians actively used artillery, attack drones, such as Lancet and Privet. Also, the enemy massively used drops from drones and strike aircraft - hit with KABs (guided aerial bombs) and NARs (unguided aerial missiles). Our units also inflicted complex fire damage on enemy positions. —The reports of the Tavria military intelligence agency often referred to the use of chemical weapons by the Russian military. Please tell us more about it. — Every month, the Command of the Support Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine provides general statistics on chemical attacks by Russian troops against the Defense Forces and conclusions on their dynamics. The messages of the spokesperson of the -Tavria- OUV referred to a part of these statistics in a specific operational area. During the period of large-scale armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the enemy, along with the use of conventional means of fire damage, uses special ammunition equipped with dangerous chemical substances against the Defense Forces. The definition of -chemical weapons- in relation to these munitions is incorrect, but the use of munitions with poisonous substances in war is also expressly prohibited by the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction.) This is, in particular, the use of hand gas grenades by the enemy type K-51 and RG-VO, which are means of combating riots and prohibited for use as means of warfare. Mostly Russians use chloracetophenone. Formally, it is not a chemical weapon. It is a combat poison of irritant action. The Chemical Weapons Convention defines chloroacetophenone as a chemical anti-riot agent. It is a chemical that can quickly cause irritation of the senses or physical disorders in the human body, which disappear after a short time after the action ends. That is, tears, snorts, fogging and the like. The enemy, in addition to violating the Convention, is clearly aware of the effectiveness of these applications. Because the very means of fighting street riots is to arm the police to get the protesters to disperse and cease their actions. In the event of the use of dangerous chemicals at the front, the serviceman remains at his position - continues to be in a chemically dangerous environment. These are deliberate actions of the enemy to violate and injure our troops through the use of dangerous chemicals. For example, there is a dugout or a trench, the Russians try to demolish them with artillery, drops from UAVs, FPV drones, sometimes UAVs. Despite this, several servicemen continue to hold defense in the dugout. When occupiers see the ineffectiveness of other means of destruction, they use munitions containing poisonous substances, which are prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention. Thus, during August, the enemy dropped 196 munitions with poisonous substances from UAVs in the operational area of ​​the Tavria air defense system. Relatively more - in the Zaporizhzhia region, but also in the Kherson region, many such cases were recorded. - As for incendiary ammunition, how often did the Russians use them? What exactly? — In addition to poisonous substances, the enemy uses drops with incendiary substances. This is another set of weapons based on using the combat capabilities of incendiary substances to destroy defensive positions. The statistics of their use are much lower than the discharge of ammunition with poisonous substances. The Russians resorted to this tactic, in particular, on the Dnieper islands, where it is easy to cause a fire and in this way forced the o/s to leave the position. —You kept statistics of enemy losses in the South. Can you share the general results for the time you were in the position of the spokesperson of the Tavria military command center? - Daily filling of tables in Exel format is a convenient way to track the trends of combat operations, both in terms of the number of assaults and shelling, as well as in terms of damage statistics. In July, the enemy lost 1,371 units of weapons and military equipment in the operational zone of the -Tavria- anti-aircraft missile system, in August - 1,041, and in the middle of September - about 400. That is, the statistics gradually decreased. These are the data based on the daily official summaries of the -Tavria- OUV. —Finally, I want to return to the question of the main message that, in your opinion, military communicators should convey to society. What and how should Ukrainians be informed first of all? - The task of military communicators is to maintain constant communication between the fighting army and the rest of society. To do our best to ensure that this connection is not lost, because a part of our society, perhaps, the further from the front line, the more calmed down it is. And the further from the beginning of a full-scale invasion, the less the desire to mobilize, the stronger the desire to sit in the rear. In fact, nothing is over. In my opinion, the best way to communicate in the military is objective information, as well as communication of problems that have been solved. I believe that problems cannot be kept silent, they must be identified and responded to. At the same time, we should also talk about many real positive points that exist in the army. It should also be explained that the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Defense Forces of Ukraine as a whole, is a large complex organism in which there is a place for everyone. Perhaps, and within the limits of his civilian profession. Because the army also needs builders, tractor drivers, truck drivers, accountants, lawyers, cooks, journalists - almost all civilian specialties. After becoming military personnel, they will actually continue to work in their profession, but at the same time will be part of the Defense Forces and will contribute to the defense of Ukraine, while receiving decent financial support, benefits and public respect.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/livyj-bereg-kanatna-pereprava-ta-himichna-zbroya-yak-boronyly-pivden-ukrayiny-vlitku-2024-go/	2024-11-10T22:41:39-08:00

The assault group of Russians was advancing through a forest strip when it was stopped and partially hit by artillery fire. Then our drones further -polished- the occupiers. But some of the invaders were able to get stuck in the cracks and required surgical removal. The scalpel of the operation was the Leopard tank, which drove up close and shot the Russians. Friendly escort was provided by the M113 armored car. -The occupiers turned the wrong way - their group was met with merciless discharges and fire from artillery brigade units. But later, the deep and dark situation in which they found themselves became even more critical. The dark avenger -Leo- and our predator -M-ka- went to the field,- commented the video in the brigade. &nbsp; As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 33rd mechanized brigade suddenly destroyed the enemy armored personnel carrier with the help of a daring tank attack.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/svyata-trijczya-bpla-arta-i-duh-svyatyj-leopard-borotba-z-pihotnoyu-nechystyu-voroga/	2024-11-10T21:19:49-08:00
The enemy carried out fifty airstrikes and over 600 drone strikes — General Staff of the Armed Force...	Operational information as of at 22.00 on November 10 was published by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The defense forces are directing efforts to disrupt the execution of the Russian invaders' offensive plans and exhaust their combat potential. In the Kharkiv direction, one skirmish continues near Vovchansk. Five enemy attacks have already been repelled by our defenders in the districts of Starytsia and Vovchansk. The enemy used aviation and carried out three airstrikes, dropping 4 anti-aircraft missiles in the areas of Kharkiv, Vilcha and Vilkhuvatka settlements. The enemy launched three attacks on our fortifications in the Kupyan direction. At this time, all of them in the districts of Kindrashyvka, Zagryzovy and Zeleny Gayu have already been repelled. On the Lymanskyi direction, Russian troops stormed the positions of Ukrainian defenders five times during the day in the areas of Terny, Torske and Serebryanka settlements. All enemy attacks are stopped. The defenders of the Ukrainian land are restraining the onslaught of the enemy in the Siversk direction, currently one enemy attack is underway in the area of ​​the Verkhnokamianske settlement. In the Kramatorsk direction, three attempts by the invaders to advance near Stupochky and Chasovoy Yar ended in failure. The enemy launched airstrikes in the areas of Chasovoy Yar and Sloviansk. In the Toretsk direction, the occupiers stormed the Toretsk and Shcherbinivka districts 14 times today. There, as well as near Shcherbinivka, enemy aviation was active. Fighting continues in six locations. The enemy is intensively attacking the Ukrainian defenders in the Pokrovsky direction. During the day, he carried out a total of 35 assault and offensive operations. The Russian occupiers are most active in the areas of Myrolyubivka, Promenya, Hryhorivka, Selidovoy, Lysivka, Sukhoi Yar, and Petrivka. Nine clashes in the direction are still ongoing. The enemy used aviation means of destruction in the areas of the settlements of Lysivka, Kotlyne, Sukha Balka, Oleksandropil. According to preliminary calculations, today our soldiers eliminated 145 and injured 204 occupiers. Two units of automobile equipment, two UAV control points, a buggy and a quad bike were destroyed. Two units of automobile equipment, one howitzer and a quad bike were also damaged. At this time of the day, there are 46 clashes in the Kurakhiv direction. Enemy attacks were repelled by our soldiers near the settlements of Illinka, Vozdvizhenka, Novoselidivka, Novodmytrivka, Sontsivka, Maksimilianivka, Antonivka, Dalnye and Katerynivka. Four attacks are still ongoing. The occupiers dropped anti-aircraft missiles in the areas of Kurakhove, Romanivka and Dachne settlements. In the direction of Vremivka, the enemy tried 13 times to break through to Trudovoy, Konstantinopolsky, Uspenivka, and Makarivka, but our courageous defenders stood in the way of this. Eight attacks have already been repelled. At the same time, the enemy actively used aviation means of destruction in the areas of Andriivka, Velyka Novosilka, Novodarivka and Zelene Pole settlements. In the Orihiv direction, the occupiers twice tried to break through our defenses in the areas of Novoandriivka and Malaya Tokmachka, and at the same time launched an airstrike on Temyrivka. In the Dnieper direction, the operational situation has not changed significantly. The enemy conducted seven unsuccessful assaults. There were no significant changes in the situation in other directions. Today we will celebrate the Ukrainian soldiers from the 110th Territorial Defense Brigade and the 124th Territorial Defense Brigade, who are steadfastly holding back the onslaught of overwhelming enemy forces on the Eastern Front. -Let's beat the enemy and bring our Victory closer! -Glory to Ukraine!- - said in a message from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, occupiers became active in the Vremivsk direction. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/vorog-zavdav-pivsotni-aviaczijnyh-udariv-i-ponad-600-udariv-dronamy-genshtab-zsu/	2024-11-10T21:02:41-08:00
Cartridges are collected even in Britain: at Interflex, automatic machines are -falling apart-	The correspondent of ArmyInform tells about rifle training during the BZVP within the borders of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. Most of us hold a machine gun for the first time in our lives, so we don't notice anything strange. However, Ukrainian instructors accompanying us during training in Britain, as well as those who served in Ukraine, note the unusualness of the Kalashnikov assault rifles issued to us for training. Indeed, this is not an AK-74 or any other modifications common in Ukraine, such as the AKS, although at first glance, and especially from a distance, it is difficult to distinguish them even for an experienced shooter. However, if someone who has dealt with the AK family of automatic weapons in Ukraine takes the weapon issued by the British in his hands, he will see a lot of differences, some of which are quite significant. How Britain trains the Ukrainian military in Great Britain / BFBS Forces News report The most noticeable detail that immediately catches the eye is the bright yellow muzzle, which is neither a muzzle brake nor a flamethrower . This is a compensator device that is an adapter for blank firing. It is designed to contain and divert powder gases to the side during firing with a blank cartridge. However, it is not this most noticeable detail that determines the fundamental difference between the machine guns issued to us and the AK-74, because if necessary, a similar or similar compensator can be installed on any model of the AK family. The fundamental differences are different and not so obvious until you pick up the weapon. Among the details that are immediately obvious even to a novice, the most noticeable are also the unusual folding tubular stock and the duplicate safety / fire switch on the pistol grip under the right thumb. With the example, the situation is about the same as with the adapter for blank firing - nothing fundamentally different from the usual AK modifications. The second fuse, on the other hand, is actually a very unusual thing that will cause a number of problems for some of us. The caliber of cartridges is also unusual - these are not the traditional 7.62 mm or 5.45 mm cartridges on our territory. It is a caliber of 5.56 mm of the NATO standard, intermediate in its power between cartridges for pistols and cartridges for rifles. This caliber was adopted as the second standard service rifle cartridge for NATO forces in 1980. Since then, it has spread not only in the countries of the North Atlantic Alliance, but also beyond it. After all, even replicas of the AK, the main individual small arms of the USSR and the Warsaw Pact Organization, which were the main antagonists of NATO during the Cold War, began to be produced under the 5.56 mm cartridge. In particular, such modifications were created in Bulgaria by the armory company -Arsenal-. The most famous Bulgarian modifications of the Kalashnikov assault rifle, including those chambered for the 5.56 mm cartridge, were the AR-M1 / AR-M1F and AR-M9 / AR-M9F. The letter -F- is used to denote the folding tubular metal stock, which helps to identify the AKs made by Arsenal's Bulgarian gunsmiths. Due to the availability of a significant number of 5.56 mm cartridges, the Ministry of Defense of Great Britain purchased and uses for training Ukrainian military Kalashnikov assault rifles of the AR-M9F model. This particular model has a right-hand thumb safety/fire switch and a folding tubular stock, as well as a number of other less significant features such as a polymer buttstock or pistol grip. Ukrainians train with Bulgarian AKs manufactured by Arsenal We get used to the weapons we receive quite quickly - they are really high-quality and easy-to-use automatic weapons for training in handling weapons and shooting during basic general military training. In terms of basic parameters, the AR-M9F is almost identical to the AK-74. However, the AR-M9F has a number of disadvantages. Oddly enough, it's primarily a collapsible tubular stock and a duplicate safety/fire switch on the pistol grip. These improvements of the Bulgarian gunsmiths created some problems for some of us. It is really very convenient to remove the weapon from the safety or to put the machine on the safety with a slight movement of the thumb of the right hand. However, the AK-74 in Ukraine does not have such an improvement, so the instructors forbade the use of a duplicate fuse. In conclusion, those of us who, for the sake of speed, tried to use the fuses on the sleeves without the instructors noticing, did ourselves a disservice. After returning to Ukraine, they had to get used to the usual AK-74 fuse. However, there were practically no offenders who regularly used a backup fuse. The instructors were vigilant, and we ourselves understood how negative the consequences of faulty muscle memory can be on the battlefield in Ukraine. Instead, the problem with the tubular stock was of a different nature. After long-term use in some submachine guns, the butt assembly attachment loosened, which obviously had an extremely negative effect on the accuracy and accuracy of the shot. To prevent this, we were forbidden to make an example. The ban on folding the stock helped, but not enough - as a result of long intensive training, the machines could not withstand and sometimes practically -crumbled- in someone's hands. It cannot be said that it was too massive, but the depletion of weapons was significant. So the aiming bar, which fell off during shooting due to vibration, did not surprise anyone. To be fair, the problematic weapon was replaced immediately. My first machine gun, which regularly jammed from the first day of shooting, was replaced already on the next field trip. After that, there were no problems with the re-received weapon until the very end of the training. In the same way, problematic submachine guns were also exchanged for other soldiers of the platoon. The British were extremely careful with their weapons and meticulously inspected them for the slightest complaint. Our Danish instructors demanded of us the same careful attitude towards the machines. The instructors were no less scrupulous about collecting cartridges after training. However, such vigilance when it came to empty cartridges was caused not in any way by the need to count all the fired cartridges and collect all the casings from them, so that the number of cartridges issued clearly coincided with the number of cartridges. During the firing of empty cartridges, no one counted their number, so it was possible to replenish the ammunition, filling the stores to the brim, as needed at any time. I think that each of us fired about 800 to 1,200 blank rounds during training. However, the lack of record of empty cartridges did not exempt from the obligation to carefully select cartridges in thick grass or among fallen leaves and brushwood. This was done in order not to pollute the environment, and also because the collected cartridges were processed for the production of new batches of empty cartridges. What's more, cardboard boxes from cartridges, which were asked not to be torn, were also collected in a separate bag. These neatly opened boxes were not thrown into the trash, but were also to be used for repackaging cartridges. Such -recycling- in the British way may seem trivial to someone, but a combination of care for the environment, frugality and strict adherence to really useful and important rules cannot fail to command respect. By demanding compliance with these and other simple rules, the instructors strengthened our discipline, brought up a responsible, cautious and careful attitude to weapons, taught us to strictly observe safety measures. All this later came in handy during the firing of live cartridges, when the instructors' requirements for compliance with safety measures and cartridge control became significantly stricter.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/gilzy-zbyrayut-navit-u-brytaniyi-na-interflex-avtomaty-azh-rozsypayutsya/	2024-11-10T20:54:14-08:00
How the Armed Forces forced the Buryats to jump: the story of a soldier who mastered everything from...	How is it to be on the defensive when you are assaulted three times a day? What tricks do the occupiers resort to on the front line? The soldier told our correspondent about this: -In the summer of 2022, I took part in the assaults. It was the Neskuchny, Velika Novosilka district. After one of the storms, I went to the hospital: I was wounded in my right heel, it was torn by a splinter. Nothing like that, the bones were intact, just tore the foot&#8230; In 2023, we were assigned to the 1st tank division and held positions near one of the villages in the south. It was already autumn-winter last year. It was difficult there, the enemy attacked us three times a day. In such difficult situations, the most important thing is that the soldiers in the positions do not withdraw into themselves, continue to communicate with their comrades, and listen to experienced fighters. It is important to take more ammunition to the position. Because this is not a very good option when the fighter takes a lot of stew, and BC - only four stores. If you yourself do not bring more BC to the position, then no one will do it for you. During the war, I mastered many types of weapons, from the RPG-7 to the M-240 and the Browning M2, but I loved the RPG the most. Because you can take this -pipe-, as it is called, and walk with it: I can find shots in almost any trench, ammunition is in everyone, they are interchangeable. Once upon a time, we carried out assault operations in Velika Novosilka. And there, the enemy AGS started working on our boys. Then the group commander told us to try to suppress him. This AGS behind the houses stood diagonally to us, and we saw it a little. With two shots from the RPG-7, we didn't just suppress him, we cut him down altogether. In one of the settlements in the south, I remember, we had two positions. The commander then ordered me to install American Claymore mines in front of them. It is an analogue of the Soviet MON-50. And then one day the Russians came to storm us again. They always entered from three sides: in the center and from two flanks. The battle began and we blew up those Claymores on both the left and right sides. Then the enemy was well mowed down by these mines. Then we captured two Russians. We squeezed them in a pincer between our two positions. One 19-year-old boy from Kamchatka did not hesitate. And the second one - a Buryat, he was 40 years old - even jumped on a mine in order to destroy the convoy group and himself. In the same area, the Russians had a custom of making -horseshoes- from their corpses. Because all the plantations there were already destroyed, only the stumps themselves. Then the occupiers placed three corpses of their comrades in front of them between two tree stumps, they also placed them on their sides and made a window between the bodies to conduct fire. In the same way, Russians often hid under the bodies of their dead after assaults in order to save their lives. Because then our drone could not see them very much.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/yak-zsu-prymusyly-buryata-strybaty-istoriya-voyina-yakyj-opanuvav-vse-vid-rpg-7-do-m-240-i-dvoma-postrilamy-vyrubyv-vorozhyj-ags/	2024-11-10T20:40:43-08:00
-Crush- everything: Israeli designers have created a laser installation that will shoot down UAVs, m...	How informs the official portal of this high-tech weapons manufacturer from Haifa, the latest defense equipment was recently presented at the largest military exhibition in North America AUSA, which is organized by the Association of the US Army, reports ArmyInform. The device Lite Beam (-Light beam-, in Ukrainian) is designed to quickly neutralize aerial threats, including swarms of drones. This 10 kW laser system is designed to enhance force protection during mobile ground operations, combining economy with cost-effective use. Lite Beam is part of Rafael's strategy to expand the use of directed energy weapons to counter a variety of air and ground threats. This mobile model is an adaptation of the Rafael system Iron Beam (- Iron beam- - in Ukrainian), a fixed laser with a power of 100 kW, capable of destroying targets at a distance of several kilometers. These weapons can be mounted from light vehicles and deployed in a variety of operational areas, allowing to counter a wide range of threats, from drones and missiles to mortar shells. In addition, the system can neutralize identified improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and other ground-based threats, increasing its versatility on the battlefield. The new version of the Lite Beam presented at AUSA 2024 has an updated increased power compared to previous models of 7.5 kW, matching similar systems such as Jupiter from MBDA and Rheinmetall. With an effective range of several hundred meters to approximately 2 km, the Lite Beam excels in its ability to accurately track targets with an advanced tracking system that can also be integrated into other anti-drone systems (C-UAVs). Design modularity allows the Lite Beam to be installed on a variety of platforms, including armored vehicles, ships, and fixed land platforms. As for the source of consumed energy, this combat laser station can be powered by diesel generators or batteries depending on the operational needs. One of the key features of the Iron Beam is its lower cost per shot compared to conventional interceptor missiles. Each Iron Beam intercept is valued at $1,000, which is significantly lower than the $40-$50,000 per Tamir missile the Israelis use in the Iron Dome (-Iron dome- in Ukrainian) from the same Rafael. Other international players are rapidly developing high-energy laser technologies: in particular, MBDA, Rheinmetall, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are also developing 10 kW solutions. Among them is the ATHENA from Lockheed Martin allows multiple lasers to be combined to achieve an output power of 30 kW, while HELWS from Raytheon is designed for extreme mobility and can be mounted on a simple pickup truck. Although this technology is still in the early stages of development with many systems being researched or tested, it offers promising potential for future defense applications. Lite Beam's ability to provide fast and accurate laser protection in a mobile format highlights Rafael's achievements in this field, positioning it as a potentially strategic tool to counter emerging threats. The Rafael laser installation has an unlimited -store- of cartridges, which allows you to use it without the need for reloading. In addition, no fragments of intercepted targets remain after the shot, which reduces the risk of collateral damage. According to the authors of the publication Army Recognition, this is especially important in the context of the conflict in Israel, where the country's air defense forces faced a shortage of ammunition for Iron Dome. Analysts cite data from Israeli economists who note that the war in Gaza has already cost the Israeli economy more than $67.3 billion, but the use of high-energy lasers such as Iron Beam or British DragonFire, about which in its publications repeatedly ArmyInform told, it also has its own problems. Atmospheric conditions such as clouds or rain can affect the ability of the beam to reach the target. Because the laser must remain focused on a moving target for several seconds to provide enough energy to destroy it. This requirement can limit its effectiveness against multiple threats at once, such as a barrage of missiles. In addition, some targets may be protected by materials resistant to laser attacks, which may reduce the effectiveness of the system. High-energy Iron Beam laser weapons system.

And again, nuclear blackmail: the Russian Federation took out a dirty bomb from the closet	However, in reality, such statements are part of the systematic nuclear blackmail of the Russian Federation, aimed at discrediting Ukraine, and are false. Russian statements about the so-called -dirty bomb- serve as a cover for its own actions that pose a threat to international nuclear security. This is written by the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security. Russia itself has repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons, occupied the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, and also provokes fears about possible incidents at the Zaporizhzhia and Kursk nuclear power plants. Russian forces are also moving tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus and conducting exercises using the nuclear arsenal, which is causing concern to the world community. Such Russian fakes aim not only to discredit the Ukrainian leadership, but also to divert attention from their own crimes in the nuclear arena. Statements about the possibility of Ukraine using nuclear weapons are purposeful propaganda aimed at undermining international trust in Ukraine and justifying further nuclear escalation on the part of Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/i-znovu-yadernyj-shantazh-rf-distala-z-shafy-brudnu-bombu/	2024-11-10T20:11:28-08:00

-Our first assault was just on Easter-: -Otaman- from the TCC told about his service in the assault ...	His story was told in OK -Pivnich-. Currently, 56-year-old Oleksandr Boyko is a military officer of the Eighth Department of Poltava District TCC and SP — Mashiv Poltava District TCC and SP. -I quickly put things in order, gathered myself and came to the TCC on March 1, where I mobilized to the Armed Forces. Although they didn't really want to take it, because they are 53 years old, they have enough ailments: hypertension, diabetes, weight 140 kg. I have had to take a handful of pills every morning for years. But all the same, it is necessary to protect the Motherland - who, if not us? And he didn't think about the difficulties, he had to, and he left,- Sergeant Oleksandr Boyko says. A few days later, representatives of the separate combined assault unit -Odin- came to the department and offered Oleksandr Boyko to join its ranks. I agreed. The formed unit was sent to the training center in Chernihiv region for coordination. Later, the platoon was sent to perform combat missions in the Sumy region near the Russian border. Their task was to hold positions, preventing a possible penetration of the enemy's DRG. There were shellings, but there was no direct fighting during that period, notes the sergeant. With a surplus, this -peace- was compensated later - on the outskirts of Liman, in Serebryan Forestry. -Our first assault was just on Easter. They received an order to storm the position taken by the Russians. We walked through the forest for several kilometers. They carried only BC and water - no food was taken. The battle was expected to last 4-5 minutes, but it lasted more than 20. There were about 80 of them, and 27 of us. But we still fought back what we had,- says the sergeant. Two weeks later, Oleksandr received a contusion and injury. After several months of treatment and rehabilitation, Oleksandr returned to the Eighth Department of the Poltava District TCC and SP in Mashivka. The state of health requires constant treatment, so he periodically has to return to the hospital, the soldier admits. So far, he is not considering the possibility of dismissal from the ranks of the Armed Forces, because he sees that civilian men are in no hurry to defend the country. -Men don't want to come here to protect their families - mothers, children, women. On the contrary, they hide behind their women. I don't know how they have enough conscience! I can't do that,- says -Otaman-. Among his responsibilities now, in addition to protection, there is also notification of citizens. It is necessary to communicate a lot with conscripts, check documents, issue summonses for clarification of data or passing of the VLK. The most difficult thing, the sergeant notes, is when people do not understand what military duty is. They start scandalizing, insulting, humiliating. They often ask why he does not fight himself. -It is so insulting in my soul that I fought for myself and for them, shed blood, and they are not only hiding, but also dissatisfied. But go fight yourselves, we have already won back ours. If you love your family, your children, you must go to protect them. Don't people realize that they won't be able to do anything when the enemy gets here?-, says the sergeant. ArmyInform reminds you of the opportunity to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/10/pershyj-nash-shturm-buv-yakraz-na-velykden-otaman-z-tczk-rozpoviv-pro-sluzhbu-v-shturmovomu-pidrozdili/	2024-11-10T09:43:24-08:00

About this on the air -Suspilne news- told the commander of the battalion of attack unmanned aircraft complexes -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket chieftain Ivan Sirk, captain Yury Fedorenko. According to Yury Fedorenko, the enemy did not manage to fully gain a foothold on the left bank of the Oskil River in the settlements of Kruglyakivka and Kotlyarivka. However, the enemy continues its attacks — it constantly sends additional manpower to the assaults, its cheapest resource. -Recently, the weather conditions were favorable, now the leaves have fallen in the forest plantations, a count was made on a small strip by the number of Russians killed. In one landing, 127 servicemen, representatives of the occupying forces, are now lying dead. And they continue to walk over the corpses, on their own,- Yuriy Fedorenko said.

The occupiers first forced people to register real estate according to Russian legislation, and now they are looking for unregistered housing and property. To do this, the ions go around houses, study all documents, even respond to advertisements and comments on the Internet. Housing taken from Ukrainians has already begun to be sold -as a mortgage- to Russian mercenaries, security forces, local traitors and imported -specialists-. -Extortion of the property of Ukrainian civilians on the TOT is a war crime. All transactions made regarding property in the occupied territory are invalid, Ukrainians remain the legal owners of the property on the TOT,- Ivan Fedorov stressed. As reported by ArmyInform, in October the Russian occupiers dropped in the South of Ukraine, about 500 bombs, and in the first days of November - about 150.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/10/vorog-posylyv-majnovyj-tysk-na-ukrayincziv-na-tot-zaporizkoyi-oblasti/	2024-11-10T07:31:47-08:00

As reported by ArmyInform, the fighters of the presidential brigade -Storm- of the National Guard not only struck enemy armored vehicles, but also achieved detonations of ammunition and other beauty .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/10/na-fronti-zyavylysya-zhyvi-rosijski-merczi-okupant-zastrelyvsya-ale-prodovzhyv-vesty-vogon/	2024-11-09T21:20:36-08:00

-Queen in the trenches- as -Thunder in the sky-: what movie news to expect this winter. Interview wi...	In an interview with ArmiyaInform, their producer, reserve colonel Oleksandr Driz, told about these new movies. - Let's start with the nearest date - December 6. I am very pleased that for this holiday we have a gift in the form of a movie called -Queens in the Trenches-. This is a film about women in the army based on the example of three people who had very good jobs before the war. One of our heroines, Oreste Brit, studied at the Sorbonne University and lived in Paris. In 2006, she became a beauty queen, received the title of -Miss Kyiv-, her photo was decorated by the best foreign publications. Another heroine is Diana -Dana- Vinogradova, a very interesting person who stood near the origins of -Right Sector- and currently holds the position of deputy brigade commander. She is the only woman in the Armed Forces of Ukraine who holds a position of this level - the deputy commander of the brigade for moral and psychological support. Now she is studying at the National University of Defense, there is also a fragment about this in our film. The third heroine is a designer, participant and organizer of various music festivals. This is Yulia Sidorova, her call sign is -Kuba-. Everyone already knows her as a very famous medic who saved a huge number of servicemen and continues to do so in the 92nd Brigade in Kharkiv. She saves lives and has her own team that she has chosen. All this will also be told in our film. The main goal of this film is to use the example of these women to show both girls and men how to act in modern conditions. Oresta Britt is a well-known volunteer. She was an adviser to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny, now she is very active in volunteering, and is engaged in REEs. It has many different directions of assistance to the Armed Forces and we show it all. Our other two heroines officially joined the military during the large-scale invasion, signed contracts and are now very successfully serving in the ranks of the Armed Forces. We hope that this project will have a positive effect on the mobilization campaign, that people will see how these girls, having such serious successes before the war, went to defend Ukraine during a large-scale invasion. - You mentioned the mobilization campaign. What do you think can activate this process so that new people go to the army? – I think that only a positive example of others. By the way, Orestes Britt in our film tells what advantages a person receives when he now goes to the service, goes to war. Yes, it is very dangerous there, you can stay there both on the battlefield and on the shield, as they say, return. But the fact is that during such service, a person receives both recognition and status in the country that will win - a worthy place, honor and respect in society. And he will also find the best friends and will feel like a real citizen, a real patriot who did not hide, but followed the call of his soul and heart to defend our country. Therefore, in such a situation, of course, we cannot influence some administrative or organizational measures for mobilization, but in a spiritual way, in the fact that people may have a desire to leave after listening to these girls - I am sure. Many people are currently in a state of uncertainty, so this film of ours will, I think, help them orient themselves and make the right choice, because the Armed Forces of Ukraine currently offer a lot of vacancies. - And whose story impressed you the most? b> – All three of them are such extraordinary and very bright heroines. But I was personally impressed by -Dana- Vynogradova. She is an artist, she had exhibitions in Lviv. In addition, she writes poems, publishes patriotic books. She is involved in the army, starting from training and ideological work with personnel to purely military operational, operational-tactical matters, where she takes a direct part. I just wonder where she got such a range of knowledge, skills and abilities. She is very young, now a senior lieutenant, but she has held the positions of lieutenant colonel, and now she will probably have higher positions after the National Defense University. And it's not just like that. Even the brigade commander, who was her commander, was amazed at how she, being in the rank of lieutenant, handled all her duties very confidently. Therefore, this is really the kind of story that impressed me the most. - Now tell us about your second film - -Thunder in the clear sky-, the main character of which is the Hero of Ukraine Rostyslav Lazarenko, call sign -Thunder-. – We created a project called -Fighting Families-. The co-author of his idea is, together with me, the head of the Department of Public Relations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Bohdan Senyk. Each series of this project is dedicated to a certain type of Armed Forces. The films have a career orientation load and also promote military professions. During the large-scale invasion, two series were created, dedicated to the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The first series was called -Defenders of the Sky- about the profession of military pilots. And the second - -Air defense is working calmly.- Rostyslav Lazarenko also took part there, but he was not the main character, there was another main character. After that, we decided that Rostyslav, as a Hero of Ukraine, as a very well-known and respected person, needed a separate film and we are currently creating -Thunder in the Clear Sky- as a portrait project. This is a portrait of a hero who experienced a lot and deserved a lot. Just imagine that today he has almost doubled the record of Ivan Kozhedub himself. Rostislav graduated from the military educational institution named after Kozhedub. He is an unsurpassed personality and the film is about him and partly about the team of those with whom he is. Because his boys, as he calls them, are a fighting family. They have their own corporate culture, their own awards, and tattoos, and bracelets, and many symbols that are fundamentally important to them. This film reveals more broadly the life of the hero, the leader of the stormtrooper pilots. Undoubtedly, there are also tragic stories about his brothers who have already died. How difficult it all is for him these days... He says: -For me, when the war ends, it will be a very difficult period, because then I will be able to remember everyone. And not like now, because now there are constant sorties-. He has already destroyed an insane number of enemies and continues to destroy them. Unfortunately, this is already the history of today. Despite everything, he believes in Victory and aims his boys at the victorious activity of destroying the enemy. - When will you be able to see the films? - Both of these projects were commissioned by the Ukrainian Cultural fund where we won the competition. -Queens in the Trenches- is scheduled to premiere on Armed Forces Day on Channel 24. After that, the film will go to other TV channels, streaming platforms and other sources. And the second project -Thunder in the Clear Sky- has, in our opinion, a cinema perspective. That's why we want to launch it in cinemas in January first. Even now, the -Planet Kino- chain and some cinemas want to rent it. Therefore, only after the film is shown in cinemas, it will be released on television. - Tell us about your creative plans. - Today we want to continue the aviation theme. Apart from Rostislav Lazarenko, there are many other worthy people there. By the way, the Hero of Ukraine Vadym Voroshilov, call sign -Karaya- and the pilot, squadron commander, who is currently also studying at the Defense University of Ukraine, Ivan Smerechansky - -Smereka-, also participate in the film -Thunder in the Clear Sky-. We want to expand the palette of these heroes, so we are planning another film about attack aircraft. And then we want to talk about bomber aircraft and fighter jets, which we have in all projects. That is why we have very good prospects in aviation, I believe. But we will not forget about other troops. Perhaps it will be possible to continue the -Fighting Families- cycle. We did about the infantry, marines, assault troops, special operations forces. In the continuation of -Fighting Families- we would like to touch on other military professions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/10/koroleva-v-okopah-yak-grim-sered-neba-yaki-kinonovynky-chekaty-cziyeyi-zymy-intervyu-z-oleksadrom-drizom/	2024-11-09T20:41:50-08:00
How to survive in battle, or What useful things will be taught at BZVP: life hacks from a DSHV instr...	ArmyInform asked the instructor about how paratroopers are prepared for war with the enemy, as well as how to communicate with society so that people stand up for the defense of Ukraine. -The deeper you dig into the ground and properly arrange the dugout, the more likely you are to survive the battle,- Comroty Roman explains the importance of engineering training to the mobilized. Theoretical block: instructors talk about the nuances. They explain to people at the classes how to act and what to do during enemy attacks with guided aerial bombs: - the Russians use anti-aircraft missiles on the front, aim them directly at our positions. Guided aerial bombs are divided into different types and types, that is, they have different charge equivalents. People in positions must understand: in order to survive, deep holes must be dug, overlaps must be arranged, and so on. In the winter of this year, the 79th DSHV brigade, Mariinsky direction. Then the Russians made 13 KAB strikes against our advanced positions. After that, I talked with my brother, the boys survived because they dug in well. Everything was -according to - according to-, there were no -two hundred-, two - -three hundred-, concussions. This is a real-life example of how the ability to dig in well saves the lives of defenders on the front line. These are tactical, fire, engineering, intelligence training, work with/against UAVs and tactical medicine, communications. We focus on night classes using drones. Interaction is important on the battlefield. The mobilized work as part of tactical groups, divisions and platoons. Let's see which of them is the leader to determine the commander of the department. Actions in defense and attack, assault actions, tactical movements inherent in various types of combat. Small group tactics: hit and roll. Repelling an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group, how to counter the meaty assaults of the Rashists. That is, all working moments that are in a real combat situation. Due to the fact that the enemy is now massively using drones with resets, we show them what elements can unmask them during missions. That they can give out during the day, or in the dark. Working with weapons and shooting is, of course, a priority.- The key point of training: the instructors in the classes share their own combat experience. Again, there are different terrains: an urbanized area, a plantation, a field, some kind of body of water. Accordingly, the combat tasks are different: - In 2023, during the counteroffensive in the south, I, as part of the 46th Airmobile Brigade, performed tasks in the -fire sack- near Robotyny in Zaporozhye. The task was to keep two plantations and approaches to them for 6-7 days. Our group consisted of 8 servicemen. In principle, there were no fixed positions there, but there were, as we called them - -coffins- - small pits, where we held the defense. SPs were set up, sectors of fire were determined. To say that it was very hot there is an understatement. The enemy worked around the clock for us: Vasylok, LPG, AGS, aviation with anti-aircraft guns, and barrel artillery. In short, solid trash. Plus the enemy used small group tactics, launching groups of three at night to determine where we were. Of course, we destroyed them on the approaches. The drones hung in the air by themselves. One day, a command came from the management: storm the next landings. Disguising smoke was launched to indicate the direction of the landings and the starting point of the assault. I don't know how, but our tanks somehow got into positions in this area, until that time none of our heavy equipment had left at that point, and they worked on the enemy. After which there was an assault, another unit from our brigade took these two landings. Next was to be our replacement. We already realized that the enemy had hacked our radio communication and knew the evacuation point already during the withdrawal from the positions. They flew at us with -fan- mines, then drones joined. But all my soldiers were prepared for any close approach, they all knew what they had to do, followed by always voice commands and onward movement, on turns at a run, no one stopped anywhere. We walked the entire route (several kilometers in fact), although we also had our own weapons and shells, we took everything as befits paratroopers. Somehow we reached the trenches of our neighbors. They flew there. Hecked out. Got in touch. They waited Our driver was injured then, so there had to be another car. The enemy struck again with mortar fire. Aimed at 120 mines for 15 minutes, and it seemed like an eternity. There was darkness in everyone's eyes, screams, it is clear that the head was bursting from pain, contusion. Our brother's leg was torn off by shrapnel, already in the dugout they provided him with medical assistance, they wanted to save him. But, unfortunately, the heart couldn't stand it&#8230; What am I leading to? In battle, the main thing is not to lose control and the ability to manage people during combat. Quality training saves the lives of military personnel on the front lines. Therefore, using such personal examples, we explain to the mobilized what reality awaits them and why it is so important to be ready for anything. The contingent of mobilized people are completely different people in terms of psychotype, social status, with different life problems and the like. We determine the degree of motivation of each person, for this we conduct testing, and we continue to work with them in classes on national and patriotic training. When working with recruits, psychological preparation is also important. Their combat effectiveness directly depends on the emotional health of servicemen. After all, we understand very well that things happen differently in war, in moments of panic, in stressful situations, a person can go -into a stupor- and, unfortunately, die. Therefore, we teach how to cope with stress and pressure, make decisions and, most importantly, work in battle as part of a team. So how to master yourself in crisis situations. There is such a simple exercise -Square-. It is quite effective. To calm down, a serviceman must breathe. He visualizes a square, on inhalation he moves his gaze to the right corner, on exhalation lowers it, on inhalation to the left corner and again on exhalation to the upper corner. In such a simple way, a person distracts himself, focuses on breathing and calms down over time. Next, it is important to teach the unit commander how to act in similar situations. He is the commander, the leader. And he should not shout at a subordinate when he is not in his right mind. The great war has been going on for three years, and the people who are coming now, unfortunately, are not prepared at all. Many people do not even know elementary things, this is primarily some basic knowledge of tactical medicine. There is YouTube: there are a lot of video courses on tactical medicine, which demonstrate in detail what the MARCH algorithm is. See how the machine is disassembled and assembled. There are shooting ranges, airsoft training that everyone loves, it's all available. People should study before they join the army. It will be easier for instructors in training centers to prepare you, because there will already be some basis. And, again, even if you've already joined the army, don't feel sorry for yourself. Especially during the preparation period. Work at the maximum, at 200%, at 300%, so that it will be easier for you in the future. Absorb as much information as possible, ask questions, always be interested in everything. It will be easier for you in battle. I will give an example. We had a set where we conducted BZVP for contractors. The youngest was only 18, and the oldest was probably 27 years old. So, they came to us already charged, hungry for knowledge. You know, it's like a blank slate on which you can write your best story. Or like the clay from which you mold that perfect fighter. To this day, thank God, the boys are unsubscribing, thanking them for the training. And as always, the next guys are asked to -pump- even more. Every Ukrainian man must protect his family and country. This is an axiom. You are either here in the army or, due to your health, you work for defense in the rear. There are many professions in the Armed Forces where you can be useful. Now there are recruiting centers, they will help you choose your profession. Prepare yourself for the fact that Ukraine must be defended. It will not be the case that some fight and others sit and wait for the war to end by itself. Will not end. We have such a category of citizens who say: they will come to my home, to my city or village, then I will go to fight. But it will be too late. The military, who were in the war, they understand this perfectly. They say that many Ukrainians are simply afraid of dying in the war. Yes, people are afraid, everyone is afraid. A person who is not afraid is just crazy, I think. Fear is good. If there is no fear, it is bad, especially when you are at war. Some say they are afraid of TCCs. We have already found a solution for you: allow military units to mobilize people directly, bypassing the TCC and SP. In my opinion, this should be done much earlier. There would be fewer negative stories, which Russian propaganda is very fond of spreading in order to discourage mobilization in our country. Mobilization is a matter of state survival. It is necessary to change the military at the front, who have been fighting there for almost 1,000 days.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/10/yak-vyzhyty-u-boyu-abo-chogo-korysnogo-navchat-na-bzvp-lajfhaky-vid-instruktora-dshv/	2024-11-09T20:31:31-08:00
They no longer know how to scare: the Russians have seen Poles in the TCC	However, this is a fake, said the UNITED24 platform, because it has never published such ads or posted such a video. In the fake video, they say that approximately 47% of the staff of the TCC are Polish citizens who have signed contracts with the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Such a step is apparently necessary in order to fight corruption during mobilization in Ukraine and to increase the efficiency of the TCC. The video itself was assembled by propagandists from footage that has nothing to do with the so-called -mass service of Poles- in the TCC. For example, with the help of a reverse search fact checker -Vox Ukraine- united24-> found a photo of the former head of the Odesa regional TCC and SP Oleksandr Okhrimenko, on which the Ukrainian chevron is visible. The photo was taken on December 12, 2023, during his press conference in Ukrinform. First, the Russians showed Okhrimenko's real chevron, and then a redacted one with the flag of Poland. In the original pictures, only the Ukrainian flag is present. There are also grammatical errors in the video. For example, -territorial center of recruitment and social support- was translated as TRSSCs, but it is correct TCR and SS (Territorial Centers of Recruitment and Social Support). The main goal of this and similar fakes is to disrupt the mobilization campaign in Ukraine. Russians no longer know how to scare Ukrainians so that they do not join the army. Each time their lies are more and more detached from reality.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/10/stopfejk-uzhe-ne-znayut-yak-lyakaty-rosiyany-pobachyly-v-tczk-polyakiv/	2024-11-09T20:11:04-08:00
Even the bridge to the Crimea is protected by the Russians not by quality, but by quantity	The spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain of the 3rd rank, told about this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon Dmytro Pletenchuk. — The enemy is indeed taking steps to strengthen the defenses of this facility. Accordingly, it is impossible to say that these actions have absolutely no result. Whatever quality, whatever principles these weapons are used, in any case, of course, quantity matters, he said. So even in the case of the Kerch bridge, Russians traditionally try to increase quantitative indicators for themselves and do not improve quality. — Just in the case of the so-called -Crimean- bridge, we see that the Russians very often take precisely the quantitative indicator. Because, as practice shows, it is quite difficult for them to repel attacks of even not the most modern weapons with the systems they use, the spokesman explained. However, the number of weapons collected to protect the bridge is still capable of producing results. — Given the amount of anti-aircraft they have attracted, they can still do this from time to time. They try to protect it both from the air and from the water. For this, they use various hydrotechnical structures and aviation patrols, Dmytro Pletenchuk said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that threat of strikes -calibres- from the Caspian are not zero, but extremely insignificant.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/navit-mist-do-krymu-rosiyany-zahyshhayut-ne-yakistyu-a-kilkistyu/	2024-11-09T12:21:59-08:00
Maneuver defense and -meat- assaults: the operation in Kurshchyna continues	told about this on the telethon -Edyny Novy- > spokesman of OTU -Siversk-, Colonel Vadym Mysnyk. — The enemy continues to maintain the intensity of shelling along the entire strip of the northern border. These are Chernihiv, Sumy and part of Kharkiv regions in our area of ​​responsibility. By terrorizing the local population, in addition to this, they are thus tying up our combat units. These are hundreds of kilometers of the border so that we cannot concentrate them or use them in the hottest areas of the front, he said. The occupiers hit the territory of the Kursk region most intensively. — The greatest concentration of shelling and fighting, [concentration] of enemy forces on the territory of the Kursk region is where fierce battles are currently taking place. They have a nimble nature on our part, the spokesman said. Instead, the enemy tries to fight not with skill, but with the number of personnel and equipment, in the usual way. - They are constantly forced to bring various reserves here - both from the depths of their territory and from other areas of the front. -When they run out of armored vehicles, they send small groups of infantry to attack,- he said. The Russians use the accumulated forces and resources extremely inefficiently. — The enemy uses the tactics of meat assaults. We do not see anything new. They accumulate manpower, equipment and try to use their advantage precisely in this with assault actions. But our soldiers in defense are very good and the enemy's losses in the last two days have been significant, Vadym Mysnyk said. The Russian invaders treat their own civilian population on the territory of Kurshchyna just as ruthlessly. - Just demolishes all its settlements to zero. Over the past day, the enemy used 46 anti-aircraft missiles in Kurshchyna, and 15 anti-aircraft missiles this afternoon. Dropped 60 UAVs, 32 [hits] by FPV drones, the spokesman said. The occupiers are also actively using artillery and mortars. Over the past 24 hours, 264 shellings and about 1,200 explosions have been recorded in the Kursk region controlled by the Defense Forces. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that voyuvaty-po-inshomu-rosiyany-ne-vmiyut/->Russians -take their own settlements to zero and hit their own population-, because they don't know how to fight in any other way.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/manevrena-oborona-ta-myasni-shturmy-operacziya-na-kurshhyni-tryvaye/	2024-11-09T12:06:32-08:00
The number of KAB drops in Kharkiv region has increased: the purpose of the enemy has been explained...	A representative of the communications service told about this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon with the public of the -Charter- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev. — The beginning of the Kursk operation had a certain result, for example, in the fact that the number of used anti-aircraft guns in Kharkiv region significantly decreased. If there could have been dozens in May-June, then they practically disappeared, he said. However, in recent weeks, the number of guided aerial bombs dropped by the enemy on Kharkiv region has increased significantly. — In the last few weeks, the enemy has started using guided aerial bombs again. -Mostly in the city, on civilian infrastructure, mostly in the evening or at night, although there are also daytime shellings,- said the guardsman. — It is very difficult to find logic in the application of [CABs]. Sometimes they just hit the highway. Sometimes, like last night, in the center of the square, in Derzhprom, which is a UNESCO monument, or simply in suburban buildings. It is very difficult to find any logic, apart from the fact that these are obviously attempts to intimidate the population, Volodymyr Degtyarev noted. He said that the detonation of a guided aerial bomb is truly depressing. — Those who have watched even the video of detonation of guided aerial bombs, see that the blast wave from them reaches hundreds of meters. Their impression is simply incredible. And, in fact, now it is one of their main means of such, one might say, massive destruction, - emphasized the representative of -Charter-. ArmyInform previously reported that lyudyna-distala-poranen/->Russian troops shelled Kup'yansk again: two people were killed, one more person was injured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/chyselnist-skydiv-kabiv-po-harkivshhyni-zrosla-metu-voroga-poyasnyly-v-sylah-oborony/	2024-11-09T11:51:47-08:00
The threat of strikes - calibers - from the Caspian: not zero, but extremely insignificant	The spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain of the 3rd rank, told about this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon Dmytro Pletenchuk. — There are currently no confirmed facts of the Caspian Sea being used to launch missiles that could fire at our territory. There are cruise missile carriers there, that's a fact. Their technical characteristics allow them to be used from such a distance - this is also a fact. However, there are currently no confirmed examples of such use - and this is also a fact, he emphasized. The military noted that there are at least two Caliber carriers in the Caspian Sea who fled there from the Black Sea. -There are at least two carriers that are being tested for the Black Sea Fleet, which were forced there from the Azov-Black Sea region,- the spokesman said. In view of this, the danger of using -Caliber- sea-based missiles from the Caspian Sea is not zero, but extremely small. — The danger can be considered to be present, but the distance is quite large and it will allow to react in time to such launches. Considering the technical characteristics of these missiles, the probability of their destruction is very high, Dmytro Pletenchuk emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that enemy fleet The Black Sea fleet is on deaf defense: defenseless Russian ships are protected from drones by aviation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/zagroza-udariv-kalibramy-z-kaspiyu-ne-nulova-ale-vkraj-neznachna/	2024-11-09T11:34:35-08:00
Enemy KABs in the South significantly increased: the results of disappointing statistics	About this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- mentioned the spokesman of the OUV -Tavria - Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn. — From the beginning of September, the Russians made certain changes in the design of guided aerial bombs and these bombs began to fly further. They hit with these bombs, struck even in the center of Zaporozhye, he said. The military gave the following statistics of the dropping of KABs in the South for October. -In October, in the Southern direction, the Russians used about 500 guided aerial bombs specifically on Ukrainian positions and on populated areas near the line of combat,- said a military officer. About a third of these 500 CABs occur in the last week of October. — Already this month, during the first 9 days of November, the enemy also used about 150 guided aerial bombs. That is, the enemy began to use guided aerial bombs more, because they bring him a certain result and it is very difficult to fight with this type of weapon.

However, if we look at the nature of these assaults, it has [also] changed. -We can see that the enemy is using more personnel,- she said.

Today, every day we see that the enemy loses 50-70 people killed and wounded, which is about 5% of the total losses of the Russians per day, the officer noted. This is how the spokeswoman described the Russian assaults in the urban development of Toretsk. - You can imagine what these assaults are like: there are a lot of Russian personnel in the urban development.

In order to cross this channel, [the enemy] needs to build certain crossings and bridges. In order to bring the bridge, at a minimum, there should be no active fire [from the Defense Forces], she said. Gunners of units of the Defense Forces keep the canal under fire control. — We, in our turn, protecting this channel, of course, will not give such an opportunity [to the enemy] and we will take every opportunity to stop the crossings and keep this channel under the watchful eye of our artillery, — Ukrainian drones will also not allow vehicles to cross the enemy channel . — Also, FPV drones work very skillfully. Our drone operators have a very high level of training and also have a very high level of creativity. They are constantly inventing new and new ways that Russia can't chew,- Anastasia Bobovnikova stressed.

In the South, the occupiers are preparing for assaults: which areas are most at risk	The most endangered areas on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- named the spokesperson of the OUV - Tavria- Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn. — At the moment, the situation in general is not much different from the situation that has been here for two or three weeks. The enemy continues shelling, continues strikes. They are shelling not only the positions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, but also the cities located in the front-line zone and in the South of Ukraine in general, he said. The officer reported that the Russian command is accumulating forces and means with the aim of intensifying assault operations on certain sections of the battle line. — Russian troops, according to our intelligence, are quite actively preparing to conduct assaults on certain sections of the demarcation line. They are carrying out and some have already carried out the occupation of [positions], they have pulled up the replenishment. Ammunition has been received and is being replenished, and engineering and aerial reconnaissance of our positions is being actively conducted, the spokesman said. All this indicates that the enemy is preparing for assaults, and some assault groups have already been moved to advanced positions. — They are preparing to start assault operations. Some assault groups have already been moved to forward positions. This indicates that sometime in the near future the enemy will start storming our positions, the military officer explained. However, according to him, we are talking about some kind of large-scale offensive, namely assault actions in separate local areas. -I don't mean any big offensive, but assault operations will begin on one of the sections of the combat line,- said Vladyslav Voloshyn. Also, the spokesman of the -Tavria- military command center named the most threatened sections of the combat confrontation line in the South. — The most dangerous look, and we know about it, that the opponents are preparing to carry out assaults there, this is the area in the Vremivsk direction, where the settlements of Levadne and Rivnopil are located. This is a plot near Gulyaipol. This is a section of the battle line, the so-called Robotynsky salient, where our counteroffensive took place and certain territories were liberated, the military said. There, the enemy will try to align the battle line. -In addition, there is certain information that on the coastal territory on the left side of the Dnieper, where Kamianske is located, the enemy is also concentrating a certain amount of forces and means for the preparation of assault groups with further assault actions,- said the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV . Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the zone responsibility of the -Tavria- military command center, the Russian command uses a wide variety of units from different military districts of the Russian Federation, the quality of personnel training in which differs significantly.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/na-pivdni-okupanty-gotuyutsya-do-shturmiv-yaki-dilyanky-najbilsh-zagrozheni/	2024-11-09T09:42:37-08:00

Survival and Fear of the Commander: The motivation and drive of the occupiers remain unchanged	A representative of the communications service told about this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon with the public of the -Charter- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev. -Their basic motivation is survival, their basic driver is fear of the commander and the barriers,- he said. Soldiers of the Russian army do not trust their own commanders and do not expect any help when wounded. Their only chance to stay alive is to surrender in captivity. — They understand that if they are injured, they have virtually no chance of evacuation or quality tactical medicine. Therefore, most of those who come to us to surrender, they come with injuries, expecting that at least here they have a chance to survive, - said the soldier. However, despite a low level of critical thinking and only basic training, the enemy remains dangerous due to its sheer numbers. — The mere fact of having such a mass of people allows them to be used as consumables. In principle, they have minimal functions: to get here and there, to shoot in this direction, - explained Volodymyr Degtyarev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, who and how who and how is Russia fighting in Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/vyzhyvannya-i-strah-pered-komandyrom-motyvacziya-ta-rushij-okupantiv-lyshayutsya-nezminnymy/	2024-11-09T09:21:39-08:00

The last personnel reserve of the Russian Federation: the enemy is recruiting teenagers	notifies the Service of Foreign intelligence of Ukraine. The number of vacancies for teenagers aged 14 to 18 increased by 76% during the year. From July to September 2024, the demand for young professionals increased several times. Minors are most actively employed in large companies. In particular, the number of employees under the age of 18 increased ninefold in the -Magnet- retail chain. At the same time, the number of minors working informally is increasing. There are 6 million citizens aged 15 to 17 in the Russian Federation, but a little more than 1% of them work. By the end of 2023, the number of employed persons aged 15 to 17 increased by 40% to 87,000. In 2022, their number was 61.6 thousand. persons The total shortage of personnel in the Russian Federation reaches 5 million people. The involvement of minors is facilitated by the state policy of the Russian Federation aimed at simplifying the employment procedure for them. Employers, in conditions of acute shortage of personnel, are forced to create jobs that involve part-time employment and a flexible schedule especially for young people. A draft law on easing the admission of minors to harmful and dangerous work has been submitted to the -State Duma- of the Russian Federation. Thus, under the conditions of the war, underage workers became a personnel reserve for the Russian Federation against the background of a serious labor shortage.

Expendable material goes on foot and carries everything on itself: who and how is Russia fighting in...	A representative of the communications service told about this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon with the public of the -Charter- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev. — For a long time now, they have mostly been walking. It's about walking quite a long distance to get into the forest strips they still control, he said. The -foot tactics- of the enemy are evidenced by various data, in particular, the losses of the enemy in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Charter- brigade. — If we look at the figures of enemy losses on our site for the past month, we will see that 200 enemies have been destroyed and a total of 20 pieces of equipment. These are mainly light vehicles and light vehicles, motorcycles, ATVs, just one tank. This indicates that, at least in this area, for certain reasons [the technique] is not used, the military said. It is possible to learn about the reasons for the enemy's refusal to use the equipment only on the basis of objective data, since the prisoners that the -charters- manage to capture have an extremely low level of situational awareness. - Why exactly, what are these reasons, we can only make hypotheses, because the captives we take are usually expendable material. All the prisoners we have taken in the last few months are yesterday's prisoners with a very low level of critical thinking. They have no connection with the world, any means of communication is taken away from them. All they know is what their commanders tell them. They get minimal information, the guard explained. The tasks of the enemy soldiers are simple, if not to say primitive - to run to a certain point, deliver some cargo. - Their task is to try to get from point to point where they are met by the next guide and sent on. The calculation is that out of ten, at least a few will make it, and eventually, somewhere in the accumulation point, there will be enough people to make some kind of movement in our direction, Volodymyr Degtyarev said. Equipping such -disposable- enemy combatants is easiest with basic soldier gear. — Basic soldier equipment. Given that they have to carry basically everything on their person, this is the basic small arms. In the forest areas, where they have been for a long time, they have accumulated quite a lot of weapons, which we are trying to track down and destroy. However, in the main, those with whom our fighters face in battle, if we are talking about some shooting battles, are equipped only with basic shooting weapons, the -charter- said. Earlier, ArmyInform explained why the occupiers are saving equipment for Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/vytratnyj-material-jde-pishky-ta-nese-vse-na-sobi-kym-i-yak-voyuye-rosiya-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-11-09T08:42:59-08:00

Fighters of the Belarusian regiment named after Kastus Kalinovsky defeated the Russian assault group. In this they were helped by the automatic grenade launcher Heckler &amp; Koch GMG.

Who is in the boat, who is under it: five men tried to conquer the Tisza on a two-seater watercraft	About this reports State Border Service of Ukraine. The incident happened in the evening when the border patrol noticed a group of people moving quickly towards the border. The attackers had already tried to board the boat, but the craft was too small for everyone, so some men jumped into the river, trying to swim across it on their own. Border guards pulled the men out of the cold water, detained them and took them to a unit where they were able to warm up. The detainees were residents of Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy and Zakarpattia regions. The men said they paid between $8,000 and $11,000 for a -safe- border crossing.

Soldiers instead of armor: why the occupiers save equipment in Kharkiv region	This was told on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- the spokesman of the OTU -Kharkiv- Lt. Col. Yevgeny Romanov. — We observe that the enemy is trying to recruit people to replace the losses he has suffered. He also accumulates ammunition, concentrates equipment in certain areas, but does not use it, but uses infantry assaults. He takes care of equipment, unlike people, he said. The spokesman explained why the Russian command acts in this way. - Because he doesn't have enough equipment. The Ukrainian Defense Forces destroyed a huge number of his armored combat vehicles and he has a shortage of this equipment. He is trying to repair old models, but this process is slower than they burn on Ukrainian soil, Yevgeny Romanov explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Russians stormed five times in the Vovchansk district under the cover of airstrikes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/soldaty-zamist-broni-chomu-okupanty-ekonomlyat-tehniku-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-11-09T05:32:11-08:00

The department noted that in the conditions of confrontation with the enemy, which prevails in manpower and equipment, such assistance is vitally necessary, especially in providing combat units with drones of various modifications. At the same time, the mobilization of specific citizens is carried out by the decision of the territorial recruitment and social support centers, which have the right to issue summonses to conscripts to clarify their registration data, undergo medical examinations and mobilization. According to Art. 65 of the Constitution of Ukraine, protection of the Motherland, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine is a constitutional duty of Ukrainian citizens. Citizens perform military service in accordance with the law. If a conscripted citizen has health problems, the question of his suitability for military service is decided during the VLK. At the same time, it should also be remembered that a large number of public activists and volunteers have joined the ranks of the Armed Forces and are fulfilling their constitutional duty. After all, only in consolidation and unity is the strength of Ukrainians and the key to victory over the treacherous, ancient Russian enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/u-zsu-vidreaguvaly-na-provokacziyi-sergiya-sternenka/	2024-11-09T05:11:18-08:00

Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces: Drones have become a key element of success on the battlefie...	He wrote about this on his Facebook page. At the monthly meeting with the commanders of the UAV units, General Oleksandr Syrsky listened to the report of the commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Vadym Sukharevskiy, about the creation of drone units and the results of their use in combat conditions. The participants discussed the experience of using drones in difficult circumstances, including the use of interceptors and drones for long-range missions, even in the face of Russian electronic warfare. Considerable attention was paid to the implementation of the latest technologies and tactics of using drones. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine thanked the combat commanders of the unmanned units, in particular the crews of the 414th regiment of the CSW BPS and the 412th battalion of the BPS SBS, for their high level of professionalism and efficiency. He emphasized that despite the difficult weather conditions, the UAV units of the Armed Forces demonstrate high efficiency. The biggest impression on the battlefield is made by strike bomber drones, which have completed more than 7,000 combat missions. During October, these complexes struck more than 52,000 targets, including destroying 129 artillery systems, 221 pieces of radio equipment, and more than 4,000 enemy soldiers. -We continue to destroy the enemy 24/7,- concluded General Oleksandr Syrskyi. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov announced the introduction of a new function in the Rezerv+ application, which allows you to get a postponement from mobilization in an online format.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/zsu-fokusuyutsya-na-rozvytku-bezpilotnyh-system-dlya-posylennya-bojovyh-spromozhnostej/	2024-11-09T04:03:50-08:00
The weather will not stop the enemy's infantry: that will give the defenders the desired result	told about it on the air -Suspilnye News- Captain Yuri Fedorenko, commander of the battalion of unmanned attack air systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirk. — As long as the enemy has manpower, this will not significantly affect, in my opinion, the conduct of hostilities. Again, where it started is my subjective opinion, for the first time mass assaults in any weather - in snow, in rain, and in mud - were carried out precisely by -Wagner- on the flanks of Bakhmut. It didn't matter then - if the equipment doesn't pass, the infantry soldier passes, he said. This was effective for the enemy, but only up to a certain point - as long as he had enough reserves. — It gave results. Regardless of the fact that the losses were disproportionate, the enemy was still able to push through. But, if you remember, at that time at some point they pearl-pearls, it seemed that there was a very difficult situation, and then at some point -Wagner- ran out. They began to be replaced by -regulars-, and at that time the Defense Forces stabilized the situation, Yuriy Fedorenko said. In the same way, even now the enemy will not be able to carry out shock-assault actions without regular replenishment of manpower, which is massively knocked out by units of the Defense Forces. — It is fundamentally important for them to be fed with additional personnel. For this, they are currently using the services of North Korea and are currently building additional personnel in one way or another in order not to stop pressing, the drone commander explained. How long the Russian command will be able to act in this way depends on many factors, primarily on the effectiveness of the destruction of enemy manpower by units of the Defense Forces not only directly on the battle line, but also in the enemy's rear. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast, the enemy is storming with active fire support.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/pogoda-pihotu-voroga-ne-zupynyt-shho-dast-zahysnykam-bazhanyj-rezultat/	2024-11-09T03:39:40-08:00

Yevgeny Romanov. — This has a significant impact. This especially applies to the use of unmanned systems, reconnaissance and strike drones, and means of adjusting artillery fire. It feels like it,- he said. The military said what factors affect the effectiveness of UAVs. - Fog, rain, wind, dusk that comes earlier - all this has a significant effect. The weather still makes adjustments and reduces both the enemy's capabilities and certain of our capabilities, Yevgeny Romanov explained. Earlier, ArmyInform explained why in Kharkiv Oblast, Russians walk over their own corpses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/imla-doshh-viter-sutinky-bezpilotnykam-na-harkivshhyni-staye-dedali-vazhche/	2024-11-09T03:21:16-08:00

From a factory guard to a school director: the collaborator turned Vovchansk into a center of Russif...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informed about this. It is noted that an indictment has been sent to the court against a 36-year-old resident of Vovchansk, who is suspected of collaborative activities. According to the investigation, during the occupation of the city of Vovchansk by Russian troops in the summer of 2022, the man agreed to cooperate with the invaders. Before the invasion, he worked as a security guard at a local factory, but after the occupation, he voluntarily took the position of director of school No. 1, created on the basis of the Vovchansky Lyceum. In his new position, the suspect organized the transfer of the educational process to the Russian language and planned to teach Ukrainian schoolchildren according to Russian educational standards. He also collected lists of teachers to send to courses in Belgorod and received methodological recommendations from the occupation administration. In September 2022, before the deoccupation of the city by the Armed Forces, the man fled with the Russian military to the territory of the Russian Federation. He is currently wanted, and his case will be heard in absentia in the Chuguyiv City Court. The suspect faces up to three years in prison. As reported by ArmyInform, the man who became the hero of the propaganda video and organized the broadcast of Russian channels.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/dyrektor-kolaborant-peretvoryuvav-vovchansk-na-oseredok-rusyfikacziyi/	2024-11-09T02:51:10-08:00
UAVs, -solntsepok-, FPV-drones: in Kharkiv Oblast, the enemy is storming with active fire support	About this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- spoken the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Lt. Col. Yevgeny Romanov. — The enemy does not stop storming the positions of Ukrainian troops in the Vovchansk region. With the support of air strikes, the enemy tried 5 times to storm the positions of Ukrainian servicemen, but all these attempts were in vain. An enemy that advanced like this and was left lying on the battlefield, he said. The spokesman told what forces and means the occupiers use during the assaults — usually they use powerful KAB strikes. Tonight, 5 rockets were used against the TOS-A-1 -Sunset- flamethrower system, FPV drones are used and, of course, artillery fire, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast Ukrainian soldiers burned two enemy heavy flamethrower systems.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/kaby-solnczepok-fpv-drony-na-harkivshhyni-vorog-shturmuye-za-aktyvnoyi-vognevoyi-pidtrymky/	2024-11-09T02:38:53-08:00
Animal fear, 15 kilometers on foot and 90% loss of equipment: why in Kharkiv Oblast Russians walk ov...	told about it on the air -Suspilnye News- Captain Yuri Fedorenko, commander of the battalion of unmanned attack air systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirk. — [Enemy] tactics remain the same. When the enemy has the opportunity to actively use lightly armored or armored vehicles, he uses them. But the enemy loses a significant amount of this equipment on the battlefield - up to 90%, which is in the zone of damage of both our anti-tank weapons and drones. For long-range logistics, the enemy will use light armored vehicles quite actively, he said. When the enemy's armored vehicles run out, the occupiers switch to motorcycles and buggies, and when they run out, they go on foot. — When the enemy runs out of this technique, he resorts to assaults at the expense of highly maneuverable vehicles - two-wheeled motorcycles, buggies, other pickup-type vehicles. When they are lacking in a moment of time, it is mostly living power. They move along landings, run across a clear field and thus try to shorten the distance as much as possible and accumulate, the military said. In some places, enemy soldiers have to cover very considerable distances on foot just to reach their own forward positions or assault lines. — At some rallies, the enemy went through the entrance to advanced positions in the region of 12-15 kilometers. Step by step, they are trying to reach, accumulate and move to shock-assault actions, Yuriy Fedorenko said. At the same time, the losses of the occupiers are extremely high, but they still continue to go. — During such movements, the enemy suffers very significant losses, indeed very significant losses. The question arises why they stick, why they do not surrender to captivity, which can motivate in a clean field to run from one landing to another, realizing that out of 8 people who run, out of 8 occupants who run, one or two will catch up, they are see what motivates you to move forward? - the officer asked the question and then answered it himself. According to the commander of the drones, the occupiers are driven by an animal fear of their own henchmen. — This is an animal fear of one's spouse. The occupier understands that if he returns to the rear, he will not be able to be heard by his own - he is guaranteed to be either destroyed or publicly punished, and there are still a number of tools and coercion. Therefore, the occupier chooses death on the battlefield rather than returning to his people, he explained. For the first time, the Russians saw the effectiveness of the described tactics and attitude towards their own soldiers under Bakhmut and later scaled it to the entire Russian army. — This tactic gave the enemy results during the Bakhmut campaign, when the -Wagner- was pushed forward. After that, the Russian occupying forces assumed that manpower is the cheapest resource, that this tactic works, and today most units of the Russian occupying forces - both contractors and those that support them - special forces and private military companies of the type -Storm Zet-, Yuriy Fedorenko told. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that mozhe/->in the Kupyan region in the Kharkiv region, the enemy -does everything they can-, suffering colossal losses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/tvarynnyj-strah-15-kilometriv-pishky-ta-90-vtrat-tehniky-chomu-na-harkivshhyni-rosiyany-jdut-po-vlasnyh-trupah/	2024-11-09T02:21:42-08:00

The defense forces managed to hold the enemy in those areas where we are carrying out combat missions, he said. However, the situation at different points where the Achilles fighters are defending is different. — This is a shade of Hlyboky, where the initiative is fully in the hands of the Defense Forces. The enemy has not been successful for 3 long months, despite the fact that he is trying to storm, is trying to knock us out of our positions, the officer said. On the other hand, the situation is significantly more difficult in the Kupyan region. -As for Kupyan region, the situation there is much more complicated, using disproportionate forces and means, the enemy does everything he can to carry out the task of carrying out shock-assault actions,- the military officer explained.

However, during the past day, despite numerous attempts of assaults, the Russian occupiers did not manage to achieve any success. — Over the past day, the enemy had no success at the rally, managed to repulse numerous attacks and hold all positions.

You can't even call this a drone: the French military is interested in the MALE Aarok UAV weighing 5...	UAV developer Turgis &amp; Gaillard is actively promote to the market its MALE Aarok drone (Medium Altitude Long Endurance, in Ukrainian - great endurance at medium altitude), ArmiyaInform reports. French developers, when presenting the new Aarok drone, immediately called it the first European military drone of the MALE class. MALE is an American acronym for the medium-altitude, long-duration drone community. Thus, Aarok MALE can be considered a direct competitor and analogue of the American reconnaissance and strike drone MQ-9 Reaper (-Reaper-), which our editors detailed told in one of her publications. Interestingly, the French drone is developed by a comparatively small private company, Turgis &amp; Gaillard. The company was founded in 2011, has about 300 employees, and an annual turnover of 50 million euros. The 5.5-ton UAV will stay in the air for 24 hours thanks to a turboprop engine that produces 1,200 horsepower and is relatively quiet. According to unofficial information, the power plant will be the Ardiden 3TP Safran engine. At the air show in France, a model with a PT6 engine from the Canadian branch of Pratt &amp; Whitney. The manufacturer separately emphasizes the high strength characteristics of its drone, which allows it to take off even from unprepared airstrips. It is possible to operate from ground airfields in any weather conditions in the automatic take-off and landing mode. The cruising speed of the French drone is 250 knots - 463 km/h, the cruising altitude is 9150 meters (echelon FL300). Technical characteristics of Aarok: Like the American Reaper, the French drone Aarok can stay in the air for up to one day. This allows the use of UAVs to operate over the open sea for maritime patrol and reconnaissance tasks. The drone is equipped with a retractable landing gear. Among the interesting features, the optical-electronic surveillance station is installed closer to the tail of the drone. The station includes electro-optical and infrared cameras and a laser range finder. Laser target illumination and guidance of guided weapons are possible. In the middle part of the drone's fuselage, a multi-mode radar can be installed, which is used, among other things, for ground surveillance and mapping tasks. It is also possible to search for sea and air targets. The manufacturer reports that the drone can carry up to 4 high-precision guided munitions (GPS-INS, laser or infrared guidance) weighing 250 kg or up to two munitions weighing 500 kg each. The stated target engagement range is 35 km. In addition, the drone can carry up to 16 air-to-ground missiles with a range of up to 15 km. Most likely, we are talking about AGM-114 Hellfire missiles or analogs, specific models are not disclosed. Compared to its competitors, the UAV is much lighter and cheaper than the EuroDrone, which is currently being developed by Airbus Defense &amp; Space. In the future, the French Air Force should receive six EuroDrone systems, currently four copies have been ordered for an amount of approximately 2 billion euros. General Stéphane Mille, chief of staff of France's Air and Space Forces, thinks it is a -quite attractive- aircraft, reported by the Zone Militaire portal. -And I'm willing to pay to see, because there is sometimes a gap between what we announce and what we can do,- he told a parliamentary hearing. -Aarok is a very interesting project, to be very clear. Overall, the work is of a high quality and is carried out in a relationship of trust between Turgis &amp; Gaillard and the departments of the Ministry,- noted the country's Minister of Armed Forces, Sebastien Lecornu.

Massive attacks by Shaheds: why the enemy chose such tactics and how many reserves he has. Expert op...	-There are several reasons why Russia started to use Shaheda so massively against Ukraine. The first is geopolitics. Elections were held in the USA, there is a new president. And all geopolitics today is built on strength. Putin is showing the collective West and the USA that Ukraine remains important to him and the Russian Federation. And in order to stop this horror of war, he trivially raises the stakes. He wants to be spoken to on the terms he needs. The second point is also related to Donald Trump. During the election campaign, Trump announced that he would end the war in 24 hours, and that he would end aid to Ukraine as such. Russians have a very simple logic. If the US stops helping Ukraine, then missiles for Patriot air defense systems will become less, as well as for all other types of weapons, for example, for Stinger MANPADS. By the way, our defenders perfectly beat the Shaheds with them. That is, the Russians want to use their relatively inexpensive UAVs to deplete the Ukrainian stockpile of anti-aircraft missiles. Fewer rockets means a lower knockdown ratio. And then, according to the classics, launch a major missile attack on Kyiv and Ukraine. For the occupiers, our capital is not only the main goal in their war of aggression against Ukraine, it is also a sacred place. They cannot accept that the -Russian city- is resisting. Therefore, daily UAV attacks are another attempt to put constant psychological pressure on the population, with the aim of breaking the motivation for resistance. Rashists think that sooner or later the people of Kyiv will not endure and will start internal riots against Ukrainian statehood itself. He said, it is necessary to end these horrors of war and to agree on something. This is absurd. What is the enemy's logic? Even if at least one -Shahed- has achieved its goal, it does not matter whether it is a critical infrastructure object or a residential building, then the terror must continue. Another goal of the Kremlin is the economic terror of the Kyiv agglomeration, which is the largest in Ukraine. Many large enterprises that pay taxes to the state budget are concentrated here. When an air alert is declared, all these businesses cease operations. Accordingly, output decreases, and this, of course, leads to a decrease in tax revenues. After receiving in the second half of 2022 the first batch of Iranian Shahed UAVs, Russia was able to launch their mass production on its territory, as well as significantly modify them. The enemy managed to increase the production of -Shaheed- to about 2,000 pieces per month. That's a pretty big number. But, I think, they will not go higher. They have the highest explosives production capacity. They managed to raise by 30% the production of alcohol compounds used in explosives, gunpowder and aluminum powder. They also have a problem with the workforce. Of course, there are enough workers. But everything that they could put in order, they have already put in place. Without the direct help of China and Iran, the Russians will not be able to further increase the production of Shaheds.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/masovani-ataky-shahedamy-chomu-vorog-obrav-taku-taktyku-i-na-skilky-u-nogo-vystachyt-zapasiv-dumka-eksperta/	2024-11-08T20:48:50-08:00
Subletting and lifting: about the amount of payments and why it is profitable to enter into a contra...	What is the difference between -sub-hire- and -elevation-, and who can receive such assistance, ArmiyaInform tells. This is, in fact, compensation for housing rent at the place of service. It is paid if the serviceman does not have his own housing in this territory. It should be noted right away that the procedure for issuing compensation is not very simple and fast. And it may also require certain costs, in particular for obtaining certificates. The basis for payment is a serviceman's report, as well as list of documents, determined by Cabinet Resolution No. 450. But if you go this way and arrange everything, you can get quite a good amount of compensation. In particular, the following amounts have been set for 2024: For servicemen with three or more family members, compensation amounts will increase by one and a half times. This is the assistance that is provided in the event of the relocation of servicemen to a new place of military service in another settlement in connection with appointment to a military position, enrollment in military educational institutions and military colleges or training centers, the term of study in which is six months and more, without retaining the position at the previous place of service or in connection with the redeployment of the military unit. Or after graduating from military educational institutions with appointment to positions in units in other settlements. More details about who can receive such assistance is prescribed in the Order of the Ministry of Defense No. 45. How much is paid? Moving allowance is paid in the amount of a monthly allowance for a military serviceman and 50 percent of a monthly allowance for each member of his family who moved with him to a new place of military service; Per diems are also paid for each day of stay on the road to a serviceman and each member of his family who moved with him. Who are considered family members? These are the persons listed in the serviceman's personal file, in particular: How many times can you receive in the event of a frequent change of duty station? Moving allowance is paid no more than for two moves of a serviceman during a calendar year. What is needed? They are paid on the basis of the order of the commander of the military unit, which is issued on the basis of the serviceman's report. In addition, the order specifies whether the wife (husband) is a military serviceman. If necessary, the commander can organize verification of the authenticity of data on the relocation of family members of a serviceman. If both the husband and the wife are military servicemen, the lifting allowance for each of them is paid at the new place of military service, for family members - from the monthly allowance of one of them. Currently, this applies to servicemen serving under a contract or enlisted officers. Unfortunately, mobilized servicemen do not have such an opportunity. But this may be one of the motivating factors for signing a contract with the Armed Forces of Ukraine. More about the opportunities provided by the contract service you can read here.

Was -Lebedev- became -Lebedenko-: the Russian Federation is spreading a fake about the Ukrainization...	The Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, which is responsible for the functioning of -Dia-, stated that such messages were not sent and are fake. In addition to the traditional grammatical errors in the text of the screenshot, which indicate a fake, any user of -Actions- will notice a font that is not typical for this application. This fake is another propaganda attempt to discredit the Ukrainian state system and inflame tension in society by spreading false information about the alleged forced imposition of Ukrainian identity on citizens. In addition, the fake name change is a typical example of -mirroring-. For Ukrainians, such practices are absolutely atypical, but for Russians, the compulsion to change names and surnames to ones that are considered Russian is a phenomenon that has been widespread since the 17th century. In the 30s and 40s of the 20th century, the -Russification- of surnames became massive in the USSR: on the one hand, people saved themselves from repression, on the other, they sought career growth, which was impossible with a -non-Russian- surname. Among the most famous examples is the father of the ex-leader of the Ministry of Murder of the Russian Federation, Shoigu Kuzhuget, who, in order to appear more -Russian- and to pursue a party career, changed his first and last name. Even now, the Russians have not given up on this: in the occupied Ukrainian territories, people are encouraged to change their Ukrainian surnames when obtaining Russian passports.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/buv-lebedyev-stav-lebedenko-rf-poshyryuye-fejk-pro-ukrayinizacziyu-prizvyshh-v-diyi/	2024-11-08T20:09:33-08:00

The F-16 protected Donald Trump, but missed the mark on tenure	About the most famous use of the F-16 fighter during the incident, which could potentially become one of the attempts to assassinate Donald Trump, says ArmyInform. Patrolling of the airspace of the United States of America, including F-16 fighters, is carried out as part of the comprehensive control of North American airspace and airspace, which is provided, implemented and coordinated by the United States and Canada's Joint Aerospace Defense System. The joint US-Canadian air defense and missile defense system is subordinate to the North American Aerospace Defense Command. Abbreviated from the first letters of its name in English, it is known as NORAD. NORAD's headquarters and command center are located at the US Peterson Air Force Base, but the command is joint US-Canadian and is responsible for the airspace security of both countries. There are three regional headquarters under his command: the Alaska NORAD region at Elmendorf Air Force Base; the Canadian NORAD Region in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and the Continental NORAD Region at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. An F-16 Fighting Falcon from the Minnesota ANG performs a simulated interception of an aerial target during the EAA AirVenture 2024 air show in Oshkosh, Wisconsin NORAD's primary mission is to protect the sovereign airspaces of both nations by responding to unknown, unwanted, and unauthorized actions in the airspace. and the surrounding area of ​​North America. Forces and assets under NORAD monitor the airspace around the clock with the aim of detecting unauthorized actions, track air targets and, if necessary, carry out a set of measures with the aim of diverting them from their flight path, forcing them to land or destroying them if they can pose a potential threat. NORAD works in close cooperation with the US National Guard, law enforcement agencies, special services and all other components of the security and defense forces of the United States of America and Canada. Patrolling American airspace, NORAD pays increased attention to the places of stay of the President of the United States. The American media has repeatedly drawn attention to the significant increase in costs for the security of the first person of the state, including due to the fact that F-16 fighters must be constantly in the air with the support of refueling aircraft in order to provide combat air patrol (CAP) within the limits of the temporary no-fly zone around the president. During the presidential elections in the United States, the protection of the candidates for the position of the President of the United States is provided not only by the Secret Service, which is responsible for the protection of senior political figures, but also by other components of the security and defense forces of the state. This year, even the Pentagon joined the protection of candidates in the presidential elections. NORAD is also traditionally involved in patrolling the airspace in the places of rallies and other meetings of candidates for the President of the United States of America with voters. This was done both during the recent presidential race and in previous election campaigns. Increased attention to the protection of US presidential candidates is fully justified, because assassination attempts are quite frequent. Among the latest high-profile cases, we can mention the assassination attempt on the now elected US President Donald Trump on July 13, 2024 at a campaign rally in the town of Butler near Pittsburgh in the state of Pennsylvania. Then the bullet hit Trump's ear, which for a while became a symbol of the unity of the electoral core of voters around the figure of a charismatic candidate. Judging by the results of the vote, the shots to the side and next to the candidate for President of the United States ultimately contributed to his victory. However, this is far from the only and not the first time that Donald Trump's life was or could be in potential danger during the election campaign. During one of these incidents, an F-16 patrol fighter of the NORAD mission took a prominent part in preventing a possible attempt on his life. The incident occurred during a Donald Trump campaign rally on October 28, 2020 at Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport in Bullhead City, Arizona, when an unidentified aircraft entered the closed airspace without authorization, creating a potential threat to the then-current To the President of the United States of America. The pilot of the offending aircraft did not communicate with the air traffic controller and did not respond to radio warnings. NORAD's statement on the incident states: -A NORAD F-16 aircraft tracked a general aviation aircraft that failed to communicate with air traffic control and entered the temporary restricted flight area around Bullhead City, Arizona without proper clearance.- Seeing that the offending aircraft did not respond in any way to the initial interception procedures, the F-16 fighter pilot fired a warning shot, using flares to attract attention. After that, it was possible to establish radio communication with the offending aircraft and it was taken out of the prohibited zone. The firing of F-16 flares became a bright part of the pre-election show. The US president and the crowd of protesters in his support were delighted by what they saw, although they did not understand exactly what was happening. -Oh look at that! Look, look, look! They pointed to the future President! How about that?- - shouted Donald Trump, instantly noticing how to take advantage of the situation. After that, the politician, who is prone to outrage and is not picky in his words, did not forget to scold the Democrats and the American media. According to him, they never report or show anything really interesting and important, and even seem to have deliberately turned the cameras in the other direction in order not to film the F-16. It is not difficult to make sure that Donald Trump's statements turned out to be far from reality - the incident was reported in detail by dozens of local and national American media. Instead, the statement that the F-16 pointed to the future President of the United States by firing signal missiles turned out to be quite true, although somewhat premature. Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential race then but won the current 2024 US Presidential election by a landslide.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/08/f-16-zahystyv-donalda-trampa-odnak-ne-vluchyv-shhodo-kadencziyi/	2024-11-07T20:58:47-08:00
It destroys what it cannot seize: the Kremlin already realizes that it will not be able to take Odes...	Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmiyaInform about this: -Ukraine is one of the five largest countries exporting grain and leguminous crops in the world. Almost 500 million people around the world are supplied with Ukrainian grain, primarily African countries. This is a huge number. This is also a serious source of foreign currency income for our state. Therefore, the Russian strikes are aimed at reducing the export potential of Ukraine, which for grain and other crops is carried out mainly by sea. racists want to undermine our country economically. There is an important nuance. Russia is also among the top 5 grain exporting countries. The Russian Federation produces from 70 to 140 million tons per year and sells two thirds of it. So if we do not grow and sell our grain to foreign markets, then Moscow will replace us, enrich itself even more and replenish the budget for military purposes to continue the war of aggression against Ukraine. An interesting point. If the Russians set about destroying our port infrastructure, this is a sign that the Russian Federation will no longer be able to return Ukraine to its circle of interests. If the enemy understood that he could completely return Ukraine, he would not destroy the golden hen that lays the golden eggs. That is, the Kremlin already realizes that it will not be able to take Odeschyna. We need to strengthen our air defense, particularly in the south. There is a reflection on the part of South Korea regarding the transfer of anti-aircraft missile systems of their production to us. This is the Cheolmae-2 medium-range air defense system, a rough analogue of the German IRIS-T system. By the way, the Korean complex was developed using technologies from the Russian S-350 and S-400 air defense systems. Maximum range to the target: 40 km. But, again, we must understand that it will not be possible to completely close the airspace over Ukraine. Even if the maximum number of air defense systems is installed in Ukraine, there will still be a breakthrough.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/08/znyshhuye-te-shho-ne-mozhe-zahopyty-kreml-vzhe-usvidomlyuye-shho-vzyaty-odeshhynu-ne-zmozhe-dumka-eksperta/	2024-11-07T20:53:15-08:00
-- Russians? Drop your weapon-! They didn't quit. And I shot: as Junior Sergeant Dobosh broke throug...	Mr. Ilya is 48 years old. In the army - since May 2022. Joined the ranks of the 51st separate rifle battalion of the 63rd separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Military accounting specialty is machine gunner. Behind his back is a term of service in the Crimea, in Feodosia, from 1994 to 1996, after Ukraine declared independence. Served in the ranks of the construction battalion. He recalls how his military unit could not -say goodbye- to the Soviet -stars- on their uniforms for a long time - although the neighboring unit had already switched to tridents. In civilian life, he managed to master many professions: a driver, a logger, a security guard, and a forester. Originally from Transcarpathia - from Mukachevo. -Why did I join the army in 2022? Because I understood that if everyone stays at home, then the Russians can be at my doorstep. Besides, my brothers went to war. When I learned about it, I also went to war. Do I regret going into the army all the time of the full-scale war? No,- says the army man. The military man has a number of hot spots behind him, including battles for Bakhmut. Now he is on the difficult Lyman direction. The other day, at the end of October, during combat missions, he destroyed up to 10 enemy personnel and prevented a breakthrough in his position. The military recalls: -I was just at training - mastering a new combat vehicle, MTLB. He came back on Saturday, on Monday he took a turn at the front. And here they go, 20 meters away from me. I ask: -Russians? Drop the weapon!-. They lined up like goslings. The weapon was not thrown. I shot. A few hours later, a new batch arrived. They were also shot,- the unit commander succinctly recalls. The most terrible thing, says Mr. Ilya, during a large-scale invasion was when the brothers were on one side of the battle, and he was on the other. -It was scary whether I would see them again: whether I would survive or they would survive. Then it was really scary. But everyone survived, thank God. It's hard to lose your friends&#8230; Recently, I lost a close friend: a landmine flew and he was cut by shrapnel. I pulled him out of the trench, he was dragged into the car on a stretcher, but, unfortunately, he was not taken to the hospital. Three children remained and the wife&#8230; -. Mr. Ilya suffered a concussion during those events. Now undergoing treatment. But they try to find time during the war for jokes - where would we go without that. -Once they said to the fellow: -Listen, the commander was urgently looking for you! Run as fast as you can to him!-. He rushed, ran 300 meters, and only then remembered that the commander was on vacation. He stopped and turned around - and my friends and I were lying there, laughing,- Mr. Ilya recalls. The need for people in his department is palpable, says Mr. Ilya. But he emphasizes that reliable fighters are needed. -I have to be sure of my brother - that he will not let me down and will not run away anywhere. As in his commander. And this, in fact, is one of the main tasks of the commander: the fighter should not be afraid of him. He should, by his own behavior, encourage him to perform his duty well, and not to -jump on his skis- and go home. You have to treat your soldiers humanely, otherwise he won't be a good soldier, he won't want to serve.- When asked what victory will be in the Russian-Ukrainian war, Mr. Ilya answers: -When I return to my family. When my brothers, alive and well, return to their families. Someday there will come a time when we will all gather in some cafe and sit together, remember the service, remember those who are not with us. Let's remember all the good and not so much. This will be a victory for me.- Photo from the personal archive of Ilya Dobosh	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/08/rosiyany-kydajte-zbroyu-ne-kynuly-ya-j-postrilyav-yak-molodshyj-serzhant-dobosh-proryv-na-lymanskomu-napryamku-vidbyvav/	2024-11-07T20:26:46-08:00
Seven Major Destructive Mobilization Narratives Spread by the Enemy	We draw your attention to the fact that each of the above phrases is untrue and is being spread with the aim of disrupting the mobilization campaign in Ukraine, spreading panic and mistrust of the Ukrainian authorities and the Armed Forces.

Jumping into holes and pretending to be a hose: the Russians are trying to save themselves somehow	The head of the planning department of the 13th brigade of the operational assignment -Charter- of the National Guards of Ukraine Lieutenant Colonel Anton Baev. - They have chosen such a system - we partly forced them to this, because during their movement we constantly inflict fire damage on them, constantly hit them. They hide in those -holes- that they equip and dig on the routes of their tracking. A very large number of -burrows-, everywhere along all the routes they mainly use, he said. The guardsman described the usual tactics of the occupiers: - When the fire attack begins, there is a -hole- somewhere, where they all climb. If not everyone climbs there, then they hide under the trees. In the same case, if Russian soldiers are found while moving in open areas where there is no shelter, they fall down and pretend to be dead. — If we find them in some areas where their usual tactics are impossible, then they simply fall down and either pretend to be dead, or just lie there and not move, hoping that they will not be seen. But it doesn't work, the military man emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform explained that prompts Russians to surrender as prisoners in Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/strybayut-u-nory-i-prykydayutsya-shlangom-na-harkivshhyni-rosiyany-namagayutsya-vryatuvatysya-hoch-by-yak/	2024-11-07T11:53:25-08:00

Distrust and trust: what motivates Russians to surrender in Kharkiv Oblast	This was told by the commander of the 13th Brigade of the operational assignment -Charter- of the National Guards of Ukraine Colonel Ihor Obolenskyi. — During several months of defense of Kharkiv Oblast, -Charter- fighters took more than a dozen prisoners. Very often, prisoners surrender already during the wounding due to despair in their troops.

Captured Russians complain of lack of support from their own Russian people and indifference from henchmen and command. — Very often they cry, complain that no one helps them, that Ukrainians treat them much better than their own people. Unlike the Russians, our soldiers help captured enemy fighters, because we understand that each of them is a possible prisoner exchange. Each of them is a possible life of a Ukrainian soldier who will be returned to our land, Ihor Obolenskyi emphasized. The Charter commander explained how important prisoner exchanges are for every Ukrainian soldier. — When we see that such exchanges happen, when our fighters return home, we see their eyes, their happiness, then for us and for all the soldiers of our brigade, this is a sign that our political power President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi Head of Office Andriy Yermak, Parliament all in order for our fighters to return home. So we are grateful for that, said the soldier. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Kharkiv direction, Russian soldiers are more afraid of their own commanders than of Ukrainian ones of the military, but they surrender only because there is no way out.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/znevira-i-dovira-shho-sponukaye-rosiyan-zdavatysya-v-polon-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-11-07T11:07:05-08:00

Reinforced concrete or earth holes: can the enemy gain a foothold in the north of Kharkiv region	The head of the planning department of the 13th brigade of the operational assignment -Charter- of the National Guards of Ukraine Lieutenant Colonel Anton Baev. - Enter immediately and it is possible to pour concrete if the enemy enters and we do not have a stable line of defense. Currently, there is no such situation in our direction. We see everything that happens. We hold the lines, we are entrenched and equipped, we control all approaches, approaches of armored vehicles for 5-8 kilometers, he said. The military explained that it allows to control the actions of the enemy, who has no way to build powerful fortifications or shelters. — The enemy was forced to walk small for long distances to their positions. Sometimes even the route from point A to point B can take more than 24 hours. We see them, we accompany them. Therefore, we are not talking about any kind of concrete here, - emphasized the officer. However, this does not mean that the occupiers are not trying to fortify themselves - they are constantly digging earthen shelters. - Digging - yes, they dig all the time. They dig with a tool, they dig without a tool, but there is no concrete at the moment, Anton Baev emphasized.

Property is not worth life: the military explained the importance of evacuation from the north of Kh...	About the importance of timely evacuation on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon the representative of the communications service told Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev of the -Charter- Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine. — Liptsi is a strategic settlement, because it is located on commanding heights and from there it is possible to hit Kharkiv with barrel artillery. From there, we managed to knock out the Russians back in May, and we continue to knock them out [further]. However, now it is practically a ghost village with no civilians because it is constantly hit by both FPVs and other means and artillery, he said. The military officer noted that there are no hostilities on the territory of the village itself, but it is absolutely impossible to live in it under constant fire from the Russian military. — There are no hostilities as such, but there is no life there, no population, because all civilians have been evacuated from there. And here I would like to remind you about the importance of evacuation from front-line zones because property is not worth human life - the Guardsman noted that the evacuation of civilians from the zone of active hostilities also significantly facilitates the work of the Ukrainian military and gave a specific example when the absence of civilians made it possible to neutralize a Russian manned aircraft a bomb that did not explode. — It makes it easier to get around, to locate, and basically to work. For example, recently our sappers had to neutralize an unexploded anti-aircraft gun that fell into one of the sheds right in Liptsi. There is no possibility to take out the KAB, that is, they have to be blown up. This is an explosive wave that can reach a quarter, and it is obvious that we definitely need to be sure that there are no civilians nearby, Volodymyr Degtyarev emphasized.

The fog hides everything: in the north of the Kharkiv region, the enemy is being watched despite the...	The head of the planning department of the 13th brigade of the operational assignment -Charter- of the National Guards of Ukraine Lieutenant Colonel Anton Baev. — Weather conditions are changing and are currently changing for the worse. We are seeing more phenomena such as fogs, which last longer during the day and are very disruptive. It starts to get darker earlier, the night part of the day gets longer, more cold comes. That is, the conditions of the war are changing and now everyone is adapting to them, both us and the enemy, he said. However, the activity of the enemy in view of the weather conditions has not decreased - the occupiers are intensively preparing for the onset of winter with further significant cooling. — The enemy is currently accumulating, pulling up its reserves. We see enemy soldiers approaching with heavier loads, gear and equipment. Perhaps they are bringing to their positions and preparing various insulation for winter, the military said. Instead, enemy offensive actions in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Charter- brigade decreased. — The enemy has not carried out offensive actions in the last 2-3 days. Armored vehicles were not recorded, but a lot of movements are recorded, the guardsman noted. The officer explained that the weather affects both sides equally, and who uses it to their advantage depends a lot on planning and preparation. — The weather affects both sides equally: both us and the enemy. How to use it depends on the task and the mind of those who use it. But the fact that it complicates the work is precisely because even the same intelligence - both winged intelligence and intelligence through drones that is taking place - its quality becomes worse, the officer explained. This forces the soldiers of the Defense Forces to look for new ways to detect the enemy, and not just rely on the usual reconnaissance with the help of UAVs. — We understand that we can no longer fly so far, we can't hang for so long, the fog hides everything, that is, thermal imaging devices on drones do not always help. This is a powerful factor that greatly affects intelligence and it is necessary to take it under close control and constantly look for some alternative sources of information and somehow solve it, because there is less information due to the fact that we do not see each other, Anton Baev emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform explained, who will take advantage of the change in weather conditions in the Kharkiv direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/tuman-vse-pryhovuye-na-pivnochi-harkivshhyny-za-vorogom-stezhat-popry-zminu-pogodnyh-umov/	2024-11-07T08:27:09-08:00

At first, the pilots of the 14th brigade of operational assignment -Chervona Kalina- tracked the enemy's infantry, waited for them to enter the dugout, and after that began to destroy their positions. After the -Baga Yaga- worked, the -dragon drones- began to destroy the Russians. In the Kharkiv region, drone operators from the -Sharp Cartouches- special unit of the NSU -Omega- tracked down three Russians who were calmly chatting near a burning house. Due to the noise from the fire, the enemy did not hear how our drone with a reset hovered above it, so the pilots had enough time to aim. The mine clearly got between the Russians, two of them managed to get away on their own, and one of them landed in the place of the drop. The Ukrainian Su-25 destroys the Russians with four unguided S-24 missiles. Usually S-24 is used to destroy fortifications and manpower in shelters.

A representative of the communications service told about this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon with the public of the -Charter- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev. — The weather is getting worse, weather conditions are getting more difficult. At night, in the morning and for most of the day, there is fog, which, accordingly, limits the use of UAVs, both reconnaissance and strike, both enemy and ours, he said. The military explained that the more prepared side will be able to take better advantage of the change in weather conditions. - It is clear that this is used by someone who is prepared for it. From our side, we see that the enemy is trying to bring down separate small groups of fighters, to replenish their losses, which they have suffered in recent weeks, in particular in our sector, - said the guardsman. Currently, in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Charter- brigade, the occupiers have practically given up the use of equipment. - They practically do not use trucks, cars, and armored vehicles, because we have successfully burned almost everything that appears in recent weeks. Therefore, their tactic is to move in small groups that carry ammunition, food, rigging groups trying to bring in some fuel, - said Volodymyr Degtyarev. The spokesperson of -Charter- reported that currently, despite the deterioration of weather conditions, the guardsmen continue to effectively destroy the enemy with the help of heavy night drones. - We understand from the intercepts, we hear that they are restless, because, despite the weather, our night drones continue to disturb them, bomb their fortifications every night. They have difficulties with evacuation, because it is practically non-existent, because the equipment does not come, so most of their wounded remain there and sooner or later turn into two hundred, - said the representative of the public relations service. He also spoke about the enemy's losses during October. — If we look at the results of enemy losses for the past month, we can see that we hit a hundred and they will never see this world again, and more than a hundred are wounded. However, it is possible to assume with great probability that these losses are also irreversible, - noted Volodymyr Degtyarev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Russians are gradually being -pushed out- - from the north of the Kharkiv region - in October, they completed the de-occupation of 400 hectares of forest massif within the boundaries of the Lipetsk community of the Kharkiv region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/pole-boyu-v-tumani-vijny-hto-skorystayetsya-zminoyu-pogodnyh-umov-na-harkivskomu-napryamku/	2024-11-07T05:52:16-08:00

The enemy plans to integrate -Cossacks- into fake volunteer battalions on the TOT	About this informs Center of National Resistance. The battalions perform a propaganda function and are designed to create the impression that the local population is voluntarily fighting for the occupiers. A similar function in the Russian Federation is performed by -Cossack communities-, which the Russians set up on the TOT with the same goal. Now the Kremlin has decided to merge these two fake structures. Hoping in this way to at least slightly increase the number of fighters in the -battalions-, as well as to emphasize the narrative that, they say, -Cossacks- support the aggressor. However, all these reorganizations are not successful, because, as mentioned above, these structures are not capable of carrying out combat tasks and are just a mass that lives on grant funds from Moscow. We would like to remind you that in the Russian Federation oil refining is being stopped.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/vorog-planuye-integruvaty-kozakiv-do-fejkovyh-dobrovolchyh-bataljoniv-na-tot/	2024-11-07T04:49:43-08:00

Sanctions work: oil refining stops in the Russian Federation	This is reported by Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The shutdown of the refinery is predicted to have a negative impact on the domestic volumes of oil refining, the fulfillment of export obligations, worsen the situation with the supply of fuel to the domestic market, and increase the costs of maintenance and modernization of enterprises. It is expected that the volume of oil refining capacities during downtime will be 1.8–2 million tons per month. The real reasons for the downtime of the refinery in the Russian Federation are limited access to Western equipment and components due to international sanctions and the impossibility of replacing foreign spare parts necessary for the maintenance and modernization of the refinery. In fact, the Russian import substitution program did not produce significant results. Actually, Russian equipment manufacturers provide only about 30-45% of market needs, and only in some components (pumps, compressors, reactors, etc.). Also, the Russian Federation failed to use China as an alternative supplier of equipment, since Chinese technologies are not always compatible with Russian equipment, which sometimes requires a complete replacement of equipment and significantly increases repair and maintenance costs. Earlier ArmyInform reported , that the Russians forcibly throw men from TOT into the infantry in Kurshchyna.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/sankcziyi-praczyuyut-u-rf-zupynyayetsya-naftopererobka/	2024-11-07T03:53:04-08:00

In Siversko-Donetsk, the occupiers are forcing the townspeople to refuse in writing from demonstrative repairs. Only in the presence of a written statement is there a slight possibility that the builders will not replace the surviving windows with cheaper ones, will not dismantle plumbing fixtures, doors, and will not remove valuable items and furniture from the apartment. However, these statements are not collected centrally. Only contractor companies accept them. Therefore, in order not to be left with nothing, the locals try to apply in writing to several teams of repairmen at the same time.

What do you think, Comrade Kim: The Republic of Korea presented a -monster rocket- weighing 36 tons	For a long time, official Seoul kept its new development - the Hyunmoo-V missile - a secret. Now it was officially presented at a military parade in South Korea (ROK), ArmyInform reports. In the words of X platform user Mason (@mason_8718) who reports regularly and in great detail about South Korea's defense industry, the Hyunmoo-V is classified by the ROK military as a -super-capable ballistic missile- (UPBM). Although the Hyunmoo-V was previously announced profile publication The Defense Post, the South Korean military has not yet provided any precise or definitive information about its characteristics. Usually, such information is deliberately withheld in order to make it difficult for an adversary to obtain information about new developments. However, the experts of the Army Recognition defense portal made some technical explanations. With a height of 15 to 16 meters, a diameter of 1.6 meters and a weight of 36 tons, the Hyunmoo-V has the dimensions of an intercontinental ballistic missile. For comparison: the modern American ICBM Minuteman III has a length of 18 meters, a diameter of 1.7 meters and a weight of 35.3 tons. Intercontinental ballistic missiles are usually equipped with nuclear warheads and have a range of more than 10,000 kilometers. In Minuteman III, the nuclear warhead weighs 400 kg; the missile can cover a distance of 13 thousand kilometers. For the Hyunmoo-V, the corresponding figure should be only 3 thousand kilometers - and that is under the conditions of using a warhead of reduced weight. Weapons experts have estimated that the range is only 300 kilometers when fully loaded. But the explosive power of the rocket is huge. The heaviest warhead reportedly weighs up to 9 tons. This means that the Hyunmoo-V may now be the most powerful conventional (non-nuclear) weapon in the world when it comes to explosive power. Until now, the American GBU-43/B aerial bomb was considered as such a weapon, better known as MOAB, which contains 8.48 tons of explosives. Ballistic missiles cannot even come close to such parameters. They are designed for nuclear warheads that cause great destruction at a much smaller mass than conventional explosives. The closest to the Hyunmoo-V in terms of parameters is the Chinese Dongfeng 21C, which can carry a 2-ton conventional warhead at a distance of up to 1.7 thousand kilometers. This begs the question: Why would a weapon as large and bulky as an ICBM but with a much shorter range be needed because it has an extremely large payload? The point is that Hyunmoo-V was built for a specific purpose and to be used against a specific opponent. The warhead, which reportedly weighs up to 9 tons, is so heavy because it is a penetrating part, also known as a -bunker destroyer.- Her kinetic energy must penetrate walls and the ground before exploding. North Korea's fortified facilities are the target. These include command centers in the mountains, weapons factories in tunnels, command bunkers and underground nuclear facilities where North Korea is stockpiling nuclear materials. At the beginning of 2024, South Korea announced the successful test of Hyunmoo-V missiles. According to preliminary data, the tests probably took place in December 2023, when the missile was launched from the west coast and hit a group of islands located at a distance of about 185 kilometers from the launch point. This distance is comparable to the distance between Seoul and Pyongyang, which underlines the missile's importance to South Korea's defense. In theory, Hyunmoo-V could also be used as a hypersonic glider, for example, to destroy ships. South Korea is working on one of them, but it has not yet been unveiled. Photo 5. South Korean strategic missile system Hyunmoo-V on parade in Seoul (ROK). Photo: Hanwha Aerospace It is planned to launch missiles not only from cargo launchers, but also from a new type of ship. The Joint Strike Ship (JSS) is currently in the concept development stage. It is designed to be able to launch as many cruise missiles of different sizes and for different purposes as possible. Construction of the three ships is scheduled to begin in 2030. Official Seoul plans to purchase at least 200 Hyunmoo-Vs. They are manufactured by the South Korean company Hanwha Aerospace, which is a key player in missile development of the Republic of Korea.

In addition, a two-story private house is on fire in the Podilskyi district, and units of the State Emergency Service were dispatched to the scene. As reported by ArmyInform, as a result of the attack by drones of the Russian armed forces on Kyiv, in the Holosiivsky district, an apartment in a residential building was damaged. Also in this area, a fire was registered on the territory of the garage cooperative. Rescue services are already working at the scene. In addition, next to the garages that caught fire in the Holosiivskyi district, a fire broke out at a nearby service station. The total area of ​​the fire is 300 square meters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/naslidky-udariv-dronamy-po-kyyevu-v-misti-palayut-budynky-poshkodzheno-medzaklad-ta-biznes-czentr/	2024-11-06T20:55:36-08:00
War in the sky: an expert spoke about the enemy's new developments in the field of UAVs	And now it is important to understand what is in the enemy's arsenal in order to effectively implement new developments to actively counter the enemy's drones. A well-known expert, former deputy chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, lieutenant general, spoke in more detail about this Ihor Romanenko: -After the events of 2014, we saw that unmanned aerial vehicles have a future. And what's more, by 2014, under my leadership, we developed the concept of combating the enemy's unmanned aerial vehicles, which was approved by the then Minister of Defense of Ukraine Yezhel. But due to the fact that his position, I I understand that it changed under the influence of the Russians, so this matter did not go beyond the concept. That is, this Minister only verbally promised to further promote this direction. But then, after all, our group from the Central Research Institute of Weapons and Military Equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine worked in this direction. It was in 2015-16 at the front, already during the Anti-terrorist operation. The group consisted of two parts. The first was involved in the implementation of our drone developments, which we had: Stork, Fury and a number of others. The second part of the group, which I headed, resolved the issue of how to fight the enemy's unmanned aerial vehicles. And at that time we focused on the means of radio-electronic warfare. The Russians were also developing all this, they worked out their developments. Unfortunately, at the end of 2022, the situation changed: the enterprises of the military-industrial complex of Russia overtook us in this direction. On our side, all this time the development of electronic warfare tools, which were supposed to suppress Russian drones, was going on. > This year, the enemy has modernized its drones in a number of directions. The first thing he did was apply artificial intelligence. What we are talking about here: when the enemy's FPV drone is aimed at an object that is covered by our electronic warfare means, at this stage the drone loses control and does not hit the target. And in order to overcome this, the Russians began to use elements of artificial intelligence. That is, they control the drone to the appropriate distance, and then the control passes to artificial intelligence, and EW tools do not affect it. So then the drone -captures- the target and then automatically points to it. The Russians have also modernized and are installing fiber optic cable on the drones. Optical fiber follows the drone, and it is controlled via a cable. Accordingly, our means of radio-electronic warfare do not affect the enemy drone. And this is how the target is hit. And now, from our side, there are developments that will fight with such means: in addition to fire damage, other options are offered. We must also say that due to the fact that we affected the enemy's A-50 long-range radar reconnaissance aircraft, the Russians have now switched to the use of tactical-level strike-reconnaissance systems. That is, they use a reconnaissance drone that can operate at a range of more than 100 kilometers. It scouts and drops data for the -Iskander- battery, which is working on purpose. ... Our Defense Forces, in turn, during 2023-2024 are actively scaling up the production of drones. Maybe we don't have much money for it, but there are talented developers. And by the way, the private sector is also now actively and effectively helping the army in this area. Well, there is always a question of time. We don't have time for everything yet, but the main thing is that we have the latest developments.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/vijna-v-nebi-ekspert-rozpoviv-pro-novi-rozrobky-voroga-u-galuzi-bpla/	2024-11-06T20:48:32-08:00
UBD benefits: as a participant in hostilities, you can park for free in the capital	ArmyInform tells about how combatants can take advantage of this benefit. According to the rules of improvement of the city of Kyiv, the right to free parking of vehicles is used: As reported in -Kyivtransparkservice-, at the moment, when parking, participants in hostilities need only attach a document entitling them to benefits to the lower left corner of the windshield. In particular, a copy of this document can be made and attached, and personal data can be redacted. In the future, the system of preferential parking should change. A corresponding algorithm is being developed. It is not yet known when exactly it will become operational. Therefore, it is worth following updates on the -Kyivtransparkservice- website. Please note that parking at municipal lots is paid only on weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. At other times on weekdays and during the day on Saturdays and Sundays, parking is free. In total, 3 zones with parking lots are defined. You can read more about the addresses of the locations of such sites on the Kyivtransparkservice website.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/pilgy-ubd-yak-uchasnyku-bojovyh-dij-bezkoshtovno-parkuvatysya-u-stolyczi/	2024-11-06T20:33:39-08:00
Counterfeiters issue humanitarian aid for support from the state: why should they?	However, this is a fake, are written in the VoxCheck project. Despite the fact that the order shown in the video is real, the help shown in the video is unlikely to have been provided by the Ukrainian authorities. Most likely, this is humanitarian aid. After all, among the demonstrated items, there is not a single one that would be produced or sold in Ukraine. Instead, propagandists passed it off as state support for the families of fallen soldiers. The goal of such fakes is quite obvious - to devalue the life of a Ukrainian soldier and discredit the state authorities of Ukraine. We remind you that the families of Ukrainian soldiers who died at the front receive a one-time payment of 15 million hryvnias from the state. If a soldier died during the period of service, but not during hostilities, his relatives are provided with monetary assistance in the amount of 750 subsistence minimums. As of January 1, 2024, the subsistence minimum is UAH 3,028 for able-bodied persons. That is, the family of a fallen soldier receives almost 2.3 million hryvnias. However, this amount may change with changes in the size of the subsistence minimum. These sums, 2.3 million or 15 million, are divided equally between all members of the deceased's family. The following have the right to receive funds: parents of the deceased; one of the spouses who did not remarry; children under 18 years old; dependents. Also, families of soldiers who have gone missing, in addition to maintaining monthly payments for a soldier (postal salary, salary according to military rank, allowances for years of service, other monthly additional types of financial support), are provided with an additional payment, which was assigned to a soldier for participation in hostilities, in the amount of 100,000 hryvnias. The family is deprived of such payments if the soldier voluntarily surrendered, deserted or voluntarily left the military unit or place of service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/fejkoroby-vydayut-gumanitarnu-dopomogu-za-pidtrymku-vid-derzhavy-nashho-cze-yim/	2024-11-06T20:07:28-08:00

Without pants at the kobzon concert - the Russians were caught undressing their own dead	The looting video was released on November 6 on the brigade's channel. Our pilots were recording the numerous bodies of the slain occupiers scattered in the bushes, when they accidentally came across a group of three living Russians. These three tried to pull off the pants of the murdered brother. Another naked Russian was lying nearby, whose pants had already been taken off. After a long struggle, the Russians were finally able to pull off the pants of the second comrade, after which they happily carried the loot to the dugout. It is not known why the Russians urgently needed the pants of the murdered. Perhaps the temporarily living occupiers were so impressed by the combat work of the Defense Forces of Ukraine that they urgently needed to change clothes. &nbsp; As reported by ArmyInform, the fighters of the 60th mechanized brigade of Ingulets, together with their comrades from the 66th mechanized brigade named after Prince Mstislav the Brave, struck well stopped another enemy assault.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/06/bez-shtaniv-na-konczert-kobzona-rosiyan-spijmaly-na-rozdyaganni-vlasnyh-zagyblyh/	2024-11-06T11:57:24-08:00

Three agents of the Russian Federation who aimed Russian missiles at Prykarpattia received 13 years ...	This was reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. SBU officers detained the attackers in the western region of Ukraine in the first days of the full-scale war. The accomplices of the aggressor turned out to be three residents from Kyiv, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, who were recruited by Russian intelligence back in 2021. The agents acted as part of a group and -locked in- to several Russian curators, with whom they communicated through anonymous chats of the popular messenger. According to the instructions of the occupiers, those involved were supposed to prepare data for a missile attack on the airfield in Prykarpattia, and after the enemy attack to -report- on its consequences. In order to carry out the enemy's task, the agent from Kharkiv acted under the guise of a -travel blogger-, who used a drone to make a video of a panoramic view of a strategic object and posted the recorded files on Instagram. Another agent, a resident of Kyiv, settled near the airfield on the eve of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation in order to record aircraft takeoffs and landings in real time. She provided the received information to a third member of the Russian agency to forward the intelligence to the occupiers.

Operation Gabriel: details of Russia's war crime against Ukrainian children	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. We are talking about the commander of the 205th separate motorized rifle brigade of the Russian Armed Forces, Dzhabrail Yusupov, with the call sign -Gabriel-. According to the investigation, in July 2022, under his command, a group of 20 armed invaders broke into the Novopetriv special school and kidnapped 15 children. The children, together with the school principal and her husband, were taken to the Crimea, and later to Anapa, Krasnodar region of the Russian Federation. For a month, they were kept in a boarding house, where the children were forced to sing the Russian national anthem. Only in November 2022, thanks to one of the charitable organizations, it was possible to take the children from the Russian Federation through third countries and return them to their homeland. Based on the collected evidence, Yusupov was notified in absentia of suspicion for violating the laws and customs of war (Part 2 of Article 28, Part 1 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). Currently, measures are being taken to search for him and bring him to justice. This is not the first time that the SBU investigates such crimes. Earlier, an occupation official of the Kherson region was exposed, who also participated in the deportation of Ukrainian children. The investigation is being conducted under the procedural guidance of the Prosecutor General's Office.

- Trump will be more decisive, he will resolve the battle deep into Russia, and the end of the war-,...	Some commentators were outraged, because -not a single US president has done anything good for Russia.

In his name, he will resolve the battle in the depths of Russia. And that's the end of the war.- Some -narrow-minded- tried to push the narrative that -Trump has traditional values, and that means Russia.- However, such a wretched man immediately received answers in the form of -He was shooting white tomahawks over the heads of our base in Syria, and then he said that his daughter had advised him so and he decided to strike!- Why do we need such a traditionalist who is ready to start a nuclear war?-. The rest of the Muscovites were very excited, because -under Trump, we received the most crippling sanctions-; he also gave more weapons to Ukraine than Obama. Israel also supports Trump, and therefore Russia's ally, Iran, will also be bad.

This was discussed during the meeting devoted to issues of inclusivity and barrier-freeness, held under the chairmanship of the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General of Justice Serhiy Melnyka. Yes, field trials of demi-season uniforms for women are currently underway. And the first samples of the winter uniform are prepared for scientific and research tests. -The introduction of women's form is important, in particular, because the dimensional grid of the form for men is not relevant for women,- Serhiy Melnyk said. At the same time, he added that the process is slowing down due to the low interest of manufacturers to provide test samples for the tests necessary to develop technical conditions for production. The Ministry also takes into account the results of field testing of summer uniforms and underwear. Changes to the technical conditions of certain elements of military clothing are already planned, taking into account the feedback of female military personnel. Serhii Melnyk also emphasized the need to provide women's bulletproof vests that would meet the protection requirements when reducing the weight of armor plates. Also within the scope of the -Wounded Package- project initiated by the Ministry of Defense this year, requirements for adaptive clothing that will be provided to wounded servicemen are being developed. According to the plan, from 2025, a set of such clothes will be issued irrevocably and free of charge at stabilization points and during inpatient treatment. The project covers all units of the Defense and Security Forces, therefore it requires interdepartmental agreement and the adoption of the relevant resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. In addition, as part of the implementation of the National Barrier-Free Strategy of Ukraine The Ministry of Defense will reconstruct part of its buildings by the end of 2024. -For this year, work on 10 medical facilities of the Ministry of Defense was planned and financed. Elevators, ramps and other equipment will be built and put into operation there, which will make life easier for servicemen who have received disabilities and have corresponding needs.

President Trump: great risks or great opportunities for Ukraine?	-During the months leading up to the US presidential election, I was asked many times the question: 'Who is better for us: Trump or Kamala?' The following answer seemed the most correct: Thus, with the victory of Donald Trump, we find ourselves on the threshold of a period of change. Despite the flurry of despair in the popular media, there is good reason to hope that the new administration's actions will be favorable to us. Let's find out why this is so. The years of Joe Biden's administration (2021-2025) will go down in history as a catastrophically unsuccessful period for the United States in the context of foreign policy. The surrender of Afghanistan to the Taliban, the large-scale Russian-Ukrainian war, the aggression of Iran and its proxy forces against Israel, the deepening of ties along the -axis of evil- Russia-China-Iran-North Korea - this is just a list of the main failures committed by Washington in previous years. Against this background, Trump's first term (2017-2021) was distinguished by an exemplary foreign policy strategy. Let's recall how in the mid-2010s terrorist attacks by the Islamic State took place in different parts of the world. Under Trump, the US military, together with its allies, eliminated the IS threat. At the beginning of 2020, the legendary (and infamous) Iranian general Qassem Soleimani was eliminated. Several Arab states signed a peace treaty with Israel (the Abrahamic Pact). A treaty was signed between North and South Korea. Currently, three actions of the Biden administration that prompted Vladimir Putin to attack Ukraine can be singled out: Donald Trump is now promising to do two things on his first day in office: close the southern border and restore oil production permits to make the United States the world's largest oil producer again. This should collapse the price, which has been holding for a long time at the level of $70-80 per barrel, favorable to the Russians. We have heard Trump's statements many times that he will stop the Russian-Ukrainian war in 24 hours. He even said several times that he would do it even before the inauguration, which is scheduled for January 20, 2025. Obviously, this will not happen so quickly, but the fact is that the newly elected president sees the Russian-Ukrainian war as a problem that needs to be solved as soon as possible. It is not for nothing that he, unlike Kamala Harris, mentioned Ukraine during most of his speeches on the eve of the elections. At the beginning, the priority of the new administration will be to stop hostilities, that is, to freeze the front line in current positions. Of course, one should not hope that Trump will immediately convince Putin to release all Ukrainian lands. But it is worth recalling his words a few months ago: -If Putin does not obey me, I will arm Ukraine to such an extent that he will regret it.- That is, the acceleration of the pace of arms delivery is considered by Trump as a way to deter Moscow. Let's not forget that it was during Trump's first term that Obama's embargo on the supply of lethal weapons to Ukraine was lifted. An extremely important factor is the fact that the Republicans won a majority in both houses of Congress. Full one-party control will ensure a high speed of decision-making, in particular regarding new aid packages for Ukraine. Broad bipartisan support for pro-Ukrainian initiatives will remain in the Senate and the House of Representatives. A negative factor can be Trump's entourage, led by his vice president JD Vance, Tulsi Gabbard, Robert Kennedy and others. Vance is known for his statements regarding the inappropriateness of large-scale US intervention in the Russian-Ukrainian war. He outlined his vision in an article for the New York Times, where he described the optimal scenario, in his opinion: freezing the front line and starting negotiations. However, it is worth noting that Vance never spoke about openly handing Ukraine over to Moscow. The activation of US foreign policy in other directions should be positive for Kyiv, in particular: Over the past four years, Washington has made many mistakes that need to be corrected immediately. We hope that an exemplary foreign policy strategy will be a feature of Trump's second term as well. Be that as it may, the main difference between the Trump administration and its predecessors should be the determination to achieve the chosen strategy, whatever it may be. Biden, Blinken and other incumbent officials have always made loud statements about supporting Ukraine to the very end, ensuring victory, etc. But their actions differed significantly from what they said: the weapons always arrived with many months of delay and in insufficient quantities. The USA did not provide Ukraine with everything it needed when we could develop success in the second half of 2022 (the Kharkiv operation and the liberation of Kherson), or when we were preparing for an offensive in the summer of 2023. Currently, the main task of President Zelensky is to direct Trump's determination in the direction we need. The Victory Plan presented by us should become the main argument during Trump's talks with Moscow. A period of indolence and indecision on Capitol Hill is being replaced by a time of great change and great opportunity. Opportunities that we should take advantage of.

Attack on the Caspian flotilla, the Reb did not help the Russians, Magyar and the wormhole: a stream...	In particular, we are talking about probably missile ships -Tatarstan- and -Dagestan-, small missile ships of the flotilla were also damaged. Drone pilots of the -Rarog- unmanned systems battalion of the 24th OMBr shared a video clip of how they hunt Russians. Our fighters find the occupiers in various situations; some of them hoped to be protected by EW, some tried to run away, some shot back, or pretended to be dead. As a result, everyone died.

$4,000 each from a swindler — in Transcarpathia, the head of the regional TCC and the deputy command...	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on November 6. According to the materials of the National Police investigators, both figures acted separately, but used similar -schemes-: in exchange for bribes, they offered conscripts to avoid conscription on the basis of forged documents about -bad- health. To do this, officials provided potential conscripts with fictitious medical reports of the VLK about the presence of serious diseases. In the future, evaders used a forgery to remove themselves from military registration and could illegally leave Ukraine. The cost of such -services- was from $4,000 per client. On the basis of the received evidence, both officials are suspected (according to the crimes committed) under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: An investigation is ongoing to establish all the circumstances of the crime and bring the perpetrators to justice. Perpetrators face up to 10 years in prison with confiscation of property. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/06/po-4-tysyachi-z-uhylyanta-na-zakarpatti-vykryly-ochilnyka-rajtczk-ta-zamkombryga-teroborony/	2024-11-06T06:46:05-08:00
The General Staff of the Armed Forces explained why they are creating new brigades instead of replen...	The conversation with Dmytro Lykhoviei was published on November 6. -Recently, the enemy has increased the number of regiments, brigades and divisions and the number of personnel by almost 100,000 people. The length of the front line also increased. In order to close the front, new brigades must be created within the Armed Forces,- Dmytro Lykhova said. According to him, there is simply no other effective way to counter the enemy who prevails, as today there are 1,300 km of frontline with active combat clashes. He also noted that the Russian occupiers have a significant advantage, sometimes fivefold, on the battle line. -Therefore, when during hostilities there is a threat of losing the positions and lines of defense of certain brigades, the redeployment of individual battalions of other military units is used here. This is a logical and regulated method of action to strengthen the defense: when there is a threat of a breakthrough in problematic areas of the front, units from unattacked areas are transferred to it,- Dmytro Lykhova assured. He noted that in conditions of insufficient forces and means, this is the optimal way to counteract the prevailing enemy forces, thus reducing the risk of a breakthrough. Also, according to the spokesman, it should be taken into account that currently the Armed Forces do not have the opportunity to quickly replenish the brigades with personnel. -Such a need is scheduled a month in advance. It is also necessary to understand that the people who join the unit must undergo adaptation and coordination in it, and this takes time. That is why, to strengthen the section of the front, where there is a threat of a breakthrough, an already formed unit is used, which is ready to perform the task in a short time,- explained Dmytro Lykhova. In addition, Lykhovi emphasized that brigades are also needed for rotation and replacement of already existing brigades. -You can't limit yourself to the simple replenishment of brigades that have suffered significant losses either - because they need combat coordination. New brigades are needed to replace them and withdraw them from the area of ​​hostilities,- noted Dmytro Lykhovi. As reported by ArmyInform, the spokesman of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Captain Dmytro Lykhovii kinczya-roku/->told about the consequences of the audit for the IT sphere in the Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/06/genshtab-zsu-poyasnyv-dlya-chogo-stvoryuyut-novi-brygady-zamist-popovnennya-nayavnyh/	2024-11-06T06:32:53-08:00

Ukraine expects a new tranche of aid from the EU in the amount of 1.9 billion euros — Rustem Umyerov	He wrote about this on his Facebook page. In addition, Rustem Umyerov expressed his gratitude to the head of the Committee, Mrs. Delphine Pronk, and the EU ambassador to Ukraine, Katarina Maternova, for their constant help and support. Thanks to European partners, Ukraine is successfully implementing a number of important security initiatives, in particular as part of the EUMAM Military Assistance Mission, which since October 2022 has already provided training for more than 62,000 Ukrainian military personnel in EU countries. By the end of the year, this number will increase to 75 thousand. The minister welcomed the EU ambassadors' decision to extend the mission's mandate for another two years and expressed hope for conducting exercises directly in Ukraine, which would speed up the training of Ukrainian defenders. The Minister of Defense also called on European countries to invest in military production in Ukraine, proposing to conclude long-term contracts for the joint production of drones, long-range weapons and ammunition. He emphasized the expectation of a new tranche of aid from the EU in the amount of 1.9 billion euros at the expense of frozen Russian assets, as well as the importance of allocating an additional 6 billion euros from the European Peace Fund to strengthen the Ukrainian army. Rustem Umyerov emphasized that the future of Ukraine lies in the European Union and NATO, and the country will continue to strengthen cooperation for a joint fight against the coalition of dictatorships led by Russia.

After interrogation, it turned out that this Pitkevich has quite a long combat experience. In October 2022, while serving a sentence in one of the Russian colonies, he agreed to sign a contract with the private military company Wagner. As part of the units of the PKK, he initially participated in the storming of the settlements of Soledar and Bakhmut. In June 2023, he took part in the -hike- to Moscow, which was then organized by the leader of the -Wagner- PMK. In June of this year, he signed a new contract and entered the service of the 155th Marine Infantry Brigade of the Russian Federation. In August, when the brigade was transferred to Kurshchyna, he took a direct part in the hostilities as an assistant grenade launcher. At the end of September, he witnessed the murder of two Ukrainian prisoners of war near the settlement of Hlushkove. According to him, the order for the execution and subsequent removal of the heads from the bodies was given by the commander of the unit. -The prisoner of war gave his name, as well as the names of the soldiers - the direct perpetrators of this war crime!!! According to intelligence reports, currently the 155th separate marine brigade of the Russian Pacific Fleet has suffered very significant losses in Kurshchyna, due to which the personnel of the unit often leave combat positions and refuse to carry out orders.

The commander of the 95th airborne platoon told about this on the broadcast of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- - of the Polish Assault Brigade Stanislav Krasnov. According to Krasnov, the aggressor's losses are huge — dozens of killed Russians remain lying on the defense line every day. That is why, he believes, it was necessary to attract foot soldiers from North Korea. Although Ukrainian defenders perceive Koreans more as a joke. -No one takes the infantry from North Korea seriously as a combat unit. Everyone perfectly understands that this will be another cannon fodder, a complete waste, which is unlikely to be able to have any impact,- the representative of the 95th Airborne Assault Brigade shared his impressions.

the Russians executed at least 109 unarmed Ukrainian soldiers	This was reported by the National Information Bureau with reference to an interview with the head of the Department for Combating Crimes Committed in of the armed conflict, Office of the General Prosecutor Yuriy Belousov. According to him, the number of executions of captured Ukrainian soldiers began to increase significantly at the end of last year. Prior to that, the facts of torture prevailed. Yuriy Belousov emphasized that the physical destruction of Ukrainian soldiers in captivity, in particular through executions, torture and terrible conditions of detention, shows the elements of genocide. Ukraine collects evidence of the aggressor's crimes from all possible sources. These are the data of our military, intelligence, information from interrogations of Russian prisoners of war, etc. Despite all the complexity of investigating cases, caused by the impossibility of access to the scene of the crime, bodies and conducting an examination, there are real sentences for war criminals. In the future, not only the perpetrators will be brought to justice, but also the entire vertical of the organizers of such crimes: those who incited, gave orders and did not respond to such crimes.

An ecological disaster is approaching in the community and district. Next year, the Russians will leave Luhansk Autodor without large orders and, accordingly, without additional funds. Because contracts with this company are concluded only for the maintenance of highways. Repairs, in particular, and capital ones, will be carried out by contractors from Russia. Currently, five enterprises from the regions of the Russian Federation have already been selected, which will be involved in the work in the so-called LNR. The occupiers do not need foreigners.

That is why it was decided to conduct an offensive operation to overtake with the transfer of hostilities to the territory of the enemy in the Kursk region. For almost three months of the operation, as of November 5, 2024, the losses of the enemy in the Kursk direction in terms of personnel amounted to 20,842 people, of which: liquidated - 7,905, wounded - 12,220, captured - 717.

Against infantry and tanks: what is known about the M136 Volcano remote mine system	As write the authors of the Taiwanese magazine The Liberty Times, created by American designers back in the 80s of the last century, the M-136 Volcano remote mine laying system is still in demand on the world arms market, ArmyInform reports. At least the military from this island immediately ordered 14 sets of these installations from the United States. The relevant agreement entered into force last year after the US State Department approved a proposed $180 million arms package that included Volcano systems and M977A4 HEMTT trucks. But in September of this year, Taipei received a message that these -remote miners- will not be delivered to the island until 2026. The M136 Volcano is an automated mine delivery system that can rapidly deploy large minefields in a variety of environments using prepackaged containers. This weapon is capable of quickly laying both anti-personnel and anti-tank mines over a large area, creating deterrents against potential enemy landings and vehicles. Defense publication experts Army Recognition underline the universality of the deployment of this weapon. -Volcano-, which is how the name of the installation is translated, can be both ground-based (Ground Volcano) and air-based (Air Volcano). The system is quick to assemble and disassemble and uses modified GATOR mines available in active or inactive canisters. The Ground Volcano modification is optimal for setting deep and tactical minefields. This system uses an M139 dispenser and an easy-to-operate dosage control unit. Ground Volcano uses modified GATOR mines, available in both combat and training versions. The system includes three main components: M87A1 ammunition, M88 and M89 training ammunition. Each M87A1 container contains six anti-tank mines and one anti-personnel mine. Anti-tank mines are equipped with magnetically induced detonators that are activated when objects with metal components move. This makes the mines particularly effective against armored vehicles. Anti-personnel mines, in turn, are activated with the help of strings that can reach up to 12 meters in length. The mines are 12 cm in diameter, 6 cm high, and each mine contains about 605 g of explosives. Mounted on an Oshkosh Defense HEMTT A4 M977A4 truck, the Volcano system can carry 960 anti-tank and anti-personnel mines, deploying a minefield up to 1,100 meters long and 120 meters wide within 4-12 minutes. This factor ensures operational protection of important facilities and strategic points on the battlefield. Mines are equipped with a self-destruct mechanism after a specified time, which ensures that unexploded ordnance does not pose a long-term threat. The M977A4 truck used to transport the Volcano system is equipped with a number of modern technologies that make it a reliable and maneuverable vehicle. Its features include a 500-horsepower Caterpillar C15 diesel engine, traction control, anti-lock braking and air suspension. These characteristics ensure high passability, including overcoming water obstacles up to 1.2 meters deep. The M136 Volcano system is a powerful tool for creating minefields, providing reliable protection against enemy offensive operations. Its mobility, speed of deployment and high efficiency make it an integral part of the arsenal of modern armed forces. M-136 Volcano remote mining system.

-Our -Caesar- has already fired 1,500 shots-: the commander of the French self-propelled guns on com...	The first batch of such vehicles arrived from Denmark, which handed Ukraine all 19 self-propelled guns it had in service. Currently, these self-propelled guns are used in units of the 148th separate artillery brigade of the Zhytomyr Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The gun commander with the call sign -Chrom- was among the first Ukrainian artillerymen to master this technique in Denmark. >He talked about the advantages of French self-propelled guns and their use in the conditions of modern warfare in a conversation with the correspondent of ArmiyaInform. He also worked in this specialty abroad. He says that he joined the Military Commissariat at the end of spring 2022, but in the end he was accepted for military service only at the beginning of summer. &#8211; I got a position as a driver-mechanic in the 95th Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, I worked on the self-propelled artillery howitzer 2C1 -Gvozdika-. After the training center, he arrived in the eastern direction, the Svatovo-Kreminna district. Already two weeks after my arrival, I was put in the crew, - recalls the gunner. Then the crews were constantly on trips and there were not even close to such a number of enemy drones. - Only the first time they saw -Lancet-, they didn't know what it was yet. He then hit the equipment, at first we thought it was an RPG projectile. The intensity of the work was much higher, our self-propelled guns stood at a distance of 2-5 km, they fired along the front, it was possible not to hide very much, - says -Khrom-. About six months later, he received a concussion, already during hostilities in Serebryansky forest in Kharkiv region. A mine flew next to his ACS, so close was the crew to the front line. For a while, Khrom dropped out of the crew, and at the same time he was offered to go for training on the CAESAR ACS. - I said that there are guys with more experience, but the combatant answered: -Their experience is for these guns. And you will do better for CAESAR,- he recalls. In Denmark, Ukrainian gunners trained for only two weeks, but this time was enough to master the machine. Every day there were classes from 8 in the morning to 9 in the evening. Then there was an accelerated course to train people before the arrival of the first batch of these self-propelled guns in Ukraine. Now the training period has increased. — At the time of training, I was a driver-mechanic, but after returning to Ukraine I was appointed a gun commander. At the same time, I was transferred to the 148th artillery brigade, which was being formed at the time, - adds -Khrom-. At the beginning of the summer of 2023, -Khrom- and its crew used the French self-propelled guns for the first time in the Zaporizhzhia region. They mainly fired in the direction of Robotyny, where there were enemy fortifications. He mentions that even there there weren't as many drones as there are now in the East. - Now we interact with the air reconnaissance unit, they report enemy -birds-, then we determine when to work. The main advantage of this machine is mobility. We can make a march of 100 km, shoot back and leave, - explains the commander of the gun. But in combat conditions, the weather sometimes makes corrections, the self-propelled gun weighs 35 tons and it is more difficult for it to move in the mud. Also, due to its considerable size, it is more difficult to disguise. - Before arriving in Ukraine, our machine fired 55 shots, it was actually new. We have already fired about 1,500 shells. Some machines have 3-4 thousand rounds, says Chrom. Among the other advantages of the CAESAR self-propelled guns are an armored cabin and anti-mine protection, as well as a French guidance system known throughout the world. > —We mostly work in the rear, throw shells at them behind the front line. The optimal shooting range is 18-20 kilometers, but we also shot at 34 km. However, accuracy is lost from the range, the crew adds For the self-propelled guns, different types of projectiles are provided, the crew chooses them depending on the task and the targets identified for hitting. The division says that most of the repair works on French self-propelled machines are carried out by their own efforts. — For example, our mechanic Oleksandr, who used to repair combines. He determines the problem by the sound, these guys are the ones who keep these machines. He could already tell the French manufacturers about all the nuances in combat conditions and how these self-propelled guns can be improved, - praises his brother -Chrom-. According to him, there are enough people in the division, they are quite willing to join the artillery . A new addition has arrived recently, young guys. Now the new recruits are undergoing training in Ukraine, the training center has such a machine and there is an opportunity to get basic knowledge. At first, newcomers work in parallel with other crew members and gain experience. Gradually, independent trips begin, for example, to shoot at the ban, -Khrom- explains. It is not difficult to master the machine, the gunners say. Already in the brigade, experienced colleagues will tell and show everything. In the same way, specialization will be determined on the spot. A person can come as a gunner, but in the commander's opinion, a novice can be more effective as a loader. - Everything is checked in practice, otherwise no way. Currently, Ukraine has the largest combat experience of using these self-propelled guns. Their application was developed without taking into account EW, drones. Drones have changed everything and we are already learning how to use CAESAR in a new way, -Khrom- summarizes.

Elections in Moldova and Georgia: what they have in common and how it will affect the situation in U...	Oleksandr Chupak, an expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Research-, tells about this in an exclusive comment to ArmiyaInform. -Both in Georgia and Moldova, the elections were accompanied by numerous reports of interference by Russia and violations of democratic standards. In both countries, there were cases of falsification and manipulation at the polling stations, which were noted by observers of the OSCE and other international organizations. Pro-Russian political forces in both countries used propaganda and tools to pressure the electorate, emphasizing the dangers of rapprochement with the EU. Both countries have significant pro-European segments of society, especially among the youth and urban population, who aspire to integration with the EU. These people took part in mass demonstrations in both capitals to express their support for pro-European leaders and to resist pro-Russian pressure. In Moldova, this support helped the pro-European candidate Maia Sandu win, and in Georgia, despite significant resistance, pro-European forces continue their struggle.- -Despite the common features, the elections in these countries had significant differences. In Moldova, the victory was won by the pro-European force led by Maya Sandu, who was able to unite the electorate around the idea of ​​European integration, in particular thanks to the support of the Western diaspora and urban centers. In Georgia, the ruling Georgian Dream party, which is supported by the pro-Russian oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, maintains power thanks to administrative resources and extensive falsifications, according to the opposition. Her next victory in the parliamentary elections caused public protests that continue to this day. The general political climate is also different. In Moldova, the president has significant influence on political processes. In Georgia, President Salome Zurabishvili, although he supports pro-European values, has limited power, which allows the government to act in favor of pro-Russian interests; she condemned the falsifications during the elections.- -The events in Moldova and Georgia have a direct impact on Ukraine, as those countries are facing challenges similar to ours on the road to European integration. Ukraine, waging a full-scale war against Russia, should actively work with countries that can become our allies in the fight against the occupier. Especially with Moldova and Georgia, which, like us, suffer from the occupation of their territories by Russia. The situation in Georgia is a reminder of the risks that arise when pro-Russian forces hold power. A parallel can be drawn between Ivanishvili's rule and Yanukovych's time, when a clear oligarchic vertical of control over power and business was established in Ukraine. Under such conditions, the perspective is to approach the current status of Belarus, and the Georgian opposition understands this well. In the context of Moldova, the situation with Transnistria is always interesting for us. The Russian enclave should have been liquidated at the beginning of 2022, but then Maya Sandu did not want to spoil relations with Moscow. Sandu's victory means that Ukraine has the opportunity to strengthen its influence (political, economic, etc.) on Chisinau with the aim of preventing Moldova from returning to the Russian orbit.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/06/vybory-u-moldovi-ta-gruziyi-shho-spilnogo-ta-yak-cze-vplyne-na-sytuacziyu-v-ukrayini/	2024-11-05T20:17:47-08:00
Propagandists justify the involvement of the DPRK in the war: they invented a new fake	Responding to this, Russian Telegram channels began to write that there were -infiltrators- behind the controls of this military equipment. This is allegedly due to the fact that among specialists in the Armed Forces there are colossal losses and the training period of the Ukrainian military is shortened. So, according to the propagandists, taking this into account, the appearance of the North Korean military in the Russo-Ukrainian war is natural, and this should not be surprising. Propagandists seek to fuel the narrative by reporting on the -Nativs- who control Western military equipment. about a possible war of the Russian Federation against the entire NATO bloc, and not only against Ukraine. That Ukraine is allegedly only a puppet in the hands of the -NATO masters- and -NATO bases and troops- are located on its territory. For example, the -Nativites- are fighting on the side of Ukraine, so soldiers from the DPRK can supposedly fight for Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/06/propagandysty-vypravdovuyut-zaluchennya-kndr-do-vijny-vygadaly-novyj-fejk/	2024-11-05T20:02:33-08:00
From convicts to marines: which Russians are fighting in the South of Ukraine	Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- : — Our south is quite large and there [are] various Russian units of its connection. For example, representatives of Russia's -Northern Fleet- are stationed at Tenderivska Spit at the mouth of the Dnieper. These are the marines, there are also various units that the Russians also use in hostilities. Next are mainly representatives of their combined armies of the southern district. Closer to the east are the representatives of the Eastern Military District. In addition, we have several units of their -airborne troops-. The spokesman noted that the training of fighters of different units and units differs significantly. — As for their training, it is different. There are also professionals, -specialists-, and there are their so-called mobilized, who already have a certain level of training. In addition, there are small units, mainly in the assault squads, which are units of former prisoners. This phenomenon is not widely used, but it exists, said the spokesperson of the -Tavria- OUV. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the south The Russian army of Ukraine has concentrated about 200,000 troops, these forces also include the occupation troops in Crimea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/vid-zekiv-do-morpihiv-yaki-rosiyany-voyuyut-na-pivdni-ukrayiny/	2024-11-05T12:17:51-08:00
Cold and wind: how they have already affected the battlefield in Kharkiv region	toldabout how the change in weather conditions has already affected the battlefield in Kharkiv Oblast on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- /a> spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Lt. Col. Yevhenii Romanov. — The enemy now attacks mostly with infantry. We know that the enemy is constantly accumulating forces and resources. He imports ammunition, equipment, food, warm equipment, fuel and lubricants. He is preparing for the winter, he said. Answering the presenter's question about the possible accumulation of tanks by the enemy in the area of ​​the village of Hlyboke of the Lypetsk community, north of Kharkiv, the spokesman noted that the Defense Forces are monitoring all the actions of the enemy and are ready for any development, and tanks are a very vulnerable target in this regard. part of the battle line. — We are aware of our enemy's actions, but for obvious reasons we will not say what our troops are preparing for him in this direction. But I will note that tanks are a very vulnerable target in this direction and we are ready for it, the spokesman emphasized. The officer said that in recent days the nature of hostilities was significantly affected by the weather. — If we talk about the last two days, the weather had a very significant effect. The number of combat engagements and losses on the part of the enemy decreased by almost a third, the number of displaced equipment decreased, and their activity decreased. It snowed, it rained, it got colder, and the change in weather is making significant adjustments at the moment, the military officer said. The impact of changing weather conditions on the enemy's use of light UAVs is particularly noticeable. — Very strong wind. What flies in the air is quite vulnerable. Speaking about small FPV drones, -maviks- and similar unmanned aerial vehicles, the weather significantly affects them, Yevgeny Romanov said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, which remains the main consumable of the occupiers in Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/holod-i-viter-yak-vony-vzhe-vplynuly-na-pole-boyu-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-11-05T12:08:04-08:00
The occupiers again resort to forced medical examinations	This is reported by Center of national resistance. Inspections will be carried out in villages with the help of mobile medical complexes. Collaborators from district administrations are responsible for attending these inspections. During examinations, doctors will campaign to conclude a health insurance contract, for which you must have a passport of the Russian Federation. That is, one of the goals of these reviews is to identify those who have not received passports. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the enemy shelled Donetsk region again.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/okupanty-znovu-vdayutsya-do-prymusovyh-medychnyh-oglyadiv/	2024-11-05T11:57:55-08:00
A correctional officer of the Russian Federation and two collaborators were detained in Kherson	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on November 5. Another detainee turned out to be a resident of the regional center, an agent of the Russian military intelligence (better known as GRU), who adjusted enemy fire on the Defense Forces. To do this, the defendant traveled around the territory of the community on a scooter and tried to identify the locations of Ukrainian troops involved in hostilities at the front. The priority targets of the enemy were camouflaged headquarters, firing positions and strongholds of units of the Armed Forces. The agent sent the received information to the Russian game via messenger in the form of screenshots with the markings of military objects on Google maps. During the special operation, the Security Service detained the traitor in her own apartment and carried out comprehensive measures to secure the positions of the Defense Forces. Another detainee is a 60-year-old ex-law enforcement officer from Kherson, who after the capture of the community joined the local occupation administration of the Russian Federation. There, the former mayor of the city, Oleksandr Kobets, appointed the collaborator as his -deputy on legal issues.- Among his main tasks was the preparation of a pseudo-referendum of the Rashists regarding the accession of the region to the aggressor country. The third suspect, who was detained by the SBU together with the National Police, is also a resident of the regional center, which during its occupation was part of the so-called -Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Kherson region.- In the ranks of the pseudo-institution, the collaborator was engaged in the -passportization- of local residents through forced registration of Russian citizenship. Investigators of the Security Service informed the detainees of the suspicion (according to the crimes committed) under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: The perpetrators are in custody. They face from 15 years in prison to life imprisonment with confiscation of property. As reported by ArmyInform, a spy from Sloviansk received 15 years in prison. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/u-hersoni-zatrymaly-koryguvalnyczyu-rf-ta-dvoh-kolaborantiv/	2024-11-05T11:42:46-08:00
Everything will be repainted: how winter will affect the palette of war	Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — Cold weather always brings certain corrections, first of all, it increases the importance of various thermal imaging tools. That is, it is better to see where what warms whom, he said. Also, the cooling and approach of winter will lead to the fact that the battlefield will be repainted in the literal sense of the word. — In addition, when it is a cold season, firstly, the palette of the battlefield changes. This very arena, it turns a different color. In particular, if it was green, then it turns gray, yellow, then white. That's why camouflage and, shall we say, quality camouflage is essential. And not only for a person as camouflage, but also to hide equipment, the spokesman emphasized. The change in weather will also affect the fighters. - In addition, when such weather changes, it becomes much more difficult for a person to be in such a temperature field. Therefore, there are many different nuances of the changes that will occur when the colder period begins, the military explained. So far, the temperature regime in the South of Ukraine is quite comfortable, but cooling is inevitable. — But for the past few weeks in the south, the weather has been dry and we now have a temperature there of 3-4 plus at night, and 15-17 during the day, well 15, let's say, quite comfortably, Vladislav Voloshyn reported. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that during assaults in the South, the enemy uses vehicles almost exclusively as a means of delivering infantry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/vse-perefarbuyetsya-yak-vplyne-zyma-na-palitru-vijny/	2024-11-05T11:32:46-08:00

Means of delivery of infantry: in the South, the enemy uses vehicles as -taxi-	Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — Our situation has not changed much for several days, or weeks in a row. The enemy continues to launch rocket attacks on the positions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine and settlements adjacent to the battle line. The enemy continues to conduct a counter-battery fight. The enemy is conducting an assault, he said. Currently, the enemy's assault actions are mainly reconnaissance in nature. — We don't have as many assaults as in some other areas, but they do exist. The enemy is carrying out so-called combat reconnaissance in certain directions and is preparing to carry out assault actions in several directions, the military officer explained. The officer said that the tactics of the enemy's actions remain unchanged - these are assaults by small infantry groups. — Assault actions carried out by us are carried out by infantry forces, small infantry assault groups of 5 to 10 people. the Russians are not changing their tactics. During these assault operations, they use light vehicles such as motorcycles, ATVs, and buggies to cover the distance between the trenches as quickly as possible, the spokesman said. Armored vehicles are rarely used by the occupiers and mainly as a means of delivering manpower, not fire support for assault operations. — In addition, in certain directions, in particular, in the Vremiv direction near Levadny, the enemy also used armored vehicles several times, but not as a means of fire support for the actions of assault groups, but in order to transport these assault groups. The enemy drove them up, struck and destroyed them, Vladyslav Voloshyn explained. From this review, it is not possible to talk about the full participation of enemy armored vehicles in the assault. — It is currently not possible to say that the enemy used armored vehicles in offensive operations. However, it is on the battlefield and it is being prepared for use. In addition, in the Dnieper direction, the enemy is actively using such means, such equipment as boats, the officer said.

The retired FSB agent dreamed of -evacuation- to Russia and solving material issues	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. According to the case materials, the defendant was a military pensioner from the Mykolaiv Oblast, who came into the view of the occupiers during his trips to the Russian Federation even before the large-scale war. After the start of a large-scale invasion, an FSB employee remotely approached the man and offered him cooperation. In exchange for helping the Russians, the man was promised -evacuation- to Russia with further resolution of his material issues. On the instructions of a Russian special service agent, the agent scouted the locations of the Defense Forces, on which the Rashists planned to carry out airstrikes using Shahed-type kamikaze drones and missile weapons.

The decisive role was played by the professional work of Ukrainian artillerymen, who destroyed most of the enemy's armored vehicles with targeted strikes. Operators of anti-tank guided missiles were also distinguished, who eliminated several tanks with accurate shots. -Our fighters showed the enemy that his tactics of numerical superiority do not always work. Each of our soldiers knows what he is fighting for his people and has a clear goal. They once again proved to the Russians that Ukrainian land cannot be broken,- one of the officers of the 10th Mountain Assault Brigade emphasized. -This failure once again demonstrated the weakness of Russian tactics, which are based on numerical superiority and -massive attacks- that disregard the lives of soldiers.

BZVP of students: when and from what course will universities teach how to defend Ukraine	Mykhailo Vinnytskyi, Deputy Deputy Minister of Education and Science of Ukraine, told about this on the air of Novosti.LIVE . — The adopted law obliges us to introduce basic general military training in institutions of higher education in 2025. Obviously, this does not apply to freshmen, because they are mostly seventeen years old. It is most likely that it will be the third year, where the students have already reached 19-20 years of age and are of legal age, he said. Educational innovation, according to the deputy minister, is in no way connected with mobilization. — The mobilization age remains 25 [years]. It's just that a person who graduates from higher education should be able to handle a weapon, know where meetings are held in case of need, how to defend themselves in case of need, how to provide first aid with tactical medicine in case of need. All these things are included in basic general military training, explained the Deputy Minister of Education and Science of Ukraine. Currently, the system is being developed, training grounds are being prepared, and from January 2025, the training of instructors will begin. — This is a continuation of the initiatives that the Ministry of Education has now introduced to reformat -Defense of Ukraine- as a subject in high school, Mykhailo Vinnytskyi emphasized. The Deputy Minister also announced that in 2025, the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine will develop a project for the training of reserve officers. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Defense Forces participate in the reform of the school course -Defense of Ukraine-, The Cabinet of Ministers will finance the purchase of modern equipment for the updated course, and military training teachers in schools under the project of the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Veterans will become war veterans.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/bzvp-studentiv-vidkoly-i-z-yakogo-kursu-u-vyshah-navchatymut-zahyshhaty-ukrayinu/	2024-11-04T22:27:25-08:00

From the steering wheel -medevak- to the NRK remote control. A frank conversation with a stormtroope...	We met with him not far from the combat mission area and talked about the war for an hour and a half. Let's quote the direct language of -Makara-. I grew up in such an environment, had such an upbringing that for me the question did not arise when the war began: to go or not to go. The answer was self-evident. There was only a question of where to go, with whom to move and to which part of the front. There were calls, they said, let's go abroad. But I didn't get into such conversations, I clearly understood what I wanted and where I was needed. It would be a breach of conscience for me not to get involved in the problem that exists at this stage of history. My field of activity changed every year: in the Kyiv campaign I was an infantryman, in the Zaporizhzhia direction - a driver of a -medevak-. During the Bakhmut campaign, he was transferred to the assault company to the position of a machine gunner, then he was a mechvod, an M113 gunner. The commander of the assault group in the end. The most difficult was in Avdiivka, it cannot be compared with anything. Now I am responsible for a completely new direction for us - ground robotic complexes. It just needs good infantry experience, an understanding of the battlefield, tactics and how everything is arranged on the front line. I was always interested in developing something new. All these positions, it was not in the format that I was forcibly placed, given an order. It was a choice moment. I could stay and continue to work in the medical service, I could remain the same machine gunner, driver mechanic. In our team, you can choose what you want to do. I have a lot of people now who are not directly involved in the battlefield, but they are as useful as possible to support the infantry, in general, to the life of the battalion. We understand that there will be no benefit from a person who does not have the desire to do this or that. At the very beginning of the great war, motivation was very powerful. I went to war with the thought that I would not last more than two weeks here. Nevertheless, I will do something useful and right, even if it leads to my death. Then this motivation changed: the more professional I become, the longer I will live on the battlefield and in this war in general. And the more good things, actions that lead to victory, I will be able to do. After the loss of my brothers, the motivation changed dramatically, and now I want to avenge these guys. War is constantly changing: almost every six months there is a different style, character, technology, opportunities for conducting both defensive and offensive actions. Both with us and with the enemy. The armed forces are developing very quickly. We have surface drones, our own long-range drones that attack the Russian Federation. But still, the human resource on the battlefield will be the main one, because everything is focused on the fact that the same FPVs, drop systems, ground reconnaissance complexes, everything is adjusted to destroy the infantry that holds the lines. But we can do everything with the help of technology to help the infantry do their jobs. Infantry will be the main factor on the battlefield in any case. The infantry will always be the most important argument, because if there is a person there, then it cannot be assumed that it is our line. It will never be possible to completely replace a person in the trenches of work. We've had cases recently where most of the enemy's infantry simply didn't make it to our front lines simply because they were being maxed out by drops and FPV drones. Out of 100% of personnel, 10% reached the front line. This already simplifies the infantry's work as much as possible. She already has less impact on her positions and it's easier for her to do her job. &nbsp; &nbsp; A post shared by Kolya Makarov (@_kolya_makarov) 70% of my unit consists of fighters with assault infantry experience. And there is a young addition with no combat experience that just makes up for it. There are young guys 19-20 years old, and there are men who are already 30-40 years old. But in general, we do not have an age barrier. Age does not matter here, at all. It is decided by your experience, your ability to act, and the level of your motivation. And it very often happens that the commander of the department is a young guy, and he has men under his command who are 45 years old. They listen to him and do what he says. They consider him their commander and do not want anyone else. There are also girls in the teams, they are mostly in the positions of BpLA operators, NRK operators. But there are other examples. I was once given an infantry assault unit with a seconded group. There was a girl who had never been in battle before. And I had never been on the defensive with girls before and had never attacked. And the boys were critical of her. But literally a day or two later, everyone was in shock, because she dug trenches better than everyone else, carried out night combat duty better than everyone else, performed tasks better than everyone else. And later, already in her battalion, during the assault, this girl was left alone in the position, holding the defense herself. When reinforcements arrived, she led the group she was given. It was her third or fourth combat appearance. This shows that not everything depends on age and gender in war. Discipline, motivation and your inner core decide here. We need to put a new cadre of officers on their feet - young, active ones who have come through modern battles. Because what we are seeing now on the front line is largely the fault of the commanders. We can do the right thing in current situations, but we need a modern approach. In our brigade, there are only those people who came up from the infantry in commanding positions. A year or two ago, you were doing your job in the trenches, storming, defending, and now you are a platoon, company, battalion commander. Most of them are people aged 30-35. We have quite a few young group commanders in our battalion, who are 18-20 years old, and they show themselves very cool on the battlefield as commanders. A leader generally has a very strong influence on a team. It may be that the group is not motivated. But if the commander knows how to present information well, teach well, show people that they are important to him, he is ready to go with them to the end, and that it is really important to him that they know how, whether they have learned it, then the group becomes motivated . &nbsp; They understand that no one is going to abandon them just like that. And they are ready to work. I recently sent a very powerful cool branch commander to where he will grow and develop even more. He went to a higher position than mine, in fact, but I see that it was useful for everyone. Civilians do not fully understand what is happening here. In their eyes, everything looks like a person was stuffed into a -bus- and immediately taken to war. People do not understand what the front is like, what front-line cities are like, how the principle of work in the army is arranged, that not everyone is fighting on the front lines here. People need to be told more about how the army is organized. When they understand this and know what functionality awaits them in the service, the number of people who will voluntarily go to the army will increase. The rear and the front are different worlds, of course, it always has been. But I began to notice that when I see acquaintances, friends in the rear, they have a certain fear of communication, a certain fear of conversation, because they do not know what to talk about. And it is felt very strongly. I'm not pissed off by people in the back, I'm pissed off by people who aren't doing anything to win. When friends ask: -Well, what should we do?-. I say: just ask yourself a question every morning when you wake up. He set himself a goal and a task to do something for the country. I would like the civilians to understand: we can live in peace here in the rear only because there is someone who holds the defense, who died at night so that I could live this day. I would advise civilians to prepare. Medicine should be studied at least minimally. Tactics. We somehow didn't think about it. There are many opportunities for this in the country. When you are ready for something, you feel more confident. We have a test week of the attack aircraft, there is a cool FPV school. Come at least to talk to the military simply. In addition to the BZVP, we also have training at the brigade, battalion, and unit levels. When a person comes to me, he has time to join the team, to get used to it. If I see that a person is not ready, he will not go to the battlefield. A person must be prepared, and I can never ask a person to do something that I have not taught him myself. He was, is and always will be. Don't be afraid only of fools. During hostilities, fear goes overboard, but you need to be able to adjust it correctly and understand that on the battlefield there is only you, the enemy and death. And now you have such a game, who will throw this death into whose basket. And that nothing will help you at that moment, except yourself. Therefore, fear should be put in the background and act. If you give in to fear, then 100% you will not return from the battlefield. Or die in the next battles. It is necessary to understand that it is necessary to act now and already. And everything will depend on how you act. When you defeat yourself inside, break through all these moments of hesitation, then, in principle, not a single challenge will be scary for you. Fantastic question. Very often plans get in the way of work. We will plan when everything is over. My plans for now are to make sure that as few parents as possible cry for their sons who are forever in the war. Because this is the most difficult, the most painful moment - to look into the eyes of the parents of their brothers whom they buried. And at that moment you realize that you are ready to give everything so that all of this does not happen. Therefore, I advise all commanders, if you lose your soldiers, to go to their funerals and talk to their parents. This then gives a very great motivation to work even better, deal with personnel, do everything more professionally in order not to make even small mistakes on the battlefield. To save personnel as much as possible and to perform the combat task as efficiently as possible.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/vid-kerma-medevaku-do-pulta-nrk-vidverta-rozmova-zi-shturmovykom-pro-tyl-strah-komandyriv-i-plany-yakyh-nemaye/	2024-11-04T21:05:43-08:00
-Iron Fist- will provide Bradley: the US has ordered an active defense system	As informs the official portal of the US Department of Defense, profile an agreement was signed with General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems, which will install active defense systems. The total cost of the work is $191.2 million for BBM equipment with an unspecified number of these systems, ArmyInform reports. And the direct manufacturer of this equipment is one of the leading Israeli gunsmithing companies, Elbit Systems. Her site in May this year announced that the Haifa-based company has been awarded an initial contract worth approximately $37 million to supply Iron Fist active protection systems (APS) for General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems (GD-OTS) to upgrade the US Army's Bradley M2A4E1 infantry fighting vehicle (IPV). The contract will be executed within 24 months. Iron Fist (in Ukrainian - -Iron Fist-) APS is an advanced Hard Kill system aimed at increasing the self-defense capabilities of armored platforms against modern threats on the battlefield. It is the second generation APS of the Israel Defense Forces, characterized by high performance and low requirements for volume, weight and power consumption. The system provides armored platforms with 360-degree protection against a wide range of anti-tank threats, such as anti-tank missiles (ATMs), anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), unmanned aerial vehicles and threats located both in the open and in urban areas. . Thanks to the use of modern technologies, Iron Fist creates a protected hemisphere around the machine, effectively tracking and destroying threats. At the heart of Iron Fist's operation is the use of radars (Radars) that detect and identify missiles/projectiles/UAVs aimed at an armored vehicle. After detecting an enemy target, the information is transmitted to the on-board electronics, which coordinates the launch of the interceptors. These obstacles, created from flammable materials, minimize the number of fragments during an explosion and neutralize the threat with a powerful shock wave. Therefore, the threat is destroyed or deviated from the flight path, which significantly reduces the risk of hitting the target. Iron Fist has high application flexibility. The system can be installed on various types of armored vehicles, including light vehicles. At most, thanks to the use of electronic-optical sensors, the system is able to determine the location of the shooter, as well as automatically turn the BBM tower towards the threat, if this function is activated by the operator. An additional advantage is the possibility of installing Iron Fist in stationary positions, which makes it a universal means of protecting both mobile and stationary objects. Iron Fist launchers can be adapted to different customer requirements. The standard configuration includes two-charge installations, but options with an increase in the number of interceptors to six or even eight are possible, although the latter have not yet become widespread. For heavy equipment, as a rule, two launchers with different numbers of charges are used. Light vehicles such as the MRAP are equipped with a single installation. To simplify firing in response to light vehicles, you can additionally install a machine gun that will automatically turn towards the enemy object, which greatly facilitates the work of the crew. It should be noted that the first prototypes of the Iron Fist active defense complex were developed in the 2000s and, in addition to being installed on Israel Defense Forces (IDF) vehicles, were also offered for export. The system was primarily created to neutralize guided anti-tank missiles and rocket-propelled grenades, and is currently being tested to intercept armor-piercing feathered sub-caliber projectiles. Yehuda (Udi) Vered, General Manager of Elbit Systems Land: -Our Iron Fist active defense systems represent the highest level of innovation, offering comprehensive protection against emerging threats on the modern battlefield. Through this strategic collaboration with GD-OTS, we are honored to contribute to the advancement of the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, providing the US military with additional capabilities to effectively and safely accomplish their missions.- How reported ArmyInform, since the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine codified and allowed for operation in units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine almost 40 samples of foreign and domestically produced armored vehicles. Among them are M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. Iron Fist Active Protection System (APS) for Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles.

Чи вистачить резервів: експерт про втрати армії рф та її подальшу долю	But to what extent can this affect the overall power of the Soviet Union group in Ukraine? Simply put when people in the enemy army are over? But is there anyone else there to call up for military service? An expert of the Center for Defense Strategies, Viktor Kevlyuk, told about this: -If we talk about the mobilization reserve of the Russian Federation, then we should remember that their the previous defense minister said that Russia has up to 20 million people who could be drafted. Official Russian statistics say that Russia has a population of 143 million. Accordingly, about 27 of them are people of draft age. Therefore, if the Russian military medical commissions do not bother much, and that is what they are doing, there may be up to 25 million. in my opinion Again, we do not forget about the Russians who are serving their sentences, and the enemy is very actively recruiting them for military service, thus disposing of criminality. Now we have to talk about the active enemy army, its say, individual segments: what state are they in now. Special operations forces in the Russian Federation are quite small. Russian SSOs have -raked out- enough at the front in Ukraine to make their existence difficult, but the requirements for selection there remain quite strict, and the preparation &#8211; Quality. And I personally expect neither reduce their combat qualities or reduce their numbers. It is a specialized structure to get there anyone. On the other hand, they are part of the respective military districts and armies. These are special purpose brigades and regiments. They suffered very large losses in 2022, when they were used as a prepared infantry, and this is the way of using these specialists, in fact, led to very serious losses. Special forces of the Russian Federation has remained about half since 2022. All the rest are conscripts called up from the reserve, who previously served in the special forces and have the appropriate training. But they are a little older. Accordingly, they tolerate physical stress differently than young fighters. But they have experience, and many even have the experience of several military companies, including Syrian. Therefore, we will observe the tendency where the units of the Russian Federation will become worse and worse. Here they tried to select people, tried to prepare them. But when the task was set to deploy new divisions, the enemy took 31 separate landing brigades from Ulyanovsk, on its basis formed 104 airborne assault divisions, including a Motorial Regiment of Territorial Forces and another mobilization. . And they were simply assigned the name of assault troops. Although in both regiments, no person who at the time of reformat was served in them, had no airborne training. That is, these were ordinary guerrillas who were simply -lucky- to become paratroopers. Later in the division to include the 345th Parachut-Destant Regiment. are currently performing their tasks in the Kherson direction. They did not show themselves in any way, but they &#8211; -дєсантніки-. На початку вторгнення у противника були 76-та та 7-ма десантно-штурмові дивізії, 106-та та 98-ма повітрянодесантні дивізії. And there were three more amphibious assault brigades: the 11th, 83rd and 31st. Відповідно, всі ці -організми- зазнавали втрат, бо виконували роль штурмових загонів. Тож повітряно-десантні війська рф залишаються високомобільним компонентом, вони маневрують вздовж всієї лінії фронту. Вони відносно непогано укомплектовані, відносно непогано забезпечуються. Але, по-перше, це легка піхота, а по-друге, це підрозділи, які зазнають величезних втрат, бо виконують завдання непритаманні повітрянодесантним військам. According to those who started the war, about 40-50% remained in the ranks. British intelligence claims &#8211; 50% And in some military units, probably less. For example, from the 331 regiment, which -distinguished- in Bucha, there is little left, because as soon as it fell into the field of view of the forces of Ukraine's defense forces, it was mowed by everything than it is. Marines. Її намагалися підтримувати на певному рівні, але це дуже важко робити через те, що та морська піхота, яка нині воює проти нас, це – партизани в бригадах другого чи третього формування. Приміром, 810 бригада Чорноморського флоту переформовувалася три рази: після боїв за Маріуполь, після боїв на Херсонському напрямку, і зараз добивають її третій склад у Курській області. Інформація, яку я бачу у відкритих джерелах, дозволяє стверджувати, що на відміну від спецпризначенців і десантників, у морській піхоті рф час від часу лунали відомості про підрозділи, укомплектовані колишніми в&#8217;язнями. Це говорить про те, що морська піхота виконує задачі штурмовиків і людей там сильно не шкодують. Якщо перейти до підрозділів мотострілецьких, то – їх до біса багато, і це основа угрупування російських військ в Україні. І ми бачимо, що росія веде війну за зразком 1916 року, коли піхота своїми масами давить на противника за підтримки артилерії і, можливо, авіації. Тобто, коли ми говоримо про ворожу піхоту, то ми говоримо про війська, які мають базову підготовку і досвід ведення бойових дій. І важливий момент – ми спостерігаємо тенденцію поступового зменшення якості військ рф. As the Defense Forces of Ukraine knock out their bones, people without training and without special knowledge come to take the place of the fallen Russian soldiers. I think that the enemy group in Ukraine will gradually degrade. If in February 2022 it had from 150 to 190 thousand, in December 2023 &#8211; 400-450 thousand, now we are talking about 470 thousand. Але російська система комплектування поступово дає збої та не в змозі постачати поповнень, які б вже покривали втрати. Так, в період з 29 вересня до 24 жовтня вбитими, зниклими безвісти та дезертирами противник втратив десь 18100 військових та ще 39400 пораненими і хворими. 23% will not return to the army due to severe wounds and amputations. In total, about 5,7500 soldiers were departed from the system, and only 20 and 25 thousand were received for replenishment. Тому, мабуть, ще рік бойових дій і наприкінці 2025-го це угруповання фізично може перестати існувати-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/chy-vystachyt-rezerviv-ekspert-pro-vtraty-armiyi-rf-ta-yiyi-podalshu-dolyu/	2024-11-04T20:29:46-08:00
The enemy is dispersing a fake about a grant for -over a billion hryvnias-: what are we talking abou...	It is interesting that on the Derzhkino website there is indeed news about the announcement of the presidential grant competition in 2025. To participate, it is necessary to submit relevant documents: application, estimate, description of the film, etc. Similar conditions were previously seen in 2023 and 2024. But, of course, there is no mention in them of -positive coverage of TCC actions.- The real purpose of the competition is to provide state financial support to young artists for the creation and implementation of socially significant creative projects. Clear restrictions on project topics are not specified. In the forgery, an amount of more than one billion UAH was indicated for the creation of a film production, but only UAH 3.9 million was indicated on the official website. This is the amount of funds provided for the payment of three grants, in accordance with the Presidential Decree -On State Support of Culture and Art in Ukraine.- They are allocated from the budget of the Ministry of Culture and Strategic Communications. As in other similar cases, by inventing such lies, the enemy is trying to disrupt mobilization and sow enmity in society.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/vorog-rozganyaye-fejk-pro-grant-na-ponad-milyard-gryven-pro-shho-mova/	2024-11-04T20:14:44-08:00

We see an increase in the number of North Koreans, we do not see an increase in the reaction of part...	The president announced this in his evening address on November 4. He said that he listened to the reports of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, and the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Anatoliy Bargylevych, as well as the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Rustem Umyerova. -Combat situation now, all directions. Of course, the most attention is paid to the Donetsk destinations. But we also see Russian activity in the south of Ukraine. The defense forces must provide a response. The Kursk operation was discussed separately today. It will be three months of our active actions in Kurshchyna soon. And this is important — keeping this -sanitary zone- in designated areas near our state border. And we must appreciate the importance of this operation - the Kursk operation - to replenish our exchange fund. This greatly helped the liberation of our people from Russian captivity. I thank all the soldiers, sergeants and officers who are involved in our active actions in Kurshchyna,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. According to him, he listened to a separate report by the GUR and the Foreign Intelligence Service regarding the North Korean military on the territory of Russia. -There are already 11,000 in the Kursk region. We see an increase in the North Koreans, we do not see an increase in the reaction of partners. Unfortunately,- the President remarked. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also announced that he had a conversation with the President of Moldova, Maya Sandu, whom he congratulated on her victory in the elections and, in general, on the fact that Moldova's course towards real sovereignty has withstood the test. The President also met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock. -And one more thing. Today is a professional day for almost 200,000 Ukrainian men and women. All employees of -Ukrainian Railways-. I had the opportunity to congratulate them, thank them. And please don't forget to always thank the people who work in such special industries of ours that carry everything else in the country. I am proud of our people! Glory to Ukraine!- Volodymyr Zelenskyi summed up. As reported by ArmyInform, the President conducted the Stavka, dedicated to the strengthening of air defense in the regions and the development of solutions against KABs.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/bachymo-zbilshennya-kilkosti-pivnichnokorejcziv-ne-bachymo-zbilshennya-reakcziyi-partneriv-prezydent/	2024-11-04T11:42:21-08:00
GUR called on the people of Russia to unite in the fight against Putin's regime	The statement of GUR was published on his channel. -What kind of -unity- can we talk about when an aggressive Moscow is getting fat, and the regions are stably pale and poor. Take, for example, Ingushetia - every third resident here lives below the poverty line. The situation is similar in Kalmykia, Karachay-Cherkessia, and Tyva - every fifth person is in poverty there,- said the GUR statement. According to our intelligence officers, such -unity- of obedience and silence of those reduced to poverty benefits the Kremlin, because it is from the regions, and not from Moscow or St. Petersburg, that the Putin regime draws human resources for -meat- assaults. -During the criminal war against Ukraine, 3.5 times more Bashkir invaders died than Muscovites; residents of Tatarstan - three times more, Buryats - twice. The recipe for Moscow -unity- contains only two components - poverty and death,- the HUR reminded. But they said that it was time to stop and punish Moscow. -You can report on the movement of Russian troops, the location of their headquarters and military-technical developments through Main intelligence bot or in other safe ways,- the GUR statement said. As reported by ArmyInform, according to the data of GUR occupiers throw the wounded to the assault against the backdrop of heavy losses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/gur-zaklykav-narody-rosiyi-do-yednosti-u-borotbi-z-rezhymom-putina/	2024-11-04T11:29:35-08:00
Ukraine needs your expertise and courage - the President congratulated the soldiers of the engineeri...

Prepare for reliable protection and for the result of our active actions. Ukraine needs your expertise, your courage,- the Head of State said. The President called for a moment of silence to honor the memory of all fallen defenders of Ukraine. In addition, Volodymyr Zelenskyy honored the military with state awards. Senior Sergeant Vladyslav Plaksivy received the -Golden Star- of the Hero of Ukraine. Thanks to the engineering barriers that he installed as part of the unit, more than 20 units of armored vehicles were destroyed in just four months of 2022.

A representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine passed the course -Information available for ...	The training took place in Riga, the capital of Latvia. A delegation of communicators from Ukrainian government structures took part in the event. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, in particular, was represented by junior lieutenant Vladyslav Dunayenko, who shared his impressions of the event with the ArmyInform correspondent. — Since Ukraine is moving in the direction of the EU, our Latvian friends organized a training called -Accessible information for all- for representatives of Ukrainian ministries and other state bodies on simplifying communication with people with disabilities. We learned to write texts according to certain standards that make them accessible to anyone - children, the elderly and people with disabilities, in particular, people with reduced mobility, people with visual and hearing impairments and even people with intellectual disabilities. The purpose of the training is to add these skills to the work of press services and press offices of Ukrainian ministries, - explained Vladyslav Dunayenko. The training program involved not only studying the rules of information dissemination, but also introduced seemingly elementary things: the presence of ramps, road markings, traffic light buttons, etc. The course participants visited the library for people with visual impairments, where they got acquainted with how books and other information materials are printed in Braille, how audio books and audio messages are created for people with visual impairments. They were also in the inclusive museum of Latvian culture. — Due to the fact that we have an increasing number of people with disabilities, this experience will be extremely relevant for Ukraine in the coming years. Creating such content and adapting the environment for people with special needs is important to us. The second aspect is about clear and simple language. In our state structures, as in most European countries, before these rules were introduced, the so-called -official language- is used, which is often incomprehensible to the common man. And this applies not only to state structures, but also to banks, insurance companies, etc. The integration of plain and understandable language standards will be appropriate in order for the society to be more aware of what is happening. After all, writing in a simple and understandable language will help to inform the society more effectively, - noted Vladyslav Dunayenko. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/predstavnyk-ministerstva-oborony-ukrayiny-projshov-kurs-dostupna-informacziya-dlya-vsih-v-mezhah-ryzkoyi-akademiyi/	2024-11-04T10:21:58-08:00

Lithuania is our faithful friend who helps us diplomatically, economically and, most importantly, militarily,- Rustem Umyerov noted. During the meeting, specific ways of deepening cooperation were also discussed. Among the topics are plans for 2025 aimed at even greater military aid to Ukraine. -Representatives of our intelligence provided detailed information to Lithuanian partners about the current situation at the front. The aggressive plans of the enemy for autumn and winter were analyzed. Today we see how Russia receives help from dictatorial regimes, including the involvement of manpower from North Korea. But I am convinced that with such reliable partners as Lithuania, we will defeat the aggressor. Together we are getting closer to victory!-, Rustem Umyerov assured. As reported by ArmyInform, partners handed over to the Defense Forces of Ukraine 230 cars.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/ministr-oborony-ukrayiny-zustrivsya-u-kyyevi-z-lytovskym-kolegoyu/	2024-11-04T09:57:20-08:00

The partners handed over 230 vehicles to the Defense Forces of Ukraine	The equipment was purchased and handed over as part of cooperation between the Ministry of National Defense of Lithuania and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Iceland, which lead the -Coalition of Demining Capability-. According to the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Rustem Umyerov, over two and a half years, Lithuania has provided military aid to Ukraine in the amount of more than 705 million euros. - Lithuania has committed to annually provide support in the amount of 0.25% of GDP. This is a significant contribution to our struggle, to our joint victory. Only in 2024, Lithuania handed us 155-caliber ammunition, M113 armored personnel carriers, anti-drone systems and other equipment. I thank Minister Kaschyunas (head of the Defense Department of the Republic of Lithuania - ed.) for his leadership and support, Rustem Umyerov emphasized. He noted that today our country received another aid package: - Lithuania purchased 230 cars and 240 metal detectors as part of the Coalition for demining. This Coalition was created at the initiative of Lithuania and united 21 countries to support our army and our people. Very grateful for this support and this leadership. We must understand that the longer this terrible war continues, the more territories will be polluted and mined. For this we need the support of our partners. In turn, the Minister of National Defense of the Republic of Lithuania, Laurinas Kaschyunas, noted that the large-scale invasion of Russia made Ukraine one of the most mined countries in the world. - Successful demining is a prerequisite for Ukraine's victory. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and its Armed Forces are responsible for a wide range of mine action activities and today perform both combat and humanitarian demining. This requires significant international support, said Laurinas Kasciunas. And he added that this first batch of demining equipment is much more than just a set of tools: - It symbolizes our steadfast support for Ukraine. The head of the Administration of the State Special Service of Transport, Major General Oleksandr Yakovets, assured that the received pickups will increase the power of engineer-mining and engineer-assault units, provide operative and humanitarian demining units and make our life safer. The Commander of the Support Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Major General Dmytro Gerega, conveyed words of gratitude from the rank-and-file sappers, who directly perform combat tasks on the contact line, using equipment, weapons and equipment provided by our partners.

The second army of the world is again the first in looting - now in Kurshchyna	This was reported by the Center for Countering Disinformation on November 4. According to the Center, the Kursk TV channel aired a story about residents of the Glushkiv district of the region who reported cases of robbery by the Russian military. Also, Kursk Regional Duma deputy Oleksiy Zolotaryov told how the Russian military stole cows from local farmers. It is characteristic that the Ukrainian military has never been in these areas. Stories about mass looting by the Russian military in the Kursk region also regularly appear in local communities on social networks. Even the Z-warriors admit it. Instead, the local authorities call this data -Ukrainian IPSO- and pretend that nothing happened. -Cases of looting by the Russian military on its own territory reveal the same -mysterious Russian soul- as best as possible, which does not know any values ​​and moral principles, but only seeks to make money,- said the message of the CPD. As reported by ArmyInform, Russian anonymous Telegram channels actively spread false information about the sale of organs of dead Ukrainian soldiers on the -black market-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/druga-armiya-svitu-znovu-persha-u-maroderstvi-teper-na-kurshhyni/	2024-11-04T08:52:19-08:00

The same tactics: the Russians are destroying Kurshchyna in the same way as Donetsk region	About this on the air of -Social News- told the spokesman of OTU -Siversk- Vadim Mysnyk. As for the northern border, the enemy continues to shell the border territories of Sumy, Chernihiv and Kharkiv regions. But in the last three days, according to Vadym Mysnyk, a significant decrease in the number of shellings has been recorded. -There are a lot of factors involved. There are also weather conditions, and they probably have problems with logistics and the fact that they do not have an unlimited resource to use here,- explained the spokesman of OTU -Siversk-. As for Kurshchyna, the most active shelling and bombing is there. the Russians do not stop trying to storm and use their usual tactics. -The enemy is simply destroying settlements, they are simply being wiped out below zero.

The soldier who took over the company. The story of a combat officer -Maxon-	This war has already brought up many worthy young commanders who went from soldier to officer, and today we will tell about one of them - Maksym Zaichenko, lieutenant of the Third Separate Assault Brigade. Correspondent of Armiya TV met with - Maxon- in the early fall near the combat mission area to ask him about 10 years of war, attitude to people and leadership in the current army. - You are from Zaporozhye. If you compare the city 15 years ago and now, what has changed? - I was born in Zaporizhzhia in 1992. He entered the football sector in 2007. Subsequently, repressive actions on the part of the then authorities against the fans began. This is me about the case of the Pavlichenkos. We supported the actions in Kyiv, for me it was a manifestation of my civic position. It happened that -Berkut- tried to put us on the asphalt simply because of the red and black flag. Both in Zaporizhzhia and at away matches. Therefore, it was precisely this press from the side of the state, from the side of law enforcement agencies, that forced us to unite. And when the revolution began, the fans came forward as a single force. Our city is very industrial, I had the impression that you only have to move along a typical vector: learn to be an electromechanic - school, vocational school, factory. It was important for me to think about my future so that it was determined by me, and not by the environment. I found like-minded people who believed that Zaporizhzhia is not only factories, but many different areas. Cossack spirit, how not to be cool. You just need to develop them. - Did you even then think that there would be a war? What will have to be fought for? — This became clear to me after the Revolution of Dignity. I was a student, I took an active part in the revolution both on the Zaporozhye Maidan and on the Capital Square. When all kinds of -militia- and Russians began to capture populated areas, of course, there was already an understanding that it was necessary to react. Ilovaisk became a critical moment. It was an understanding for me that the situation is not as rosy as I imagined. I understood that I had to join the army. I was supposed to go to the third year of the university, but I packed my things and went to Kyiv. We had a mobilization center at the Kozatsky hotel. He stayed there for several weeks, underwent training and went to the East. Arrived in Urzuf near Mariupol. Got weapons, got armor, it was a volunteer battalion of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. - How did those around you, loved ones, perceive your decision to go to war in 14th? - The family had a reaction that, they say, you can stay, you don't need to go - they can kill you there. But I have explained my position. And they supported me, saying that I was doing everything right. It was organic for me and my environment. Once again, I am an ordinary guy from Zaporozhye. — Tell us about your battle path. How did you end up here? - During the 2014-16 campaign, I was a grenade launcher, a machine gunner in an assault platoon, as it was then called. I was in the rapid response group, participated in the Shirokin operation. Stabilization actions were also carried out in Mariintka. Sometimes he performed the tasks of a unit commander, but he did not officially have a title. Retired as a senior soldier. Later in his civilian life, he began to delve into military topics. He formed a defense headquarters in our city, he immediately understood that it was necessary to acquire skills, not only in handling weapons, but also in medicine, tactics, and military management. Just before the large-scale invasion, he moved to Kyiv. And I knew that, in case of anything, the guys from Azov and I would gather at ATEK (plant in Kyiv). And on February 24, indeed, everyone was there. They say to me: -Maxon-, come on, you are a veteran yourself, gather people like you, people are coming from different regions, organize. So, literally on the first day, more than a hundred people gathered at my place. Some I knew, some just arrived. They came again. And in the evening they ask me how many people you have. At that time there were about one hundred and thirty. They put me in charge of a company, they say, deal with the distribution of personnel, structure, organize, think about support, think about combat training. For about a week, he was engaged in organizing this. Legally, it was just a group of people. At the same time, there were already situations when the enemy came very close to Kyiv. I gathered groups of people who were already ready to perform combat tasks and they went to perform such tasks already in those days. There was a kind of -commotion-, but work had to be done, for example, they helped one of the units of the 72nd brigade to hold the line on the Irpin River. There were a number of other similar combat missions. In just a few weeks, we were able to build a management structure, assign people roles according to their knowledge and skills. But there were also people who did not know much, they had to gain a basic level of training in these couple of weeks. In this way, we coordinated, formed a company, at that time it was a unit of territorial defense -Azov-Kyiv-. On the basis of this company, we later reformed into a company of the Azov-Kyiv SSO battalion. Being actually a company commander when he was drafted into the SSO, only then did he receive the rank of sergeant. - How did the events develop further? - Then we went to the Zaporozhye direction, where as a company we joined the battle and helped hold Vremivka. There was a difficult situation. The enemy then took possession of Neskuchny, there was very little left to enter Vremivka. We went there, reinforced our comrades from the territorial defense, from the Defense Forces. There was another episode when the enemy entered a settlement, and we immediately knocked it out: we were provided with three BMPs, our infantry drove into them and cleared this settlement. In this way, they worked to stop the advance of the enemy in the Zaporizhzhia direction. After that came the understanding that it was necessary to develop as a unit, because we did not have heavy weapons, armored vehicles, artillery, tanks. We realized that it is not promising to be permanently attached to someone. Therefore, it was decided to reformat and create a brigade within the Ground Forces. At that moment, I was offered to develop the battalion. That's how I got the primary officer rank - junior lieutenant. This is how I went from a senior soldier, then an actual company commander, I was still the head of intelligence in the Bakhmut direction, then I worked in the Avdiiv direction, Terny, and now I am here as a so-called acting officer. battalion chief of staff. - Are there people, commanders or soldiers that you look up to? - This is not about historical figures or any military leaders, but about the fact that there are a lot of guys around who look fear in the eyes. I understand for myself that everyone can have fear, but what distinguishes a brave person is not the absence of fear, but the ability to overcome this fear and fulfill the task that you have, that you have set for yourself. And it's not just about war, it's about life in general. And I am very glad that many of the guys we have here are, in fact, almost all of them are heroes. And everyone I see, I have a lot of respect for someone who is in our department and can be looked up to. In general, in response to this question, I can name many battalion commanders. We don't have -jackets-. The average age of the officers is probably somewhere in the region of 30 years. All of them grew up within the brigade, roughly speaking. Now we have reached the level where we have harmony between the officers and the rank and file, there is an understanding between the soldiers. And there are no questions, they say that an outsider came to command there. - If it were not for the Third Assault Brigade, in which brigade would you like to serve? - But there is no such brigade. It happens that people do not want to spend their own efforts, to come to everything ready-made. But the guys and I built this unit from scratch. Everything in the Third Assault Room was created from scratch. Created directly by the guys in this crew. Fighters of all levels. Both soldiers and command. And volunteers. Indeed, this is the child that we created, gave birth to together. I just can't say that I see myself anywhere yet. And it's not about us being perfect. We actually have a very wide range of areas that need to be developed. Nothing perfect exists. And even if somewhere we are the coolest, there is still room to grow. Therefore, everyone who comes, I am sure, will be able to realize himself with us. If the ideas are really competitive, then a person will show himself, and we will create all the conditions for this. - Tell us about how you prepare recruits? - We have recruiting centers. A person comes, asks what they are interested in, signs a contract. Next, our instructors provide basic skills, do everything to ensure that a person is first of all able to blend into the team. After a person has come to us, he also goes through adjustment. That is, it is not the case that a recruit arrived and was immediately sent somewhere. This is something that scares many. We don't do that. Because we would lose ground to an unprepared fighter. And it is not profitable for us to put an untrained fighter on the front line. We are interested in a person being ready to perform basic tasks. - Tell us about recent work (the conversation was recorded at the end of September, ed.). What is the current situation in your area of ​​responsibility? - If we talk specifically about our unit, the Second Assault Battalion, we have been in active defense since the spring, we were moved from the Avdiiv direction for recovery. But recovery takes place in combat conditions. And lately, the enemy has been trying to seize the bridgeheads, advance in the direction of Borova, to the Oskil River. The pressure is on several fronts. Including due to the range of responsibility of our brigade. But we are trying to dictate our own initiative. We suppress the enemy, accordingly, the defense is active, we carry out counterattacking actions. Somewhere we are helping other units. Right now, our soldiers are conducting active assault actions on the front. And the preparation for these actions was very exhausting, dynamic, it's a pity that I can't tell about it. According to our estimates, the main goal of the enemy is to seize specific settlements before winter. In order to cross the river on our site. So that they have a bridgehead and from it continue the offensive and seize Ukrainian territory further. - What was remembered during these days? - Is it that the enemy's infantry marches in droves every day. And now I sometimes have this feeling, especially in the morning, like a time loop, -groundhog day-. Almost every day the same thing. The enemy tries to climb, follows almost the same routes. We are waiting for him there, we meet him, inflict damage, squeeze like cockroaches. But they continue to do it the next day. And they use the same ineffective methods. - Do you expect that with the rains and cold weather the nature of the fighting will change? - There is a conceptual opinion, and there is a practical one. If you start from a practical point of view, it is always better to winter in basements, and not in dugouts in the ground. Therefore, purely from a practical point of view, the impression is that the enemy is trying to occupy populated areas in order to meet the winter normally. We faced the fact that actually wintering in the ground is a little more difficult than getting settlements. And from a more global point of view, the adversary needs to compensate for the reputational losses he has already suffered. Which were caused by the actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I have in mind both the Kursk operation and the situation with the fleet at sea, how we knocked them out. Therefore, they use a large human resource, a significant amount of equipment. And he will achieve some results, and indeed, this winter and these geopolitical moments will shape the reality that will take place in the spring. - Do the military talk about potential negotiations, some kind of truce? - I believe that such thoughts appear more among the civilian population and in the mass media. Not so in the military. We are thinking about the combat mission that is immediately in front of us. This is directly my attitude. We have, regardless of what happens in the offices in Kyiv or other cities, other countries, to fulfill the task that is clearly issued as a combat order. Hold the line. Provide maintenance in general. Each brigade has a line of responsibility. We need to get used to the fact that everyone should be responsible for their own line of responsibility. After all, when you fail in yourself, you thereby set others up. The same probably applies to people who try to shift responsibility from themselves to someone else. There is a citizen, his responsibility, it is written in the Constitution, in addition to rights. Yes? But there is still a responsibility to protect one's Motherland. Why is it often said that the Third is stormy, it has an ideology, there is some high psychological level. Because our people, first of all, are ready to take responsibility for themselves. And when you understand that you have a specific task, you will fulfill it regardless of other circumstances. That is why we are thinking about this. - What are your plans after the war? Will it ever end? — In war, it is difficult to talk about plans. But I know for sure that I will return to my family, to my wife, to my son. I am in contact with them, now video communication helps. But what I know for sure is that as long as I am in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, I will do my duty. I will try to bring this point as close as possible, I don't know what to call it, but this point is a clear understanding that the eastern neighbor, I hope, will no longer be in the form of the Russian Federation, this fragmented structure will not threaten our state. And, accordingly, to my family. And to the families of my boys, my brothers. That is, it is a matter of survival. We are not fighting because we are simply stubborn. Or we were told by our Western partners that we should fight. This is a question of survival. So I want to make sure my child doesn't have to fight. That my wife will not be in danger. Until there is this understanding, I will use the most effective methods, which is to defend the state with weapons in my hands. And to protect those people, citizens who live in this state. This is what we are doing now.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/soldat-yakyj-vzyav-na-sebe-rotu-istoriya-bojovogo-oficzera-maksona/	2024-11-03T21:11:52-08:00

Rocketman Kim's intercontinental antics: what is known about the ballistic missile he plans to launc...	As informs the Army Recognition portal, intelligence received during a confidential briefing indicates that North Korea has completed preparations for a nuclear test at its Punggyeri test site, with a special equipment and launchers, probably for the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile designed to demonstrate atmospheric reentry capabilities. As the authors of the portal note, the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, has been increasing his show of force in recent months, accelerating missile tests and opening a secret military enterprise for the production of uranium in September. According to South Korean intelligence, North Korea has deployed a mobile launcher, likely the 12-axis model recently shown in state media, to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles that could potentially reach the US territory. The move comes in line with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol's warnings that Pyongyang could stage major military provocations around the US election to pressure Washington and its allies. The ICBM, probably the Hwasong-18 or a similar missile, will check durability of atmospheric re-entry technology, which is critical for the warhead to withstand the extreme heat and friction en route to the target. While previous North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile tests have been conducted with launches at steep angles to minimize distance and avoid hitting nearby territories, analysts suggest that a more standard trajectory would represent a major advance in North Korea's missile program. Such a test would confirm North Korea's ability to target remote locations, including the US mainland. Escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula since 2022, particularly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have allowed North Korea to develop its nuclear and missile programs under less international scrutiny. In this context, recent reports from the authorities of the Republic of Korea leave no doubt about Kim Jong Un's intentions to continue developing weapons of mass destruction while strengthening alliances with states outside the Western sphere, such as Russia. For decades, North Korea has developed a nuclear capability to increase deterrence against perceived threats. Relying on asymmetric weapons strategies to offset the limitations of its conventional forces, Pyongyang has made significant progress in miniaturizing nuclear warheads and developing intercontinental ballistic missiles such as the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15 models. These capabilities position North Korea as a nuclear power capable of striking the United States, thereby increasing geopolitical pressure on the United States and its allies. As North Korea occupies a strategic position, the US and its regional allies continue to closely monitor these preparations to anticipate any potential threat. -The possibility of nuclear tests and the launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles during the election period in the United States creates an atmosphere of uncertainty, emphasizing the importance of maintaining international vigilance,- the authors of the article summarize. The launch of the North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-18.

About the great construction and the best servant of the soldier: why in Britain they teach the mobi...	No matter how well trained and highly motivated the soldiers are, no matter how many they are, and no matter how well they are equipped with the right weapons and ammunition, the fighters will not be able to hold their positions if they are not properly equipped. The correspondent of ArmiyaInform tells about how they learn to set up individual shelters, observation and firing positions during the BZVP within the limits of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. The task of our two detachments is to occupy a circular defense in a house on the outskirts of a small settlement called Eastmere. This is one of the locations of the famous STANTA - Stanford Training Area in the county of Norfolk in the northeast of England. Based on the approximate population size by Ukrainian standards, Istmir can be called a village, because it is unlikely that more than a thousand people can live in the houses there. However, in terms of infrastructure, it is more of a town, because it even has its own hotel. Before leaving the camp for the so-called -Urban- - training in combat tactics in urban development - I had time and will be able to surf the Internet well, so I not only know the general history of the STANTA district and the town of Eastmere, but I can also navigate its streets . Eastmere was built in 1942 when, during the Second World War, the British Army needed a combat training ground to train soldiers for urban combat. It was on the territory of STANTA that soldiers were trained for combat after landing in Normandy during Operation Neptune on the famous D-Day. There are a lot of photos and videos from Eastmere Training Village on the Internet, including media publications about the recent training of Ukrainian servicemen from previous rotations. This makes it possible to recognize not only the streets and houses of the town, but even individual rooms inside the buildings. The most interesting fact turns out to be the fact that from the end of the 1960s to the mid-1970s, the famous TV series -Dad's Army- (-Dad's Army-) about the so-called Home Guard (The Home Guard), which was originally called Local Defense Volunteers (LDV). The Home Guard can be called local defense units or, in a more familiar wording for Ukrainians, territorial defense. Volunteers who could not join the army in any other way due to medical reasons or because they had professions from which specialists were exempted from conscription went to the British Terrodefense during the Second World War. Most often, the British could not join the army in any other way, except for service in the Home Guard, because they were older than the mobilization age. Hence the title of the series -Dad's Army-, which jokingly plays on the age of the volunteers, most of whom are over 50 years old, while others are not supposed to serve for medical reasons or because of their civilian profession. The TV series -Dad's Army- became extremely popular in Great Britain, having a huge impact on society and popular culture. During its run in the 1970s, it regularly drew an audience of 18 million viewers, its characters became recognizable, and many of its catchphrases became catchy. In 2000, Dad's Army was ranked thirteenth in the British Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes, and in 2004, Dad's Army was ranked fourth in the BBC's poll of the UK's best sitcom. In the end, the extraordinary popularity of the series prompted the British in 2016 to make a full-length film -Dad's Army-. After reading about STANTA and -Dad's Army-, you involuntarily begin to associate yourself with the heroes of the series and British soldiers of the Second World War. So when we finally get to the town of Eastmere, its modern look is somewhat surprising, because we expected to see something from the 80s. But no, Eastmere has been renovated, updated and partially rebuilt. The middle of the last century is evidenced only by the rusty skeleton of an armored car left in the backyard of a city hotel. It has such an ancient appearance that it appears to be a message not even from the Second World War, but from the even earlier First World War. It is the two-story hotel building that our second and fourth units are to protect, while the first and third units are set up in the house across the street. There are a lot of rooms on two floors and in the solid basement of the hotel, so there are two fighters for each position. We are given the task of setting up observation and firing positions in a limited time and with the means at hand in such a way as to be able to repel the training assault that will be carried out by the instructors. Time is short, so we get to work right away and work non-stop right up to the deadline. I am lucky to work with -The Chinese- - he is younger than me and has some experience in military training, so he can orient himself better and faster than me. I myself am more useful in earthworks - rural childhood and the experience of archaeological expeditions are in evidence, but I feel less confident in urban development and with building materials. Our building material is bulky and inconvenient to carry wooden pallets, heavy sandbags and heavy clumsy stone building blocks, much larger in size than the standard bricks we are used to. We also find some fragments of metal structures, boards, netting - everything goes. Our -big construction- continues, the outskirts of Istmir have turned into an anthill, on the streets of which dozens of soldiers in pixels are dreaming, dragging everything that will help to set up positions. Our unit continues to work even when some fighters from neighboring platoons have long since finished their work and are resting. Only after the deadline, when the instructors are already leaving to evaluate our work, -The Chinese- and I have time to run around and inspect the work of our brothers and sisters. The quality is impressive, and -Grandfather- and his partner actually managed to build a real -Great Wall of China- - an impenetrable barricade. -Grandfather- in civilian life is a builder, so he knows what he's doing. The instructors praise our unit, and our position thanks to the -Chinese- is one of the best - comfortable, well protected, with a good field of view and firing. Instructor -Thomas- gets into position with the machine gun and nods his head approvingly - we did a good job. Then, when we go to inspect the positions of neighboring platoons, we will see positions that are even better than ours, and, unfortunately, significantly worse positions. Those who completed the work much earlier than us did it precisely because they neglected their own safety and built the fortifications badly. While we are visiting the neighbors, I remember the world-famous tale of the three little pigs, which, by the way, originally originated in England and goes back to the depths of folk folklore of the Middle Ages. The first piglet made a house out of straw. But the evil wolf blew - and the lightweight straw weaving flew behind the wind. The second piglet made a house out of branches, sticks and verbolos. However, the predatory beast tensed up - and destroyed the shaky weaving of the mouth. And only the third piglet built a real tenement with strong walls. So no matter how much the attacker tried to break his fortress, he could not even move a single brick or move even a single pebble. The third pig stubbornly struggled, while his fellows, hastily making a shelter out of straw and sticks, rested, played, sang and danced and passed the time in every other way. However, later, when it came to the fight with the enemy, it turned out that only the house of the third piglet was able to reliably protect the inhabitant. Instead, the straw and adobe -fortifications- crumbled to pieces at the slightest enemy pressure. The instructors do not read us notations, they only silently pay attention to certain shortcomings that are obvious even without their prompts. Only later, already during other classes, one or the other of them make small remarks, from the combination of which a simple but important moral emerges: -A good soldier always takes care of himself, his safety and his comfort. After all, how well he feels, how well rested, how safe and comfortable his shelter and position are, directly depends on both his survival and the performance of the combat mission. A soldier has no servants to do everything for him. He is his own best servant, who can and should take care of himself in the best possible way. So never be lazy, because your life depends on your work.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/pro-velyke-budivnycztvo-i-najkrashhogo-slugu-soldata-chomu-u-brytaniyi-mobilizovanyh-vchat-buty-tretim-porosyam/	2024-11-03T20:40:25-08:00
The battle for the White House: what is known about the strategic communications of Kamala Harris an...	Donald Trump's election campaign is built on the images of a -savior of the common people- and a national hero. His communication strategy is to consistently emphasize Trump's role as the only defender of citizens against the -system.- His slogan is-They didn't come for me, they came for you. I'm just standing in their way- resonates with thousands of American citizens, especially among supporters of the Republican Party. The key theses of Donald Trump's campaign are collected in Agenda 47, which includes ten priorities and twenty promises focused on the security and financial well-being of Americans. Trump's staff has made extensive use of micro-targeting, attracting support among specific groups such as parents, veterans and athletes through promises addressed to each audience separately. Opinion leaders are another important tool during election campaigns. As of today, 49 celebrities, including Elon Musk, Mel Gibson, Tucker Carlson, Kanye West and Fifty Cent, have expressed their support for Donald Trump. This greatly strengthens his position among voters, for whom the opinion of these people is authoritative. In response to Donald Trump's hero image, Kamala Harris' staff chose the archetype of a leader who faithfully serves the country and leads it to change. Her campaign builds on Harris' previous experience as vice president of the United States and California attorney general, emphasizing her accomplishments and work already done. The main audience of Kamala Harris' information campaign is middle-class citizens. In its strategy, it relies on the support of such famous persons as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jimmy Carter, Barack and Michelle Obama, Eminem and Taylor Swift. In total, she was supported by 81 famous people, which is a significant advantage for attracting the attention and trust of voters. The information campaigns of both candidates were also influenced by the publication of -Project 2025- by the think tank -Heritage Foundation-, which highlights the potential first steps of Donald Trump if he wins the election. The project has become a sensation and has caused concern among many US citizens, as its recommendations are considered a threat to democracy and civil rights. Donald Trump distanced himself from the project. At the same time, Kamala Harris began to use it as a tool for conducting -offensive actions-, forcing Trump to take a reactive position. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris' strategic communications show consistency and a clear structure. Both candidates go to great lengths to maintain their chosen image and to maintain the tone of their own brand. Kamala Harris is benefiting from the powerful support of opinion leaders, as well as the effect of the sensational release of -Project 2025-, which significantly increases her chances of winning the presidential election. At the same time, time and circumstances leave room for change, which adds uncertainty to the race for the White House.

But as informs the Countering Disinformation Center, these messages are part of a long-running campaign by enemy propagandists, known as Black Transplantology. It dates back to 2014. Its main goal is to discredit the Ukrainian military and political leadership and to create a negative image of Ukraine on the international stage. This fake also works as a tool of psychological warfare, causing distrust in the Ukrainian authorities, speculating on emotionally complex topics and creating an image of the Ukrainian military as -victims of the system- rather than Russian aggression. The manipulation is aimed at destabilizing Ukrainian society and weakening the country's support from the international community. Propaganda often uses similar disinformation tactics to tarnish Ukraine's reputation as a corrupt state with a disregard for human rights. Ukraine, on the contrary, always adheres to international norms of humanitarian law and ensures proper treatment of fallen soldiers, strictly fulfilling international obligations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/sercze-bijczya-zsu-za-70-tysyach-dolariv-rosiyany-v-darkneti-breshut-pro-chornu-transplantologiyu/	2024-11-03T20:15:51-08:00

Active hostilities and destruction bypassed this settlement. Nevertheless, the reconstruction and opening made an event of national scale. However, customers are accepted there on a first-come, first-served basis. Because the Russians did not implement electronic recording in Aydar.

The purpose is to cover losses related to the consideration of cases in Russian courts about the -illegality- of sanctions.

From hopelessness: whom Russians fear the most and why they surrender	A representative of the public relations service of the -Charter- brigade told about this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon - Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev of the National Guard of Ukraine. - Almost every week we manage to capture someone from the Russians. They fear their commanders in some places more than us, he said. The military said that Russians most often surrender because of hopelessness and hoping for medical help from the Ukrainians. - It is usually rare that they surrender themselves. Most often, we create certain conditions for them when, for example, they are injured and understand that they will not receive help from their own, and then they start to show signs or go towards our soldiers, - said the guardsman. Russian servicemen of the same units who have long been in that part of the Kharkiv direction, which belongs to the area of ​​responsibility of the -Charter- brigade, are mostly captured. - Basically, these are the same units, but they have been recruiting former -convicts- for a long time, who sign a contract with the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. This is a new form of the -Wagner- army, only now instead of -Wagner- they come and representatives of the Russian Ministry of Defense communicate with them, - explained Volodymyr Degtyarev.

In the fall, the Russians were counted, but they will not be cured: the October losses of the occupi...	The representative of the public relations service of the -Charter- brigade named the representative of the public relations service of the -Charter- - Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev of the National Guard of Ukraine. — If we look at the losses of the enemy only in the area of ​​responsibility of our brigade, we will see that we disabled up to 200 Russians. 89 of them will never see this world again, he said. Another 97 occupiers managed to be injured, and some of them also, most likely, eventually fell into the category of irreversible losses, given the extremely low level of training of enemy soldiers in tactical medicine and the almost unorganized evacuation. — Evacuation is very badly organized, there is practically no training in tactical medicine. It can be concluded that even this hundred will not survive. That is, 200 Russians were destroyed in a month - that's two full-fledged infantry companies. This is a lot, as for the section of the brigade, - remarked the soldier. Also, the representative of -Charter- reported that in October, the Guardsmen destroyed or damaged 20 units of enemy equipment, mostly cars. — Of course, this may indicate that they are preparing an accumulation, and we are ready for it, we are watching, we are preparing our anti-tank means. However, so far we can see that the ability for us to see deep and far enough thanks to drones and shoot through these roads does not allow them to use the technique, - explained Volodymyr Degtyarev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast, the enemy intensively spends manpower, but saves military equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/03/voseny-rosiyan-polichyly-ale-vzhe-ne-vylikuyut-zhovtnevi-vtraty-okupantiv-pidrahuvaly-v-hartiyi/	2024-11-03T02:42:45-08:00

About this in the interview Youtube channel The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine was told by Oksana Ferchuk, adviser to the Minister of Defense of Ukraine on logistics and IT. She reminded that SAP is the leading international system in the field of resource management, which is used by 28 NATO countries. This program was provided to the Armed Forces of Ukraine by colleagues from the USA and specially adapted for our country. The system automates supply processes, generates information about the balance in warehouses, orders, allows you to see the real need, procure and provide the army with everything necessary on time. About 240 large Ukrainian companies use SAP software to control and allocate their resources. -SAP is the digital core and will help us provide the most modern defense resource management process and is an integrated solution with other systems,- said Oksana Ferchuk. Also, thanks to SAP, control over the supply and accounting of weapons and military equipment at the main bases was automated. This also applies to spare parts for equipment that we receive as part of international technical assistance. According to Oksana Ferchuk, this system is implemented by a joint team with the General Staff and the command of the Logistics Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And now it is already used in 600 military units in the directions of 6 security services. -The result of the final implementation of the system should be the full automation of logistics processes and the complete rejection of paper document flow in logistics operations,- concluded Oksana Ferchuk, adviser to the Minister of Defense on digital development, digital transformations and digitization.

Kalich regiments - the Russians force the wounded to go into battle	Maksym Bilousov, the head of the communications department of the 60th mechanized brigade, told about this in the ArmyTV stream. He was commenting on a video in which the pilots of the brigade fighting in the Lyman direction hit Russian attack aircraft heading towards our positions with FPV drone strikes. -I think that these comrades will replenish the Russian Kalich regiments.- Recently, we saw a conversation with a Russian man who said that he was concussed, he doesn't understand what to do, and he is being sent to storm,- Maksym Bilousov said. According to him, the accuracy of the brigade's drones is largely due to the fact that the boys used to play a lot of computer games. -On the video, the Russians were lying down and pretending to be dead in the hope that they would not be seen. And our boys see very well. Before that, they played computer games and are very good at using a joystick. Therefore, there is no problem for them to hit,- Maksym Bilousov said. (video from 14:05) As reported by ArmyInform, mortars of the 60th mechanized brigade demonstrated unique accuracy when working on enemy attack aircraft.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/03/kalich-polky-rosiyany-prymushuyut-poranenyh-ity-v-bij/	2024-11-02T23:51:22-07:00

Will North Korea go further than Kurshchyna: the expert named the country that can stop it	About how the actions of Putin and Kim Jong-un are perceived in Beijing, the expert on the history of Ukrainian-Chinese relations, candidate of historical sciences, leading researcher of the Institute of History of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Volodymyr Golovko, told in the ArmyInform commentary: -China is not very satisfied with this Russian-Korean initiative It should be remembered that it is with North Korea that China has an Agreement on Cooperation and Friendship, which provides for the provision of urgent assistance from the PRC if necessary, that is, in fact, a military alliance. Therefore, involving the only country to which China has such alliance obligations is a serious challenge for Beijing. Obviously, China will put pressure on both North Korea and the Russian side to limit the North Koreans' participation in hostilities against Ukraine. Obviously, Beijing will seek to ensure that the use of North Korean troops is limited in nature. Most likely, Russia and North Korea will be watching for China's reaction. And for the time being, the Koreans will not enter the Kursk region in large units. Further, both the Russian Federation and the DPRK will take into account both the reaction of China and the reaction of the Western world. If the reaction of China, as well as the Western countries, is strong, then the participation of the North Korean military will be limited to the Kursk region. If not, then the Russians will dare to transfer the Koreans to internationally recognized Ukrainian territory.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/03/chy-pide-pivnichna-koreya-dali-kurshhyny-ekspert-nazvav-krayinu-yaka-mozhe-zupynyty/	2024-11-02T22:06:11-07:00
Invisible heroes of a complex operation: how engineers of the Support Forces of the Armed Forces bro...	Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Veretko is the deputy commander of the 48th Kamianets-Podilskyi Engineering Brigade for psychological support of personnel. He devoted his whole life to service in the engineering troops. He started serving in the special forces in 1998, graduated from the Military Engineering Institute at the Podilsk Agrarian and Technical University in 2005, and the National Defense University of Ukraine in 2024. Went through the ranks from deputy platoon commander to deputy brigade commander. Now its military unit is one of those operating in the Kursk region together with other components of the Defense Forces. ArmyInform asked a military officer about the difficulty of an engineer's work during a breach of the state border, the special psychological training of a sapper, and much more. We are talking about this very thing today, November 3, when Ukraine celebrates the Day of the Engineering Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. - Do the specifics of your brigade's actions differ from actions on the territory of Ukraine and Kurshchyna? - On the territory of Kurshchyna itself, the specifics of actions do not differ from the tasks performed by our brigade on the territory of Ukraine. The only thing that was new was overcoming the border and engineering barriers of the enemy located on the border. — How did you interact with the units of the DSHV, SV ZSU? — We interacted in such a way that the sapper units of our brigade were placed under the command of the amphibious assault units, namely: battalions, companies, and directly our means of communication were adjusted under their communication. - Is there special psychological training for sappers? Briefly explain how this happens. — The sappers go through an obstacle course that simulates the conditions on the battlefield. Servicemen of the sergeant rank underwent combat stress courses to be ready to respond to critical situations in their units during combat missions. - How did your unit commanders prepare (psychologically, morally) their people for operations on the territory of the Kursk region? The deeper the knowledge and confidence in one's skills, the calmer and more confident a fighter acts in stressful situations. When a person clearly knows how to react in extreme conditions, in combat operations under KAB strikes, his body and psyche are less affected by panic or uncertainty. First, you need to learn to reduce your anxiety level. The work of a sapper is a constant risk, and if you keep it to yourself, you won't last long. We learn to control our breathing, quickly -switch- after tasks and maintain emotional calm, even when everything around us is turbulent. Secondly, it is important to be able to adapt quickly to a new team. When a sapper is attached to another unit, everyone has to understand each other's words, because there is no time for explanations in battle. Therefore, we often conduct joint training with other units in order to be -on the same wavelength-. Last but not least is exposure. The life of a sapper is a constant stress, and you need to be able to cope with it, recover quickly and stay focused. Conversations and explanatory conversations were held that this task is necessary for the army and the state as a whole. However, people were motivated to take these actions. — Were there ready-made engineering and fortification structures on the border with the Russian Federation? How was the border with the Russian Federation fortified (and was it fortified at all)? - There were high-quality engineering fortifications on the border with the Russian Federation, the border was fortified in terms of engineering. In addition to the fortifications, there were many mine-explosive and non-explosive barriers combined as a whole in the line of defense. — Due to what, in your opinion, did the Defense Forces manage to break through the state border: equipment, people, training? — The border was managed to break through due to the effect of unexpectedness, the training of people who had some combat experience and were equipped with good armored vehicles. —In the network, information is already spreading that the Russians are entrenched in Kurshchyna. Is that so? And the Defense Forces of Ukraine? - Almost from the very beginning, the Russians began to carry out fortification works for the defense of Kurshchyna. The Defense Forces of Ukraine, in their turn, also began to carry out fortification works in order to consolidate and defend units on this territory. —Is your crew adequately staffed? And the techniques? (for actions in Kurshchyna and in general). Do you need people who are specialists in civil life? - This is always a difficult question. On the one hand, we have a team that shows its strength, professionalism and confidence every day. But, on the other hand, motivated, goal-oriented people are always needed - because engineering forces have their own specifics, and there is always a need for those who are ready to work under constant drive. We do not have monotonous days: sometimes we are laying roads for equipment, sometimes we are clearing mines for special forces. And every new task needs those who can withstand the stress and make quick decisions. Therefore, even when it seems that there are enough people, new, motivated professionals will definitely not get in the way. - What would you advise civilians who have not yet decided to mobilize or not to join the Defense Forces of Ukraine - But come to us! Everything awaits you: drive, friendship, and, as they say, real tests of spirit and body. The work we are doing is not just a service, it is a battle for the future. At the front, we are not just defending the land, we are standing up for the right to live freely, for the lives of our relatives, for Ukraine, as we want to see it. Everyone who joins becomes a part of this struggle. It's a real challenge, yes, but is there anything more epic than fighting for your country and winning? In the engineering troops, there is not enough work only for sappers! Specialists of various profiles are needed in our team, because engineering troops are engaged in a wide variety of tasks - from the construction of defensive fortifications to the creation of routes for combat vehicles. And even after our victory, the engineering troops will still have a lot of work to do in demining, cleaning, and decontamination of our motherland of Ukraine from explosive objects. - What inviolable values ​​and principles guide you in your work? - In my work, I am always guided by the principle of justice, because it is the basis of true leadership. It is important to me that subordinate personnel feel supported and cared for. A fighter who has to perform combat tasks must not only be professionally trained, but also provided with everything necessary: ​​clothing, food and timely payment of financial support in full. These are basic needs that must be met so that a serviceman can fully perform his duties, knowing that he has reliable support. The job of a sapper is not just to carry out combat tasks, but to be always ready to be near any unit (airborne assault troops, special forces groups, tank units) that needs their help. Since sappers are usually attached to other combat units, they must be able to quickly adapt to new conditions and quickly establish contact with a foreign team. It is not easy, but this is the specificity of our work. - What does it look like in practice? Sappers do not always work in their usual team - they are constantly assigned to other units. This means that each sapper must be able to quickly get used to a new environment, understand the task, and at the same time be responsible for the safety of the entire unit. The work of a sapper is always a difficult and dangerous process, but, as they say, there are nuances. It's one thing to clear a path for tanks. This task is clear, understandable: the sappers know that there is an armored vehicle in front of them, which is ready to withstand a certain level of danger. The main thing here is to lay a safe corridor and to react promptly to a change in the situation. Demining for special forces and more is a completely different story. This is filigree work, where the life of the sapper depends not on the armor, but on the people who will then follow invisible paths to the enemy's rear. It requires absolute precision, accuracy and silent work without the right to make a mistake. You usually have to work at night or in unfamiliar territory, and any little thing can be decisive. At such moments, sappers must be psychologically prepared for high responsibility: they go first, providing a way for those who carry key tasks on the front line, and often become the invisible heroes of a complex operation. After all, it is not for nothing that the motto of our brigade is ahead of the first. - Whose exploits from among the personnel of the brigade would you single out, in particular, during the actions in Kurshchyna? Two servicemen of the brigade were awarded the Order of the -Golden Star- posthumously. These are Lieutenant Oleksandr Borshulyak and Junior Sergeant Denys Dorofeyev. In particular, several times Denis Dorofeev's unit was able to stop the advance of the enemy thanks to the minefields they installed. In total, they had thousands of installed mines on their account.

What is the most important component in a fighter plane and why can't a fighter pilot think? ArmiyaInform tells about how -Maverick- has already helped and whether it can still help Ukraine. The combat sequences of many, if not the vast majority, of feature films are more fairy tales than actual depictions of combat. However, the influence of the world of cinema, especially the masterpieces of world fame, on real life is undeniable and it applies, including international politics and the military sphere. This also applies to -Top Gun- - a dilogy of Hollywood films about the pilots of fighter jets. Its first part was published way back in 1986, and the second was published 36 years later - in the spring of 2022. The first -Top Gun- not only became extremely popular, collected more than 350 thousand dollars in theaters, made the actor of the main role Tom Cruise a superstar, and made the American heavy carrier-based fighter F-14 Tomcat famous. The 1986 film also significantly influenced the perception of military service in American society in the mid-to-late 1980s. At that time, Americans, in view of the detente in relations with the USSR and traumatic memories of the war in Vietnam, viewed the prospect of a military career rather negatively. Instead, -Top Gun- made military service popular again, causing a veritable boom in new recruits in 1986. About 90% of those who aspired to serve in the US Navy indicated that they had watched a feature film about fighter pilots with Tom Cruise. The second -Top Gun- also became a sensation at the American and global box office. Collecting more than $1 billion worldwide, it left behind such films as Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (just over $950 million), Batman (around $770 million) and Jurassic Park 3 (around $750 million). The very names of the films indicate that -Maverick- had to compete for the audience's attention with very powerful rivals. It was possible to win the battle for the audience thanks to the cooperation of forces and means - from the nostalgia of the fans of the first -Top Gun- and the star galaxy led by Tom Cruise to the dashing plot, talented direction and extremely realistic location shooting. The influence of this part of the dilogy also went far beyond the world of cinema, affecting world politics and international relations. First of all, he significantly raised the morale of Ukrainians and strengthened the anti-Russian position in the whole world. The main villains of the film flew precisely on Russian Su-57s and used the Mi-24 attack helicopter. This left no doubt that the unnamed country was at least on friendly terms with the Russian Federation. The way in which the latest American F-18 Hornet fighters and even the legendary, but already decommissioned F-14 Tomcat confidently crushed the latest Russian weapons left no doubt that the Russian aggressors can and should be defeated. To defeat the aggressor state of the Russian Federation, it is enough to provide Ukraine with the necessary weapons and train the Ukrainian military to use them - and the Armed Forces of Ukraine will ensure the desired result. The film, which was watched or at least well known by the citizens of all pro-Ukraine states and all the politicians there, did its job even when it was not mentioned. When it was possible to include the issue of providing Ukraine with the F-16 Fightin Falcon to the agenda, reminiscences from the dilogy began to work with triple efficiency. The spirit of -Top Gun- was felt in everything from quotes from the film in media publications to visual solutions. After all, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi took a photo in the cockpit of the -Fighting Falcon- in the same way that Tom Cruise did many times in many American fighter jets. It was in the F-16 that Tom Cruise was photographed on December 6, 2001 during a visit to the Joint Reserve Naval Aviation Base in Fort Worth (Texas). Volodymyr Zelenskyy did this at the Skridstrup Air Base in Vojens (northern Denmark) on August 20, 2022. It took more than two years for the first F-16s to enter service with the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Fighting Falcons- in the Ukrainian sky, the President of Ukraine presented > August 4, 2024. The next day Volodymyr Zelensky published several photos of the fighter jets, noting that -the F-16 is truly a reality, a reality in our skies.- Between the two August series of photos - in Denmark in 2022 and in Ukraine in 2024 - there is a gap of hundreds of hours of negotiations and thousands of hours of training of Ukrainian pilots, during which -Top Gun- was not only in the air, but also repeatedly mentioned directly by instructors and their students . -Did you see the last movie, Top Gun, where Tom Cruise says, 'If you think, you die,'- cites the American media Politico as saying Tom Richter, a former US Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornet pilot who later transferred to the F- 16. -No matter how Hollywood it is, it's true.- Watching films in the original language with subsequent discussion is always an important component of language training. It was urgently needed and received by Ukrainian pilots during F-16 training. Also, films are an important motivational tool that can, with the help of bright emotional images, establish certain thoughts in the audience, postulate certain theses, and form stable beliefs and principles. -Top Gun- is the best for this. The thesis -it's not about the plane, but who is the pilot- that is repeatedly repeated in the film emphasizes, first of all, the training, skill and fighting spirit of military pilots. The F-16 is a perfect fighting machine, but its main component is the pilot in the cockpit. It is thanks to the pilot that the fighter turns from a set of tools and functions assembled into a single body into a living organism capable of acting as a single entity with a person. In the hands of a well-trained military pilot, the F-16 becomes a direct extension of his consciousness, a part of his body, like an arm or a leg. It is at the moment when this union can be achieved and firmly established that the training can be considered complete. None of the parts of -Top Gun- show how Tom Cruise's character flies exactly on the F-16 - this would make the parallels between the films and life even more obvious. However, Pete Mitchell instead has the globally recognized callsign Maverick, named after the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-surface missile. AGM-65 Maverick is the standard, one might even say classic, ammunition for the F-16 Fightin Falcon multipurpose fighter. This missile is intended for Close Air Support aircraft during an all-out battle. -Maverick- is an extremely effective missile capable of hitting and destroying a variety of tactical targets - armored vehicles and ground vehicles, fuel and ammunition depots, stationary fortifications and enemy air defense facilities. However, the AGM-65 Maverick also has a weak point - a range of only 40 km. In view of this, using it over the battlefield in Ukraine under the current conditions is too risky, since to launch it, the F-16 will have to fly too close to the line of combat engagement. The risk of losing a plane due to the action of enemy air defense is too high and in the vast majority of cases it is absolutely not worth the destroyed enemy targets. So at the moment there is no need to talk about the transfer of AGM-65 Maverick to Ukraine. Under the current conditions, other air-to-ground munitions should become more important, primarily high-precision, medium-range glider guided bombs AGM-154 JSOW. However, one should not forget that the modern war has already surprised many times with non-standard solutions and changed the rules of the battle. Therefore, you should not completely forget about the AGM-65 Maverick - by changing a number of parameters, they may well turn out to be an effective means of combat. Similarly, in the fictional world of Top Gun: Maverick, the F-18 Hornet is not the latest F-35 Lightning II, disabled by enemy GPS jammers, but chosen for the mission. What's more, the old F-14 Tomcat puts up a decent fight and even comes out victorious in a confrontation with two enemy Su-57s. For all its fabulousness, the cinematic -Maverick- never crosses the fine line between realism and fantasy definitively. The chances that the dogfights shown in the movies could have happened in reality are extremely slim. But they are not absolutely zero. The chances that the AGM-65 Maverick can be effectively and safely used over the battlefield in Ukraine are extremely slim. However, Ukrainians know how to surprise and impress no worse than Pete -Maverick- Mitchell. Because -it's not about the plane, but who the pilot is.- Earlier, ArmyInform talked about JSOW guided aerial bombs from the USA: what kind of weapon is this and how will it help the Defense Forces of Ukraine and thought, what will be the task of Mirage 2000 in Ukraine, and also explained why they are fighting on the side of Ukrainestrong peanut John McClain, John Rembo, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Indiana Jones, Angus McGyver, T-800 terminator, Neo and John Wick and other movie heroes of world fame.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/03/f-16-tom-kruz-i-top-gan-yak-meverik-dopomig-ukrayini-i-chy-zmozhe-dopomogty-shhe/	2024-11-02T21:36:02-07:00
They twisted the essence: fake workers of the Russian Federation created a manipulation about the co...	Actually, in the interview, an excerpt from which the Russians seem to be spreading, Sergeant Tymochko did not say anything about -plans for the mobilization of women-, but only expressed an opinion about the need for civilians, in particular women, to undergo military training courses. Civilian training centers operate in Ukraine, engaged in both general military and specialized military training of civilians. Civilian women and men take the course in these centers voluntarily as part of preparation for military service and resistance to Russian aggression. So the propagandists, in their characteristic manner, twisted the essence of the message and made a short manipulation out of it. Since 2014, no woman in Ukraine has been forcibly mobilized. However, Russian propaganda regularly spreads fakes that Ukraine is about to start mobilizing women. This is one of the most favorite topics of propagandists, to which a certain number of gullible Ukrainians are -led- every time. We remind you: the service of women in the Defense Forces of Ukraine was and is exclusively voluntary. And the goal of such destructive narratives is to cause a split in society, to sow distrust in the Armed Forces and state authorities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/03/perekrutyly-sut-fejkoroby-rf-zlipyly-manipulyacziyu-pro-pryzov-zhinok-do-vijska/	2024-11-02T21:17:54-07:00
Billions for a new BMP: the US will replace the world-famous M2 Bradley	According to the information distributed by the author of the defense publication Army Recognition, the Pentagon allocated to General Dynamics (GDLS ) and American Rheinmetall for $800 million for the development of prototypes of this machine as part of the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) program, ArmyInform reports. The total cost of the rearmament program is estimated at $45 billion, and the United States Army plans to purchase approximately 3,800 units of new armored vehicles. In June 2023, GDLS and American Rheinmetall were selected from five competitors for the final stage of detailed design, while Point Blank Enterprises, Oshkosh Defense and BAE Systems were eliminated from the competition. Evaluating the concepts of the future BMP, experts from IKK Defense Express in particular stated that in fact we are talking about more than a classic modern BMP with a forward location of the engine and transmission department. And also deliberately emphasized armor protection in the form of, most likely, elements of dynamic protection in the lower frontal part of the hull and details on the sides, which are additionally reinforced with overhead elements. Specialists from the Army Recognition defense portal analyzed the novelty more thoroughly. The authors of the site believe that the XM30 will bring significant changes to the infantry fighting vehicle (IPV) category, having a 50x228mm gun in a remote-controlled turret, dual anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), an AI-enabled fire control system, and a hybrid powertrain. The XM30 will have a crew of two (mechanic driver and commander) and will carry six infantrymen. The vehicle's size and capacity were designed to maintain a balance between firepower and mobility, while preventing it from becoming too large or heavy, as was seen in some previous BMP designs. The combat vehicle will be designed to work alongside future versions of the M1 Abrams main battle tank and is expected to include protection against unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Digital engineering is central to the development of the XM30. In the early stages of the program, the five aforementioned contractors were awarded approximately $60 million each to create digital projects based on Army requirements. Through this process, which facilitated design, development and possible future upgrades, the US Army clarified the requirements for the armor and ensured that they were achievable, avoiding the problems that led to the cancellation of previous programs. For example, by using 3D models and simulations in the early stages of design, the Army has obtained assurances from contractors that all requirements and subsystems, including sensors and fire control mechanisms, are agreed upon before physical prototypes are built. This approach has minimized development costs and helps contractors and the Army quickly resolve any design issues that arise during the process. The XM30's modular design supports future technological upgrades, allowing new systems to be integrated with minimal changes to the vehicle's core architecture. Equipped with a hybrid-electric drive and various weapon systems, including a 50 mm cannon and anti-tank guided missiles, the XM30 is configured to meet current operational requirements while maintaining flexibility for future needs. The XM30 program is a continuation of the US Army's efforts to replace the M2 Bradley, which has been in service since the 1980s. Despite several previous attempts, including the Ground Combat Vehicle and Future Combat System, such initiatives were not successful. Mainly due to problems with requirements alignment, funding, manufacturing technology and prototyping schedule. Colonel Geoffrey Jurand, the XM30 project manager, emphasized that the current program is consistent in these areas and is supported by the use of digital technologies. This approach allows the vehicle to be designed and tested using digital models, avoiding some of the problems faced by previous programs. Both General Dynamics and Rheinmetall have been selected to move forward in the competition, with the US Army currently in the third phase of a five-phase schedule. These contractors will deliver prototypes to the military by the end of 2026, and the Pentagon will conduct a critical analysis of the design by the first half of fiscal 2025. The final selection of a single supplier for production will occur around the first quarter of fiscal year 2028 after testing and evaluation of prototypes. The program is also supported by a -digital trinity- approach that includes model-based systems engineering, digital engineering and development, security and operations (DevSecOps). This digital approach improved tracking and communication between contractors and the Army, and errors were identified and corrected early in the design process. XM30 is one of six programs identified by the Pentagon to demonstrate the benefits of digital technology. The US Army's use of digital technology for this project aims to improve design efficiency, reduce costs and ensure the armored vehicle's modularity and adaptability to future needs. The program has earned the trust of senior United States Army leadership, who have expressed support for its goals and its potential to deliver long-term benefits, including cost savings through its open architecture. As the program progresses, other phases will focus on prototyping, testing and evaluation. The US Army plans to begin testing prototypes in 2026, with a final production decision expected in 2028. Implementation of the program to create the BMP XM30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle.

Russia uses Western components for attacks on Ukraine — the President	Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated this in his evening address on November 2. -Today, first of all, gratitude to our soldiers. To everyone who protects Ukraine from the daily attacks of -shaheed- and rockets. In the month of October, more than 2,000 -martyrs- were against Ukraine, against our people. Literally every day. This number of -shahedis- is more than 170 thousand components that should have been blocked for delivery to Russia. Microcircuits, microcontrollers, processors, many different parts, without which this terror would simply not be possible,- said the President. According to him, all this is supplied to Russia from abroad. -And this, unfortunately, from companies from China, Europe, America - many micro-contributions to the constant Russian terror. This brings the world back again and again to the need to work much harder to control the export of specialty parts and resources. In order not to give Russia the opportunity to circumvent the sanctions that have long been imposed against Russia for this war,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. In his opinion, the situation is similar to that of the Shaheds and Russian missiles. -They all contain components from other countries. Fighting against Russian strikes means fighting, including for the strength of sanctions against Russia. Sanctions should increase and be effective. And every scheme to circumvent sanctions is a crime against people and the world. And it is precisely such schemes that allow Russia to also help the regimes in Iran and North Korea build up their muscles. This is a global threat. And only global, special pressure can overcome this,- the President assured. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy once again ataku/->emphasized that constant terrorist attacks on Ukrainian cities indicate insufficient pressure on Russia and its allies.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/rosiya-vykorystovuye-zahidni-komponenty-dlya-udariv-po-ukrayini-prezydent/	2024-11-02T12:31:59-07:00

Kursk massacre by drones - paratroopers hunt enemy armored vehicles	The video of combat work was posted on November 2 on the brigade's channel. -Kryl- drones hit enemy armored vehicles on the move, often together with landing forces. Drones provided by one of the Ukrainian volunteer communities were used for combat work. The defeat of the Russian armored personnel carrier was particularly successful. It was a real pyrotechnic art. As reported by ArmyInform, the soldiers of the 95th Polish Airborne Assault Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine repelled the assault of marines of the 155th brigade of the Russian Federation, leaving their corpses on the battlefield in Kurshchyna.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/kurska-rizanyna-dronamy-desantnyky-polyuyut-za-bronetehnikoyu-voroga/	2024-11-02T11:39:23-07:00
Loud and unsuccessful escape at the border: shippers and -customers- detained at gunpoint	About this reported the State Border Service of Ukraine. Suspicious movement near the border was recorded by a video surveillance camera. The border guards reacted immediately and set out to search for violators. The fugitives were apprehended after several warning shots. It turned out that the detainees were residents of Kyiv, Kyiv and Lviv regions. During further search activities, border guards detained the 55-year-old organizer of the crossing and his accomplice, a female driver who transported illegal immigrants to their destination. As the law enforcement officers found out, the man organized illegal crossings through social networks, offering his services for 9-10 thousand dollars per person. The detained men were taken to the border unit, where administrative and procedural documents were drawn up against them for attempting to cross the border illegally. The organizers face criminal liability for h. 2 Art. 332 of the Criminal Code (-Illegal transportation of persons across the state border-), and the driver was also prosecuted for maliciously disobeying the legal requirements of border guards. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/guchna-ta-nevdala-vtecha-na-kordoni-perepravnyky-ta-kliyenty-zatrymani-pid-postrily/	2024-11-02T11:21:59-07:00
Dropping drones - the Russians use tourer drones in the direction of the main strike	Senior Lieutenant Andrii Bezsonov, head of the radio-electronic warfare service of the 18th Slavic Brigade of the National Guard, told about this on Army TV. -In my private opinion, there are Russian UAV crews that move from place to place, from direction to direction. And through this, they strengthen the direction that is most interesting to them at the moment. We have also had such people visit us and we can see it, first of all, by the quality of piloting. That is, we intercept the video and see how it flies, how it bypasses trees, how it approaches the target, how it counteracts our EW means,- said Andriy Bezsonov. According to him, the situation with enemy drones has improved somewhat in his brigade's area of ​​operation near Chasovoy Yar, mostly local operators are working, which our pilots call -husks- because they demonstrate very low efficiency. (video from 28:44) As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers are crossing the channel near the Time Yar, they are unable to gain a foothold, but they continue to attack.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/perekaty-drony-rosiyany-vykorystovuyut-dronshhykiv-gastroleriv-na-napryamku-golovnogo-udaru/	2024-11-02T11:03:43-07:00
Over one and a half thousand hit targets in a month! — -Birds of Magyar- had a great October	The summary video appeared on November 2 on the battalion channel. -Waking up in the morning to find that the pilots of the -Birds of Magyar- have hit 50 more worm targets in the past day,- commented the video combatant Captain Robert Brovdy. Among them are Russian guns and armored vehicles, beloved by the -Birds- and enemy vehicles and personnel. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 414th unmanned battalion aviation systems -Birds of Magyar- as part of the Marine Corps we have already hit 150 enemy guns in the Pokrovsky direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/ponad-pivtory-tysyachi-urazhenyh-czilej-za-misyacz-ptahy-madyara-udarno-provely-zhovten/	2024-11-02T10:37:03-07:00

The video of combat operation was released on November 2 by the Forces of Unmanned Systems of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The -Wasp- air defense system was found at night, and our bomber drone immediately flew to it. Although the -Wasp- is designed to attack air targets at low altitudes and was on combat duty, it failed to notice the danger. Then our drone calmly hovered over the enemy air defense system and made two accurate drops that hit the air defense system. -Step by step, we are destroying every level of the enemy's echeloned anti-aircraft defense,- the SBS of the Armed Forces commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 412th battalion of unmanned systems Nemesis of the Forces of unmanned systems of the Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed in one operation the storage place of enemy ammunition and transport.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/dron-pidkravsya-nepomitno-na-luganskomu-napryamku-rozbombyly-vorozhyj-zrk-osa/	2024-11-02T10:19:26-07:00

Just from the street to the marines: what has the Russian marine corps turned into	About this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- told the spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain 3 rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. — The quality composition changes. The Marine Corps is an elite, and its elite is not only in the name, but also in the level of training. Just today I came across a material in which a former prisoner turned out to be a marine. That is, now the qualitative composition of these units does not differ significantly, he said. Now, there is no special training for Russian marines. — In fact, the organizational core of the marine corps is used, that is, the command structure, which, of course, is not directly applied on the battlefield. These units have become ordinary infantry units that fill up just off the street without any special training. Because [real] Marines is amphibious training, it's jumping, it's conquering the three elements, the spokesperson explained. Unfortunately, a similar situation is observed in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, although the Armed Forces of Ukraine still try, despite intensive combat operations, to better train marines. — If we take the training from us, the training of the marines continues periodically, despite the fact that they are in combat conditions. But, nevertheless, and there we can notice that now it can actually be called simply infantry, said Dmytro Pletenchuk. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the 155th Separate Guards Marine Brigade of the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Federation is known for its war crimes, it was even characterized as -very rotten brigade-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/prosto-z-vulyczi-u-morpihy-na-shho-peretvorylas-rosijska-morska-pihota/	2024-11-02T09:21:40-07:00
Artificial intelligence against the -heavenly river-cutter- - the Russians are trying to keep their ...	Video appeared on November 2. After the Russian -wing- noticed the approach of our kamikaze drone, it began to maneuver sharply to escape. This time it was difficult for our operator, but he managed to get close to the Russian UAV and destroy it. But in the future it will be more difficult. Perhaps our drones will have to use new attack tactics, enter from the blind spots of additional cameras, or increase the combat part of our FPVs. Previously, the Russians tried to reduce the consequences of the -sky cutter-, the mass destruction of their reconnaissance -wings- by camouflage painting them, but this did not give results. Now they are trying to use artificial intelligence. As reported by ArmyInform, the Defense Forces began to shoot down with drones the Russian analogues of the -shaheds-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/shtuchnyj-intelekt-proty-nebesnogo-rusorizu-rosiyany-namagayutsya-zberegty-svoyi-kryla/	2024-11-02T09:12:32-07:00
If Global Positioning Is Hacked: Satellite Imaging Company Maxar Is Working on a 3D Mapping Tool to ...	-Maxar's nascent Pinpoint tool will use the drone's video feed to identify its surroundings in 3D, then match it to maps created with the company's P3DR , for accurate 3D registration,- stated the chief product specialist of the Maxar Corporation, Peter Vilchynski, ArmiyaInform reports. While most mapping technologies -focus on flat representations of the world,- Wilczynski said, Pinpoint will address -how you use that 3D representation to help drones determine their positioning, to help aircraft pilots navigate, to help understand when you're getting drone video or from the plane, what position is he actually looking at.- A representative of the firm noted that it could be an alternative to GPS, which could be vulnerable to adversary interference. That's important in part because of -all the obstruction issues we've seen in Ukraine,- he said. -I think what we're going to see in the next few years is a transition from this absolute GPS navigation system to a much more reference navigation system, more like what happened when you could sort of be in the middle ages on a ship and make your route through the stars-. Pinpoint plans to complete several pilot programs with domestic and foreign drone manufacturers next year, and then make the technology widely available. -We work with various companies throughout the project creation chain. Some companies produce suspensions, some produce completely (unmanned aerial vehicles). There are a bunch of different development options: free, more expensive, some with more durable UAVs. So we are trying to experiment with this market,- Vilchynskyi said. -This is a really fast-growing market right now as people in the defense community realize that the GPS we've relied on for so long may not be available in the next conflict,- said a Maxar spokesperson.

The situation in Toretsk was stabilized: where the enemy was stopped	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. — In Toretsk, we somewhat stabilized the battle line. The enemy, as before, is on the eastern outskirts of the city. We stop all attempts of the enemy to advance and, at this moment, all assaults on Toretsk are repulsed. There are strong units of the Defense Forces and they are not allowing the enemy to move, she said. At the same time, the spokeswoman noted that the occupiers are accumulating and concentrating forces and means with the aim of intensifying offensive actions. — We now see that the enemy is withdrawing reserves, the enemy is establishing manpower at the front line, replenishing military personnel, installing anti-aircraft missile systems. We see that they are preparing for some active hostilities, the spokeswoman said. The officer also reported on which divisions and units of the occupiers operate in the area of ​​responsibility of the Luhansk OTU. — If we talk about Chasiv Yar, then the Airborne Division of the Central Military District of the Russian Federation is stationed there.

Senior Lieutenant Andriy Bezsonov, head of the electronic warfare service of the 18th Slavic Brigade of the National Guard, told about the situation near Chasovoy Yar. -You kill them, and they keep climbing and climbing. Another wave, another wave, more... Their human resource is inexhaustible,- said Andriy Bezsonov. According to him, the Russians are actively manipulating the logistics routes of the Defense Forces in order to disrupt supplies. The Russians are also persistently looking for ways to protect themselves from our FPV drones. -I didn't see EW shoulder pads, instead there are a large number of EW rifles, and such modifications, about which there is no information. Apparently, this is a small garage production, not very efficient, because in my eyes the Russian worked with an electronic warfare rifle and received an epfivishka,- Andriy Bezsonov said. (video from 26:07) As reported by ArmyInform, the fighters of the 18th National Guard brigade showed what the occupiers have transformed Chasiv Yar.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/cze-nagaduye-zombi-rezhym-v-call-of-duty-koly-ty-vbyvayesh-a-vony-vse-lizut-naczgvardiyecz-pro-boyi-pid-chasovym-yarom/	2024-11-02T08:41:29-07:00

In the Kharkiv region, during the rotation of the Russians at their positions, shells from our artillery and drops from drones flew at them.

Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. — The enemy is most active near such cities as Chasiv Yar and Toretsk. Near Chasovoy Yar, the enemy is trying to cross the channel. No success at this point, she said. However, the Russians take into account previous experience and change their tactics. — Now they have focused on the use of sabotage and intelligence groups and the so-called -secrets-, when one, two, three people run across the channel, hide in urban buildings, in basements, in holes and wait for replenishment or, rather, for the accumulation of sufficient forces for assaults. However, at the moment, such attempts are detected and the groups are affected and destroyed, the officer said. The spokeswoman explained why the named cities are important for the invaders. — These cities are a priority for the Russians, they want to capture Donetsk and Luhansk regions before the cold. As far as we know, the enemy is not preparing for the winter period, because they believe that they will achieve their goals before the onset of frost. Therefore, they focused their strikes on these cities, the officer said. However, the concentration of the enemy's main efforts on Chasovoy Yar and Toretsk does not mean that the occupiers have curtailed their activity in other areas. -In particular, in the Seversky direction, the enemy is also advancing with the use of equipment and simply infantry groups to one unit,- the spokeswoman said. However, currently all enemy assaults are successfully repulsing units of the Defense Forces. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the area of ​​Chasovoye Yaru, the drones of the Defense Forces destroyed the naval jet bomber of the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/vstygnuty-do-holodiv-okupanty-zoseredyly-zusyllya-na-zahoplenni-toreczka-ta-chasovogo-yaru/	2024-11-02T07:57:18-07:00

It looks futuristic, it burns even better: the jet bomber of the occupiers was destroyed in the area...	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. - Usually, the enemy uses the tactics of small assault groups, as mentioned earlier. However, there are other methods, using technology. For example, it is the transportation of the occupiers to the forward positions and the work of artillery, the work of drones and aviation, she said. Voyskova informed about the interesting fact of the use of a jet naval bomb launcher by the Russian invaders. This testifies to the occupiers' lack of weapons and military equipment and an attempt to use anything on the battlefield. — the Russians pulled up a Soviet RBU-6000 or -Smerch-2- jet sea-launched bomber in the direction of Chasovoy Yar. It looks pretty futuristic because it's a ship weapon. However, we can say that the occupiers are dragging everything they have onto the battlefield. Including the ship's bomb launcher, which was not destroyed by our Navy, the drone fighters of the operational-tactical group -Luhansk- did finish off. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the East the Russians are resorting to rat race tactics.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/vyglyadaye-futurystychno-goryt-shhe-krashhe-reaktyvnyj-bombomet-okupantiv-znyshhyly-v-rajoni-chasovogo-yaru/	2024-11-02T06:46:43-07:00

Hypersound has reached Turkey: Ankara will develop a charge based on a ballistic missile	How states the TurkishFacts4u page on the X social network, in the Republic of Turkey confirmed not only the fact of the existence of such a weapon, but also its practical testing, ArmyInform reports. Mach 5.5, and this fact refers Turkey to a rather narrow circle of countries that have hypersonic technologies. Defense market analysts who are the authors of the Army Recognition portal note that hypersonic missiles, the speed of which exceeds Mach 5, have high maneuverability and are practically invulnerable to modern anti-missile defense systems. Traditionally, the Tayfun missile in its basic configuration, the SRBM (Short Range Ballistic Missile) can engage targets over 500 km away. Turkish developers assured that its maximum range is up to 1,000 km. The missile in ballistic configuration with a length of 6.5 meters, a diameter of 610 millimeters and a mass of 2,300 kg identifies the target using a coordinate guidance system. The Tayfun, equipped with a pre-formed cluster warhead, has a high hit accuracy with a CEP (Circular Probable Error) value of 10 meters or less. The hypersonic version of this missile promises to significantly increase the speed, range and effectiveness of destroying targets. > Although detailed technical characteristics, such as range, payload and methods of evading countermeasures, have not yet been published, experts are already stating significant progress in the development of Turkish missile technology. Observers note that the company Roketsan, founded 1988, plays a key role in ensuring Turkey's self-sufficiency in the field of defense technology. The latest developments in the field of hypersonics demonstrate its ability to create advanced weapons. These successes confirm that Turkey is ready to compete at the world level and aims to become an important player in the global arms race, where hypersonic technologies are becoming one of the key directions. The development of this type of weapons shows Turkey's desire to strengthen its position on the world stage and significantly increase its strategic and defense potential. At the very least, the creation of a hypersonic version of the Tayfun SRBM can significantly strengthen Ankara's position in the Mediterranean, the Middle East and other strategically important regions, analysts concluded.

From -rat- to oath: how the military oath evolved in Ukraine	Taking the oath was started in the 9th century. with the arrival of the Varangians to the Ukrainian lands. Rata - that's what the oath to the prince was called. Accordingly, the soldiers were originally called -ratai-, that is, the one who took the rata (oath). Joining the wife, the soldiers swore their loyalty to the prince, and after that the soldiers were considered brothers. The Zaporozhye Cossacks inherited this tradition. When a new warrior came to Sich, he went through reception rites. Among them was a solemn oath of allegiance to the society and acceptance of Orthodoxy if the man was of a different faith. Subsequently, in the period of the XVII-XVIII centuries. the Cossacks were forced to swear an oath to the Russian tsars. It is obvious that at that time it was a forced measure, because the Cossacks swore to them for political reasons. The military oath of the Legion of Ukrainian Sich Riflemen also faced a test in the form of the Austrian military command, because the Sich Riflemen were part of the Austro-Hungarian army. According to the plan of the authorities, they had to swear an oath to the government of Austria-Hungary. But the volunteers who joined the ranks of the SSS went to the ranks of the army with the goal of defending their homeland from the Russians and serving their own Ukrainian people, so they had no desire to swear allegiance to a foreign state and its people. However, due to poor technical support and the threat of dissolution of the SSS, on September 3, 1914, the troops of the SSS Legion were forced to take an oath of allegiance to Austria-Hungary and its emperor. But the USS military did not put up with this and drew up its own alternative text of the oath of loyalty to the native Ukrainian people, although it did not receive official approval. The text was as follows: -I, &#8230;, the Ukrainian Sich Archer, swear to the Ukrainian princes, hetmans, Zaporizhia Sich, graves and all of Ukraine, that I will faithfully serve my Motherland, defend it from the enemy, fight for the honor of Ukrainian weapons until the last drop of blood. So, Lord God and Archangel Michael, help me. Amen.- Under the text of the oath, the soldiers who took the oath must sign. This made the oath more weighty. Special attention should be paid to the wording -to serve the Motherland, to defend it against the enemy- because this was the main motivation of the volunteers. On July 24, 1918, the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian State of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky passed the Law on General Military Conscription. They tried to recruit only those citizens who demonstrated -unconditional devotion to the idea of ​​an independent Ukraine- to the army. Hetman Skoropadskyi also approved the -Law on the Military Oath of Allegiance to the Ukrainian State-. The text of the oath was provided in short changes for conscripts of various religions and nationalities living in the Ukrainian State. The text of the oath: -I promise and swear by Almighty God and the Holy Gospel that I will serve, without sparing my life, faithfully and sincerely to the last drop of blood to the Ukrainian State and His Highness Hetman, the Supreme Commander of the Ukrainian Army and Navy. I will in all cases put up the greatest possible resistance to the enemies of the Ukrainian State, I will watch over all the interests of the Ukrainian State and sacredly guard the official secret entrusted to me and obey without objection all orders for the needs of the service and the State, conscientiously perform all my duties and do nothing for my own benefit to do something that would be contrary to my service and oath. I will never forsake my unit and my Flag, and in all cases I will behave as befits an honest, faithful, conscientious, brave and conscientious (officer or soldier). May God help me in this, and in the end I kiss St. Scripture and the Cross of my Savior. Amen.- This time, the Ukrainian army immediately had the opportunity to swear to its own people and native land. In addition, the Hetman administration took important steps in the organization of the future Ukrainian army. On November 13, 1918, in Lviv, the Ukrainian National Council of the ZUNR approved the text of the -Oath of Ukrainian Troops- by its resolution. It was set out in the following format: -We solemnly swear to Almighty God to faithfully and obediently obey the Western Ukrainian People's Republic, Its Supreme Authority, Its Government, Its Army, as well as to all Its chieftains and all Its leadership, to respect and protect them, their orders and suggestions in every service to be carried out, against every enemy, whosoever he may be, and wherever the will of Her Supreme Authority shall require, on the waters, on the lands, in the air, by day and by night, in battles, offensives, skirmishes and in all kinds of enterprises, in other words, in every place, at every time, on every occasion, to fight bravely and bravely, never to abandon our troops, flags and weapons, never to enter into the slightest understanding with the enemy, always to act according to the laws of war demand and how honest soldiers face to live and die in honor in this way. Yes, God, help us - Amen.- The Ukrainian Galician Army was the most capable Ukrainian military formation during the First Liberation Struggle in 1917-1921. In January 1919, the authorities of the Ukrainian People's Republic approved a sample oath or, as it was then called, -The Promise-. Subsequently, on March 12, 1919, on behalf of the Directory in Vinnytsia, Chief Ataman of the Army of the Ukrainian People's Republic Simon Petliura approved the new text of the oath of the Ukrainian troops. The oath took place solemnly, as a rule, it was attended by high-ranking state officials. Galicians freed from Serbian captivity swear allegiance to Ukraine and the Ukrainian army, August 3 1919. Photo: wikipedia.org Text of the oath: -I swear by the honor of a citizen of the Ukrainian People's Republic and I solemnly swear to Almighty God to faithfully serve the Ukrainian People's Republic, obediently obey its supreme authority of the Directorate, the government and the people's army. I swear to respect and protect the orders and all recommendations of their service, to carry them out exactly against any enemy of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the working people, whoever this enemy may be and wherever the will of the Supreme Republican Power will demand: on water, on land, in the air , day and night, in battles, offensives, skirmishes and all kinds of enterprises, in a word, in every place, at every time and in every case fight bravely and courageously to the last drop of blood. Do not throw away your military units, flags and weapons in any case, do not enter into any, even the smallest, understanding with the enemy, always behave as the military laws and the honor of a warrior-knight require, in this way and honor to live and honor to die Help me in this, Holy God, my love for my native Ukraine and the people.- The Ukrainian military organization was established in 1920 in the western Ukrainian lands. The members of the Ukrainian military organization were veterans of various military formations, first of all, the Sich Riflemen of the Army of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the Ukrainian Galician Army. Colonel Yevhen Konovalets, the former leader of the Sich Rifle Corps, headed the UVO. Each new member of the UVO had to swear an oath of loyalty to the organization. The oath was taken in a secluded place in a narrow circle of people. Those who took the oath raised the three middle fingers of their right hand, and put the left one on the weapon. And various texts of speeches were delivered. Usually, the oath was about unfailing execution of the orders of the leadership of the UVO and about signing a death sentence in case of treason. The OUN and the UPA, following the traditions of the UVO, presented their own text of the oath on July 11-15, 1944, at the founding Great Meeting of the Ukrainian Main Liberation Council near the village of Sprynya. It was prepared by the OUN leadership and the UPA Main Team. The oath entered into force by order of the General Military Staff of the UPA on July 19, 1944, and was published in the magazine -Povstanets- in November 1944. It was accompanied by instructions on the procedure for its preparation and celebration events. The oath was taken after the training, when the soldiers were already sure of their choice. For this event, the warriors prepared in advance by memorizing the text. The ceremony took place on a wide lawn, the rebels were festively dressed and with weapons in their hands, all this was accompanied by a divine service. The first collective oath was administered on August 5, 1944 by the Chief of the Main Military Staff of the UPA for the soldiers of the 3rd Hundred - -Snakes-, -Mace- and -Lions- - using the text approved by the UGVR. Text of the oath: -I, a soldier of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, having taken up a weapon, solemnly swear by my honor and conscience before the Great Ukrainian People, before the Holy Land of Ukraine, before the spilled blood of all the Best Sons of Ukraine, and before the Highest Political Leader To the People of Ukraine: To fight for the complete liberation of all Ukrainian lands and the Ukrainian people from the invaders and to win the Ukrainian Independent Cathedral State. In this struggle, I will spare neither blood nor life and will fight until my last breath and final victory over all the enemies of Ukraine. I will be courageous, brave and brave in battle and merciless towards the enemies of the Ukrainian land. I will be an honest, disciplined and revolutionary-vigilant soldier. I will follow all the orders of my superiors. I will strictly preserve military and state secrets. I will be a worthy brother in battle and combat life to all my comrades-in-arms. When I break or deviate from this oath, let me be punished by the strict law of the Ukrainian National Revolution and let the contempt of the Ukrainian of the people.- Modern Ukraine On August 24, 1991, together with the adoption of the Act of Proclamation of Independence of Ukraine, the resolutions -On the Proclamation of Ukraine's Independence- and -On Military Formations in Ukraine- were also adopted. In November 1991, at the 2nd Congress of the Union of Officers of Ukraine, where Defense Minister Kostyantyn Morozov was present, the participants took the first unofficial oath of loyalty to Ukraine. On December 6, the Council of Ukraine adopted the laws of Ukraine -On the Defense of Ukraine- and -On the Armed Forces of Ukraine-, and also the resolution -On the text of the Military Oath- approved the text of the military oath solemnly taken in the Verkhovna Rada by the First Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Colonel General Kostiantyn Morozov. After the VRU resolution -On the text of the Military Oath- was approved on December 6, on December 23, soldiers led by Martirosyan on the Independence Square in Rivne took it, publicly swearing allegiance to Ukraine. The text of the oath: -I, (surname, first name and patronymic), join the military service and solemnly swear to the Ukrainian people to always be faithful and loyal to it, to defend Ukraine, to protect its sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability, honestly and to honestly perform military duty, the orders of commanders, to strictly adhere to the Constitution of Ukraine and the laws of Ukraine, to keep state secrets. I swear to fulfill my duties in the interests of my compatriots. I swear never to betray To the Ukrainian people.- In peacetime, the day of taking the oath is declared a holiday for the military unit, usually it is a weekend. The commander determines the time and place by separate order, announcing to the personnel. Native military personnel and guests may be invited to the ceremony, priests or religious representatives may be present. Military personnel come in full dress uniform, but during martial law the uniform is determined by the commander. The party lines up, and those taking the oath stand in front. The ceremony begins with a speech by the commander, followed by speeches by representatives of the higher command and veterans. The military are called according to the alphabet, and they, with weapons in their hands, take an oath and put their signature. From this moment on, they officially become military personnel.

Preparation of the mobilized and -military rally -Paris — Dakar--: the chief sergeant of the Armed F...	— What are the features of training in wartime, in the conditions of the situation that has developed, what problems and difficulties exist? — The huge volume of personnel that needs to be trained. At the same time, the terms of such preparation are as limited as possible. Therefore, the number of those who need to be trained and the time limit: these factors definitely have a negative impact on the quality of training. Again, by the method of trial, error and testing in most NATO countries, they came up with the position that the basic general military training for those citizens who have never served before should be 3 months. This is the most optimal term to equip a serviceman with all the necessary skills and abilities. On the other hand, we understand that combat units and units need to be equipped as soon as possible, given the losses they suffer on the battlefield. And here two important factors come into conflict. The first is preparation speed and quantity, and the second is quality. And it is in wartime that we try to balance these three indicators so that in a short time it is possible to train a certain number of servicemen, but at the same time achieve a certain quality of training. Of course, quality suffers. In addition, everything depends very much on how training is organized in a particular training center. How staffed are the instructors at this center and how qualified are they? Plus, it is necessary to take into account the moral and business qualities of those who come to such training, whether they have the motivation to study or not. And a number of other factors that are reflected in different educational centers in different ways. Therefore, the quality of such training in different educational centers also differs. Where management managed to gather more trained and experienced instructors, the quality is better. Where leaders think about improving the educational process, while minimizing many distractions for cadets, such as daily uniforms, patrols, shifts, performing some work and so on, of course, the quality of training is better in such training centers. But it is different everywhere. Also among the main problems is the search and selection of qualified instructors. Since May 2022, the network of training military units and training units conducting BZVP has been significantly expanded. And a large number of new instructor positions were introduced, which must be filled with competent instructors. And it is necessary that they all have combat experience, are prepared, etc. This is very difficult to do even during two years of a great war. Next, it is necessary to send as many such instructors and sergeants as possible to the appropriate courses so that they acquire the methodology and become specialists in teaching. This is what we do, trying to do everything we can and even more. — Recently in social networks, some civilians have been spreading information about the alleged falsification of BZVP in the Armed Forces, what do you know about the above, are the facts being presented true? — Yes, there are cases when civilian bloggers or some experts quite often explain in social networks certain problems of training our military personnel, especially regarding BZVP. Indeed, there are enough problems. As I have already said, you can achieve quality in training only when you train the optimal number of military personnel and you have appropriate deadlines for that. Well, of course, there are other conditions: material and technical base, ammunition. So there are problems, and we know them. Even better than some experts. And we do everything to solve them. I am participating specifically in the area of ​​professional development, training of instructors from among sergeants. It must be said here that combat sergeants are also lacking in combat military units that directly fight the enemy at the front. Therefore, commanders do not really want to give their experienced subordinates as instructors to training centers. They need them there to carry out combat missions. Another of the main problems of the basic training of a soldier is the violation of the very technology of training a fighter to participate in combat operations in the fiercest war that can be on this planet. A full-scale war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine with the use of strategic aviation and all types of weapons and equipment, including the latest drones and so on. Humanity has practically never seen such a war. Only nuclear weapons are not used. Ideally, after basic general military training, a serviceman should get into his unit, where he must undergo further training, certain exercises and a stage of collective training of the unit before performing combat tasks. It is this process that helps a serviceman to prepare for combat operations over a certain period of time. But quite often this does not happen. We can compare the participation of Ukrainian servicemen in combat operations on the front line with the participation of car racers in extremely difficult and fierce rallies -Paris - Dakar- or -Le Mans-. Professional drivers have been preparing for these races for years. Our military does not have the ability to prepare for war for years. Most of our soldiers go to combat brigades immediately after the end of the BZVP. At the moment, unfortunately, we do not have a set of military units to fully replace units on the battle line, given the large length of the entire front. This would provide an opportunity for our units and units to periodically leave the areas of hostilities, recover, and undergo a full cycle of training. Therefore, the absence of this cycle, let's say, also greatly affects the quality of a soldier's training. Therefore, it is impossible to expect that after BZVP a soldier, who was a civilian before that, will come and fully fight the enemy on the front line alongside experienced fighters. To make up for certain shortcomings in his training, as well as in psychological readiness for combat, it is necessary to train with a military unit, for which an adaptation course should be held in it for two to three weeks. I recently worked in the Zaporizhia and Kherson directions, before that I worked in other areas of hostilities. So, in each military unit, sergeants and officers organized additional training for servicemen who come from training centers after the BZVP. And where it is organized effectively, the level of execution of combat missions is better, and there are fewer losses. As part of this training, sergeants who have combat experience and an understanding of the nature of combat operations in this area identify the shortcomings of a particular serviceman, and take such additional training into account. Soldiers are trained for those types of weapons that are specifically in a brigade or battalion. Due to the fact that our units sometimes have different types of weapons (in particular, even small arms), accordingly, the nature of hostilities in different areas of the front differs. Tactics of actions of both the enemy and ours in urban areas, plantations, fields, ruins of cities and villages are taken into account. The main thing is that motivated people come who are ready to fight the enemy, protect their families, homes, their country, the future of their children. — What real steps are being taken to increase the effectiveness of the BZVP, to ensure a higher quality of training for our soldiers? — First, the quality of such training is constantly being analyzed. This is work directly in the training units and units that carry out the BZVP, by checking the training process, interviewing the military themselves, and testing them. And work in combat military units when such fighters come. At the moment, a feedback system is being implemented between training centers and units at the front: reports with shortcomings are sent for further rapid response. Secondly, we are currently working on involving officers and sergeants with combat experience from combat military units to the basic general military training held in training centers. That they directly participate in the training of their future fighters. Such a practice is already in place at the Training Center of the State Academy of Medical Sciences, and it has proven its effectiveness. The main area on which we concentrate is improving the training of the instructors themselves, in particular the professional component of their training, improving their skills in fire, tactical and engineering training, for their transfer to cadets. We hope that the increase of BZVP from one month to one and a half will increase its quality, provide an opportunity to conduct more practical training with recruits, primarily in shooting and tactics.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/pidgotovka-mobilizovanyh-ta-voyenne-rali-paryzh-dakar-golovnyj-serzhant-zsu-rozpoviv-pro-problemy-bzvp-pid-chas-vijny/	2024-11-01T21:23:44-07:00

President: North Korean soldiers are already near the Ukrainian border	About this he said during the evening address. North Korea recently test-fired a new ballistic missile that set records for flight time and altitude. Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized that cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang has already allowed North Korea to improve its missile and artillery capabilities. Now the first thousands of North Korean soldiers are near the Ukrainian border, and, unfortunately, Ukraine will be forced to defend itself against new invaders. The president emphasized that the world cannot simply watch this threat grow. According to him, Ukraine has accurate data on the locations of the North Korean military on the territory of Russia, but it cannot carry out pre-emptive strikes due to the lack of long-range weapons. The provision of such weapons depends on Ukraine's partners - the USA, Great Britain, Germany and other states, which have so far refrained from active actions. Zelensky called for the active participation not only of Western countries, but and China, which declares its desire to end the war, but at the same time only observes the situation. The President of Ukraine concluded that North Korea's participation in the war against Ukraine poses a threat to the whole world, and it must be stopped as soon as possible. As reported by ArmyInform, in an interview with South Korean TV channel KBS Volodymyr Zelenskyi shared his thoughts on the danger posed by the involvement of the North Korean military not only for Ukraine, and why it is important to resist it together.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/01/prezydent-pivnichnokorejski-soldaty-vzhe-bilya-ukrayinskogo-kordonu/	2024-11-01T14:29:43-07:00

The event was organized by the non-governmental organization -International Academy of Geoinformatics- with the assistance of the Department of International Defense Cooperation of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and with the participation of the Kyiv Association of Military Attachés of the countries of the Ramstein group. The President of NAPNU, the head of the -Knowledge- Society of Ukraine, Vasyl Kremin, and the director of the NATO Documentation and Information Center in Ukraine, Vineta Kleine, addressed the conference participants with a welcome speech. -99% of all military aid to Ukraine comes from NATO. We all remember how we started. We started with light equipment, then added heavy military equipment, then anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems. Then drones, ammunition and tanks. And we have already reached the Patriot, IRIS-T and F-16 aircraft systems. We always emphasize that supporting Ukraine is not so much charity as our security interests. It is important to emphasize that during the last summit it was once again confirmed that Ukraine's membership in NATO is irreversible, and the question is no longer whether Ukraine will join NATO, but when. But for now, it's about increased military support and more security deals. And all this can become a bridge to Ukraine's full membership,- Vineta Kleine emphasized in her speech. ArcGIS technology, the core of NATO's geographic information system, was the subject of a 20-minute talk by Nick Sutherland, Executive Director of Defense and Intelligence at Esri European National Government Team. Col. Serhii Pryshchepa, representative of the Support Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told about the implementation of the tasks of creating geospatial data based on Esri technologies.

Russia is removed from participation in the cross-border payments project -mBridge- due to sanctions	About this informs Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The project was developed by the central banks of Hong Kong, China, Thailand and the UAE with the support of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS, which unites the central banks of 60 countries of the world). The purpose of the discussion is to prevent the creation of an alternative mechanism for international transactions, as this will weaken the effectiveness of sanctions pressure on the Russian Federation. In view of the risks of participation in the project of Russia or the transfer of this technology to it, the Bank for International Settlements is considering the possibility of closing the project - the Director General of BIS A. Karstens stated that the organization will not support projects related to countries under sanctions. Earlier ArmyInform reported that the enemy is planting drugs in order to create a pretext for detaining Ukrainians at the TOT.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/01/rosiyu-usuvayut-vid-uchasti-u-proyekti-transkordonnyh-platezhiv-mbridge-cherez-sankcziyi/	2024-11-01T11:18:18-07:00
the kremlin is strengthening its anti-immigrant policy - this will have a negative impact on the Rus...	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. They provide for classifying the organization of illegal migration as a particularly serious crime, making decisions on the administrative -deportation- of foreigners without a trial, and creating a -register of controlled persons - foreigners- who are illegally staying on the territory of the Russian Federation. Strengthening the anti-migrant policy will have a negative impact on the Russian economy - migrants provide cheap labor in construction, agriculture, transport, service, etc. A decrease in their number will lead to an increase in the labor shortage, an increase in labor costs and a slowdown in economic growth. In addition, such a policy will worsen the Russian Federation's relations with the countries of Central Asia. Since the beginning of the year, the number of illegal migrants in Russia has increased by 40 percent. The rate of cases of organizing illegal migration increased by 5.5 times. In 2024, the number of decisions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation to restrict foreigners from entering Russia increased by 50% to 180,000 cases. Over 106,000 violations in the field of migration legislation were recorded in ten months of this year. 20,000 people were deported from the Russian Federation, and 1,200 people were deprived of their Russian citizenship. As of October 1, 6.2 million foreigners were registered in Russia (8.5 million in 2023). At the same time, the population in Russia is rapidly decreasing. This is influenced by the declining birth rate, high mortality of young men and the outflow of citizens abroad. To maintain the population at the level of 146 million people, Russia must attract from 390 thousand to 1.1 million migrants annually. North Korean military personnel are not classified as migrants. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that 84,000 Kadyriv residents plan to die in Ukraine in the near future.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/01/kreml-posylyuye-antymigrantsku-polityku-cze-matyme-negatyvnyj-vplyv-na-ekonomiku-rf/	2024-11-01T11:04:56-07:00

List of units and contact numbers published on the official website of the State Border Service of Ukraine. The commanders of these units can draft reservists and conscripts who have expressed a desire to do military service during mobilization. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine recently introduced relevant changes to the Procedure for the Conscription of Citizens for Military Service During Mobilization for a Special Period (Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated October 1, 2024 No. 1130 -On Amendments to the Procedure for Conscription of Citizens for Military Service During Mobilization, for a special period-). According to the changes, the list of military units whose commanders draft reservists (except for reservists who have signed a contract to serve in the military reserve) and conscripts during mobilization is determined by the General Staff of the Armed Forces for a special period. The commander of the military unit can now independently refer conscripts and reservists to the Military Medical Commission (MMC) to determine their suitability for military service. Commanders of military units are also given the right to equip combat military units at the expense of volunteers who express a desire to serve under the draft. For this, it was necessary to contact the TCC and the joint venture. How does it work?

About this the Ministry of Defense announced on November 1. -Our second large-scale Hackathon is designed to unite talents to create the latest technological solutions that will help counter the enemy's means and save the lives of our military. We will turn the best ideas into real systems that will strengthen the country's defense,- said Deputy Minister of Defense for Digitalization Kateryna Chernogorenko. -Onslaught of Machines 2.0- will focus on two challenges: Challenge 1: Countering guided aerial bombs.

The Ministry of Defense is looking for solutions to neutralize or reduce the effectiveness of these bombs. Challenge 2: Countering fiber-optic guided drones. The enemy uses drones controlled via fiber optic communication. This makes their radio jamming impossible. The Ministry of Defense is looking for a solution to effectively neutralize these drones. You can register for the Hackathon at the link. Deadline for filling out the form: November 8. - After registration, we will inform participants about the technical details of the calls.

They don't have armor, or they hide it: in the Kharkiv region, enemy infantrymen justify their name	The reasons for such a structure of losses of the enemy's ATS in the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- explained the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU lieutenant colonel Yevgeny Romanov. - What we give in our reports, what we observe, what we work on is about one and a half hundred dead and wounded every day. Armored combat vehicles and tanks are also being destroyed, he said. At the same time, in terms of losses of weapons and enemy equipment, the enemy's road transport prevails. — About three or four times more equipment losses are caused by motor vehicles. They save armor, or they run out of it and can't replenish their resources in time - craft them or restore them, the spokesman explained. In view of the lack or insufficient amount of armored vehicles, the enemy command tries to preserve them and throws Russian soldiers into battle on maneuverable, but virtually defenseless, vehicles. Or at all forces enemy infantry to attack exclusively on foot. — They use either automobile equipment or send personnel on foot to the attack, Yevhenii Romanov said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the north of Kharkiv region, the Russians attack on everything that has wheels, but for their equipment and infantry it is a road at one end.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/01/broni-ne-mayut-abo-hovayut-na-harkivshhyni-vorozhi-pihotynczi-vypravdovuyut-svoyu-nazvu/	2024-11-01T08:51:52-07:00

M1A1 Abrams Weapons of Victory: Uranium Shells, Gas Turbine Engine and British Armor: American Tank ...	In the 1970s, the US began developing a new main battle tank to replace the aging M60 Patton tanks. The result of this work was the M1 Abrams, which was accepted for service in 1980. Named after General Creighton Abrams, a commander during the Vietnam War, the M1 tank featured the use of composite armor (Chobham), high mobility thanks to a gas turbine engine, and the 105 mm M68A1 gun. To reduce the risks, it was decided to develop a tank according to the classic scheme with a crew of 4 and a high ballistic cannon as the main armament. Several armament options were considered: the M68 105 mm rifled gun, the British 110 mm gun and the German 120 mm smoothbore gun. The 110 mm option was rejected and the 120 mm was considered risky, leaving the 105 mm gun with the option of replacing it with a 120 mm later. During the development of the prototypes, the two companies were guided by the following basic requirements: The hull and turret of the M1A1 Abrams tank are of welded construction. The main material for the outer armor is MIL-A-11356 steel. The front parts of the hull and turret, as well as the side parts of the turret, use multi-layer armor based on the English Chobham armor. The upper front part of the case is a 50 mm steel plate. The main characteristics of the reservation: An important safety element is the presence of knockout panels, which allow to prevent an explosion in the event of an ammunition fire. Some tank modifications are also equipped with the Softkill active defense system to counter guided anti-tank missiles. Since 1985, Abrams tanks have been armed with the 120mm M256 smoothbore gun, which uses unitary projectiles with a partially incendiary case, including armor-piercing subcaliber and cumulative rounds. Due to the large diameter of the cartridges, the M1A1 ammunition was reduced to 40 rounds. Additional armament includes a 7.62 mm M240 machine gun mounted with the gun, another such machine gun near the loader hatch, and a 12.7 mm M2 machine gun on the commander's turret. The tank is also equipped with smoke grenade launchers for setting up a smoke screen. M1A1s were first used in combat during Operation Desert Storm. More than 1,800 tanks were used in the campaign to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi occupation, including 594 M1A1HA tanks and 1,178 M1A1s. The Iraqi army had about 1,000 T-72 tanks. Abrams tanks had significant advantages due to a modern sighting system, better crew training and the use of uranium ammunition. On February 26, in a battle with the Iraqi Tauvahalna division, Abrams tanks destroyed 24 T-72s, losing only 4 of their own. In the Iraq war, Abrams tanks were also actively used, but the style of their use was significantly different from the previous conflict. During the first month of fighting, 151 tanks were damaged and 2 were destroyed. By February 2005, 70% of the Abrams tanks in Iraq were damaged, of which 80 were beyond repair. In 2011, a tank company (14 vehicles) of the 1st Tank Battalion of the US Marines was deployed to Afghanistan. Tanks were used to detect the enemy, but their use was episodic due to the terrain. During the war against the terrorists of the Islamic State, 140 M1A1 tanks were given to the Iraqi army, but by the end of 2014 only 40 remained in service. And in June 2018, the Iraqis began to replace them with Russian T-90s. Ukrainian tankers especially note a number of advantages of Abrams: these are high-quality thermal imaging sights, accuracy of fire, maneuverability and reliable stabilization of the gun. Despite the considerable weight of more than 60 tons, this tank demonstrates excellent maneuverability on the battlefield. Thanks to its capabilities, Abrams effectively destroys enemy equipment and infantry, constantly adapting to the new conditions of modern warfare. In the story on the Army TV channel, the Abrams crew of the 47th Mechanized of the brigade recalls a case when they had to finish off an enemy T-62 after it was disabled by an FPV drone. This is a clear example of synergy between different types of weapons on the battlefield. Tankers note the lack of additional armor in some critical areas among the shortcomings of the tank. However, these nuances do not reduce its combat capabilities, which is demonstrated in successful operations.

-Four friends came to our unit, still serve together-: new recruiting opportunities and experience o...	Currently, this system is being worked out in many brigades, so the mechanisms of interaction between military units and TCC and SP are being honed. ArmyInform correspondents asked servicemen of the recruiting group whether the mobilization process has become easier and what opportunities volunteers have 46 separate airmobile brigade of the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. For volunteers who decided to mobilize directly through a specific military unit, there are currently two options: — come on the PPD, write a statement about the desire to serve in a specific brigade. After that, a referral to the VLK is issued to determine fitness for service. In the case of a positive conclusion, psychological tests follow, and then the processing of documents begins. For this, it is necessary to request a personal file from the TCC, but the procedure for issuing it is not yet fully worked out, the 46th brigade explains. — if a person cannot come to the PPD, he communicates with the recruiters of the brigade, who provide a sample application. The volunteer signs it, sends a scan and the original by mail. After that, a referral is made, which is transferred to the TCC for the place where the person wants to undergo the VLK. The person must pass it within the specified time. -According to the TCC procedure, the team must be informed that the volunteer has completed the VLC and send a conclusion. We already have the first person who went through this scheme, but we did not wait for the conclusion, he called and informed himself,- — says the head of the freelance recruiting group, Lieutenant Oleksandra Unknown. The TCC must also provide a list of names, according to which the mobilized person will come to the brigade, and a military ID (if he is a soldier or a sergeant). — The brigade does not issue military tickets, and without them we have no right to send a person to the BZVP. And according to the new law, after arrival and registration within three days, we must send him to study. And if a person does not have a military ticket, he will not be accepted there. And the TCC says that we do not know such a procedure. While this is a problem, — explains Oleksandra Nevydima. At the same time, a military unit can itself turn to the nearest TCC with a request to issue a military card for a specific person , who expressed a desire to serve. — This system is interesting and can help increase mobilization. It is only necessary to work out the algorithm of cooperation with the TCC. Then it will make our work easier, and people will not be afraid that even with the attitude they may not get into the chosen brigade and unit, - adds the recruiting group of the 46th brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the 46th brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, they emphasize that currently the majority of new arrivals are those people who come through the recruiting system. Young people choose the specialties of UAV operators, scouts, anti-aircraft gunners or communications 8217; porters. People aged 35-45 already choose more according to their civilian specialty and experience, for example, drivers of heavy equipment, repairmen. — We had a company of four friends from Dobropill , who came together and still serve together. For us, this is only a plus. This is already a well-formed team that understands each other in half a word. They came to the TCC with our relations, we talked to the TCC and said that these four guys should get to us, — recalls Oleksandr Nevidim. She emphasizes that recruiters never promise candidates a position if it doesn't exist. Moreover, there are always back-up options, if the position is filled while the person undergoes the BZVP, this sometimes happens. They also offer an alternative if there are no positions that the candidate is interested in. — We do not hide that the brigade is conducting combat operations in the Kurakhiv direction, this is already known to everyone. A person who knows what he is going for is more motivated. When recruiting began, all units said that people come more motivated, learn better and ultimately serve better, — explain the recruiters. In 46 brigades of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are convinced that one of the effective ways to attract volunteers is to inform about the combat path of the military unit. It is for this purpose that a documentary series is currently being filmed about all the key events in which the brigade participated. Five series have already been released, work on the sixth is underway. — A year ago, on the Day of Airborne Assault Troops, the idea arose to shoot a documentary series. The first series was devoted to the Makarov operation, where three battalion tactical groups of the 95th brigade were involved. From there, the birth of the 46th brigade began — on April 5, 2022, it was these 3 BTGr that formed the basis of the brigade, — says the head of the communications department of the 46th OAeMBr, Lieutenant Oleksandr Nevidimy. The series also tells about the coordination of the brigade, the long operation in the Kherson region and its liberation, and then about the battles in the East — in Bakhmut and Soledar. Work is currently underway on a new episode about the brigade's participation in the Zaporozhye counteroffensive in 2023. — Our fourth battalion broke through defense of the enemy at Robotyn, and the then battalion commander Oleg Dmytrouk was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine for this operation. We tell you how it really was at the level of our brigade. And so that the enemy does not tell it in his own way and does not distort it, - explains Oleksandr Nevymidy. A well-known Ukrainian producer helps the paratroopers of the 46th brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to create the series Ihor Kondratyuk. — No one from the military offered me this. I liked the idea. This is a young brigade, and if we do not write its history, then the Russians can write it. It helps awareness one hundred percent. People who are currently considering whether to join the military can see real servicemen, sergeants, officers, commands, how the brigade structure works. Such awareness must be there. Reports from the brigades — are important stories for mobilization. To choose a brigade, you need to know it at least a little from the inside, — he notes. Recently, the 46th Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine organized a two-day intensive for civilians. It is also part of the unit's recruiting campaign. Participants received all the necessary equipment. Among them were volunteers, wives of the dead and missing, as well as ordinary civilians who understand that war affects everyone. More you can read about this intensive in the ArmiyaInform report. We also remind you of the opportunity to use aggregator of vacancies in ZSU on our website.

As established by investigators from Vox Ukraine, it is a podcast of Spanish, not Colombian journalist Juan Luis Sanchez. In addition, the Russians faked the recording, because the Spanish media elDiario.es, where this journalist works, did not publish it. A separate search for keywords from the heading -Military conflicts around the world - Ukraine, Israel, Korea- (-Conflictos militares en todo el mundo Ukraina, Israel, Corea-) also did not yield results. According to Article 47 of the Additional Protocol 1 to the Geneva Convention, foreign citizens who officially fight in the armed forces of one or another party conflict, are not mercenaries. Therefore, all foreigners who serve in the ranks of the Defense Forces sign a contract, are considered combatants and have the full status of military personnel, not -mercenaries-. Similar fakes, as we have repeatedly emphasized, are aimed at cultivating a negative image of our country in the world and discrediting the military units of the Armed Forces in which they serve volunteers are citizens of other countries.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/01/kolumbijskyj-podkast-vyyavyvsya-ispanskym-rosiyany-rozganyayut-chergovyj-fejk-pro-dobrovolcziv/	2024-10-31T21:04:53-07:00
The occupation authorities carry out the systematic militarization of Ukrainian children at the TOT	Russia popularizes militarization as -military applied sports- and the way to a -healthy and safe lifestyle.- It turns Ukrainian children into objects of propaganda. Conducting such -schools- violates children's right to a peaceful childhood and prepares them to participate in the war against Ukraine. I would like to emphasize that the involvement of children in hostilities is contrary to the Geneva Convention for the Protection of the Civilian Population in Time of War and Additional Protocol I, which expressly prohibit the use of children in war. In addition, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court defines the recruitment and use of children in an international armed conflict as a war crime. However, the Russian occupation authorities disregard these norms, using children in the interests of their regime since the beginning of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation in 2014. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that on TOT a new batch of construction workers arrived from Belarus.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/31/okupaczijna-vlada-provodyt-systemnu-militaryzacziyu-ukrayinskyh-ditej-na-tot/	2024-10-31T12:54:13-07:00
The occupiers announced the construction of a new plant in Mariupol	Mariupol City Council informs about this. Here's the truth, the invaders have also been promising to restore the work of the existing steel mills for almost three years. According to the occupier, some -small industries- will also be restored. It is not clear what exactly it is about.

The European Commission presented a report on Europe's readiness to respond to crises	About this informs the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The document, along with the economic report of M. Draghi (Prime Minister of Italy in 2021-2022) on European competitiveness is part of the strategy of U. von der Leyen to strengthen the strategic capabilities of the EU and the role of the European Commission. The report emphasizes that the world is facing a new reality and focuses on Russian aggression against Ukraine, the pandemic and climate change. This requires changes in policy approaches and security measures from the EU countries. S. Niynisto states that today the EU's ability to respond to threats is slowed down by -institutional, legal and political limitations that make it difficult to quickly unite the relevant actors to manage the crisis.- The main proposals: creating the EU's own common defense treaty to provide assistance to one of the member states in the event of external aggression. The document should supplement NATO's collective security mechanism; endowment of the EC with broad functions in the field of defense and reorientation of 20% of the EU budget to security needs; creating within the EC a central hub for coordination between different sectors and increasing situational awareness; expansion of the powers of the Intelligence and Situation Center (EU INTCEN), including the collection of intelligence with the help of EU diplomatic missions and the conduct of counterintelligence operations; increasing military support to Ukraine to offset US aid in the event of a reduction. It was emphasized that the European Peace Fund, as a quick extra-budgetary instrument, should be provided with sufficient resources. At the same time, the document emphasizes the need to promote the integration of the Ukrainian defense industry into the defense industry of the European Union.

There was a case: we approached the village, gave the coordinates and waited for instructions. The voices of our two opponents were heard. It so happened that we were ambushed on the way. They did not agree to lay down their arms, so they transformed into another life. Next, we found the house where the -Akhmatovs- were. We had a fight there, not everything went according to plan, they ran away. We got a good foothold there, took control of the positions and led our boys. They did a good job,- adds the defender. Anton recently received the medal -For Military Service to Ukraine- from the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, for numerous successful combat missions and exemplary service. -For me, this award is proof that we are going in the right direction.

About the help of the army, mobilization, hate from Russian bots and family matters. Interview with ...	This was discussed in first part interview. Today is the final part of the conversation. - I would like to talk about this. In your streams, you constantly invite your viewers to help the army, including financially. Aren't our people tired of helping the army? - Absolutely not! I have never positioned myself as a volunteer. And I want to emphasize this. Because, with certain exceptions, and it was literally several times, I try not to collect anything on my map. And my principle in this case is very simple. Since I am not a volunteer, I do not plan to solve any strategic tasks there. There are people, we have giant funds, they solve complex approaches. Even certain weapons systems are introduced with public money, and then they are already purchased in large batches from manufacturers by the Ministry of Defense. My approach as a citizen is to help our army on a daily basis. When, let's say, I carol at people, it is primarily in the interests of certain departments. I actually have only one rule: these should be people who really defend the Motherland with weapons in their hands, who are really at war. Because the army is big. If these are our fighters in the Kursk region or Donetsk region, of course, we need to help, help, help! And from the meetings that I sometimes organize, I see: why should anyone get tired of this. A lot of donations are sent from abroad. And it is clear from the surnames that these are not only people with Ukrainian roots. A lot of money is sent to Israel, from the USA, Canada, and the Baltic States. There are also many of them in Ukraine, in particular in Kyiv. Therefore, the people are ready to invest in their security. And this, it seems to me, is an absolutely undeniable thing. - And how do you feel about hate, or twisting of true facts in the comments to your videos? - I wouldn't say that I cover it a lot there. Well, they actually show how those Putin bots react, that this is all a -team game- for them. For example, when there were fights for Vugledar, no matter what I said, a bunch of comments from haters were of the same type: -but our Uglidar.- If you just treat it like an ordinary person, then you understand that this is your job. Well, since recently. For example, when it was decided that the meeting in Ramstein at the level of the heads of state of the anti-Putin coalition would simply be postponed because of hurricanes in the USA. Before this topic, I saw the same type of messages that -even a hurricane is on the side of Russia, you were fired, you were abandoned- and so on. Although everyone perfectly understands that all necessary decisions from the military and military-technical aspect may not be as fast as we would like, but they are all being adopted. And Biden wants, on the contrary, to say it himself, those messages. And when they write that -Biden is not going, but Biden abandoned you-, it's even a little funny, because the bots write everything the same. They, our enemies, told us about this 10 years ago, and they are telling us now. And there is no way they can understand that Ukraine was, is and will be. Therefore, I simply do not pay attention to such attacks. Well, my mother corresponds with such a category of people, trying to prove something to them. And I say: if you do not know this person personally, then there is no point in entering into a conversation with him. —From political and public issues, let's move, if you don't mind, to a personal question. Not only the physical enemy occupation, but also the war itself separated hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian families: men were in Ukraine, women and children were forced to live abroad. This happened to you too. That you miss your family is understandable. Nevertheless, what changes and transformations are taking place in your family? - I don't think that my story is any different from others. This is a test. Our family has complete understanding in such a situation. And it still seems to me that if there is an ability not to hear air alarms and, accordingly, not to live in the risks in which we live, then children should be saved from this. I, of course, have a longing for them. They are growing up, but in fact they do not see their father as often as they would like. There, abroad, they master two languages. Foreign I notice that their Ukrainian is not as fluent as before. But many people have even worse conditions for dating, for personal communication than I do. It is clear that conscripted men are not allowed to travel abroad, because everyone is obliged to defend the state, be registered and, if necessary, join the army. What about the children? We have so many destroyed settlements. It is better for them to grow up in Europe than to fall into Russian captivity, like the children of Mariupol, for example. Therefore, the situation is complicated, there are many uncertainties. I think we should each do our own thing. Children should grow, learn, and we should defend our country. It is clear that not everyone will return from forced evacuation, from emigration. And this should also be said directly. It is clear that the demographic situation in general will be the number one issue in Ukraine. But it is equally clear that many will want to return after the war, if they have somewhere to return to. Because many simply have nowhere to go. Upon their return, they will have a completely different level of requirements for school, for their city, and many, many other things. I actually understand the risks, I'm not sure there's any point in talking about it right now because the underlying issue isn't resolved. The basic issue is security, it's a war that's still going on. Well, we are now in Kyiv, there are many children here, many have not left, many are here. This is a personal decision. Criticize, suggest: no one knows how to do the right thing unequivocally. When you don't know how to act, act as you see fit. But I'm optimistic: many people will still come back here. Because, first of all, it's great to live here in Ukraine. What's most upsetting us here right now? War! And if we take away the factors of war, then, of course, not everything is as perfectly organized here as in many European states. But our compatriots will come here with new knowledge, with new acquaintances, with a new vision of the world, knowledge of languages, etc. — Following this personal thread. During a previous meeting in our editorial office, touching on the topic of your family, you said that your wife is a role model for you, but she has one flaw: a foreigner's passport. After all, like your children, you brought your beloved wife to Ukraine after a long business trip from Moscow. Has it been possible to solve this -documentary- problem? - Not yet, but we have done a lot for this and have taken a big step towards it. About a month ago, I attended an interview at the Security Service of Ukraine, which was conducted by officers of the counterintelligence department. And I think that everything will be as it should be, regarding the wife's acquisition of Ukrainian citizenship. Of course, there are some legal issues involved. The attitude of the Ukrainian state and the majority of our people to the holders of Russian passports during the war is understandable. My approach: you need to look at what a person actually does, not at his passport. There are people who use Russian passports to fight for Ukraine. And to immediately understand who is a rogue, a spy or an -exiled Cossack-, there are special services in this state for this. I am confident that everything will be fine for my family. - Now the topic of mobilization is perhaps the most discussed in our society. You are a media person, you constantly communicate with our fighters from the front line, organize help for them. But you also know the opinions of civilians about joining the Defense Forces. Is there any transformation taking place here in people's awareness of the need to defend the Motherland? - It is clear that during the war, the first-line soldier is the greatest treasure of the state. That is, being a rifleman in the first division of the first platoon of the first company of the first battalion of any mechanized brigade is the most difficult, the safest. These are just realities. And service in the army can also be very different. But still the most dangerous thing is what is called infantry, on which everything rests. No matter what anyone says, no matter how many drones there are, if there is no Ukrainian soldier, then they, the occupiers, will go on, on and on. So there are two aspects here, maybe even more. In my opinion, the most important thing is that the state should be sincere with its citizens. If the President says that we have a plan for victory, there are points that are addressed to partners, then they should tell us that in order to achieve this, exactly what efforts should be made on the part of the citizens of Ukraine. Because, on the one hand, we hear from high-ranking officials that everything is fine with mobilization, but there are other opinions on this matter. And no one cancels the obligation. And that's what mobilization is all about. We even have some deputies with scythes in the Rada, they say: we are against violent mobilization. So, I would like to tell these stupid populists that mobilization is already coercion. The word is violent, it is so colored. Some parliamentarians say that, as they say, we think about Ukrainians, but the rest - the generals, the president, the chief of the general staff - do not. Such things should simply be cut off and broadcast the thesis that everyone should be registered and ready to be drafted into the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I am well aware of this and am registered with the TCC. I know that you are also standing. — As a video blogger, you are classified as an -opinion leader-. Roman Tsymbalyuk was one of the first in Ukraine to become a -millionaire YouTuber- by the number of subscribers. For this, the popular social network has a special award - the -golden button-. Did you get it? - Yes, this is the only thing I lack for complete happiness (laughs - Author). Two things, to be exact: victory in the war and the golden button. -Golden buttons- are currently not sent to Ukraine. On this popular video platform, they believe that we are in a military conflict zone. And that's why I don't physically have a -golden button- from YouTube. — So in the YouTube office, they associate such attention to your channel with Russian aggression? And in general, do you notice any decrease in the audience's interest in your page on this popular video hosting? Is there any personal secret to expanding the audience? - I think it's all about the content that the author makes. And in my case regarding the audience, the number of views, it's always this kind of multidirectionality in the graphs, -up and down-. That is, the audience in terms of the number of subscribers and views changes periodically, and you yourself need to change. This is YouTube, this platform is quite competitive. Many new authors appear. If there is no competitive television for the most part now, all the viewers have gone to YouTube. And if there is a desire to somehow keep your viewer so that he does not forget about you, then you have to work every day. And I work every day without a day off. And the main secret is that I just love this job. And specific surges of viewer interest are observed when significant events occur in domestic politics or in the international arena. But, I repeat, you have to work every day. Since 2022, since the beginning of the large-scale Russian aggression, it can be said that there is a decline in the number of views. Maybe 20 percent. And the very beginning of the war, it led to some crazy flourishing of the Ukrainian segment on YouTube. It seems to me that the rule I work by is actually not only inherent to how this particular platform works, but to life in general. The head of this organization once said: -I have only one piece of advice for authors. You should do what you love and talk about what you believe in.- If you follow this rule, even outside of YouTube, you'll be fine no matter what you do. If a person is a doctor, if a person is a soldier, if a person is a journalist, it doesn't matter. I live by this principle and it is equally good for me to look into the eyes of a specific person, my viewer, any audience. Because I do not change my opinion about what Ukraine was, is and will be!	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/31/pro-dopomogu-armiyi-mobilizacziyu-hejt-vid-rosijskyh-botiv-ta-spravy-simejni-intervyu-z-romanom-czymbalyukom/	2024-10-30T21:58:09-07:00
- It is important not to -philonit-, but to get the most from the instructors-. Mobilization, traini...	Now he is a junior sergeant, commander of the unmanned aerial vehicle division in the ranks of the 128th separate mountain assault brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Higher education, specialist diploma with honors in the field of IT. He is 31 years old. Before joining the army, he worked in real estate. After the large-scale invasion, he recalls, the field in which he worked somewhat -dimmed-. -There was no desire to sit and wait for an unknown amount of time. There was no certainty about tomorrow. There was no income for a month or one and a half. I came to our territorial defense, they promised to call me, but I never received a call,- the man recalls. That's how Roman found himself in the field of landscape design - he became a project manager. And once his team was offered to work with a facility in Transcarpathia. It was in May 2023. -To be honest, my colleagues were afraid to go there, but there was no way out. And when we were driving on the Torun Pass, we were stopped at a roadblock: the police checked the documents, and the representative of the TCC, after several clarifying questions, wanted us to move with him to clarify all the credentials. The next day I was already in Rivne at the training ground. There was no opportunity to get together, change clothes, grab something from home, everything happened somewhat spontaneously,- Roman recalls. Next came basic military training and leadership courses. We ask a military man what his impressions of BZVP are. -It's all individual. It doesn't matter what kind of training. What matters is that it exists. It is important to get the most out of what the instructors give you. It is important not to -philonit-, to turn on creativity sometimes in order to learn something and not to die in the first days on the battlefield. Maybe I'm wrong, but it's all very individual.- After that, he was assigned to the 128th separate mountain assault brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -I really didn't know until the end where I wanted to go and where I saw myself. At first I decided to go for a stormtrooper. We studied battle strategy, how to properly enter enemy trenches, etc. But then a person came to us who, according to certain criteria, selected people for the UAV unit. Two people were taken from us, the rest of the guys went to the fire support company. After that, we went directly to the site of hostilities - to the area occupied by our brigade.- Roman began training - first he mastered one type of drones, then he took up shock UAVs. It was already September 2023. During one of the combat missions, Roman eliminated the enemy's ammunition warehouse with two drops from a drone. We ask you to recall this case, but, he says, the crew sometimes does not even know that they are working on an enemy composition from BC. -We simply drop on specific targets that are pre-announced to us by operatives on duty or higher commanders. And then we see detonations, which give us the understanding that somewhere there was some BC&#8230; At first we threw it off - and then we already understand that we hit something fat and such joy overflows&#8230; And we understand that we are also contributing to the future victory.- In general, there are several crews in Roman's unit, which alternate among themselves, going on combat sorties. The longest such trip lasted 9 days. Roman also remembers the most delicious exercise: -We saw the enemy's equipment through the thermal imaging camera, which had recently been silenced&#8230; And we began to kill them with resets: we saw how they detonated, caught fire, burned! I can't say exactly the equivalent in terms of money, but it was definitely some BMP that brought the crew of their infantrymen to the assault.- Recently, Roman's crew came under fire. There were losses, Roman received a concussion. He says this is one of the hardest moments: losing colleagues. -I was always afraid of forgetting the algorithm of first aid, the sequence of actions when my brothers were injured. We pulled into the position, started to deploy, I was adjusting everything in the shelter&#8230; And the shelling began. When I came out of the shelter and saw what I saw, that was probably the most difficult thing: surviving that moment. Because there was no one to provide first aid.- The novel states: fear does not disappear from being in the area of ​​hostilities. -Yes, working for several days in a row, you get used to it to a certain extent and you begin to treat it somewhat easier morally. But the security measures we use come first. I think for myself and my staff. Therefore, I emphasize and repeat: for me, safety measures are in the first place. If I see some area where we can't pass because we might -burn- somewhere there, then I won't go, I'll just argue to the command that we weren't ready to take the risk. And in our country, by the way, the command is very loyal to this,- says the military man. He recalls that in the unit there were cases when people were lost. -And we drew certain conclusions from that. And we understand that we don't want to say goodbye to each other. And we are all well aware that we can wait literally 20 minutes and drive in safer conditions than risk it. Safety measures should not be taken lightly.- The novel advises civilians who, for various reasons, have not yet joined the ranks of the Defense Forces, to start studying the units that are actively participating in hostilities and to decide for themselves where they can go to serve. -It's mostly the fear of the unknown that can stop a person. And everyone is now terrified, afraid of any contact with the army, etc. But everyone had enough time to make a decision for themselves. If not ready to fight, there are other ways to be useful to the Defense Forces. You just have to put some effort into it.- In the end, we ask a military man what for him will be victory in the Russian-Ukrainian war. -Many moments affect the awareness and understanding of what victory is. For me, victory is when I come back. When I am demobilized. When there will be all the conditions for this. And when planes will be able to fly again in the peaceful skies of Ukraine. No matter how banal and childish it sounds.- Photo is from the personal archive of a serviceman	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/31/vazhlyvo-ne-filonyty-a-braty-maksymum-vid-instruktoriv-mobilizacziya-navchannya-i-vijna-komandyra-viddilennya-bpla-u-128-ogshbr/	2024-10-30T21:40:39-07:00
The time for modernization has passed: how Japan will improve its main battle tanks	Within announced By the Ministry of Defense of Japan in a profile document on procurement for the modernization of the fleet of Type 10 tanks, the agency of the -Land of the Rising Sun- formed specific technical tasks and stages of modernization of its main battle tanks, ArmiyaInform reports. According to the authors of the Army Recognition portal, who studied the aforementioned documents in detail, the Type 10 Hitomaru tank modernization program, created by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and adopted for service in 2012, is aimed at strengthening the protection of tanks against current threats such as guided munitions and UAVs, including FPV drones. and ammunition drop systems. The technical goals of this update include improved protection against anti-tank weapons and drones, which are increasingly common in today's combat scenarios. According to information provided by the Defense Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Agency (ATLA) of the Ministry of Defense, three active defense systems were selected for evaluation: Rafael's Trophy and Elbit's Iron Fist from Israeli manufacturers and Rheinmetall's Strike Shield from German tank builders. These systems were selected based on specific criteria, including topside threat protection, 360° interception capabilities, and a total weight of less than 1,000 kg. At the same time, Japan's Ministry of Defense also decided to test the Kongsberg RS6 remote module equipped with a 30 mm cannon. It is expected that this module will be integrated into an active defense system and will have sensors capable of detecting high-speed objects, including UAVs. The purpose of such an innovation is to increase the ability of Type 10 tanks to face air threats, while providing effective protection against ground risks. While the exact number of Type 10 Hitomaru battleships to be upgraded has not yet been disclosed, Japan plans to purchase approximately 300 RS6 modules, which will be produced domestically at a rate of 10 units per year. In addition, the Far Eastern country continues to produce new Type 10 tanks, and in 2025 there are plans to order 12 more vehicles to increase the total number to 148 units. Ultimately, around 300 tanks of this type are expected to be produced. The Ministry of Defense is also considering the development of additional protection modules that could be installed on the Type 10 tanks. The combat vehicles will be designed with modularity in mind and will be able to install new systems directly from the factory, facilitating the integration of advanced technologies. In a broader context, official Tokyo continues to strengthen its defense capabilities, including the production of new Patria armored personnel carriers (about which our agency told in previous materials) for the Ground Self-Defense Forces of Japan, made on the island of Hokkaido. This initiative underscores the importance Japan attaches to modernizing its military forces in response to rapidly evolving global threats. Japanese Type 10 Hitomaru main battle tank.

Putin chauvinists put up imaginary posters in Kyiv: why is this the enemy	Quite unexpectedly, this slogan was mentioned again. This time in Kyiv. The so-called pro-Russian -resistance of the NOD-, which exists only in the sick imagination of chauvinists-Putinists, put up 1000 posters in the Ukrainian capital with this slogan and a portrait of a bunker rat. Naturally, no one has ever seen these posters, as well as -NOD partisans-, except for enemy telegram channels and other propaganda resources. But for fakers, this is not a problem. They took a photo of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra from an article in the Ukrainian media and pasted Putin posters on it in a photo editor. Locations in other photos and videos distributed by the Russians cannot be identified at all. There is no reason to claim that such postcards could have appeared in Kyiv and Ukraine in general. Most likely, this is a production whose purpose is to show that at least someone in Ukraine is -waiting- for Putin and does not perceive him as an aggressor.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/31/shovinisty-putinczi-rozkleyily-u-kyyevi-uyavni-plakaty-navishho-cze-vorogu/	2024-10-30T21:01:25-07:00

From a swarm of drones to a robot dog: Brave1 tests new capabilities for the Armed Forces	This was reported by the Deputy Prime Minister for Innovation, Development of Education, Science and Technology. Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine Mykhailo Fedorov. In view of the dynamic situation at the front, the military needs new solutions to strengthen defenses and stop the advance of the enemy. Drone swarm is one of the technologies being tested. It is a system that allows a single pilot to control an entire group of drones. By working in a group, drones can perform missions autonomously. During the tests, it was demonstrated how a swarm of drones coordinate their actions and perform operations together with robots. The next technology was guided munitions, which hit the target with high accuracy. They are automatically guided to the target and adjust their flight, which significantly increases the effectiveness of bomber drones in combat operations. Another important innovation was the robot-dog, a technology that is already actively used in military operations in the United States. The robot is capable of carrying out logistics and reconnaissance tasks in various weather conditions and landscapes. It can travel up to 10 kilometers on a single charge. Brave1 is already in talks with an American company to to ensure the introduction of dog robots in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. These technologies demonstrate high results and can significantly increase the capabilities of the Ukrainian army on the battlefield. As reported by ArmyInform, in Brave1 already has more than 2800 defense developments, most of which appeared after 2022.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/30/vid-royu-droniv-do-robota-psa-brave1-testuye-novi-mozhlyvosti-dlya-zsu/	2024-10-30T07:53:40-07:00

The occupying power is faceless: the Kremlin closes access to data on officials -LNR-	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, head of the Luhansk OVA. In addition, restrictions on access to information about the socio-economic status of the occupied territories, where a catastrophic budget deficit is observed, have already been introduced. The propaganda about the economic development of these regions, which the Russians had been spreading for decades, began to lose its effect when people saw the real numbers. It is these data that are planned to be classified. Access to the personal data of officials and security forces will also be restricted due to the fact that many Russians refuse to go to leadership positions in the -LNR- due to the high death rate among the occupation authorities. From November 21, residents of the -LNR- will be deprived of Russian citizenship if they do not take the oath. The law, which will take effect next month, invalidates all previous citizenship decisions. Those who do not swear an oath to the aggressor country by the specified deadline will be considered as never having Russian citizenship.

Deadly Hypervelocity Shield: The US military is developing a program to counter hypersonic weapons	As highlighted in a release posted on Northrop Grumman's official portal, this innovative defense system should be the first of its kind, specially designed to neutralize hypersonic threats, which are becoming more and more influential in modern conflicts, ArmyInform reports. The American firm noted that, in close cooperation with MDA, the three-year development phase of this project led by Northrop Grumman led to the creation of an individual solution aimed at countering current and new capabilities of hypersonic missiles. GPI represents a significant technological leap in missile defense with significant potential to play a key role in future conflict scenarios. Experts of the defense site Army Recognition learned some details and said that as the program moves into the next phase of development, Northrop Grumman will focus on several critical aspects. First, the company will continue to refine the previous GPI design to enable it to be deployed against ballistic missiles on US Navy destroyers, as well as the land-based Aegis Ashore system, using a standard vertical launch system. Next, Northrop Grumman will focus on demonstrating the interceptor's performance in hypersonic environments before moving on to a preliminary design analysis. In addition, the company plans to conduct early flight tests of interceptor missiles, relying on its proven test technologies. Finally, the use of advanced digital engineering techniques will streamline the design process and accelerate the development of interceptor capabilities. Wendy Williams, vice president and general manager of Northrop Grumman's launch and missile defense division, emphasized the strategic importance of the GPI program. -GPI provides warfighters with critical engagement capabilities in situations where distance provides a tactical advantage. Our solution adapts well to meet a variety of operational needs and is designed to succeed in an ever-changing threat environment,- said Williams. The GPI design includes advanced technologies such as scanning equipment for accurate threat tracking and the ability to use hit-to-kill technology (technology to intercept and destroy enemy missiles with kinetic weapons). Experts said that in the competition for the contract to develop the anti-hypersonic weapons program with Northrop, it won over such a serious competitor as the corporation RTX. The two firms were awarded a preliminary contract to develop the GPI in June 2022 after eliminating another competitor, Lockheed Martin. In addition to fulfilling its obligations to MDA, Northrop Grumman will work closely with the Japanese Ministry of Defense as part of a joint GPI development program. This partnership aims to provide interceptors that will enhance the defense capabilities of both countries against hypersonic threats. Northrop Grumman provides comprehensive solutions to defeat enemy missiles.

A philosopher with a weapon in his hands: a locksmith - Plato - told about the battles in the Pokrov...	-Plato- comes from Kyiv and is a philosopher by education. According to the man, this science helps him in the army, as the result of thinking becomes broader, thanks to this, it is possible to take into account a large number of factors that are happening now, and it helps to make quick decisions. — In the discussion, the truth is born, or something like that, and therefore there are many points of view and there are other points where they all coincide. And it is during communication and dialogue that these points are found, and this communication is called philosophizing, Plato said. He entered the army in 2023, when a summons came to his home. While still studying at the university, he graduated from the military department, so he was a reserve officer. — I have many acquaintances who have participated in ATO since 2014. They say, if the summons comes, we know you're ready, if we can, we'll serve together. And I listened to their advice and it so happened that a summons came, and I went to the Military Commissariat without hesitation, - said Platon. However, he did not manage to get into the service of his comrades. At the same time, the man did not think long about his future call sign. After all, it is worth reminding that Plato is a philosopher by education, so he chose his nickname in honor of the ancient Greek thinker of the same name. In the TCC, Platon was informed that the 401st separate rifle battalion was being formed, in which he later became a platoon commander. For several months, combat training of recruits took place near Kyiv, where there were classes in tactical medicine, fire and tactical training. — In principle, the preparation was good, and thanks to it, we were able to hold out quite well for a while, but the advantage of the enemy's strength sometimes does not give us a chance, unfortunately, said Platon. At the same time, the military man said that in the army, in addition to direct combat operations and work -at zero-, there is quite a lot of work with documents, which requires a lot of time. Plato believes that in the current situation, quality training of soldiers should be a priority, because they have to learn something new literally every day. — Because there is no pattern that can be followed in every situation. Because the situation changes every day, maybe every hour, every half hour. Factors can always be different. They may coincide, but the situation is different. There is nothing here that we did here a week ago and we will do it now. Not a fact that it will work. And war changes very quickly, he said. Already at the beginning of June, Platon went to the Bakhmut direction, namely to the Andriivka village area. They took part in battles together with other units. According to his recollections, enemy artillery, mortars and tanks were mostly working there. — Shooting battles, of course, also took place, but mostly it was a defeat at a distance. And it was felt that the enemy had more iron than we did. When I was in the position, I tell everyone, I had nightmares about -Cornflower- for four days. It's just dawning, a drone flies in, hovers, flies away. And we hear it there, pooh-pooh-pooh-pooh-pooh-pooh-pooh-pooh. And we know that they have crept up to us, said Plato. At that time, the shelling was so constant that they did not even raise their heads from the trench, and when there was a minimal lull, they immediately took up the shovel and dug in. Plato clarified that it doesn't matter what rank and position you have on the front line - everyone works. The man took part in defensive operations in the Andriivka region, and was also engaged in setting up positions. Bakhmut's direction in a warrior is associated with both fear and joy that all his boys survived. Later, the battalion was transferred to another area, namely to the Terny village near Liman. Plato remembered the battles in this direction with bitterness, because there the enemy behaved quite unpredictably. — They counted on one development of the situation, so I said that there is no pattern. And the situation is developing differently. You need to react quickly to it. Sometimes they made it, sometimes, unfortunately, they didn't make it, the man said. Near Terny, the battles were fought almost non-stop, the enemy tried to go to the side, and in some places even to the rear due to landings. However, the occupiers managed to be stopped and even pushed back to their former positions in some places. A month later, the soldiers were already transferred to another part of the front, because they were able to fulfill their task near Terny. At the moment, Platon, already in the role of deputy company commander, and his fighters are in the Pokrovsky direction. Platon calls the extensive use of FPV drones a feature of the battles on this part of the front. Previously, they tried to hit heavy equipment, but now they are used to hit manpower. And it does not matter whether it is a group of soldiers or a single serviceman. Therefore, the fighters continue to train new recruits, give them experience. One of the stages of training is working with drones, and not only controlling them, but also being able to distinguish Mavic and FPV by sound. — The problem here is that remote warfare is taking place, but not only with the help of artillery, but also with such means of defeat as drop and FPV. Now, in principle, the line of responsibility of our brigade has more or less stabilized, and the enemy has gone the other way, but this was achieved with a very great effort at the moment when we were somewhat led here. We are talking about Novooleksandrivka and Vozdvizhenka, because then the Russians had their main attack in that direction, towards the highway, - said Platon. Platon recalled how a column of invaders advanced to the area of ​​the village of Vozdvizhenka, but the brigade artillery worked well against them. The Russians were hit with tanks, 152 caliber artillery and D-30 howitzers. Most of the invaders became -good fertilizer- after that. According to the military, proper communication with neighboring units also contributes to successful defense. Thanks to her, the soldiers of the battalion managed to effectively restrain the enemy's offensive. Platon, in the role of deputy company commander, is engaged in building an effective management system, and also tries to maintain a positive atmosphere in his team. At the moment, his battalion has fully entered the structure of the 110th separate mechanized brigade. - First of all, there should be a correct division of functions so that a person is not given tasks that he cannot perform for some reason. This is the key point. Secondly, there are mistakes that it seems that a person knows something, I put him in a workplace, and then I see that he is not suitable for this work. It is necessary to change the task for her, Plato said. There is quite a lot of work in his mouth, so Plato does not manage to get a full night's sleep, but sometimes he finds a free hour in the middle of the day to, as he says, -lie down with his eyes closed.- After our victory, Platon wants to meet his friends and have a nice rest, and also get a cat.

From head to toe: the Russian Federation disperses a fake about the conversation of Oleksandr Syrsky...	In the conversation that actually took place, the commanders discussed the current situation at the front and the organization of Ukraine's defense in certain areas. As well as the possibility of hitting military facilities deep into Russian territory. According to Syrskyi, the British side is working on its own proposals as part of the practical implementation of the Victory Plan, which indeed contains a clause about long-range strikes on the territory of the Russian Federation. In particular, Ukraine wants its partners to lift restrictions on the use of long-range Western weapons. However, Russian propaganda has turned everything upside down by spreading fake news that Great Britain is participating in military operations against the Russian Federation. Such -throwbacks- have become more frequent recently. The Russians constantly try to accuse Ukraine of involving servicemen from NATO countries in hostilities, and they try to discredit foreign partners in the eyes of Ukrainian society by saying that they do not want to accept our country into the Alliance. Literally last week, there was a fake rumor circulating in the news space that there were seven NATO countries against the invitation of Ukraine to the Alliance. The main task of the enemy is to demoralize Ukrainians and make them quarrel with international partners. Only in this way will they have at least some chance to impose their conditions for the end of the war.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/30/z-nig-na-golovu-rf-rozgonyaye-fejk-pro-rozmovu-oleksandra-syrskogo/	2024-10-29T21:21:16-07:00
The enemy has not created offensive groups in the South, there are no significant advances	This was announced by the spokesman of the Southern Defense Forces on the air of the telethon Edyny News Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn of Ukraine. -Currently, the enemy has not created offensive groups, according to our intelligence, but in several areas he is creating additional assault groups to conduct assault operations with small infantry forces,- the spokesman said. Vladyslav Voloshyn emphasized that in each of the directions in the South, the enemy distributes its forces according to where it is increasing its efforts, as well as where it maintains defenses. -The enemy has no significant advances. A few days ago, due to constant assault actions, the enemy wedged in a short distance, to the depth of a platoon support point near the village of Levadne. Now the Southern Defense Forces are conducting a stabilization operation to level the situation,- said Vladyslav Voloshyn. According to him, the enemy continues air strikes, uses UAVs, there are missile strikes every day, and a counter-battery fight is underway. The spokesman also noted that the vast majority of islands in the Kherson region are under fire control of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russians began to use FPV drones with a fiber optic cable, soldiers of the 128th separate mountain assault brigade of the Transcarpathia encountered them for the first time.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/vorog-ne-stvoryv-nastupalnyh-ugrupuvan-na-pivdni-znachyh-prosuvan-nemaye/	2024-10-29T12:57:24-07:00
The Defense Forces reported the appearance of unusual enemy drones in the Zaporizhzhia direction	An officer of the press service of the 128th separate mountain-assault division told about this on Army TV Major Yaroslav Halas of the Transcarpathian Brigade. -For the first time, our team encountered the fact that the Russians used FPV drones with a fiber optic cable 10 km long in the Zaporizhzhya region. In practice, we encountered them for the first time,- said Yaroslav Halas. According to him, the use of such a drone was conditionally successful for the enemy, he managed to damage the shelter. But our fighters did not leave their positions. -These drones are completely invulnerable to EW devices, as soon as our guys saw them, they tried to shoot them down with small arms. Anti-aircraft guns are effective against them. A big disadvantage of these drones is the limited range of use. Also, they are ineffective for dense urban development or dense plantings,- the spokesman said. He also said that today the enemy aviation was active with anti-aircraft missiles, unguided air missiles. There were no assaults on our positions, although they occur regularly. The defense is being probed, the Russians are looking for our weak points. -We know from intelligence reports that the enemy is gathering forces and the Russians may try to break through our defenses, but there are no prerequisites to believe that these attempts will be successful,- Yaroslav Halas added.

The enemy is trying to storm our positions in this direction. However, usually these are 2-3 fighters who cross the canal and hide,- said Anastasia Bobovnikova. She emphasized that the Russians cannot gain a foothold behind the canal there, they are quickly destroyed, and logistical routes are cut off. -The channel is under the cover of our drones and our artillery, so the enemy cannot storm it with equipment, as for this it is necessary to set up crossings, which is impossible,- explained the spokeswoman of the Luhansk OTU. Anastasia Bobovnikova also reported that the number of assaults has slightly decreased in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Luhansk- OTU, but the number of shelling from artillery and aviation has not decreased, even increased. -They understand that they cannot storm head-on in this direction, so they are trying to completely wipe out the surrounding cities. The aviation of the Russian Federation carries out 15 to 20 strikes every day, dropping at least 20 anti-aircraft missiles,- the spokeswoman added.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/otu-lugansk-okupanty-ne-zakripylysya-za-kanalom-u-chasovomu-yaru/	2024-10-29T12:09:13-07:00

NATO and EU leaders discussed the situation in Ukraine and the appearance of North Korean troops in ...	The General Staff of the Armed Forces informs about this. Their discussion focused on the importance of a close strategic partnership between NATO and the European Union. Both agreed that in an increasingly dangerous world, this partnership is vital to the protection and defense of peace, freedom and prosperity. Russia's war of aggression on European soil is the biggest threat to peace and security on the European continent. The Secretary General of NATO and the President of the European Commission emphasized that the deployment of North Korean soldiers in support of Russia's aggressive war represents a significant escalation of the war against Ukraine, as well as a serious threat to European security and global peace.

More than 130 enemy assaults per day: Russia is concentrating its efforts in two directions	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In addition, the occupiers are actively attacking in the Kupyan, Lyman and Vremiv directions. The terrorist state carried out 70 airstrikes, dropping 119 anti-aircraft missiles. The invaders also used 685 kamikaze drones for strikes and fired about 3,800 shots at the positions of our troops and populated areas. In the Kharkiv direction, Russian terrorists stormed the positions of our units in the Vovchansk region four times. Thirteen times the enemy attacked our positions on the Kupyansk direction. Near the settlements of Kolisnikivka, Sinkivka, Kruglyakivka, Pershotravnevo and Lozova, units of the Defense Forces repelled all enemy attacks. In the Lyman direction Russian troops attacked Ukrainian defenders 15 times in Grekivka, Zarichny, Terni and Torsky districts. In the Kramatorsk direction Ukrainian soldiers repelled two attempts by the invaders to advance in the Chasovoy Yar and Stupochky areas. In the Toretsk direction our troops repelled one enemy attack. In the Pokrovsky direction the aggressor attacked our positions 31 times. In the districts of Myrolyubivka, Promeny, Lysivka, Krutoy Yar, Selydovoy and Vyshnevoy, our defenders repelled all the assaults of the occupation forces.

The hottest in the Kurakhiv direction, where the invaders made 48 attempts to advance at this time of the day . The main battles are taking place near Zoryanyi, Maksimilianivka, Novodmytrivka, Katerynivka, and Antonivka. In the Vremivsk direction, the aggressor, with the support of aviation, stormed the front edge of our defense 12 times in the area of ​​Bogoyavlenka and Novoukrainka. In the Dnieper direction the enemy made two unsuccessful attempts to storm the positions of Ukrainian units. The Defense Forces of Ukraine continue the operation in the Kursk direction. Enemy aviation today carried out 28 airstrikes on Kurshchyna with the use of 39 anti-aircraft missiles. The department honored the soldiers of the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade named after Kostya Gordienko, the 38th separate marine brigade and the 425th separate assault battalion. As reported by ArmyInform, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces General Oleksandr Syrsky visited military units and units participating in the defense operation in the Zaporizhzhia region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/ponad-130-vorozhyh-shturmiv-za-dobu-rosiya-zoseredzhuye-zusyllya-na-dvoh-napryamkah/	2024-10-28T22:16:18-07:00
Microwave frying drones: the latest solution for the electronic fight against swarms of UAVs was pre...	In the official release of the developer of this high-tech equipment, the Californian company Epirus stated that the ExDECS system was designed with the Marine Corps' requirements in mind to combat the rapidly growing UAV threat . In particular, the designers of the device took into account the experience of using drones during the Russian-Ukrainian war, ArmiyaInform reports. ExDECS is the latest version of the Leonidas weapon system created by Epirus, which ArmiyaInform told in one of his previous publications. Epirus has released details of a profile contract in which it is partnering with the Office of Naval Research, the Joint Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Countermeasures Division and the US Marine Corps Warfare Laboratory to support expeditionary forward base operations and counter-unmanned systems missions for a total of 5 .5 million dollars. The program will include initial integration with the US Marine Corps' Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S), as well as field experiments and multi-platform testing in expeditionary scenarios to improve USMC (US Marine Corps) land-based air defense capabilities. Epirus has developed ExDECS, a solid-state, software-defined, long-pulse HPM system to support the US Marine Corps Expeditionary Force (EABO) and counter-unmanned systems missions. The system is designed to be compact and easy to maneuver. This makes ExDECS suitable for any expeditionary force mission. -As drone warfare dominates the daily headlines, we are proud to bring ExDECS to life and work with the Marine Corps to develop expeditionary HPM capabilities,- said Andy Lowery, Chief Executive Officer of Epirus. -We are committed to accelerating the delivery of operational HPM capabilities for cUAS across the joint force.- Leonidas Expeditionary, or ExDECS, is the latest addition to the Leonidas HPM product suite and uses Epirus' revolutionary approach to HPM, which significantly reduces system size and weight and provides greater operator control. The modular and scalable system is designed to be installed on a Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) trailer and complements the low-altitude air defense system during expeditionary operations. Authors of the popular magazine Forbes talked with the creators of the latest radio electronic weapons. As the head of the manufacturing company reported, previously the best solution against drones was considered to be radio electronic warfare (EW), but now radio electronic suppression is at best partially effective. According to him, many soldiers in Ukraine carry shotguns to protect themselves from FPV drones, but even the best shooters will have a hard time defending themselves against the simultaneous attack of more than fifty UAVs. The ExDECS system was created just for such cases. ExDECS is reportedly able to destroy both individual drones and large swarms of drones. These weapons have some similarities to laser devices, however, the laser focuses its energy on a small point, while the microwave weapon can emit a wide field of energy that disables all electronics inside the drones. The manufacturer calls economic efficiency the main advantage of ExDECS. One shot costs just five US cents (about UAH 2). As noted in the publication, the previous model of the Epirus energy weapon was -tiny- compared to a similar device of competitors. Thanks to compact solid-state electronics, the ExDECS system has been made even smaller. This is important because Marines need a lightweight rig that can be towed behind standard vehicles for maximum mobility. -The solid-state, software-controlled, long-pulse high-power microwave setup we're doing at Epirus has demonstrated effectiveness against a spectrum of electronic threats, including targets beyond drones. In theory, anything that has an electron pulse would be vulnerable to the Epirus HPM,- states Andy Lowery. As part of the contract, Epirus will deliver a ready-made ExDECS HPM system to the Marine Corps Combat Operations Laboratory by the end of 2024. Microwave weapon of Leonidas.

Consequences of the attack on Kyiv: depressurization of a gas pipe and victims	notifies the head of the KMVA Serhii Popko. The air alert was announced twice during the night in Kyiv and lasted more than 4 hours in total. Drones attacked the capital from different directions, but the air defense forces detected and neutralized the enemy drones in time. As a result of falling debris, damage was recorded in the Solomyanskyi and Sviatoshynskyi districts. In the Solomyansk district, a gas pipe depressurized near a 9-story residential building, which led to the occupation of a store and three parked cars. The fire was extinguished. Five people were injured, one of them was hospitalized with a serious leg injury. In Sviatoshyn district, debris broke windows in a three-story administrative building, but there were no casualties.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/naslidky-ataky-po-kyyevu-rozgermetyzacziya-gazovoyi-truby-ta-postrazhdali/	2024-10-28T22:02:10-07:00
Hunting for mopeds: what foreign weapons are used to destroy the enemy - Shaheds -	-the Russians managed to increase the so-called Shahed assembly production.- Because the enemy, apart from the hull itself, cannot produce anything, not even engines. The rest of the parts are bought on world markets. Indeed, cold weather and winter are ahead. the Rashists are driven by their maniacal philosophy and really believe that our power system should be destroyed. Their targets are not only critical infrastructure facilities of TPPs and HPPs. Moreover, in my opinion, the Rashists want to destroy the distribution devices of nuclear power plants and transmission substations, which are critical for the safe operation of nuclear energy in Ukraine. Ukrainian air defense systems demonstrate simply impressive performance indicators in shooting down Russian Kh-101, Kh-555, Kalibr and other missiles. The churn rate varies up to about 95 percent. Therefore, the enemy resorted to the mass use of Shaheds and wants to exhaust our air defense system. Although, in my opinion, this is not quite the correct assessment on their part. Now -Shakhed-, first of all, are shot down not by anti-aircraft missiles of various classes, but by appropriate weapons, for example, barrel artillery. Australian Slinger anti-drone combat modules are effective means of defeating enemy Shaheds. The complex is based on the 30-mm M230LF cannon and the 7.62-mm MAG58 machine gun and is installed on a regular pickup truck. The system is equipped with thermal imaging and night sights. The range of detection of aerial targets by the optical-electronic system is 12 km using the day channel, and 13.7 km using the night channel. Another effective answer to the question of how to cheaply shoot down the Russian Shaheds. Our defenders are armed with the British short-range MSI-DS Terrahawk Paladin system. Consists of a remote-controlled Mk44 Busmaster II 30mm gun, equipped with a dual-feed system that allows the use of two different types of ammunition, including programmed detonation. The Terrahawk is capable of destroying targets at a range of up to 2 km. The complex's radar allows for 360-degree surveillance of targets. Recently, the enemy began to use cheap decoy drones during attacks on Ukraine. These drones fly without a warhead. This is done in order to identify the positions of the Ukrainian air defense and, once again, exhaust our air defense assets. the Russians for some reason believe that we will spend expensive anti-aircraft missiles on them, such as the Patriot air defense missile, costing up to 3 million dollars. The Defense Forces of Ukraine have learned how to shoot down Shaheds even from helicopters. Conventional Kalashnikov machine guns, other large-caliber machine guns of foreign models and small arms are used. Means of radar and visual calculation of aerial enemy objects appeared. And most importantly, they learned, in combat work, so to speak, to set the aiming point correctly. Plus, let's not forget about the Stinger portable anti-aircraft missile complex. The Americans resumed their production. There are cases when 50 out of 50 -Shaheeds- are lost. That is, the destruction rate is 90-98%. Consequently, their effectiveness turned out to be shockingly low. But what does the adversary think? Even if one missile of a certain class hit the target or even if one -Shaheed- reached its goal, then, according to the Rashists, the terror must continue. In my opinion, this (Russian air attacks on critical infrastructure facilities and residential buildings of Ukraine - ed.) will be permanent. The production of air weapons will not stop, and Russia's big missile-drone attack on us is only a matter of time.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/polyuvannya-na-mopedy-yakoyu-inozemnoyu-zbroyeyu-znyshhuyut-vorozhi-shahedy/	2024-10-28T21:57:18-07:00
A million people, Soviet equipment and nuclear weapons: what makes up the North Korean army	Meanwhile, Russia has ratified a de facto military alliance with North Korea. In this regard, it becomes quite logical to ask the question: how many troops and what kind of weapons does the North Korean Juche regime have? The Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of the DPRK and Chairman of the Central Military Commission is President Kim Jong Un, who heads the five branches of the Korean People's Army (KPA): Ground Forces, Navy, Air Force and Air Defense Forces, Strategic Missile Forces, and Special Operations Forces . Despite the fact that North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world, its military spending is slightly less than a quarter of its GDP, which ranks first in the world in terms of military spending. In 2019, it was estimated at about $3.6 billion per year. The Korean People's Army is the world's fourth largest conventional force, with about 5% of the population serving. This is about 1.3 million military personnel and another 600,000 reserve soldiers. KPA ground forces are deployed in three echelons: — Forward operational echelon: 4 infantry corps. — Second operational echelon: 2 mechanized corps, 1 armored corps, 1 artillery corps. — Strategic reserve: 2 mechanized corps, 1 artillery corps. As the DPRK's military policy prioritizes military spending over economic development, this has increased the KNA's role in everyday life, including greater involvement in social and economic decision-making. Servicemen spend most of their military service participating in various spheres of the country's socio-economic life. Men must serve in the army for 10 years and women for 8 years. Despite the fact that the main parts of the army are infantry, it has about 4,000 armored personnel carriers. The army has a significant number of well-equipped mechanized units. These mobile forces have armored personnel carriers of Soviet, Chinese and domestic production. North Korea has about 3,500 medium and light tanks, including about 2,000 T-54/55 main battle tanks and about 175 Chinese Type 59 tanks (an upgraded version of the T-54). Since the late 1970s, North Korea has produced approximately 600 T-62 tanks, the main battle tank of the Soviet Army in the 1960s. North Korea has also supplied light tanks, including the locally produced M-1985, the Soviet R-76, and Chinese variants of the Type 62 and 63. North Korea continues to rely on a large number of artillery systems to support ground operations. The North Korean Air Force's potential vulnerability contributes to its reliance on field artillery as its primary means of warfare. Thus, Pyongyang has deployed about 8,400 artillery pieces and more than 2,000 rocket launchers. North Korea has at least 3,000 towed and 5,400 self-propelled guns and howitzers. A photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency on March 7, 2017 shows the launch of four ballistic missiles by the Korean People's Army during a military exercise at an undisclosed location in North Korea. North Korea says its nuclear arsenal and ballistic missiles are necessary to counter threats from on the part of the United States and its allies who fought against North Korea during the Korean War of 1950-1953. Pyongyang also often touts the weapon as an item of national prestige and a proof of the country's power. According to the American Arms Control Association, North Korea has the ability to deliver nuclear weapons using a variety of land-based missile systems, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with a range capable of hitting the continental United States. But critics, including in Washington and Seoul, say the weapons destabilize the situation, pose a threat to North Korea's neighbors and divert resources from the country's poor citizens. State media have shown photos of various types of warheads, but North Korea has never disclosed the number of weapons it possesses, and analysts and foreign intelligence agencies have only rough estimates. A July report by the Federation of American Scientists concluded that the country may have produced enough fissile material to build up to 90 nuclear warheads, but that about 50 are likely to have been assembled. Lee Sang-kyu, a nuclear engineering expert at South Korea's Korea Institute for Defense Analysis, said , that North Korea is estimated to have 80-90 nuclear warheads made of uranium and plutonium, and that number is expected to increase to 166 by 2030. North Korea has facilities scattered throughout the country that support its nuclear program, including mines where raw uranium is collected, enrichment facilities and nuclear reactors to convert uranium and plutonium into bomb fuel, as well as weapons assembly plants. The North Korean Air Force is the second-largest branch of the Korean People's Army, with more than 100,000 servicemen. In 2022, the name was changed to the Korean People's Army Air and Anti-Aircraft Forces (KPAAF). Historically, the North Korean Air Force had a fairly large fleet of various equipment. With the support of China and the Soviet Union, the KPAAF was one of the first to introduce jet aircraft into its combat fleet. North Korea also sent forces overseas during the Vietnam War. After the end of the Cold War, the KPAAF was left with aircraft and combat equipment that were decades old. With ongoing sanctions over the past decades, North Korea has been unable to purchase newer aircraft. In addition, the sanctions affected the existing supply of aircraft, including spare parts, maintenance and even aviation fuel. Several different reports indicating the current state of affairs in the KPAAF indicate that it has an active fleet of between 500 and 900 combat aircraft. They still operate the outdated MiG-17, MiG-19, MiG-21 and MiG-23 fighters, but use the more modern and quite powerful MiG-29 fighters. Analysts have also long speculated whether Korea is fielding the MiG-25, but there is no evidence yet as to whether they are fielding the MiG-25. The KPAF's most numerous fighter is the MiG-21, which is effectively obsolete. North Korea's special operations forces, one of the largest in the world, are organized into 22 brigades and 7 separate battalions. These forces have five main tasks: conducting reconnaissance, conducting combat operations alongside conventional operations, creating a second front behind the enemy's rear, countering the South's special operations in the rear areas of North Korea, and maintaining internal security. The Ministry of People's Armed Forces has two main commands that oversee special operations units, the Intelligence Bureau and the Light Infantry Training Bureau. North Korea classifies its special operations units as reconnaissance, light infantry and snipers. Command-sized units conduct reconnaissance to gather intelligence or information about targets. Light infantry operations are combat operations conducted by units up to the size of a company or battalion against military, political, or economic objectives. Sniper operations are basically the same as light infantry, except that they are carried out in groups. The North Korean Air Force supports special operations missions through aerial infiltration and resupply operations. The North Korean Navy provides amphibious operations and resupply. The main ship for amphibious operations is the landing craft NAMPO. Small submarines and semi-submersible landing craft also support most missions. North Korea's special operations forces conduct operations at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Basically, strategic operations support national or departmental objectives, operational operations support corps objectives, and tactical operations support division and brigade maneuvers. North Korea's 60,000-strong navy is primarily a coastal defense force. Most of the naval vessels are small patrol vessels that cannot operate more than 50 nautical miles from the coast, but are capable of guarding North Korea's territorial waters. North Korea's naval forces are geographically divided into East and West Coast fleets, which do not exchange ships. The country has neither aircraft carriers nor destroyers. The Navy's most powerful force is 39 patrol boats with guided missiles. The Navy also has 12 Soviet SOJU-class patrol boats. Other ships, such as the Soviet guided missile patrol boat KOMAR and its North Korean derivative SOHUNG, are smaller in size. North Korea's attack submarine inventory includes 4 Soviet WHISKEY-class submarines, 4 Chinese ROMEO-class submarines, and 16 North Korean ROMEO-class submarines. Therefore, the full involvement of North Korea in the war as one of the main suppliers for Russia may not have a decisive impact, but it still remains dangerous and provides an additional resource for the Russian army. Although the indiscriminate and imprecise weapons typically relied upon by less technically advanced armies are not highly accurate, they are still destructive and dangerous.

Assault of the Russians, a drone with a thermobar and combat cats: a day at the position of the 79th...	The paratroopers have been holding back the enemy's advance in the East for more than two years and preventing the Russians from advancing in the Kurakhiv direction. We fly into the broken village and quickly pass several turns. You can't linger — the enemy is just a few kilometers away in a nearby settlement. There is constant shelling and circling enemy drones. Currently, only our soldiers and their war cats remain in this village. Correspondents of ArmiyaInform spent the day with the Taurian paratroopers and saw with their own eyes how they repelled the Russian assault. Three cats — the first ones you meet at the entrance to the dark basement. Under the wall are their food bowls and the weapons of our fighters. There are nine cats in total. — They reach out to people, nobody lives around here anymore, — say the guys. In the basement there is a control and observation point (KSP) of a company of one of the battalions. Here, near the huge monitor, there is round-the-clock duty, the situation around our positions is monitored from the stream in online mode, and the battle is managed in cooperation with other units in the event of enemy assaults. — U enemy tactics are not uniform. For example, one or two armored groups enter from one direction, and from the other — -motorcycle troops- on motorcycles, buggies, -loaves-, — explains paratrooper -Doc-, who is watching the situation on the monitor. This is a common suicidal tactic of the Russians, because even if these -motorcyclists- reach our positions, they are immediately destroyed. -Dok- is from Volnovakha, has considerable combat experience, and served in the 79th brigade even before the beginning of the large-scale invasion. He says that after the loss of Ugledar, the situation in their direction became more complicated. — They are trying to trap us, — he summarizes briefly. — The funniest thing has started recently, — a platoon leader with the call sign -Vinny- joins the conversation. He comes from the Lviv region and has been in the brigade for over a year. He wanted to join the Armed Forces when he was not yet 25 years old, which is why he was rejected by the TCC: — But I pushed them, — he recalls with a smile. The enemy tries to attack at different times of the day, regardless of the weather, and often even without the support of their own drones. — They probe us as much as we probe them. They can leave three units of equipment for each of our battalions, carry out combat reconnaissance, check where there are mine barriers, how the ATGM works. And they retreat, and after two or three days they chase a large column, — explains the officer. -Vinny- recalls the battles in Novomykhailivka, where our the paratroopers were opposed by the 155th brigade of the Russian marines, which during the large-scale invasion rozstrilyanyh-pobratymiv/->committed numerous war crimes: — They then had the task of storming the center of Novomykhailivka. Then they went on rotation. If compared to them, children are now fighting against us. Literally immediately after these words, the duty officer notices the movement of enemy vehicles on the monitor: -They are coming!- On the stream we see three units of armored vehicles, which rush through the open area along the landing. The enemy is covered by smoke screens to make it harder for UAV operators to track them. In a few minutes, three more -boxes- appear. All units are included in the work — drones track targets, commanders adjust and transmit instructions to artillery, report the situation to the soldiers in the front positions. We hear the -outputs- of our guns, again and again. In a few seconds, on the screen we see a hit on an infantry fighting vehicle, before that another enemy -beha- is blown up by a mine. One still manages to break through close to our positions and land the infantry. Almost immediately after that, the BMP is destroyed, in about half an hour it was possible to find the mech driver — he is seriously wounded and is trying to hide in the ruins. Our drones end his suffering with a well-timed reset. -The bastards are hiding in the house, let's hit them with a thermal bar-, — we hear the drone operators talking, who are preparing to defeat the enemy. Two more Russians reach the position of our paratroopers in a row, -Dok- immediately reports this to the -point-: several automatic rounds — and 3-4 grenades destroy the invaders. Further, the sweep takes place, and the enemy assault is repulsed, the paratroopers held their positions. In total, up to 15 occupiers were eliminated and several units of armored vehicles were knocked out. At KSP, everyone exhales from the tension, smokes a cigarette and talks about the 18-year-old Javelin operator, who during several assaults destroyed a dozen and a half units of equipment. In one of the battles, he managed to destroy three tanks. Today, he also has damaged equipment. Doc recalls that at the beginning of the large-scale invasion, there was a constant flow of volunteers to the brigade. — Motivating people now requires a comprehensive approach. Both rotations and recovery time, increased payouts for attack aircraft are at zero. And certain social guarantees for soldiers already after the end of their service, so that they have some certainty in their future, — he ponders. -Vinny- tells , who has already twice completed officer courses — for platoon commander and company commander. — We can guarantee a quick growth spurt. There are opportunities for sergeants — three-month officer courses, — says a serviceman. Guys immediately favorably respond to the recent span>decision to allow military units to mobilize people directly, bypassing TCC and SP. They only regret that this did not happen earlier. — Although in reality not all TCCs are as bad as they are reported to be. I would also like to have longer recovery times. People have been in positions for one and a half to two years. They get tired, they burn out, but they have to keep working because there's just no one to replace them, — emphasizes -Vinny.- The officer explains the simple math: the more personnel arrive, the more there is a reserve, so people have the opportunity to rest more between combat missions. — For example, there are 10 people in positions, 10 are resting and another 10 are in reserve. Then I can guarantee vacations for everyone, people are interchangeable, — adds the platoon commander. We are talking separately about the training of new recruits in training centers. Recently, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces General Oleksandr Syrskyi stated the need to increase the period of basic military training and improve training programs. Paratroopers emphasize the need to review and update the training plans for the mobilized in order to they met the requirements of modern warfare as much as possible. After all, combat brigades simply do not have time to train or retrain new arrivals. At the same time, everyone notes positive changes in the training of the sergeant corps. In this unit, sergeants are mainly paratroopers with extensive combat experience who can perfectly train new arrivals. — Here is one of our sergeants, who traveled from our battalion to teach people at the training center. Now he can safely be left on duty at the KSP, — says -Vinny-. Of course, the topic of mobilization and its coverage in mass media and social networks. -And outside the window&#8230; almost Desna,- — hums -Winnie,- laughs, and asks if I've seen the meme that emerged after the TCC and the police checked the documents of visitors to the -Ocean Elsa- concert in Kyiv. — Why swim across the Tisza? Come here, change people for me, and you will also earn in a year. I have a fighter who has five children, he is 50 years old, he voluntarily mobilized, he did not hide from them. He recently received an injury, but he is already writing to me to talk to the commander and while I have at least taken him on paper work, he wants to help the boys, - says the officer. Military personnel believe that the mass media should talk more about the need for mobilization, about the need to change people who are fighting at the front for the third year. — If there are more of us, we we will be able to fight back faster and return home faster. In the same way, if there are more of us, we will be able to go home from time to time, — the paratroopers say, adding that they are sorry to read on social networks about war fatigue among civilians. span> — We have a boy who was crushed in Marinka, he was injured for a day. After the injury, he still decided to stay with us. Yes, now he no longer participates in assaults, but deals with documents. Another boy was drafted — his religion forbids him to pick up a weapon, and he is an Haitian. But they found him a job, he works at the rear point.

The Russian Federation is spreading a fake about renaming a street in Kyiv in honor of the NATO Secr...	This -news- uses as confirmation the fake -order- on renaming No. 267, supposedly issued by the Kyiv Regional Military Administration. The first thing that catches your eye is &#8211; the decision to rename a street in Kyiv was apparently made by the Kyiv regional government. This is not possible, because the capital of Ukraine is a separate administrative-territorial unit and is in no way subordinate to the regional government. Also, the authors of the fake -document- made grammatical errors that are already traditional for this kind of forgery, which are not characteristic of speakers of the Ukrainian language. For example, fakers use the phrase -help withholding-. If you translate it into Russian, you will get -help content-. Instead, the -document- meant -receiving help-, which in Ukrainian would be written as -receiving help-. In addition, Kyivans know that the Kyiv City Council at the beginning of 2024 had already renamed part of Heroiv Sevastopol Street to honor of Ukrainian surgeon Oleksandr Shalimov. The local authorities did not make any other decisions regarding this street. Decolonization of toponymy is one of the most painful processes for enemies inside Ukraine. After all, Russia uses its own imperial heritage to preserve, restore and strengthen the imperial influence on our country. The common names of streets and settlements, monuments, and the same traditions are for her an argument in favor of the thesis that underlies the current aggression: -Ukrainians are one people with Russians.- If there is one people, then the Ukrainian state is a mistake, or an unnecessary and harmful invention, either by the Austrian General Staff, Lenin, or NATO. That is why propagandists from time to time try to at least somehow suppress this process.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/rf-poshyryuye-fejk-pro-perejmenuvannya-vulyczi-kyyeva-na-chest-genseka-nato/	2024-10-28T21:17:42-07:00

This process affected many areas, including the IT sector of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which includes the Center for Geospatial Data and the Center for Scaling Technological Solutions. The importance of IT solutions in today's high-tech warfare is undeniable, so there has been an improvement in the organizational and staffing structure of the Center for Scaling Technology Solutions. Such optimization involves more rational use of human resources, concentration on important areas, and improvement of the efficiency of specialists who remain in their positions. The Center for Scaling Technology Solutions has been given time to reform until the end of the year. At the same time, the Armed Forces continue to actively and effectively support technological innovations and the IT sector, and accusations about the destruction of the IT sphere in the Ukrainian army are false.

As a result of comprehensive measures in Zakarpattia, Lviv and Cherkasy regions, the organizers of the riots were detained.

The government has approved a plan to combat corruption in the MSEK system: what will change	About this informed the Ministry of Health. The MSEK system consists of institutions of the central and regional level. The Ministry of Health forms only the Central MSEK, which performs organizational and methodical functions. The regional vertical includes 328 MSEK, including 25 regional bureaus and more than 300 central-city and interdistrict commissions. The activities of MSEK regional bureaus are managed by a manager who is appointed and dismissed by the founder — the regional council. The government adopted amendments to the Regulation on medical and social expertise, which allow the Ministry of Health to impose the rights and obligations of the Central MSEK on an enterprise, institution or organization that belongs to the sphere of management of the Ministry of Health and has a license to carry out economic activities in the field of medical practice. This allows you to optimize the process at the central level as quickly as possible. According to the decision of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, the performance of the functions of the Central MSEC, in particular, regarding the consideration of appeals and the verification of the validity of decisions made by the regional level MSEC, has been completely transferred to the Ukrainian State Research Institute of Medical and Social Disability Problems of the Ministry of Health in the city of Dnipro. Here, during 2024, the Ministry of Health created the necessary material and technical base, which should significantly simplify the process of passing an examination for people. The reform plan also provides: The algorithm for appealing decisions of the MSEC has not changed at the moment. If your case was sent for appeal to the Central MSEC, it will be forwarded to the Ukrainian State Research Institute of Medical and Social Disability Problems of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine in the city of Dnipro. You will be contacted regarding the review and further actions, the order of consideration will be preserved. As reported by ArmyInform, recently a meeting of the NSDC took place regarding numerous facts of violations of the CSEC and false disabilities for officials. There are numerous facts of unjustified disabilities among customs officials, prosecutors, tax officials, in the Pension Fund system, and in local administrations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/28/uryad-zatverdyv-plan-shhodo-protydiyi-korupcziyi-v-systemi-msek-shho-zminytsya/	2024-10-28T06:53:00-07:00
The wave of public dissatisfaction with fortifications was extinguished: the materials are still use...	With the experience of how, in the winter and early spring of 2024, the communicators of the -Tavria- OSU managed to cover the construction of fortifications in the East in such a way as to calm society and at the same time not harm the security of the military, in an interview ArmyInform shared the spokesman Captain Dmytro Lykhovii of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: — In the Tavria air defense system, we organized active coverage of the construction of fortifications in our area of ​​responsibility, near Avdiivka. It was shown that construction is provided by engineering units, relevant companies of mechanized brigades, emergency services, regional administrations, etc. They showed new defense lines, concrete freshly built dugouts, trenches, trenches with overlaps, built according to the requirements of the infantry, which take into account the modern challenges of combat and the operational environment. Photos and videos were taken, I recorded a lot of stand-ups from the trenches and bunkers, and we made all these files freely available to all willing TV viewers. Those materials are used to this day, if there is a need to illustrate one or another thematic plot. Thanks to the fact that we showed and explained all this, the wave of -popular discontent- about the fortifications was then extinguished. After all, fortifications were actually built, in large numbers, and the fortifications are not bad. I believe that this was an exemplary case of responding to a crisis call that arose in the information field in February-March. Again, effective -communication of solved problems-. Once again, I thank the excellent team from the public relations department of the -Tavria- OSU, whose area of ​​responsibility included the Avdiyiv direction.

Closer to the coast - they felt a blow, but continued to pull the board to land. After crossing the coastline in Odesa, we completely lost control. There is only one way out - a catapult! The Su-24 is designed in such a way that after firing the lantern, the navigator's catapult pyro cartridge is activated first, and the pilot's after one and a half seconds. And, believe me, sometimes those one and a half seconds are worth life... That time my commander survived, is serving, but was unable to return to flying work. Any catapulting is a trauma for the body, to a lesser or greater extent, it's a matter of luck. After rehabilitation, I returned to combat work again,- Viktor said. Its commander, Colonel Yevhen Bulatsyk, said that a feature film is currently being shot abroad, the main episode of which is the combat work of the pilots to liberate Zmiiny Island. And Viktor sometimes has to fly on two-seater L-39 training and combat aircraft. This can be a task of maintaining flying skills, i.e. recovery after a break, or other special tasks where the use of this type of aircraft will be sufficient. Viktor flew out with his brother on one of these missions. Looking ahead, I will say that this case is unique in the history of aviation and probably has no analogues in world practice! The task was completed. Returning to the base, the pilots got into a rather unpleasant situation - the cockpit of the plane was rammed by... a stork. The cabin light was thrown away, but only the first catapult worked. Viktor's seat remained in place... He instantly took control of the plane, got out of the dangerous pique and continued the flight without a cockpit light and, as it turned out later... without his brother, he did not survive... The flying profession is not only romantic, but also dangerous, every detail is important. The main thing is not to lose concentration at a critical moment. In this difficult situation, the experienced pilot-navigator showed steel endurance and landed the plane at the nearest airfield. It is difficult not only in heaven, but also on earth. The dawn in Starokostyantynov for the third full-scale year already usually takes place to the accompaniment of a siren... The war made the city quite a well-known district center. Starkon, as the city is called for short, survived the unprecedented missile and drone attacks of the Russians. What's more, the local tactical aviation brigade of the Air Force drank Putin's blood well, because it effectively hits the rear of the aggressor in the occupied territory, freed Zmiiny, destroyed the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and even sank several of its ships. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilot of the Ukrainian Su-24M said that with his colleagues -storm-shadow-pilot-ukrayinskogo-su-24m/->get in line to work on the Storm Shadow enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/28/bombyv-zmiyinyj-perezhyv-vluchannya-rakety-i-zitknennya-z-lelekoyu-potrapyv-u-kino-istoriya-lotchyka-viktora/	2024-10-28T03:06:48-07:00

About this informs October 28 SBU. -The task of the Russian agent was to identify the locations of Ukrainian infantrymen and artillery that are holding the defense under the district center. In order to find the coordinates, the person involved traveled around the district center and nearby settlements under the guise of delivering humanitarian aid to local residents,- the report says. According to the case file, he sent the received data via messenger to his Russian curator, a staff member of the FSB, whose identity has already been established by the counter-intelligence of the Security Service. -The Russians used information from the agent to plan new attacks on Pokrovsk using guided air bombs and FPV drones,- the SBU said. Counter-intelligence agents exposed the agent at the initial stage of his intelligence activity and detained him. Simultaneously, comprehensive measures were taken to secure the positions of the Defense Forces. During the searches, a mobile phone with an anonymous chat in the messenger, which he used to communicate with an FSB employee, was seized from the detainee. On the basis of the received evidence, the investigators of the Security Service notified the detainee of suspicion under Part 2 of Article 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The perpetrator is in custody. He faces up to life in prison with forfeiture of property. As reported by ArmyInform, the Security Service completed the pre-trial investigation regarding the members of the criminal organization that carried out information sabotage against Ukraine on the order of the FSB.

- We are signing up to work on the enemy Storm Shadow - Ukrainian Su-24M pilot	On October 28, Vol. Acting head of the communications department of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Yuriy Ignat. Su-24M pilot Victor leisurely enjoyed his coffee with his cigarette. He says he does it traditionally, before he gets on the plane. Now the aviators are focused on the use of Western high-precision weapons. There are serious strategic tasks at hand. It would seem that everything is simple. Pilots must clearly go to the launch line of Storm Shadow/Scalp cruise missiles, press the launch button, sit down at one of the operational airfields and ... wait for objective control - confirmation of the destruction of the enemy object. Everything is simple only at first glance. In fact, these are complex operations that involve a large number of specialists from various fields. Strike planning, missile programming, reconnaissance - everything requires the most accurate mathematical calculations, otherwise - there will be no result. And Storm Shadow or Scalp should hit the target! And full stop. We don't have many of those missiles. -We sign up in line to let in the -winged ones-. And why are you surprised, it is. Everyone wants to complete this honorable mission. There are crews, there are planes, but Western missiles are not enough... The guys are very motivated and purposeful, that's why it's the turn! When it is necessary to go to combat, we do not have questions: -Why should I...- We are told: -Can I...-, Viktor said. In the first months of the war, there were no Western weapons yet, so the pilots struck with short-range air missiles and free-falling air bombs. At the beginning of the war, our pilots did not have any -red lines-, they broke through the enemy's anti-aircraft defense and in one sortie sent to hell hundreds of occupiers, tens of units of armored vehicles, which pearled on Kyiv in columns. Yes, it was a one-way ticket for many, but the bombers made an incredible contribution to the victory. Needless to say, in the first weeks of the full-scale operation, the pilots successfully flew near Bryansk more than once, destroyed the enemy's offensive pace on its territory, and destroyed logistics. In many directions, these were bold, daring operations of the Air Force aviation, in which Victor also took part. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukrainian missiles destroyed key command points of the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/28/my-zapysuyemos-v-chergu-shhob-vidpraczyuvaty-po-vorogu-storm-shadow-pilot-ukrayinskogo-su-24m/	2024-10-28T01:04:23-07:00
Snow collapse: MOU prepares for logistical challenges in extremely difficult weather conditions	This was reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on October 28. According to the legend of the exercises, the biggest blizzard in recent decades happened in Ukraine, which caused the collapse of the roads. The storm paralyzed traffic, it accumulated on the roadway and at the entrances to large settlements in the central and northern parts of the country. The MOU noted that in the conditions of war with the Russian aggressor, such a situation on roads of defensive significance would threaten the disruption of military logistics. It would become impossible to move personnel, military equipment, weapons, ammunition and humanitarian cargo. The participants of the exercises identified a network of the main highways of defensive importance and sections with long uphill and downhill sections, where snow removal and other special equipment will primarily work. In addition, monitoring of the situation and collection of hydro-meteorological data, prompt informing of the population and carriers, an algorithm for introducing restrictions or traffic bans, as well as an overview of the technical condition of vehicles were worked out. The training took place on the basis of the Information and Analytical Center of the State Agency for Reconstruction and Development of Infrastructure of Ukraine. They were attended by representatives of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Reconstruction Agency, officials of the regional and Kyiv city military administrations, the Department of Patrol Police, the State Emergency Service and Ukrtransbezpeka. The Ministry of Defense was represented by Colonel Artem Voronin, the Chief Specialist of the Emergency Prevention Department of the Civil Protection Department of the Main Department of Mine Action, Civil Protection and Environmental Safety. He drew attention to the fact that the maintenance of roads of defense importance in proper condition is a guarantee of reliable logistical support for the fulfillment of tasks by the Defense Forces of Ukraine.

From the sky to the ground: air-to-ground missiles were used in a special anti-tank vehicle	How inform experts of the defense portal Army Recognition, Wolfram is an anti-tank complex that combines a special purpose vehicle Supacat HMT 6×6, equipped with a Brimstone missile launch module, ArmyInform reports. The main idea of ​​Wolfram is to install a launch platform with eight Brimstone missiles on an HMT vehicle, which will provide a mobile strike capability against ground targets. The Brimstone missile, which was originally an air-to-surface warhead used by ground attack aircraft, was adapted for surface-to-surface missions, in particular, to counter enemy armor. About the similar use of these winged fired by the Defense Forces of Ukraine in ground operations, our editorial office has already repeatedly told in her materials. However, it is worth recalling that the Brimstone warhead is an air-to-surface and surface-to-surface missile developed by the United Kingdom, designed primarily for precision strikes on ground targets. It has been involved in several military conflicts and has been used by such armed forces as the Royal Air Force of Great Britain, the Royal Air Force of Saudi Arabia, the German Luftwaffe, and more recently the ZSU. Brimstone is a compact missile weighing about 50 kg and 1.8 m long. Its design includes a tandem HEAT warhead weighing 6.3 kg, specially designed to penetrate armored targets. This missile is powered by a solid-propellant rocket engine and has a supersonic speed of about Mach 1.3, or about 450 meters per second. One of its key features is its sophisticated guidance system, which integrates an active 94GHz millimeter-band radar and an inertial navigation system (INS) that provides impressive accuracy with an error of less than one meter. Later versions, such as the dual-mode sensor variant and the Brimstone 2 and 3, also include laser guidance capability, increasing the missile's versatility in various combat environments. The land-based version of the Brimstone missile uses fire-and-forget technology, allowing operators launch the missile and rely on its autonomous guidance system to locate and destroy the target without further intervention. This advanced capability is made possible by the missile's dual-mode homing system, which combines millimeter-range radar and laser guidance. Once launched, the missile uses its radar to target targets even if they are moving, ensuring high accuracy and minimizing risk to the operator. The fire-and-forget feature increases battlefield effectiveness by allowing multiple missiles to be launched simultaneously or in rapid succession, increasing the chance of success against enemy armored vehicles and other targets. In turn, the autoplatform for this ground-based anti-tank system is provided SC Group is a British multifaceted engineering company , which is a world leader in the creation of modular structures, including the HMT 600 vehicle, which can use different modules depending on the tasks. Installation of the missile module is possible on 4x4 and 6x6 platform variants. The Wolfram project became the first specialized ground-based anti-tank complex with these missiles, which were created for strike and multi-purpose aircraft. The Wolfram anti-tank system using the ground version of the Brimstone air-to-surface missile.

What it's like to be a military spokesman: Captain Lykhovi on mobilization, civilian media and the m...	Also, the spokesman of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Captain Dmytro Lykhoviy, spoke about mobilization, security of operations, coverage of the construction of fortifications and the peculiarities of the perception of the official spokesperson's posts on a private Facebook account specially for ArmyInform. —Say a few words about your work as a spokesperson for the -Tavria- OUV - when did you accept and hand over the position in the South of Ukraine? — I was the spokesperson for the -Tavria- OUV in the summer and autumn of this year. Before that, in the winter, I was the head of the public relations department and at the same time the spokesperson of the previous OSUV -Tavria-, which covered, in particular, a part of the Donetsk region - the Avdiyiv direction. That is, this year it was my second rotation at Tavria. We are talking about slightly different operational areas. At the same time, I am the spokesperson of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It should be noted that both in the OUV/OSUV and in the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the spokesperson is not a position, but a function. Many journalists do not take this into account. In fact, I have a position in the Main Directorate of Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in the department of interaction with the media. I also have responsibilities that consist in communication on behalf of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This is what is called the -spokesman of the General Staff-. In Kyiv, we alternate with captain Andrii Kovalev. In addition, servicemen of the Main Directorate of Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine can be sent to strengthen communication directions in the OSUV or OUV, which are temporary bodies of military management. So this year, I had two business trips to fulfill certain functional duties at the Tavria Higher Secondary School, rather than moving to a new position. During such a business trip, the spokesperson reports to the commander of the OSU or the OUV, but he also maintains contact and coordinates his actions with the Main Directorate of Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. — So the spokesman for OSUV or OUV is a certain role, the performance of certain duties, or, as you put it, a function. What are the responsibilities of a spokesperson? — These are responsibilities related to communication with media representatives, providing interviews, comments, clarifications in oral and written form, inclusion in TV and radio broadcasts, preparation of texts, summaries for distribution in social networks, etc. A spokesman has a wide range of responsibilities. It should be closer to the media, to journalists, to the audience, intermediaries with which journalists, websites or TV channels are. The spokesperson should be open to constant contact and communication with a wide range of people. When someone becomes a spokesperson, they automatically become a public figure with a heavy workload. This work is intense, difficult, but for me it is very interesting. Actually, this is what I joined the Armed Forces for the second time. - You are a journalist with many years of experience. How did this affect the fulfillment of the duties of a military spokesman? - I have been working in the media since the end of 1991, when I became a correspondent for the newspaper -Ukraine Moloda-. For a long time he worked as the head of the political department, deputy editor-in-chief. The newspaper was very popular in its time and had a large circulation. In 2014, after the beginning of anti-terrorist operation, I first mobilized to the ranks of the 1st tank brigade. According to my VOS (military accounting specialty), obtained at the military department at KNU, I was the deputy battery commander for personnel work. Back then it was called -zampolit-. After demobilization, he founded the online publication -Newspaper-, which writes about the army and war. Its motto: -News of warring Ukraine.- I was convinced that if there was a war going on in the country, then this should be the main topic. I could no longer work in another direction. That is, the specifics of military journalism have been with me since 2015. When the large-scale invasion began, I was also working in the news. The topic of war, for obvious reasons, began to be in much greater demand among readers. The monthly attendance of Novynarna reached 10 million. It helped a lot that all the previous years I was in close contact with many press officers, brigades, servicemen and veterans. After all, -Novynarnia- specialized in coverage of ATO/OOS and everything related to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and earned a good reputation. When I mobilized for the second time in 2023, I chose the path of a communicator, came to serve in the Main Department of Public Relations of the Armed Forces. This was my environment. That is, relatively speaking, I remained on the same information platform, I just moved from one side of the table to the other. — That is, you both came and at the same time remained in the same field in which you have been working professionally for more than three decades. Does it help? - Here I work with many of the same journalists, the same military, in fact the same units that I have been working with since 2015. But no longer as a civilian journalist, but as a military journalist and communicator. At the same time, in my work in the Armed Forces, I profess the principle that Ukrainian civilian journalists are our allies, colleagues and partners. I think it is a huge advantage when I have contacts and approaches to many journalists interested in our topic since I worked side by side with them. I believe that I am doing the same thing with them in the same war, but as a representative of the Armed Forces. In those periods when I was seconded to OSUV and OUV -Tavria-, this cooperation became as contact as possible. I could perform my work much better and in larger volumes, because I know journalists well, their problems, their requests, strengths and weaknesses, the specifics of publications, etc. —Has anything fundamentally changed in the coverage of the war in the media since the beginning of the large-scale invasion? It's not the amount of news and public attention to the topic that matters - it's too much to compare the scale before and after, everything is obvious. I have in mind the requests of society and journalists for information about the war and the work of the media in general. - As a civilian journalist in the recent past, I understand what the media want. I understand that they are always eager to learn more. At the same time, it is equally obvious that those journalists who have been working on the military topic for a long time are aware of the logic of certain limitations in connection with the challenges facing the military. It is easy to work with such experienced colleagues. They have an understanding of how and why all this is being done, and who is fighting and how, and how it should be covered so that everyone remains alive. It is clear that both the amount of information and the scale of the war after February 2022 have increased many times. Now, in the third year of repelling the large-scale invasion of Russia, we must help maintain the interest of the Western media, our media, and our society in general in the events at the front, in the issues of the army. Actually, to engage in objective reporting about what is happening in the war and in the army. —You mentioned Western media working in the national media spaces of their countries and at the international level. With the main messages about them, everything seems to be clear - Ukraine is waging a just war against a brutal aggressor who has not only committed an act of aggression, but has committed numerous war crimes. As an aggressor state, the Russian Federation despises international law and tries to undermine the fundamental principles of the world order. Therefore, Great Britain, the USA, Canada, Australia, the states of the European Union and other countries should continue to effectively support Ukraine in this war - this is correct both from a moral and ethical point of view, and from a purely pragmatic point of view. And what should be the main message to Ukrainian society, what should be addressed to it? - A citizen of Ukraine should be aware that he has not only rights, but also responsibilities. That military duty is prescribed in the Constitution. That assistance to the Defense Forces and mobilization is a matter of the survival of the Ukrainian state, Ukrainian society, and the Ukrainian nation as such. The task of military communicators, in my opinion, is very serious here. This is both direct information and cooperation with our media, which are actually mediators between the army and society. Of course, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have many channels in various social networks, they have millions of subscribers. But still, without cooperation with Ukrainian journalists, we will not be able to communicate with our society better, more qualitatively, more efficiently. So to speak, influence the basic settings. Honest communication - and above all communication about solved problems - can improve the situation with mobilization, and therefore improve the situation in the Armed Forces and at the front in general. In the opposite case, there is a collapse of specific aspects on the battle line - when there are simply not enough personnel, in particular, because the information vacuum has been filled by fakes and manipulations. That is why I say that cooperation with civilian journalists is so important for us. - Let's return to your work as a spokesperson at the Tavria State Educational Institution - how did the interaction with civilian media take place in practice? - During my business trip to the Tavria Educational Institution in February-March 2024, first events with the withdrawal of our troops from Avdiyivka and the subsequent Russian offensive. The question of fortifications also arose. There was a lot of active crisis communication, both reactive and proactive. In addition, during the same period, there were changes to the Order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine No. 73 -On the organization of interaction between the Armed Forces of Ukraine, other components of the defense forces and representatives of the media during the legal regime of martial law-. I believe that the changes that were made to this order in particular and the efforts of our communication department in cooperation with professional public organizations, brought to the press services in the troops and to civilian journalists, were progressive. They greatly facilitated and simplified the work of journalists in war zones. Our team of the public relations department of -Tavria- OSUV was one of the first to start implementing these innovations for the media in practice. The result was, for example, a report by Anna Kalyuzhnaya from Robotyn: the -red zone- can -open- under certain conditions. I will also emphasize that the spokesperson's quality communication is based on the possession of a large amount of up-to-date information regarding the operational situation in the area of ​​responsibility of the OSU/OUU. To do this, it is necessary to constantly work daily with information sources of military structures, social networks, open sources, press services of brigades in the operational zone, keep statistics, receive information from intelligence, from colleagues from other components of the defense forces, etc. That is, as a spokesperson, you can only answer the questions and requests of journalists when you are deep in the topic, have information, statistics and analytics, and at the same time know how to weigh and dose all this. After all, when you monitor yourself every day, write something for yourself, keep tables in Excel. After all, if we talk only about -cotton- in general terms, no one has been interested in it for a long time. Such communication does not satisfy either the journalists or the audience and society. - You said that journalists always want more - more information, more photos and videos, more interesting characters and speakers, more comments and explanations. However, this is not always possible, and, I will make no secret, sometimes some of the military directly say that it is easier to ban and not let anyone anywhere, than to run the risk of leaking important information through publications in the media. How to find a balance here between the interests of journalists and society's right to information and security requirements and the non-disclosure of important details, the data of which could contribute to the enemy? How did you manage to do this? — Of course, there is such a thing as operational security, and the officers concerned are careful to ensure that no information that could be useful to the enemy is made public. Their position is clear: if the enemy, for example, learns the thickness of the armored door in a new bunker on a certain section of the front, he can prepare accordingly to overcome these fortifications. Therefore, in the opinion of the security of operations, it is better not to show any fortifications that we have at all. And nothing to show at all (smiles). On the other hand, if we don’t show the fortifications, don’t talk about them, then the society will start to get nervous, because they will think that the defense line has not been built, there are no fortifications at all or they are of poor quality. People will think that the armed forces are retreating only because they are not properly fortified. To prevent this from happening, military communicators need to show the construction of the same fortifications in a way that does not harm the security of the military and operations, on the one hand, and to provide the public with objective, reassuring information, on the other. That's why in the -Tavria- OSUV we organized an active coverage of the construction of fortifications in our area of ​​responsibility, near Avdiivka. It was shown that construction is provided by engineering units, relevant companies of mechanized brigades, emergency services, regional administrations, etc. They showed new defense lines, concrete freshly built dugouts, trenches, trenches with overlaps, built according to the requirements of the infantry, which take into account the modern challenges of combat and the operational environment. Photos and videos were taken, I recorded a lot of stand-ups from the trenches and bunkers, and we put all these files freely available to all willing TV viewers. Those materials are used to this day, if there is a need to illustrate one or another thematic plot. Thanks to the fact that we showed and explained all this, the wave of -popular discontent- about the fortifications was then extinguished. After all, fortifications were actually built, in large numbers, and the fortifications are not bad. I believe that this was an exemplary case of responding to a crisis call that arose in the information field in February-March. Again, effective -communication of solved problems-. Once again, I thank the excellent team from the public relations department of the -Tavria- OSU, whose area of ​​responsibility included the Avdiyiv direction. —Now you have returned from a business trip and are acting as the spokesman for the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Is it just a matter of scaling between OUV and ZSU or are there other more important differences? - There is a significant difference in features. After all, the spokesman of the operational group works with all the components in his operational area and daily communicates the necessary operational data within his own communication framework. Only sometimes, when the situation requires it (in particular, if there is a significant change in the situation), the spokesman coordinates his message with the command of the OUV. At least it was like that for me. The spokesman of the General Staff has a much wider range of topics. But there are clear limitations here. After all, one spokesman is unable to accumulate all the information about the actions of all the components of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in all directions. This would require both the appropriate level of access and communication approvals. Unfortunately, there is no magic drawer in which you can find answers to any urgent media inquiries about the activities of all the Armed Forces in one minute. And the spokesman of the General Staff cannot provide fast communication at the same level as the spokesman of the General Staff. However, we are trying to improve the work and ensure more active communication of the spokespersons of the General Staff. Consideration is also given to being on TV and providing direct comments to media inquiries today. I will give an example. Recently, there has been a lively media interest in the reform in the IT sector of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The information on this matter was critical and somewhat distorted. The media, including, asked for a comment from the General Staff of the Armed Forces. We promptly prepared a response the same day. - What exactly was it about? - The question related to the alleged -collapse- of the IT structure of the Armed Forces. And the fact is that in the spring of 2024, the Main Inspection of the Ministry of Defense conducted an audit of the functional purpose of military organizational structural units and military management bodies. Among other things, there was talk of the need to somewhat reduce the number of staff positions. This process affected many directions, including the IT sector of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which includes the Center for Geospatial Data and the Center for Scaling Technological Solutions. The importance of IT solutions in today's high-tech warfare is undeniable, so there has been an improvement in the organizational and staffing structure of the Center for Scaling Technology Solutions. Such optimization involves more rational use of human resources, concentration on important areas, and improvement of the efficiency of specialists who remain in their positions. The Central Committee was given time to reform until the end of the year. At the same time, the Armed Forces continue to actively and effectively support technological innovations and the IT sector, and accusations about the destruction of the IT sphere in the Ukrainian army are false. - As can be seen from the examples you mentioned - both about the fortifications in the East and about the reform of the military administration - the role of the spokesperson is very responsible. Is there a situation where every word you say or written is perceived as an official position? After all, any word said in public space can be seen as an official comment. There was a fun case. In the summer, as an individual, as a sports lover (and a former curator of the sports department in the newspaper) commented on Facebook a speech at the Turkish Sagittarius Olympiad - an athlete in glasses, without headphones, a former police officer who fired, holding his hand in his pocket. Then he became a world meme - they say, look at what a cool police in Turkey, that here is an ordinary police officer on a relaxed shot of titled professionals! And then I wrote a comment that he is actually a professional athlete who has been firing for decades, he already has dozens of medals from the World and Europe Championships, that all the pneumatic gun shooters hold his hand in his pocket, after all, many shooters in Berushi's ears. And in this Turk. Then this comment dispersed on the Internet, from my private post made publications on many sites with headings: -The spokesman of the Tavriya- put -in the place of Turkish Sagittarius.- Therefore, I am on Facebook now careful (smiles) . In the continuation of the interview with the Armyinform with the spokesman of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by Captain Dmitry Likhovy, read soon about the Krynki, the left bank of the Dnieper in Kherson region, Gulyaypilsky, Zaporizhia, Orikhiv directions and robots, as well as about mobilization and distinction between chemical substances.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/28/yak-cze-buty-vijskovym-rechnykom-kapitan-lyhovij-pro-mobilizacziyu-czyvilni-media-ta-memnogo-tureczkogo-strilczya-olimpijczya/	2024-10-27T21:44:09-07:00
Another scandal about filtering in the Armed Forces: which indicates a fake	Such nonsense could come to mind only to a stubborn Russian propagandist who had read the Kremlin's manual and Gundyaev's prayers. Even without analyzing the content, this -document- is a fake for a number of other reasons. First, the text contains a number of linguistic errors, incorrect wording and is overly emotional. This indicates that the -letter- was written by a person who does not speak the state language and does not work with official documents. Secondly, the code of EDRPOU (Unified State Register of Enterprises and Organizations of Ukraine) in the header of the document and on the seal are different. This is a serious inconsistency - in such an official document, the codes must match. Thirdly, given the document's other shortcomings, the presence of the QR code and electronic signature information may be an attempt to make it look official. What seems strange about the design of the -document- is that the -letter- is addressed to two divisions of the TCC of the JV at different levels: the Odesa Regional Territorial Center of Recruitment and Social Support and the Khadzhibey Territorial Center of Recruitment and Social Support of the City of Odesa. At the same time, the names and surnames of the managers are not indicated, which is atypical for official documents. Note -App. No- is also not filled in, which is a violation. It usually means -instance number- and indicates which instance is the original or the copy. In conclusion, we would like to emphasize that such -throw-ins- are aimed at inciting conflicts on linguistic grounds and undermining unity among Ukrainian military. Fact checkers state that fake reports about the alleged discrediting of the Russian-speaking population in Ukraine and about the so-called -increasing conflict- between Ukrainian and Russian-speaking citizens of Ukraine have become more frequent recently.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/28/chergova-ahineya-pro-filtracziyu-v-zsu-shho-vkazuye-na-fejk/	2024-10-27T21:23:58-07:00

Canadian Roshel armored car vs. Russian FPV drone: the story of border guards	They told about him in the video. According to the border guards, the Ukrainians gave her the gentle nickname -Roshelka-. It is used to bring soldiers to and from positions, to evacuate the wounded. -We were beaten near Vovchansk. FPVishka hit. The glass survived. It didn't fly away. It was broken, the road was not visible, but it was possible to drive,- recalled the fighter under the pseudonym -Sensei-. Armored body is just one of its charms. Defenders of Ukraine assured that -Roshelka- will pass without problems where ordinary pickup trucks can get into a difficult situation. -And it is managed by ordinary guys who, before mobilization, were either forwarding drivers or computer science teachers. Because mastering it, despite its large dimensions and 8-ton weight, is not so difficult,- the border guards noted. Earlier, ArmyInform showed how border guards of the -Hart- brigade destroyedan enemy howitzer gun D-20 in the Vovchansk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/kanadskyj-broneavtomobil-roshel-proty-rosijskogo-fpv-drona-istoriya-prykordonnykiv/	2024-10-27T11:26:06-07:00

Uterine drones near Selidov: the enemy broke through to the city thanks to a significant advantage i...	At the same time, the Russians practically did not use armored vehicles, instead they resorted to innovations in the use of drones, using drones. The defense forces are making maximum efforts to prevent the enemy from advancing further. The spokesperson of the 15th Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine -Kara- Dag- Vitaly Mylovydov: — The situation in Selidovo remains very difficult and very difficult. For almost a week now, the enemy has continued active assaults, deploying large reserves, partially transferring units from the northern part of the Pokrovsky Front and carrying out, starting and continuing attacks not from two, but from three flanks, that is, the northern outskirts were approached from the northern, eastern and southern outskirts. He used all the bridgeheads that he tried to prepare during September and advanced along the settlement of Selidove, i.e. further north and south. Since the beginning of the week, on Monday, having conducted a preliminary massive artillery training, for about twenty hours, the maximum number of assault units, personnel, due to a large accumulation of manpower, has been trying to capture the city of Selidove. In part, he managed to get to the eastern and southern outskirts, in part to gain a foothold due to a huge number of personnel. But the Defense Forces, 15 Brigade, adjacent units are doing their best to check the enemy's advance. In recent days, the enemy has focused more attention and is using forces partly with the use of equipment, light equipment, trying in the direction of the settlement of Vishneve, which is located further south, with an attempt to create conditions for the encirclement of the city and the displacement of our units directly from Selidowo, cutting off the logistical routes and the supply of our units . Previously, the enemy had very massively used artillery and means of air damage, namely anti-aircraft missiles. The enemy attacked point by point, calculating the positions. Partially struck, destroying some of the western outskirts of the city of Selidove to make it impossible to defend and consolidate our units on those outskirts. I also want to note that the enemy uses a lot of force, but did not use armored vehicles, and due to the movement of infantry groups, taking into account the peculiarities of the geographical area, that is, forest strips that almost come close to the outskirts of the city and reach the first 50 by 70 meters there houses Even the leaves, unfortunately, did not cover these movements in our favor, therefore, at the expense of a significant number, it was possible to infiltrate the territory of the city with an attempt to further entrench. Artillery is now less actively used, but, nevertheless, the positions of our units and adjacent ones are subject to constant and regular attacks by both aviation means of destruction and artillery. Also, it was on this route that we probably first encountered such a combination of a drone that had an FPV drone attached. That is, the zone of its damage was expanded due to the depth of advancement of the main reconnaissance UAV, which corrected and, when calculating the movement of the equipment, dropped the FPV drone directly in the area of ​​damage to the targets. Thus, getting caught in those areas where you least expect damage, catching our equipment or the movement of forces. This bothered me and that's why EW devices were already used at entrances even where, theoretically, it was not planned to use it and counter FPV drones. Selidove is a more or less large settlement, and therefore it can be used as a bridgehead for quartering, or accommodation, or pulling up some resources. Therefore, in any case, the loss of any settlement that retains any logistical routes or capabilities will pose a problem. Geographically, Selidove is in the lowlands, but still it is a fairly large settlement, and further on we see that they are trying to push the Pokrovsky Front very hard, they are not stopping and are pulling up fresh reserves. All measures are being taken and every effort is being made to prevent the enemy from advancing further. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Selidovoy district, the Russian occupiers take pity on their own soldiers and literally step on the corpses of their henchmen.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/drony-matky-pid-selydovym-vorog-prorvavsya-do-mista-zavdyaky-znachnij-perevazi-v-zhyvij-syli/	2024-10-27T10:41:19-07:00
The occupiers are taking North Korean mercenaries to the front in trucks with civilian license plate...	This is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The driver who was in the trailer of reinforcements from North Korea did not have a combat warrant. In another radio intercept obtained by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the staff members of the 810th separate brigade of marines of the Russian occupation army, to which the North Korean assistance from KamAZ was intended, are trying to find out whether they have a stopped truck on the balance sheet and why the driver does not have the proper papers. The GUR of the IOU emphasized that there will be a fair retribution for every war crime committed against Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine intercepted the conversations of servicemen of the 810th separate brigade of marines of the 18th army of the Southern Military District (of the Russian Federation), which is participating in hostilities in the Kursk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/okupanty-vezut-na-front-pivnichnokorejskyh-najmancziv-vantazhivkamy-z-czyvilnymy-nomeramy/	2024-10-27T10:28:59-07:00

They walk over corpses: in the East, the Russians put 600 of their own soldiers behind a village fro...	About the tactics of the Russian occupiers in the East, the ruthlessness of the Russian invaders towards local civilians and their own soldiers, and the situation in the Selidovoy district on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon told Vyacheslav, commander of the company of the -Shershni Dovbush- strike unmanned aerial systems of the 68th separate hunting brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush. — We held positions on the outskirts of Selidovoy for a long time, and our friendly units of the brigade also stood. They held out for a long time, but constant assaults, a constant meat grinder, constant attacks of manpower and equipment&#8230; How many are being destroyed in this direction - the numbers are colossal - and the assaults are in fact never ending, he said. The military described the ruthless attitude of the enemy command towards its own soldiers. — I have very little understanding of how this can happen, when the army can afford to put 600 men in a week in our small direction, when they stormed a village with a length of one street in a kilometer. There, the whole road was covered with the dead bodies of Russian soldiers. I thought they should have retreated, regrouped. But, apparently, they have such reserves that they constantly attack and the attack does not decrease. Therefore, they still have some success, the commander of the drones reported. The defender explained how this happens. — Someone somewhere will fix the -300-m-, one or two, and they will come. And this is what happened to Selidov. They held advanced positions, somewhere they broke through, everyone started pushing into that gap, started to pass, Vyacheslav said. The soldier compared the attitude of Ukrainians to their brothers and the occupiers to their henchmen. - We don't even have that, you see, if there is movement in our country and someone there is injured or something else, then an evacuation is carried out, we stop such actions, and they don't pay attention, said the soldier. the Russians continue to advance, regardless of their own soldiers - neither dead nor even wounded. — If a -brother- falls, they continue moving anyway, regardless of whether he is the -300th- or the -200th-, whether they can help him, provide assistance - no one cares about that, Vyacheslav explained. He described one situation recorded by Ukrainian drones. — It was even worse: once we hit enemy infantry with a drone. Two units were moving, we -triggered- one. He fell, taking his weapon. And the second one continued to move, he did not provide any help to his -brother-, he continued to move. Then this wounded man took a machine gun and started shooting at his comrade, who ran away from him. That is, their interaction is like this, said the commander of -Shershniv Dovbusha-. Earlier, he recalled the following behavior of the occupiers: - The enemy does not understand during the offensive. It even happens that [they shoot] at their own people, not only at civilians, but they also open fire at their own people, when they land infantry with vehicles. Let's say that we have already repeatedly observed the situation that even when turning around, the armored personnel carrier tries to go quickly so that we do not hit it with drones or artillery. And he even simply chokes [his own] infantry with his own equipment and turns back. He does not always return successfully - very rarely, - said the Ukrainian military officer. In view of this, he is not surprised that the occupiers also shoot civilians - not valuing their own lives, they do not value the lives of others even more. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that The Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine for Rights person reacted to the information spreading in social networks about the alleged shooting of two women by the occupiers in the city of Selidove, an investigation has been launched into the facts of the killing of civilians by the occupiers of Selydovogo. Meanwhile Ukrainian fighters in Selidovo saved two civilians from Russian shelling.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/idut-po-trupah-na-shodi-rosiyany-poklaly-za-tyzhden-600-vlasnyh-soldativ-za-selo-z-odniyeyi-vulyczi/	2024-10-27T09:41:45-07:00
The takeoff was successful, the landing is doubtful: modified FPV drones are hunting Russian reconna...	They published a video of combat work on their channel. The war with the Russian occupiers continues not only on the ground, but also in the sky. -46 OAeMBr cuts the enemy's wings. Enemy planes do not even come close to Ukrainian positions, because they know: there was a takeoff, landing is unlikely. But drones, especially reconnaissance drones, are still a real nuisance to our fellow citizens,- the report says. According to the paratroopers, reconnaissance UAVs are mostly invisible from the ground to the naked eye, they direct and adjust the fire of artillery and MLRS, point the way to Iskanders and KABs. The 46th OAeMBr said that recently, with the joint efforts of the air defense and RUBpAK units, freelance calculations (crews) were created to detect and destroy small aerial targets - UAVs of the operational-tactical level in the defense zone of the 46th OAeMBr. It is about the use of modified FPV drones to intercept Russian reconnaissance drones such as Zala, Supercam, etc. -So soon the free and impunity flights of the enemy's -wings- and -eyes- will be put to an end. Or at least the ability of the occupiers to conduct aerial reconnaissance is significantly limited,- the paratroopers said. Earlier, ArmyInform showed how during the day the occupiers tanky-ta-avtivky-rosiyan/->six times resorted to assaults in the zone of responsibility of the 46th separate air mobile brigade of the Russian Air Force in the Kurakhiv direction, but the Ukrainian defenders repelled the enemy attacks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/zlit-buv-posadka-navryad-nashi-modyfikovani-fpv-drony-polyuyut-na-rozviduvalni-bpla-rf/	2024-10-27T09:26:30-07:00

The Ombudsman reacted to the alleged shooting of two women by the occupiers	Dmytro Lubinets wrote about this in his Telegram channel. According to him, if the facts of the crime are proven, this is not only a violation of human rights, it is a gross violation of the laws and customs of war, the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. -The alleged shooting of two women by the occupiers in Selidove is a war crime! And the culprits must be brought to justice! He immediately sent letters to international organizations: the UN and the ICRC. I am waiting for a reaction. Russia commits crimes every day in Ukraine!- he assured. Dmytro Lubinets emphasized that the aggressor must be stopped, and the criminals must be punished now. Let us remind you that the released video shows how representatives of the aggressor state's troops probably shot a civilian car with an automatic weapon. During the attack, two citizens were in the salon, one of them was wounded. Currently a pre-trial investigation is being conducted in criminal proceedings for violations of the laws and customs of war. As reported by ArmyInform, after that at the scene military forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces arrived and, pulling the victim out of the line of fire, provided him with first aid and evacuated civilians from under fire.

As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the -Heavenly Dream- unmanned systems battalion of the 43rd mechanized brigade were able to hit the enemy's MSV with full ammunition.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/podarunok-z-nebes-vorozha-tehnika-vybuhaye-na-minah-vstanovlenyh-z-droniv/	2024-10-27T07:49:06-07:00

For two days he fought with a bullet near his spine, and the first aid was provided by a captured pa...	The story about the fighter was published on October 27 on the brigade's page. The fighter entered the army recently, waiting for the country to call. -The HR department received a summons at work. I've been thinking about mobilizing since the first days of the full-scale invasion, but there have been one reason to put it off and another. And then the summons came and I didn't argue anymore. Then passed the BZVP. I don't regret for a moment that I ended up here. It's very cool, I met many interesting people,- said Mazai. In the brigade, he mastered the specialty of a sniper. He says that he has been interested in weapons since childhood. -Before the war, I worked as a forester for five years. He kept various accounts, planted a forest, managed some people. The same as now: he walked around the forest with a weapon, shooting various pests. So, the work has not changed,- the fighter joked. At the beginning of the Kursk operation, Mazai and his partner were in reserve. A little later, they received the command to move forward. -I gathered my thoughts, we were brought to a combat position, everything was wonderful. At first it looked like chaos to me, then I began to notice order. I listened carefully to what they told me, because I really want to live. And they told me: you will live if you obey. I did not retreat from that memorandum, not even for a second,- Mazai shared his memories. During the advance through enemy territory, the sniper detected the first opponents by ear. This gave the advantage of several important seconds to prepare for contact. -My first fight started with a beautiful journey through the dreamlands. We went into landing, there were Russians from several sides. Two groups of boys were walking in front, and we had to cover their rear. We went into the forest, met them, and they told us that the Russians were walking behind us. They sat down and began to wait. I overheard the conversation. There was very dense vegetation everywhere, a kind of mini-jungle. And then I saw a red bandage. At that moment, he was confused and not at the same time. He started shooting, shot one in the shoulder. Then he noticed that people can run very fast. When he started to shoot, the boys felt elation and started to pour there too. Words are difficult to convey those emotions. Then I changed my position, saw how the Russians were moving. The guys found a trophy machine gun somewhere. It was impressive, to say the least. Even during the movement, he -took off his hat- from one enemy soldier. I hope he caught a bad cold from that,- the fighter joked. On the same day, Mazai received his first wound. -At first I thought it was not difficult. Then I hurried a little, got up and the enemy bullet passed between the kidney and the liver, stopped near the spine. At first, it was not felt. But when I tried to shoot two more times, my ribs hurt a lot. My first question then was whether you can smoke in battle. I never had a panic attack. I didn't think that everything was bad, that I was dying. I had very good support from my comrade in arms. For the next two days I continued to perform my combat duties. We took a prisoner even then. In the evening, our enemies left their wounded. Their paramedic was supposed to go after him and stay with him until the evacuees arrived. But the nurse came to visit us. He really wanted to live, and instantly gave up. That orderly even helped me a little,- said Mazai. For a fighter, experience on the battlefield has shown that the most difficult part of a sniper's job is the need to walk a lot. And also, it is important to work not only with weapons, but also with the head. -I thought it would be difficult to shoot people. But when it came down to it, it turned out to be the easiest. Not such a terrible enemy as it is portrayed. It was probably quite easy for me to stay in the positions. The first time in the positions I was worried, but everything went smoothly. If you obey the commanders, remember what you were taught, everything will be fine. Taking the initiative into one's own hands is fatal. And if there is a comrade nearby who can help, give advice, then it is most useful,- the fighter noted. After a few months in the ranks of the 80th brigade, the young paratrooper is motivated most by his family and the desire to liberate the country from the invaders. -Actually, I have been very ideological since childhood. My great-grandfather fought for Ukraine. Father also wants to join the army, but he cannot do it, because he does not have one hand. He supports me morally, he can always find the right words,- said Mazai. Currently, he continues to recover from his injuries and is waiting to return to his duties. -First of all, I would like my brothers who are currently in Kurshchyna to take all instructions and advice seriously.

However, in the same Vremiivsk direction, 22 assaults are quite a large number. It was the day before yesterday or the day before yesterday, and yesterday there was a constant amount of assault going on there, he said. In Kherson region, Russian invaders are trying to move closer to the regional center to terrorize the city. — As for the Kherson direction, there, too, the enemy carries out about 5-7 to 10 assaults every day, trying to take control of the island part of the Dnieper and advance closer to Kherson. The enemy is constantly launching missile strikes, airstrikes and drone strikes on Kherson, the spokesman said. When shelling populated areas, the Russians hit civilian objects and local residents not only randomly, but also purposefully target the civilian population. — In particular, over the past day we had almost 350 strikes by kamikaze drones. These are strikes not only on civilian infrastructure, the enemy is conducting a real hunt on civilian road transport, on public transport, the civilian population is suffering, the officer said. The situation in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast is the same. -In addition, the enemy is constantly shelling the Dnipropetrovsk region, in particular, shelling the Nikopol community and the Marganets community, which are located on the right bank of the former Kakhovsky reservoir,- the military officer said. The spokesman explained the actions of the Russian occupiers as a desire to terrorize Ukraine in various ways with the aim of making the lives of Ukrainians unbearable. — The situation in the South is quite complicated, the residents of Ukraine are constantly suffering from enemy attacks, because the enemy sees here as a direction from where he can at any moment increase the influence of fire, increase terror against Ukraine, Vladyslav Voloshyn said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that komentar/->UU -Tavria- provided an official comment on The Economist's information about the alleged plans of the Russian invaders for Zaporizhzhia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/polyuyut-na-czyvilnyh-u-transporti-pa-pivdni-vorog-teroryzuye-misczevyh-meshkancziv/	2024-10-27T06:03:14-07:00

It is not known for what reasons the invader switched to locomotion with 4 limbs at once, but he stubbornly, although not quickly, climbed the forest strip.

During the competition, pilots had to hit a balloon attached to a Mavic quadcopter. -This is a very difficult exercise, because the ball does not move along a straight path - it is constantly lobbed in all directions.

The Economist's information about the plans of the Russian invaders for Zaporizhzhia on the air of the national telethon -Edyni Novyni- commented by the spokesperson of the OUV -Tavria- Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn. — According to our intelligence, no offensive groups have been identified in the South. That is, if the enemy has any ambitious plans and The Economist has its data, its insiders among the Russian General Staff, then they can say anything. I am stating what our intelligence can see and what it has found out: that is, there are no offensive groups there, he said. However, in general, the intentions and plans of the enemy are clear - the Russians seek to advance further with the aim of improving their tactical position and creating the threat of shelling large population centers, including with the aim of terror against local civilians. — But, of course, it is logical that the adversary will try to reshape the configuration of the battle line for its own benefit, to bring forces and means closer to such large cities, to such large population centers as Zaporizhzhia, in order to inflict damage by certain means from there, and not only our Defense Forces of Ukraine, and to carry out terror, which the enemy is doing, against the local [civilian — ed.] population, striking Zaporizhzhia with guided aerial bombs, the spokesman emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the enemy's success in the area of the front in the Levadny region is of a limited nature, the dominant heights around the field state are controlled by the Defense Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/zaporizhzhya-the-economist-ta-mozhlyvi-plany-okupantiv-v-ouv-tavriya-nadaly-oficzijnyj-komentar/	2024-10-27T05:11:32-07:00

The Levadny district is controlled by the Armed Forces: the enemy's success is limited	Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . -On that section of the battle line after Ugledar, the enemy increased certain efforts, regrouped and carried out massive assault actions, as a result of which he had partial success, that is, he wedged into our defense to the depth of approximately a platoon's strong point,- he said. However, the Defense Forces are currently taking measures to stabilize the situation and restore lost positions. — As for Levadny itself, I would not be in a hurry to call it a settlement, because it is a simple field state, which was located in a certain lowland, and therefore it is somewhat difficult to defend it, to conduct defensive actions, let's say. Currently, all command heights in this area of ​​the combat clash are under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and a defensive operation to restore the position is ongoing, the spokesperson assured. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that, resorting to air terror tactics, the occupiers turned Orikhiv into a ruin, and also informed that the enemy does not abandon the intention to take control of the islands in the Dnieper river and a real river war is going on there.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/rajon-levadnogo-kontrolyuyut-zsu-uspih-voroga-maye-obmezhenyj-harakter/	2024-10-27T04:14:47-07:00

Ironing with KABs and advancing with the cheapest resource: the Armed Forces revealed the goal of th...	In detail about the repulse of the enemy assault, the situation on the left bank of the Oskil River, the threat of guided aerial bombs and the cheapest resource of the occupiers on the air of the -Espresso- TV channel told captain Yury Fedorenko, commander of the battalion of unmanned attack aircraft complexes -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket captain Ivan Sirk. - This was not some unexpected attack. The enemy is now very active in the Kupyan district. A decision was made on the forced resettlement of Ukrainian citizens from the Kupyan Oblast, because there is an immediate threat to their lives and health. Why does this happen? The enemy still has the ability to use aviation in a highly intensive manner, guided air bombs attack the left bank of the Kupyan region from morning to night and fly into Kupyansk itself, so it was necessary to take these measures to preserve life and health, he said. The task of the occupiers, with the help of Yury Fedorenko, remains unchanged. -The enemy's task remains the same - to reach the left bank of the Oskil River, gain a secure foothold and expand to Kupyansk-Vuzlovoi in order to fully take control of the left-bank Kupyan region,- explained the soldier. In an effort to achieve their goal, the Russian occupiers regularly carry out offensive actions in the Kupyan direction. — As a result, the enemy has been very actively conducting shock and assault operations for more than two and a half months. Two weeks ago, there was a massive assault with the involvement of armored vehicles - 50 units were used by the enemy and the Defense Forces destroyed almost all of them on the battlefield. Then the -Achilles- battalion destroyed 20 units, another 20 were shot down and then burned by the Defense Forces, the officer recalled. The new enemy assault was also considerable, although much smaller than this previous one. — This time the enemy deployed 17 units of armored vehicles at the moment along with assault infantry. As a result, 15 units were destroyed and an additional 2 were hit. The -Achilles- battalion destroyed 8 BMPs that day, as well as 2 tanks and, of course, assault infantry, the military said. The commander of the drones reminded that at the moment the main and cheapest resource in the Russian army is manpower. — Where the enemy cannot succeed through the use of his armored vehicles, he tries to succeed through the use of manpower. For the enemy, it continues to be the cheapest resource at the moment, Yuriy Fedorenko explained. The defense forces of Ukraine are giving a decent rebuff to the Russian invaders. - In one way or another, the enemy can start fresh replenishment and keep the level of hostilities at the -high intensity- mark. Today, too, fierce, complex battles continue. At the moment, we managed to eliminate 6 occupiers and wound another 14. There was also additional training on equipment - not only armored, but also highly mobile. This is what the enemy uses for operational movement, in particular, and to the front line of the battle - two-wheeled motorcycles, buggies, said the military officer. He assured that despite all the efforts of the enemy and the difficulty of the battles in the Kupyan direction, the Defense Forces manage to restrain the enemy. — Now very difficult battles are going on in Kupyansk, very difficult. But the Defense Forces stopped the advance of the enemy. Despite the insane losses he suffers on the battlefield, he is unable to complete the task set before him. They were not able to gain a full foothold on the left bank of the Oskil River, so the battle continues, the officer said. Yuriy Fedorenko told how it was possible to restrain the advance of the invaders. — Did the enemy manage to fully entrench, dig in and hold this territory? No. Currently, systematic work is being carried out, in certain shades there is a living force of the enemy that is migrating, trying to find shelter. Unmanned systems work in it, artillery works in it. Unfortunately, the enemy managed to sneak into the settlement. But has it managed to gain a foothold? No! said the soldier. The captain predicted that the opponent would not be successful in the near future. — The fighting continues now and I am convinced that the enemy will not succeed in the short term in fully reliably occupying the bridgehead and begin expanding their zone of influence along the left bank of the Kupyanska in the Oskil River, said Yuriy Fedorenko. The military explained that it is necessary for the Defense Forces to confront the enemy even more intensively. -Therefore, it is about the fact that in order to achieve a positive result, the defense forces need a little more equipment and means, because the activity of the enemy remains highly active, although it would be correct to use another word,- said the commander of the -Achilles- battalion. Earlier, ArmyInform explained, will the mud with the onset of natural autumn stop the offensive actions of the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/prasuyut-kabamy-ta-prosuvayutsya-najdeshevshym-resursom-u-zsu-rozkryly-metu-okupantiv-na-kupyanshhyni/	2024-10-27T01:53:18-07:00

The video of the lesions was released on October 27. -Gerbers- cost less than -shahedis-, so the enemy often launches them without a combat unit, as a decoy to distract our air defense. Shooting down -Gerbers- with the help of FPV drones is a sign that soon our pilots can start shooting down -Shahedis- in the same way. FPV drones are cheaper than missiles or projectiles for air defense systems, and their use will prevent Russian plans to deplete Ukrainian air defense.

According to him, the first factory is already in operation, the equipment is being serviced there and the production line for the Lynx BMP production is in operation. The second and third plants, still under construction, will produce gunpowder and ammunition. Finally, the company's fourth plant will produce air defense systems. The director of Rheinmetall said that he is quite satisfied with the protection of these plants in Ukraine. -We run a strong training program for people to teach them what to do there. I am glad that we can move forward very quickly on some issues. Of course, from the German side, from the Ukrainian side, the issue of bureaucracy sometimes arises, but in the end, everything works,- said Armin Papperger. As reported by ArmyInform, a German-Ukrainian seminar was held of defense industries DFNC2.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/do-kinczya-roku-zavod-rheinmetall-v-ukrayini-vypustyt-pershu-partiyu-bmp-lynx/	2024-10-27T00:39:57-07:00

Mud tanks, crossroads and Russian assaults: will the mud stop the offensive actions of the occupiers	This was discussed on the Espresso TV channel by the commander of the Achilles unmanned aerial systems battalion of the 92nd separate Captain Yury Fedorenko of the assault brigade named after Ivan Sirko of the Koshovo Otaman. -The intersection will not significantly affect the course of hostilities, since assault operations are carried out by infantry units, and infantry moves in almost any weather,- he said. The military officer explained that under insurmountable weather conditions, the enemy, of course, suspends offensive operations. However, it immediately restores them after the weather improves. — It is clear that when it rains heavily, the enemy also stops at that moment. But as soon as the rain stops, his infantry goes forward, and for them the crossroads does not present significant obstacles, explained the officer. The change in weather conditions will also affect the logistics of the occupiers, making conditions somewhat worse, but this effect will not be critical. - As for logistics, the intensity of supply, of course, it will decrease somewhat, but the enemy will not lose the ability to conduct shock-assault actions, - said Yuriy Fedorenko. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the East, the Russian command of the occupying army more often throws not only infantry into the assaults, but also armored vehicles, which it tried to save before that and explained, why Russians voluntarily die by the thousands in -meat- assaults.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/tanky-brudu-rozdorizhzhya-ta-rosijski-shturmy-chy-zupynyt-bagnyuka-nastupalni-diyi-okupantiv/	2024-10-27T00:11:04-07:00

The video of the killed and captured Kadyriv soldiers was released on October 27 on the channel of the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Kadyrivtsev, known for their exploits in the field of cinematography, filmed a video showing how strong and brave they are before the battle. -However, all their self-confidence was blown away on the battlefield, and they died one by one - the paratroopers destroyed them all. However, among the Russians there were two intelligent people who value their lives more than their dictator. Yes, they surrendered and remained alive. They were immediately provided with medical assistance,- the brigade reported. Kadyrivets, as the elite of the Russian army, are replaced by the Russians in the first place, in contrast to simple -vanoks-. As reported by ArmyInform, scouts of the 95th Polish Assault Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces destroyed a group of the 155th marine brigade of the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Federation, which was supposed to mine the paths of advancement of Ukrainian units.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/ahmad-salo-garmatne-na-kurshhyni-chastkovo-znyshhyly-a-chastkovo-polonyly-kadyrivskyh-tiktokeriv/	2024-10-26T23:55:58-07:00
The defense forces repelled 174 enemy attacks per day — the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukr...	Operational information as of at 08:00 on October 27 was published by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The situation at the front remains difficult. The enemy, using their advantage in manpower and equipment, is relentlessly attacking our positions. Ukrainian defenders steadfastly restrained the onslaught of the occupiers and inflicted significant losses on the enemy. The aggressor carried out airstrikes, in particular, in the areas of the settlements of Khrapivshchyna, Yablunivka, Myropyllya, Basivka, Hoptivka, Kozacha Lopan, Odradne, Pischane, Hlushkivka, Berestov, Zagryzove, Terny, Chasiv Yar, Toretsk, Kostiantynivka, Mirnograd, Uspenivka, Mali Shcherbaki, Mala Tokmachka , Lviv. Over the past day, aviation, missile forces and artillery of the Defense Forces hit two enemy command and observation posts, six areas of concentration of personnel, weapons and military equipment, one air defense vehicle and two enemy guns. In the Kharkiv direction, the enemy stormed our positions seven times near the settlements of Vovchansk and Staritsa. In the Kupyan direction, 14 attacks by invaders took place during the day. The defense forces repelled enemy assaults near Kindrashyvka, Synkivka, Petropavlivka, Kruglyakivka, Zagryzovy, Vyshnevoy, Berestovoy, and Pershotravnevyo. The enemy actively used bombing and attack aircraft for strikes on the direction. In the Lyman direction, the aggressor attacked 18 times. He tried to penetrate our defenses near Kindrashyvka, Synkivka, Petropavlivka, Kruglyakivka, Zagryzovy, Vyshnevoy, Berestovoy and Pershotravnevy. On the Siverskyi direction, Ukrainian defenders repelled two assaults by Russian invaders near Bilogorivka. In the direction of Toretsk, the enemy, with the support of aviation, launched nine attacks in the direction of Toretsk and Shcherbinivka. In the Pokrovsky direction, our defenders stopped 41 assault and offensive actions of the aggressor in the areas of the settlements of Vozdvizhenka, Myrolyubivka, Promin, Lysivka, Krutyy Yar, Krasnyy Yar, Mykolaivka and Selidove. The greatest concentration of enemy attacks was near Selidovoy. In the Kurakhiv direction, the Defense Forces repelled 43 attacks. The occupiers most actively tried to advance near Antonivka and Katerynivka. In addition, the enemy attacked in the direction of Novoselidivka, Gostroy, Dalnyi, Kostyantynivka, Elizavetivka. In the Vremivsk direction, the enemy carried out five assaults on our positions in the Bogoyavlenka and Novoukrainka districts. In the Orichiv direction, the Russian invaders once stormed the positions of our soldiers in vain. Five times in vain, the invading troops tried to dislodge units of the Defense Forces from their positions in the Dnieper direction. The operation is ongoing in the Kursk region. Russian aviation continues to bomb its villages and cities. Over the past day, Russian planes have carried out 30 airstrikes with 45 anti-aircraft missiles on their own territory. No signs of the formation of enemy offensive groups were detected in the Volyn and Poliske directions. On the border with the Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the enemy from the territory of the Russian Federation is actively using artillery and aviation in the areas of Ukrainian settlements. Our soldiers inflict significant losses in manpower and equipment on the occupying forces and actively undermine the offensive potential of the enemy in the rear. In general, the Russian invaders lost 1,440 people last day. Ukrainian soldiers also destroyed 4 tanks, 23 armored combat vehicles, 39 artillery systems, 73 operational-tactical UAVs, 100 vehicles and a unit of special equipment. As reported by ArmyInform, more than 1,400 soldiers and almost 40 guns voroga-genshtab-zsu/->made up the losses of the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/syly-oborony-vidbyly-174-vorozhi-ataky-za-dobu-genshtab-zsu/	2024-10-26T23:28:22-07:00

The video of the battle was published on the channel of the Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi. Aerial reconnaissance of the 3rd mechanized battalion detected the accumulation and advancement of the enemy column in time. The enemy used a total of several dozen pieces of equipment: tanks with trawls, armored personnel carriers and BMPs with infantry. -Thanks to the prompt response, the joint efforts of our units: 3 mechanized battalions, 1 special purpose company, as well as operators of the 194th pontoon-bridge brigade of the State Special Transport Service managed to hit about 20 pieces of equipment. The number of liquidated infantry is difficult to count,- the brigade commented on the video. Several interesting moments of the battle can be noted. So at 0:17 you can see how the occupiers opened the landing compartment to meet our drone. Russian armored vehicles were encased as much as possible in the additional armor of grill screens, but this did not prevent the drones of the Bulava nf -Chimera- units from successfully hitting a large number of enemy combat vehicles. During the offensive test, the Russians tried to move exclusively along the tracks from the tracks of the cars that had passed earlier. The reason for this caution, most likely, is the large minefields created by the Defense Forces in this direction. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 2nd mechanized battalion of the Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky destroyed an assault group of Russians that tried to approach our positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/goryt-palaye-tehnika-vorozha-ponad-20-odynycz-vidbyttya-velykogo-rosijskogo-shturmu-bilya-vugledaru/	2024-10-26T23:21:17-07:00

Maly and Minion cleaned up the positions they had recaptured from the Russians. The minion threw a grenade into the Russian dugout and ran across its roof. The ammunition ignited from the explosion. Suddenly, they heard a shout from the dugout: -Yours!-. However, the Russian occupier with the call sign -Georgian- turned out to be -his-. He almost burned, was slightly wounded and begged not to be killed. Later it turned out that he had been hiding in this dugout for more than a month - it was deadly dangerous to go back, as well as forward. The Georgian survived the FPV strike and hid from our troops, who managed to enter these positions earlier. In particular, Little and Minion were able to take trophies from there: weapons, walkie-talkies and a helmet with the inscription -Georgian-. But her owner managed to remain unnoticed at that time, and he met with the Ukrainian soldiers much later. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the 93rd mechanized brigade -Cold Ravine- were able to track down and hit the Russian Lancet kamikaze drone, which was flying to strike at our equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/ponad-misyacz-hovavsya-u-blindazhi-boyavsya-i-svoyih-i-nashyh-rosijskyj-polonenyj-z-pozyvnym-gruzyn-perezhyv-pozhezhu-ta-udar-fpv/	2024-10-26T22:31:10-07:00

The enemy is intensively attacking the Ukrainian defenders in the Pokrovsky direction. Here, during the day, the aggressor carried out 40 assault and offensive actions. The Russian occupiers are most active in the areas of Vozdvizhenka, Myrolyubivka, Promenya, Lysivka, Krutoy Yar, Krasnoy Yar, Mykolaivka, and Selidovoy. In total, Ukrainian defenders have already repelled 36 attacks in the direction, four more clashes are ongoing. The situation is difficult, but controlled by the Defense Forces. Our soldiers are making efforts to prevent the enemy from advancing deep into Ukrainian territory. According to the currently available information, the losses of the aggressor in this direction amounted to about 300 people killed and wounded. Five vehicles, one motorcycle and one buggy were destroyed. In addition, eight cars, three mortars and one motorcycle were damaged.

The Kursk operation: will it be able to change the course of the war. Expert opinion	-It turned out that their all-powerful intelligence could not see such a large-scale operation. And this is a large-scale corps-level operation. No less. Why corps level? Because the forces and means that are concentrated there, up to 50 thousand people, this is exactly what a corps is. Second moment. It turns out that a non-nuclear country can launch a conventional military strike against a nuclear country and a nuclear apocalypse does not occur. True, this is not the only case in history. Argentina also struck a nuclear country in 1982 during the Falklands War. Here it is necessary to emphasize very correctly that this is not the only precedent. What tasks in the interests of Ukraine continues to be performed by the Kursk operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine? The operation in Kurshchyna focuses on itself a part of Russian reserves, which the Kremlin cannot use to strengthen its offensive in Ukraine. Indeed, the Russians have attracted a considerable amount of forces and resources there, primarily from the Pokrovsky direction. As we can see, as a result, their offensive stalled there. Second, the exchange fund is replenished with Russian prisoners of war, and this is also no less important. Putin is no longer the -security guarantor- of Russia. The Ukrainian offensive undermines the image of the Russian dictator. I think the Kursk region is important in the future as a possible exchange fund for territories. Why not? It's quite a working tool. Conditionally, we are changing the Kursk bridgehead to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Waiting for precipitation is literally several weeks, a month. The weather will make it impossible for the enemy's heavy equipment to pass. And then it will be time for a counter-battery. The defense forces of Ukraine will suppress and destroy the artillery of the Russian invaders. In this aspect, we are head and shoulders above the Rashists. In recent months alone, more than 18,000 different enemy artillery systems have been destroyed (damaged). We have simply unique American counter-battery systems AN/TPQ- 36, 48, 50. The German COBRA radar system, which at a distance of up to 100 km is capable of detecting and classifying up to 40 units of artillery systems in two minutes. This accuracy is a very important component. This is exactly the phenomenon of this war: we outplay the Russians in quality, not quantity in the counter-battery fight. Of course, time will tell how it will be in reality. In my personal opinion, we should strengthen our (military-diplomatic - ed.) positions for the summer of 2025. The next cycle of dry weather could see a fundamental upheaval in this war. It is important that it is in our favor.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/kurska-operacziya-chy-zmozhe-zminyty-hid-vijny-dumka-eksperta/	2024-10-26T22:00:56-07:00
The war of drones in the Black Sea and the failure of special operations of the Russian Federation: ...	However, the use of mine weapons in the Russian-Ukrainian war will enter a new page in the history of mine warfare at sea. After all, mine weapons have never before been used as a means of modern robotic warfare. This happened for the first time and it was done by Ukrainians. About the specifics of mine warfare in the Black Sea, the loss of Russian control over the sea area, the destruction of enemy ships, the strengthening of the anti-mine capabilities of our Navy, ArmiyaInform told a candidate of military sciences, captain of the 1st rank in retired Stepan Yakymyak: -Mine weapons during the repulse of a large-scale invasion of Russian troops into Ukraine became a cementing element of the anti-landing defense of the sea coast of Ukraine in the Black Sea. On the eve of the invasion, the Russians increased the landing capabilities of the Black Sea Fleet with six more large landing ships from the Northern and Baltic Fleets. The enemy had a firm intention to capture Odesa and Mykolayiv Oblast, the loss of which could lead to the enemy's capture of Ukraine from the south. However, defensive anti-landing sea mine barriers were created in advance and officially declared by Ukraine to be prohibited for navigation seven coastal areas became a barrier for groups of enemy forces. Thus, having complete superiority in the air and at sea in the first days, the enemy clearly understood that he could not overcome this obstacle , because for this it was necessary to destroy coastal artillery and spend considerable time searching for and destroying sea mines. However, as it turned out, this was only the beginning of this new mine warfare at sea. The next stage of mine warfare was the use of rf drifting sea mines on the surface. The enemy did this purposefully to stop international shipping, compromise Ukraine in the eyes of its partners, and exert psychological pressure on the crews of civilian ships. In violation of the norms of International Maritime Law, in particular the Hague Convention of 1907, the Muscovite military leadership created a threat to shipping uncontrolled use of mine weapons. Acting according to the techniques of information struggle, the enemy in the person of the captain of the port of Sochi, who is an official representative of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, on March 18, 2022, distributed an -interesting- letter under the number 348/0162. It states that there is a mine threat in the southwestern and northwestern parts of the Black Sea due to the fact that, as a result of the storms, about -420 UM and YRM mines- installed by the -Ukrainian Navy on the approaches to the ports of Odesa, Ochakiv, Chornomorsk, Pivdenny-. But this message turned out to be more than just misinformation. Drifting mines do appear throughout the water area of ​​the southwestern part of the Black Sea, and more precisely in the maritime space of coastal states: March 26, 2022 - in the Turkish Bosphorus, March 28 - off the coast of Turkey and Romania, April 6 - off the coast of Turkey, 31 July and December 10, 2022, August 13, 2023 – in Romanian waters. It was no longer an information war, but a real threat to the lives of the crew members of ships flying the flags of various countries that carried out non-military transportation in the Black Sea and the waters of non-belligerent states. However, the Russian Federation did not succeed in compromising Ukraine in the eyes of its partners. True information was provided, which dispelled the myths of misinformation. Already on March 29, 2022 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine distributed a statement regarding the illegal activities of the Russian Federation in the Black Sea. On the other hand, the international community faced the problem of ensuring the safety of shipping and bringing the Russian Federation to criminal legal responsibility for crimes at sea. On the part of the Russian Federation, it was a real, well thought out, but ineffectively conducted special operation with the use of mine weapons. The next and again unprecedented step of the Russian Federation in violating the norms of international law was the mining of the areas near the mouth of the Danube River and the Snake Island. That is, on the shipping lanes of the -grain corridor- created by Ukraine after the refusal of the Russian Federation to implement the agreement on the Black Sea Grain Initiative. This corridor was also used as a humanitarian one for the withdrawal of foreign ships that were blocked in Ukrainian ports as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Without the possibility of attracting surface ships and submarines to lay mines in these areas, in early autumn 2023 2018, the Muscovites attempted to drop mine-explosive devices by bomber aircraft from what seemed to them to be a safe border at the time. That is, the planes carried out mortars without entering the damage zone of air defense equipment deployed on the Ukrainian coast. From the very beginning, the insidious plan of the enemy was almost immediately discovered by the Ukrainian military sailors. Understanding the enemy's intentions, they observed the laying of mines by the enemy's aircraft and destroyed the mines in the sea. Finally, on December 5, 2023, the enemy's actions to mine the areas of the -grain corridor- by aircraft were stopped. Air defense forces shot down an enemy Su-24 aircraft that was trying to drop mines. The enemy realized that it had become dangerous here and refused to continue this operation. The successful defense of the -grain corridor- by the Defense Forces of Ukraine during the first four months created the conditions for the export by sea of ​​seven million tons cargo. From August 8 to the beginning of December 2023, 200 ships left the ports of Odessa and 226 entered. The mine countermeasures of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine played an important role in this. ships under the flags of foreign states. Only from September to December 2023, 5 ships under the flags of Togo, Turkey, Liberia and Panama were blown up by mines. For example, the bulk carrier Vyssos under the flag of Panama, which was heading to one of the Danube ports to load grain, was blown up by a mine in Ukrainian waters. The ship lost speed and control, a fire broke out on the upper deck. Two sailors were injured. Unfortunately, the list of bombings of civilian ships under the flags of foreign states that did not participate in the war in the Black Sea is not exhaustive. There were other cases and, in the end, the war continues... However, the purpose of the enemy's actions was not achieved. The export of grain and other cargo from Ukrainian ports through the -grain corridor- successfully continued. In October 2023, as a result of a covert operation to lay sea mines by the forces of the Armed Forces Navy of Ukraine and SBU with the use of unmanned sea systems during the external raid of Sevastopol, four Russian warships were hit. In the course of this unique operation, modernized sea unmanned vehicles of the type Sea Baby was exposed to at least 15 sea mines, each weighing about 180 kg. Preparation lasted at least one and a half months, in particular, during this time, the maneuvering routes of Russian warships on the external raid of Sevastopol were monitored. The entrance to the internal raid of Sevastopol (to the Sevastopol bay) was at that time tightly protected by the enemy with booms and other barriers, which made it difficult for unmanned vehicles to penetrate the ships in the bay. As you know, the laying of mines lasted several weeks, in total the devices traveled more than 3,000 miles to their staging areas and back. During one of the outings at sea, the unmanned device was discovered by three Raptor-class patrol boats. That is why it struck a grenade launcher (our unmanned aircraft is equipped with a grenade launcher &#8211; ed.) at Russian boats, as a result of which one of the enemy boats was damaged. However, the enemy failed to detect the placement of mines exposed mine barriers and after that the events on the external raid of Sevastopol became more and more interesting and fun every day. Yes, on October 11 2023, the patrol ship -Derzhavin- was blown up while moving to the Sevastopol base (the starboard side was probably damaged); Two days later the same ship blew up again while trying to move to another base for repairs. On the same day, a tugboat that was going to help -Derzhavin- was also blown up by a mine. And a few days later, in the same area during mine countermeasures, one of the two newest project 12770 mine countermeasure ships in the Russian Navy was blown up. Preliminary analysis of the events and consequences of this operation testified that marine robotic systems significantly change the nature of actions at sea. It is possible that only the insufficient amount of explosive substance in the exposed sea mines did not allow to achieve the maximum result and ensure the complete destruction of the ships. However, and this is the most important, what effect did this operation have on the nature of the enemy's actions in the war at sea? Some time after this operation, it can be argued that it became one of the main factors in the loss of Russian control over the approach areas to the main naval base. And also the withdrawal of the main forces from it, including ships with the Kalibr missile complex and amphibious assault ships, to the bases in the eastern part of the Black Sea.- . After all, the available forces are not sufficient. Currently, the Ukrainian fleet has limited capabilities to deal with mine hazards at sea. After the loss of a significant number of warships under the conditions of Russia's occupation of Crimea, including a number of anti-mine ships, the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine had only the project 1258 raid minesweeper -Genichesk- in its composition. But in June 2022, it became known about his death under enemy strikes. Thanks to the measures taken and the provision of military-technical assistance by partners, the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine currently carries out mine action primarily to ensure the defense of forces at base points and protection of civil shipping. It is about ensuring the functioning of the -grain corridor-, preventing the detonation of civilian ships by mines in ports and during sea crossings. Are these forces sufficient? Certainly not. After all, the spectrum of anti-mine tasks is very wide. Currently, only the main tasks are partially performed. Currently, one of the most important sources of development of anti-mine capabilities is the Coalition of maritime capabilities, which was created on December 11, 2023 at the initiative of Great Britain together with Norway. Several other states joined the Coalition. The surface forces of the fleet already include two anti-mine ships - minesweepers of the Sandown type with the names -Chernigiv- and -Cherkasy-. They were transferred to Ukraine in 2023 by Great Britain in accordance with the agreement of January 2022. However, due to the effect of the Montreux Convention, they cannot be sent to the Black Sea at the moment, so they are in Great Britain and are involved in joint exercises. In addition, two more anti-mine ships - mine hunters from the Netherlands are expected to be transferred to the Ukrainian fleet (approximately in 2025). It is likely that these will be ships of the Alkmaar type. The main anti-mine armament of these ships is a hydroacoustic minesweeping station and underwater vehicles of the PAP104 type. Considering the capabilities of the anti-mine forces, it should be noted that the mine anti-complexes Seafox Atlas and Remus 100 include modern underwater vehicles that have high search capabilities. At the same time, it is known that the Ukrainian Navy can also use some other complexes to search for mines, in particular, German-made sonar stations of the Cerberus Mod 2 type, purchased in 2019.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/vijna-droniv-v-chornomu-mori-ta-proval-speczoperaczij-rf-shho-vpershe-zrobleno-same-ukrayinczyamy/	2024-10-26T21:44:14-07:00
The one that is loaded with missiles: Turkey is building its first air defense destroyer	How claimed on the official website of ASFAT (Askeri Fabrika ve Tersane İşletme AŞ, Administration of Military Factories and Shipyards), a subsidiary of the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of Turkey, the first domestic destroyer of the TF-2000 series, which was developed by the Project Bureau of the Military Command naval forces and the construction of which was decided to start at the meeting of the Defense Industry Executive Committee (SSİK), will be laid at the Istanbul Shipyard under the leadership of the main contractor ASFAT, ArmiyaInform reports. Actually speaking, the need for such vessels was announced by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan two years ago. -Turkey intends to strengthen the power of its navy&# 8230; With the help of the TF-2000 destroyer with an air defense system, the construction of which will begin at the Istanbul shipyard, we will gradually provide air defense of our country from the sea - emphasized Turkish leader. How notes the Turkish portal MarineDeal, the TF-2000 HSHM will have the basic functional capability of using the sea as a shield to detect guided missiles short/medium/long-range missiles and ballistic missiles at low/medium/high altitudes and destroy them before they approach the mainland (except for ballistic missiles). The functionality of the future watercraft should include the ability to air defense (HSH), anti-submarine (DSH) and surface (S/S) long-range warfare. At the same time, it will receive the means and capabilities to effectively perform the tasks of non-combat operations, such as peacekeeping, evacuation of non-combatants, countering manifestations of international terrorism, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and maritime control operations. Tactical requirements - the technical characteristics of the destroyer of the TF-2000 series are put forward as follows: &#8211; a maximum speed of at least 28 knots, a range of at least 5,000 nautical miles at a speed of 18 knots and an average duration of operation of 5,000 hours per year; &#8211; unlimited operational capability in sea conditions up to 5 points (on a nine-point sea roughness scale), which is defined by international standards as -Significant roughness-; &#8211; the ability to carry out operations for at least 45 days without integrating logistics (except for refueling); &#8211; the ability to work autonomously for 180 days without entering home bases; &#8211; service life of at least 40 years; &#8211; availability of system programs to reduce the radar cross section (RCA), underwater acoustic, magnetic and infrared (I/R) signatures; &#8211; must be designed according to the main design features, such as the durable structure of the hull structure within the framework of high survivability. The destroyer TF-2000 HSH, which will have an overall length of 149 m, a beam of 21.3 m, a draft of 5.75 m and a displacement of 8,300 tons, will be equipped with a main propulsion plant in the CODOG configuration consisting of two LM2500 gas turbines and two diesel engines. TF-2000 will use various missiles developed in Turkey. Air defense missiles will consist of HİSAR-D (medium range), SAPAN B1/B2 (actual performance not released, possibly medium range), SİPER Block 1D and SİPER Block 2D (100+ km and 150+ km). At the same time, missiles of the -surface-to-surface- class - ATMACA anti-ship missile and GEZGİN long-range cruise missiles will be placed with a vertical (mine) launch option. An effective long-range anti-aircraft defense system created under with the help of a multi-purpose radar with a phased array (ÇAFRAD). The destroyer will be equipped with an Airborne Long Range Radar (UMR) that can produce aerial images from a minimum range of 200 miles and work with an integrated IFF system that allows for three-dimensional surveillance of enemy aircraft and the detection of modern G/Ms. The ship will have an integrated hydroacoustic system (Sonar Suit) for anti-aircraft defense purposes, an anti-torpedo protection system and a torpedo system against underwater targets. The TF-2000 HSHM ship will be able to land 2 medium cargo transport helicopters with a maximum take-off weight of less than 15 tons and 2 shipborne unmanned aerial vehicles (GIAVs) with fixed or rotary wings for reconnaissance/attack missions. For this, a fixed platform and a hangar, an arsenal of spare weapons and the possibility of fuel supply will be available. It will have level 1 certification, which allows working in meteorological conditions by instruments day and night. As the main material of the hull and superstructures, it is planned to use high-strength shipbuilding steel of domestic production. Aluminum material will be used in the superstructures of the deck superstructures to reduce weight as much as the strength requirements will allow. It is stated that the ship will have living space and a service area for at least 200 people. It is especially emphasized that during the construction of the first destroyer of the TF-2000 HSHM series, a high level of localization will be achieved: thanks to the planning of the level of localization, that is, the confirmation of the production of elements of the future ship on the territory of Turkey. In this particular project, at 85% in the elements of its design and armament, the ship should demonstrate the growing capabilities of the Republic of Turkey in the defense industry.

Fake stories about the deportation of Ukrainians from EU countries: why is it an enemy?	How to experts of the StopFake project explained, in fact, this incident was not about evasion of mobilization, but about deportation due to violation of Polish laws, but rather suspicions of assisting illegal migration. Official sources do not confirm allegations of mobilization reasons for deportation. The spread of fakes about the deportation of Ukrainians from EU countries, in particular Poland, is part of the disinformation campaign of Russian propaganda. Previously, they actively distributed a fake letter on behalf of the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine (in 2020-2024) Dmytro Kuleba. In it, he allegedly asked Poland to deport -all men to be sent to the front- from the country. Agitprop also falsely wrote that Ukrainian diplomats sent similar letters to Latvia and Lithuania. But to date, no EU government has introduced a policy of returning Ukrainian citizens through mobilization. European Commissioner for Internal Affairs Ylva Johansson said that the deportation of Ukrainians of conscription age contradicts the Directive on temporary protection, which regulates the status of refugees in the EU.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/fejkovkydy-pro-deportacziyu-ukrayincziv-iz-krayin-yes-navishho-cze-vorogu/	2024-10-26T21:15:49-07:00

Hit 11 targets on the first shift: how a skiff truck driver became an FPV pilot	The fighter himself says with a modest smile that in his peaceful life he rode around Europe behind the wheel of a truck, and never imagined himself a pilot. Yes, he picked up a soldering iron already in the army. He planned to do programming, but he didn't have time to study seriously - a large-scale invasion began. After joining the Armed Forces, the boy was a driver who rotates positions, and was a -zampotech-, the commander of an anti-tank platoon. Even at the beginning of 2023, he was critical of FPV, because it seemed something incomprehensible, but already in the fall he stopped enemy attacks as a drone operator. — We had a commander who gave a push. I was assigned the task of selecting and training pilots from the anti-tank platoon. At first, I dealt with purely organizational issues: the training schedule on the simulator, I looked at who has the talent and who does not want to do it. Then we bought our first -tiny whoop- (tiny whoop - a small FPV drone. - Ed.) - training drones, - recalls Skif. At first, all training took place in the unit. After 30 hours in the simulator, the fighters were allowed to practice on small drones in the hangar, where an obstacle course was set up. Then the pilot trained in the field already on working UAVs. Only after 20 successful drops on an improvised target was he admitted to combat duty. — Not all stages went smoothly. You know that feeling, as if you are running, and someone pulls you back by your T-shirt. And at some point he lets go. The dialogue with the new commander was decisive for us. A question of approximately the following content was sounded: what is necessary for it to fly? And we said in one voice: -do not disturb.- In response: -understood, accepted.- And we started going to study with experienced pilots and engineers in other units, to learn from experience, - says the guy. The next stage was solving the issue of supplying drones, components, and explosives. And that was a turning point. Comrade -Scyph- from a peaceful life was engaged in volunteering and helped to close the requests of the unit. - I called him, I said that it is not possible to kill p..v something as a humanitarian, we have a more interesting topic - FPV. He started ordering us drones. I got to know the engineer who assembled them, they started working together. I took on the search for components and financing. We were in constant communication about the nuances: how it should be done for effective application. They found a middle ground — and for the drone to fly with a load, and for the funds to be raised, -Skif- recalls. Actually, this was the birth of the -Wild Hornets- project, which developed from a collection of -from what God will send- before the release of unified series. Now a party with the same components does not require a lot of effort from the settings. The -Queen of the Hornets- was born out of this communication. And the unit, after the tactics of accurate airdrops in conditions of shortage of means, got the opportunity to effectively repulse assaults with dozens of FPV-kamikazes. The moment came when -Skif- switched from organizational work to practice. He remembered his first combat duty forever. — Of course, I worried and checked several times to make sure everything was working. On September 26, we entered, the next day an experienced pilot left, and on the 28th at 4 a.m. mass artillery training began. They followed her. He was in the air almost continuously until 4 p.m. Used more than 25 drones. 11 lesions. Two tanks and two BMPs were burned, the rest were seriously damaged. The equipment that managed to leave the battlefield fled without a landing party, which simply flew apart from the armor under the blows of drones. The enemy was stopped 5-7 km from our positions, - says the soldier. you have to be ready, as if tomorrow in any case p..ts-. - From 11 in the evening until 2 in the morning I could personally check each drone, that it is armed, that there is a video. A minimum of 15 drones, which I am completely confident is the best calming. I well understand the value of time when you are messing around and tanks are shooting at your brothers. We trained with a calculation so that from the moment of decision making to the direct take-off there was no more than a minute. In a clear interaction and sequence. In order to avoid the situation when the drone is turned on, the charge is raised, and the pilot is sitting in the trench, and he has no picture, says the military man. He calls the sense of responsibility and the ability to make decisions quickly on the spot essential components of effective work . — There is my sector. When I see that the enemy roll begins, I do not wait for coordination. I'm already in the air. Here you already feel the seconds. 30 seconds — and the tank drove by. If you are the first to intercept the movement and take off, then you will be in time before he starts working on ours with direct fire. The guys in the trenches don't call the headquarters with questions: -can I go with an RPG, because we have a tank advantage here?-. We are talking about the fact that the enemy has a numerical advantage and fights according to the anthill principle we have to invent the same insecticide, the technological advantages that will allow quality to stop quantity. And save human lives. -Skif- dreams of drones with machine guns and grenade launchers surrounding enemy groups breaking through to our positions. - During my work as a driver, I saw those who leave the battle, who are carried away. He took out the wounded. In my experience, the picture of active combat operations from the stream is superimposed, and in my head there is always the question of how to make part of the tasks of stormtroopers in close combat performed by drones. People get exhausted, and exhausted people make mistakes. It is very difficult to keep fighting. And by the time help arrives, it may no longer be relevant. Or simply not reach. You know what I mean. And it's time. And here it's a matter of minutes. I remember that the sound of FPV in itself exerts considerable psychological pressure. -Scyth- with a smile tells how he tested it on himself when he was still studying. - If you are caught by the FPV pilot's camera and you have no cover where he can't fly, your chances are almost zero. I understand this clearly as a pilot. Others, I think, just feel instinctively. And this is a very strong fear. When we were studying, I asked my partner to fly on me. He said, I will run, and you fly almost to the end. And when he was 10–m away from me, I was filled with fear - apparently he forgot that he had to leave the trajectory, although I knew - he was flying empty. span> He felt this fear already when he became a pilot, when he had to leave on the M113 for the wounded in the gray zone. Couldn't get rid of the unpleasant feeling, as if you see yourself from above as a target. Therefore, the fighter considers the psychological factor, multiplied by the drone's ability to fire for at least three minutes, to be a significant factor in putting pressure on enemy infantry. software configuration of drones. He makes sure that the drones behave stably and do not overheat. He makes overflights himself. We laugh that dreams come true in a strange way - the division is, of course, not an IT company, but probably the best option where -to be right now, while having the opportunity to perform creative tasks.- — After I am being flown by a pilot who will work with them to immediately deal with the issues that arise. Brings, says, there is such and such a problem, I solve it on the spot. And he is already taking the equipment in which he is completely confident, says -Skyf-. Already having awards (order -For Courage- III degree and -Golden Cross-. - Ed.) and a list of confirmed injuries. He says that one question was pressing morally: no matter how cool you are in the military environment, for the system you are a line in the papers, and at any moment your experience and skills can be disregarded, handing over a conditional shovel. — In no way do I devalue the work of an anti-tanker or a driver, I did it myself. But let's talk about efficiency. With the help of these means, we have been preventing the enemy from advancing in our area for a long time. I think this should be taken into account. When you interview for an IT company, the determining factor is not your diplomas, but how you cope with a technical task. If you are able to solve problems, you are needed. If you can only speak and show a folder with papers, it is not about competence. Efficiency is when there is a real result. The unit began to receive batches of drones from the state a little more than six months ago. -Scyth- believes that it is better that certain latest developments become known only when they appear on the battlefield, in the form of an unpleasant surprise, but the realities are different. — Of course, it is better when something from is already in working form and in working volumes. But there is a nuance. Censorship in this area is understandable and necessary when it comes to the development of government defense agencies. And when the necessary means are made by developers who survive at the expense of donations, it will not work like that. In general, part of our work resembles a reality show. The best series means more money for funds for the next series. When I hear criticism that the enemy sees and zooms in, I remind you that every video is followed by a call to your own - do it, zoom in - says Skift. The fighter has feelings for the drones assembled -in the kitchen- complex -Skif- advises those who want to help, to contact a specific division, with engineers and ask how best. The ideal option is to purchase something ready and tested, with which they already work. The manufacturer must test the drone under the load and action of a serious REB, civilians rarely have this opportunity. — When people decide to organize a drone from a school or club, they should understand that it will mostly be a talisman, not a weapon. I hung it on the wall and look at it with gratitude, like a picture. In order for me to put the pilots in position for combat use of the drone, there must be professional soldering, it must be configured and tested. My heart bleeds when I receive 28 drones that someone has assembled, spent money on, but are essentially spare parts. the development of people with combat experience. - Maybe it's naive, but it seems to me that the one who repelled more than one assault, who took more than one drone in his hands, which turns over at you on takeoff, and the charge is raised , will have a high level of responsibility. Part of the work of engineers is still related to self-made BC or intervention in staff, and this applies to all such units. — There is a question of constant improvement: we still have a lot of things to solve, roughly speaking, screed, chewing gum, scotch tape and glue. The current form of initiation fees is a temporary solution. It must be finished. And not taking out a check every time to think that your life depends on how responsible the person who made it is. Finally, let's talk about fatigue, supports and motivation. Painful points and vision of the future. — There are difficult experiences. A certain disappointment related to how it was in the first days of the invasion and what processes are currently taking place in society. In the army next to me, I see people who stick to principles, brotherhood, when the unit has the opportunity to work and develop. But we know and have observed different stories. There are fewer of us, and those who come now often have a problem with motivation. How to solve it? Much is determined by our dependence on the close connection of the human level and the level of technology. Drones can be configured on site, and the people who are responsible for making decisions cannot be asked. If one is driven by false and dangerous narratives and is not held accountable for the consequences of one's actions while in high office, it undermines the overall ability to resist the enemy. Speaking of our direction, there must be people in leadership positions in this field , in which the eyes will burn, which are understood in the technical part. In particular, I was lucky with this. I know what it's like when they speak the same language to you, and a conversation solves a problem that used to take weeks. It adds motivation. What else adds motivation? When there is support, when there is no pressure on you. You cannot be constantly pinned down from two sides, when on one side is the enemy, and on the other - your own. In the army, they often want everything here and at once. When we were still studying and some things were not perfect, excessive pressure sometimes became the reason why some refused to train. We have not yet revealed our full potential, the direction will develop. And it will enter all spheres of life. Perhaps, if we imagine the end of the war optimistically, I will work with these technologies, there will be an expansion of production and exports, - says the fighter and, pausing, he looks into my eyes with that deep look familiar to all of us, as if ashamed of his directness, and adds: - But maybe first I want to live on a deserted island. Too much painful and difficult accumulated inside. While saying goodbye to -Scythia-, I thought about the fact that for a state that strives to endure and survive, it is important to make sure that its brave and sincere defenders see here not only a difficult the battle path behind, but also the future, where there is a place for development, self-improvement and creativity.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/26/na-pershomu-cherguvanni-vrazyv-11-czilej-yak-vodij-fury-skif-stav-pilotom-fpv/	2024-10-25T21:09:22-07:00

The BRICS summit: what Moscow wanted to -extract-	As of autumn 2024, BRICS members, in addition to the founding countries, also include Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. Several other developing countries have expressed interest in joining this coalition. On October 22-24, the 16th BRICS summit was held in the Russian city of Kazan. About how this event will affect the situation in the world, what Moscow wanted to -push- and whether it succeeded, Oleksandr Chupak, an expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Studies-, tells: -According to the Kremlin's statements, more than 20 heads of state attended the BRICS summit +, which took place in Kazan, Russia. This was the main goal of Vladimir Putin: to show that his -empire- is not isolated from the world, but on the contrary enjoys the support of great powers that form an alternative to the American-centric order. However, BRICS in general has never set itself the goal of confronting the West. As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently said, -BRICS is not anti-Western; it is simply different from the West.- Putin's attempts to pit the summit against his enemies are resonating, perhaps only with his Chinese and Iranian partners. The rest, led by India and Brazil, see their priority as balancing between global centers of influence for maximum economic benefit. Several issues were put on the agenda of the current summit, in the resolution of which Moscow is directly interested: on October 23, the final declaration of the BRICS summit was made public, which did not meet the Kremlin's expectations. In particular, with regard to Ukraine, the participants only recalled the national positions of their countries and testified to their commitment to the goals and principles of the UN Charter, as well as to peaceful settlement and diplomacy. Putin apparently failed to impose his neo-imperialist views on the BRICS member states and secure their unanimous support in the aggression against Ukraine. Therefore, Moscow's hopes that BRICS would become a tool for dividing the international community have once again not come true. Oleksandr Chupak explains: -Despite Moscow's desire to strengthen its military and political positions, BRICS continues to be a club of economic interests. India, South Africa, Brazil and others will not go to a direct confrontation with the US, because it will result in significant losses for them. However, Washington should react much more actively to the economic support of the aggressor, for example, from India, which in two years became one of the two largest sales markets for Russian oil. The visit of the President of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping, who apparently has nothing against deepening relations between the Russians and the DPRK, is worthy of attention. It is worth saying that this is only his third trip abroad after the lifting of coronavirus restrictions; two of them were in Russia, and one more in the USA. If Xi goes somewhere, it's only when it's really important.- The biggest surprise was the visit to the summit of UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who, as is known, refused to go to the Global Peace Summit organized by Ukraine and Switzerland in June. There is a version that Guterres came to Kazan not to Putin, but to Xi. After all, over the decade, the United States has greatly lost its position in the UN, and China has bought up all available positions there. Guterres is considered a pro-China general secretary who, under the guise of -globalization-, trivially promotes the Chinese agenda. That is why he has such rhetoric and such actions. But it is sad that by these actions he is improving the status of Putin in the international arena&#8230; -Putin has achieved his goal by showing that he is not isolated and is not afraid of a long struggle against the West. The BRICS summit should become another lesson of missed opportunities for our partners: they do not work enough with countries that could be realistically kept in their sphere of influence. Europe, the USA and others can offer Brazilians, Indians and companies much more than economically backward Russia or the same China. However, the BRICS summit perfectly fits into the general trend of indecision and weakness of the Western world,- Oleksandr Chupak believes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/26/samit-briks-shho-hotila-protyagnuty-moskva/	2024-10-25T21:03:24-07:00
What is the feature of the 199th training center of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine:...	ArmyInform was told by the head of the Airborne Assault Troops 199 Training Center of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Lt. Col. Oleksiy Gerasimchuk. -One of the key areas of work of our Training Center is basic combined military training for the mobilized. We train scouts, mechanic drivers, snipers, gunners, machine gunners, combat medics, etc. This is professional training. In the center, we conduct combined training of sergeants — department commanders, in particular, at different levels from units and units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We are preparing the non-commissioned staff to replace the positions of the officer staff. We train the mobilized for real combat operations: we polish the skills of defenders in owning personal weapons, in fire training, we teach tactics and tactics in defense and attack, assault operations, the order of movement on the battlefield, work in a combat group (department), local orientation, etc. Anything that will help save lives in war. Instructors work with the mobilized from the morning until the very evening. The terms of training for professional training in different specialties are different. It all depends on the specifics of the profession to be mastered or the type of weapon mastery. In the training programs, we take into account the experience of conducting military operations, the tactics of the enemy, the use of the latest types of weapons and military equipment of both domestic and foreign production. No less important is the psychological preparation of the mobilized. And it's not just passing an obstacle course - we add a run-in with a tank. A person must be morally prepared for war and better adapted. Military personnel should not feel the transition between, in fact, training and combat operations. This is our goal. I will not reveal the secret that with well-trained soldiers it is much easier and faster to carry out combat coordination of a platoon, company, battalion, brigade than with untrained ones. Look, there are no fixed things in preparation, just like there are no fixed things in combat. We must be guided by the principle: a trained soldier is a saved life on the front line. Therefore, we are analyzing combat actions both from our side and the actions of the Russian Army. We learn from the enemy's mistakes, so to speak. We are looking for countermeasures at every step of the enemy. Of course, the exchange of experience with foreign partners is important. Our instructor-teaching staff has extensive combat experience. In addition, instructors regularly go to the front for combat missions. There they see what's new in the battle, what trends are currently relevant. Plus, they were trained abroad: in Germany, France, Lithuania, Spain and other countries, so they know the -motherland- very well. The constant exchange of experience with the commanders of units of various branches, parts and units of the DSHV helps. The combat experience gained in battles with the enemy and its introduction into the educational process as soon as possible is our main task today. Flexibility is important. The golden mean, unfortunately, is difficult to find. The combat is very dynamic and fast-paced. It is necessary to adapt everything to modern realities. So practice and practice again. Training programs should help our paratroopers on the battlefield not only to survive, but also to successfully destroy the enemy with all types of weapons. The advantage in the battle lies in those who quickly used technological weapons and adapted their strategy to it. This is a key moment in the Russian-Ukrainian war. The course of hostilities and their results depend on this direction. The main thing is the ability to do as much damage as possible to the invaders, destroy the enemy, disable his equipment and weapons, while saving the lives of our paratroopers. In this context, drones have become an integral part of the modern military arsenal. At us, almost every lesson takes place with the use of FPV drones, drones of various types. In addition, we actively use electronic resources. As it happens on the battlefield: if the enemy jams one frequency, we switch to another. This is, so to speak, a kind of technology race. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, Ukraine has received dozens of types of various weapons and military equipment from the Allies. No army of the world in history has ever had such a -zoo- of the most diverse equipment and weapons. Students master both small arms (machine guns, machine guns and grenade launchers of various models), and more complex weapons systems (anti-tank missile systems of various types, etc.). For example, paratroopers train to destroy the enemy with American heavy-caliber Browning M2 machine guns. This machine gun is effective against infantry, unarmored and lightly armored vehicles, fortifications, and helicopters at low altitudes. Regarding armored vehicles. Gunners and driver mechanics are trained on combat vehicles such as Stryker, Marder, etc. The DSHV units are armed with the British Challenger 2 tank. It has excellent maneuverability, maneuverability, firepower and ease of control. But this tank must first be thoroughly mastered, its technical characteristics should be studied. Next, in practice, check its maneuverability, maneuverability and combat capabilities to destroy targets. This all requires scrupulous preparation. A person who comes here for the first time from civilian life cannot help but make mistakes, so we repeat it several times to remember all the details. We polish actions to automaticity. There are many fears in society about mobilization. One of the reasons is the lack of proper training before sending the unit to the front. This myth needs to be dispelled. Preparation is underway, and it is of high quality. Of course, we would like to increase the number of study hours in different subjects, because better training requires time and even more practical training. As far as I know, according to the decision of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, it is already planned to increase the duration of basic general military training from one to one and a half months. Therefore, in the end, I will turn to those who are still thinking or hesitating: you should not wait for the enemy to come with -Russian peace- to your home and kill you. Learn and be prepared for resistance. It is necessary to finally knock out the occupiers from our territory&#8230;&#8221;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/26/u-chomu-fishka-199-navchalnogo-czentru-dshv-zsu-armiyainform-diznalas-yak-i-chogo-navchayut-mobilizovanyh/	2024-10-25T20:51:23-07:00
Can work without operators: a new drone with artificial intelligence was presented in the USA	The goal of the new Bolt-M drone, presented by the American company Anduril, is to reduce the demands on operators and provide more information than traditional first-person attack drones. As the company notes, Bolt-M can work without the need for specially trained operators. One of the main features of Bolt-M is its standalone software, which runs on the Anduril platformLattice. The operator can draw a bounding box on the battlefield display, set a few specifications and send the drone on its way. Thanks to artificial intelligence, Bolt-M is able to independently track moving objects and deliver precise strikes. -Once the target is identified in Lattice, the operator can specify the position that the Bolt-M should maintain, instructing the system to track the target out of visual or acoustic detection range, even if the target is moving and closing in.- When it's time to strike, the operator can determine the grip angle to ensure the most effective strike, while on-board vision and navigation algorithms support guidance even if connection with the operator is lost,- the developers say. The Bolt-M also performs reconnaissance tasks that are not available to cheaper strike drones. Anduril chief strategist Chris Brose explained that this drone helps the operator better understand the situation on the battlefield, recognize targets and, if necessary, issue commands for surveillance or damage. Brouse added that the Bolt-M is capable of detecting new variants of older weapons. Bolt-M complies with the Pentagon's principles that robotic systems should involve humans in making lethal decisions. Brouse noted that their efforts are based on the experience of the campaign in Ukraine, including feedback from Ukrainians facing Russian electronic warfare. The drone can fly according to the given GPS coordinates. However, in areas where GPS is suppressed, operators can take control and continue to control the drones, maintaining control over the target and executing previously set commands, even if communication is lost. The US Department of Defense supports ethical principles for artificial intelligence that emphasize the importance of human judgment and responsibility in the development and use of AI-based weapons. Last year, the Pentagon tried to clarify what actions are allowed, leaving the possibility to adjust the rules if circumstances change. A key lesson from the Ukrainian experience is that conditions on the battlefield can change rapidly, and different countries may have different policies regarding autonomous weapons. This underlines the need for more powerful autonomous systems as attacks on human-drone communications become increasingly effective. Anduril's Brose expects that US policy will change, and the company wants to be ready for the Pentagon's new requirements.

They want to pass off wishful thinking: the Russians -in their own way- count Ukrainian losses	The table being circulated is unreliable, and several signs indicate this. First, there is no original source. The screenshot with the table, which is spreading on the Internet, contains the name of a Russian propaganda Telegram channel, but even there the source is not mentioned, only it is indicated - -according to Western estimates.- The error table itself states in English that this data is an estimate based on -numerous sources of information-. -troops losses-, -airplanes- instead of -aircrafts-, -missed in action- instead of -missing in action-, etc. The third feature is the data itself. They are clearly made up, like the entire table. Even if we do not take into account the human losses, the data on the losses of military equipment do not stand up to any criticism. For example, the table mentions -650 aircraft lost since February 2022-. On the eve of Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine, the air fleet did not have even close to such a number of aircraft. Another example is -18,700 tanks and armored vehicles lost-. These figures are also very far from the real ones. Russian propaganda constantly raises the issue of losses during the war, and due to the fact that the real data is not revealed, the Kremlin speculates on this topic and regularly throws out fakes. Such -throwbacks- are primarily aimed at demoralizing Ukrainians and the Ukrainian army.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/26/hochut-vydaty-bazhane-za-dijsne-rosiyany-po-svoyemu-rahuyut-ukrayinski-vtraty/	2024-10-25T20:17:26-07:00

To organize sabotage, the special services of the Russian Federation remotely engaged local unemployed people who were looking for -easy- earnings in Telegram channels. However, instead of Russian funds, the perpetrators can receive life imprisonment with confiscation of property. Two residents of Fastov, aged 25 and 29, who set fire to the local office of Ukrposhta and facilities of Ukrzaliznytsia were detained in Kyiv region. The perpetrators filmed the fire on a mobile phone camera for -reporting- to the Russian curator, and then tried in vain to escape from the crime scene. In Vinnytsia, a couple was arrested -on hot pursuit- who burned two relay cabinets of signal installations that regulate traffic on important sections of Ukrzaliznytsia. The extras are two recidivists from the city of Gnivan: a 28-year-old woman who had a criminal record for forging documents, and her 29-year-old friend who previously served a sentence for theft. A 27-year-old local resident was detained in Sumy, who set fire to two relay cabinets of a railway connection and was preparing further sabotage in the regional center. All detainees were notified of suspicion under Part 2 of Art. 113 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (sabotage committed under martial law). As reported by ArmyInform, the Security Service and the National Police detained 7 people who burned military cars and facilities of Ukrzaliznytsia in Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk and Cherkasy regions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/do-zaliznyczi-dodalasya-poshta-speczsluzhby-rf-onovyly-spysok-czilej-dlya-pidpalyuvachiv/	2024-10-25T11:59:27-07:00

An ex-policeman received 15 years of well-deserved rest for a new career on the side of the Russian ...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. Prosecutors proved that an active police officer voluntarily cooperated with the enemy during the occupation of the Chkalov settlement territorial community in Chuguyiv Oblast. From the first days of March 2022, he started working in a pseudo-law enforcement agency. For this, the occupiers gave him a firearm and a car marked with the letter -Z-. The traitor tried to -form- the collective, agitating his former colleagues to cooperate with the enemy. In addition, the person involved showed the Russian military places for the best tactical and strategic location of enemy artillery and other equipment on the territory of the district in order to prevent the offensive of the Ukrainian military. He even took turns with the Russian military and L/DPR militants at checkpoints, and on his days off he brought food, water and cigarettes to the occupiers. In July 2022, the person involved was appointed -head of the criminal investigation department- in the pseudo-law enforcement agency of the occupiers in the village of Shevchenkove, Kupyan district. The -chief- supervised the activities of the department, detained local residents and interrogated them personally. And he continued to work at checkpoints in the same way. The guilty verdict was handed down by the Kyiv District Court of Poltava. The term for an appeal continues. The traitor was dismissed from the ranks of the National Police of Ukraine. Since the convicted person is still hiding from Ukrainian justice on the territory of the Russian Federation, the term of his sentence will begin to be calculated from the moment of his actual detention. As long as he avoids serving the sentence imposed by the court, the statute of limitations is suspended. Earlier ArmyInform reported that 19 members of the network that tried to disrupt the mobilization were detained.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/15-rokiv-zasluzhenogo-vidpochynku-otrymav-eks-policzejskyj-za-novu-karyeru-na-storoni-rf/	2024-10-25T10:49:49-07:00
The first villages - in Kyiv, 7 people received sentences for evading mobilization	About this reported on October 25 by the Main Directorate of the National Police in Kyiv. According to him, a resident of the Solomyan district was sentenced to 4 years in prison, and a resident of the capital's Oboloni will spend the next five years behind bars. In general, since the beginning of the year, investigators have completed the pre-trial investigation and sent indictments to the court in 26 criminal proceedings, which were investigated for the fact of evasion of the draft and registration for the military. 51 persons were notified of the suspicion. In most cases, pre-trial investigation in criminal proceedings under Art. 336, 337 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine is initiated upon notification of the Territorial Centers of Recruitment and Social Support. We would like to remind you that the current legislation stipulates liability in the form of deprivation of liberty for a period of three to five years for those conscripts who evade conscription for military service during mobilization and military registration. In addition, the violator is not removed from the military register and is subject to conscription in the future.

Moscow's partnership with the Houthis increases destabilization in the Red Sea region	Relevant information published by the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. According to the researchers, Moscow's partnership with the Yemeni Houthis may allow this radical movement to intensify its destabilizing activities in the Red Sea region. Especially if modern Russian-made long-range weapons fall into their hands. Russia is known for its ability to use crises around the world to its own advantage. From the first days of the civil war in Yemen, the Kremlin tried to demonstrate neutrality. However, the deterioration of Russia's relations with the West after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine prompted it to seek new friends to implement its anti-American plans. Iran became such an ally. At the same time, the Yemeni Houthis, a proxy of Tehran, began to be considered by Moscow as potential partners of the global anti-Western coalition. Researchers suggest that relations between Moscow and Canada can be used by the Russian Federation as a bargaining chip against Saudi Arabia. Riyadh seeks cooperation with the United States, which the Kremlin does not like very much. Russia is also trying to contrast its -friendship- with the Houthis with the possibility of the US and the West granting permission to Ukraine to use long-range weapons for strikes deep into the Russian Federation. In case of such permission, the aggressor country threatens to transfer similar weapons to potential opponents of the countries of the -free world-, in particular the -Hushi-. The Kremlin's partnership with a radical Shiite organization classified as a terrorist group by the UN Security Council is not unusual. Russia is very flexible in its definition of terrorism: it has excluded the Taliban from its own list of terrorist organizations and has maintained close ties with radical paramilitary groups around the world since Soviet times. Therefore, a shared vision of a future where the US will have less influence provides the Russians and the Houthis with sufficient basis for cooperation, even with the use of terrorist tools. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, that the shadow fleet of the Russian Federation met its biggest enemy — insurance.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/partnerstvo-moskvy-z-husytamy-posylyuye-destabilizacziyu-v-regioni-chervonogo-morya/	2024-10-25T10:40:57-07:00

FSB in the service of the UOC (MP) undercover: from prayer to information sabotage	The Security Service of Ukraine informs about this. According to the case materials, the cleric coordinated three accomplices - the so-called -polyexperts- who, while in Kyiv, massively spread Kremlin narratives. In their materials, they justified the Russian Federation's war against Ukraine and incited inter-religious hatred in our country. We will remind that in March 2024, SBU employees detained all four persons involved. Currently, the indictments against the detainees have been sent to the court. Perpetrators face life imprisonment with confiscation of property. As the investigation established, the defendants were part of one of the largest FSB intelligence networks, which has been operating in Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale war. Thanks to the prompt response of the SBU, the enemy cell was neutralized at the beginning of its subversive activities against Ukraine. A special pre-trial investigation is ongoing with regard to more than 10 members of the Russian intelligence agency, as they are hiding abroad. It was established that the accused cleric personally oversaw the distribution of anti-Ukrainian content through controlled channels in Telegram and YouTube, Facebook pages and official websites of various dioceses of the UOC (MP). Immediately after the publication of the ordered materials, they were instantly -picked up- by the central TV channels and Internet publications of the Russian Federation, which spread fakes about our state. In this way, the Rashists hoped to discredit Ukraine in the international arena, especially in front of our Western partners.

-Failure crept in unnoticed-: the shadow fleet of the Russian Federation met its greatest enemy - in...	About this informs the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. In response, Great Britain plans to increase inspections of tankers with questionable insurance. In particular, they will be required to provide details of their insurance status when crossing the English Channel. The main insurance options for Russian tankers according to the research: Western insurers: before the start of the Russian-Ukrainian war, most cargoes of Russian oil tankers were insured by Western companies that are part of the -International Group of Protection Clubs and indemnity- (-International Group of Protection & Indemnity Clubs-). Insurers from the G7 countries are able to conclude insurance contracts only if there is written confirmation that Russian oil is purchased at a maximum price of $60. US per barrel; Russian insurers:after the introduction of sanctions, the number of appeals to Russian insurers by the owners of Russian -shadow fleet- vessels has increased. The main Russian companies: spat -ingosstrakh-, insurance group -alfastrakhovanie-, JSC -sogaz-. The financial guarantee for these companies is provided by the state reinsurer JSC -Российская национальная перестраховочная компания- (rnpc), which is under international sanctions; new entrants: insurance companies from Cameroon and Kyrgyzstan provided insurance coverage for at least two tankers from the -shadow fleet- each. As a result, the rejection of Western insurers and the transition to companies with a low reputation increases the risk of payment delays or non-payments in the event of accidents, oil spills, etc. This increases economic and environmental threats to European countries. At the same time, problems in the field of insurance as a result of international sanctions indicate that Russia's use of the -shadow fleet- is becoming more and more complicated. We remind you, Russian generals will be responsible for the strikes that could have caused the catastrophe in Kharkiv.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/nyeudacha-padkralas-nyezamyetna-tinovyj-flot-rf-zustriv-svogo-najbilshogo-voroga-strahuvannya/	2024-10-25T04:21:43-07:00

Search and rescue operations are ongoing at the scene, and the type of weapon and the final number of victims are being determined. The prosecutor's office is conducting a pre-trial investigation with the aim of documenting war crimes committed by the armed forces of the Russian Federation. As reported by ArmiyaInform, three people were killed as a result of today's shelling of the Pokrovsk community.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/okupanty-obstrilyaly-poshtu-na-donechchyni-zagynuly-dvoye-molodyh-lyudej/	2024-10-24T21:09:12-07:00
- The country is huge - did not stand up: why did the Russian Federation add Korean sauce to the war...	Oleksandr Musienko, head of the Center for Military Legal Research, told about this in an exclusive comment to ArmyInform. -Putin's invitations to the North Korean military show that the so-called policy of -get up a huge country- with the rise of a mass volunteer movement in Russia, voluntary mobilization of Russian society with the aim of attracting a sufficient number of soldiers to the front is not working. We see different stages of manpower recruitment in Russia. The first is the ongoing mobilization. It has a hidden character - summonses are sent out, but then the mobilized are forced to either sign a contract until the end of the so-called -svo- under duress, or buy them with payments, constantly increasing the amounts. Thus, such a category as the so-called voluntary contractors appears in Russia, but there are still not enough of them. Secondly, Russia constantly raises payments and increases the number of monetary rewards specifically for contract workers. This indicates that they have quite serious problems, because why pay more if you already have the necessary amount. Moreover, this is definitely not characteristic of the Putin regime in relation to its own population - to pay something, to take care of someone there. On the contrary, we see that Putin is angry at his own population, because they strike at their own settlements in the Kursk region, even knowing that civilians are hiding there. Possible victims among their own civilians do not stop them. There are also prisoners and, finally, mercenaries from different countries. It is obvious that Russia is faced with a lack of manpower, it is obvious that it does not have enough capabilities and resources to meet its own operational needs, to support -meat assaults- directly on the front. Therefore, Putin asks Kim Jong Un to provide appropriate assistance. This indicates that the Kremlin does not yet dare to announce any significant mobilization measures in Russia, because it is afraid that this will affect the socio-political situation and shake the existing stability of the regime. In view of this, Putin is engaging external forces. This testifies to his insecurity and the weakness of his position. At the same time, this also indicates that the enemy does not have enough strength to implement the plans he has conceived, because the Ukrainian armed forces are destroying a significant amount of the manpower of the aggressor. Another positive consequence of reports that the Russians are inviting troops from the DPRK to fight against Ukraine is the Russian Federation's loss of subjectivity on the international stage. Putin, who visited North Korea for the first time since 2000, is forced to ask for help, actually begging Kim Jong-un in the DPRK, first for shells, ammunition, and now manpower, looks humiliated. russia asks for help in north korea! Even 10 years ago, no one could even think about it either in Russia itself or anywhere in the world. And today these are realities - Russia is losing its subjectivity and signing on to its own inability to defeat Ukraine on its own. This is seen by external players who look at Russia and understand that Putin is weakening. At the same time, it strengthens North Korea, because the DPRK extracts from Russia the technology necessary for the production of weapons. Such as, for example, the modernization of nuclear submarines and others. Of course, in any case, the DPRK military is a force. It, like any troops, forces and means of the enemy on the front, can pose a threat. While training in Russia, the North Korean military can create certain problems in certain areas and may even have some minor tactical successes. So this is an additional challenge for us. This is the understanding that there will be more enemy manpower to be destroyed. However, as previous experience shows, the Russian Federation has no chance of defeating Ukraine thanks to North Korean soldiers. Russia was no longer helped by mercenaries from other countries. Strategically, North Korean and Iranian weapons did not help to turn the tide of the war. Therefore, the North Korean soldiers will not help her either.- Earlier, ArmiyaInform reported that the Russians are trying to intimidate Ukrainians and the world with North Korean soldiers , the Kharkiv OTU assessed the quality of ammunition from the DPRK, the head of the GUR told where Russia will send the first batch of North Korean infantry, and North Korean soldiers tried to escape from Bryansk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/strana-ogromnaya-ne-vstala-navishho-rf-dodala-korejskyj-sous-u-vijnu-z-ukrayinoyu/	2024-10-24T20:58:48-07:00
-The idea of ​​running arose after pulling a 16-ton airplane on a prosthesis-. Roman Kashpur and his...	Every year, more and more running enthusiasts from all over the world join this event, but for the Ukrainian community, this year's event is symbolic. Participant in the marathon distance race (42 km 195 m) was Roman Kashpur, an active serviceman of the 808th separate Dniester support brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who in 2019, during a combat mission as part of the 74th separate reconnaissance battalion in the settlement of Olenivka in Donetsk region, as a result of receiving a mine-explosive wound, he lost part of his leg. Roman told ArmiyaInform about how he managed to go through all the difficulties of rehabilitation after a serious injury, and did not leave either military service or his love for sports. —Mr. Roman, please tell me how, after being seriously wounded, you got into the service of the 808th separate Dniester brigade of the Support Forces? — The wife, on a volunteer basis, helped units in Odesa, in particular, and the personnel of the 808th th brigade. Having joined the project to establish a rehabilitation center for veterans right on the shores of the Black Sea, we began to actively spread the topic of rehabilitation of wounded soldiers or veterans through sports activity, which is quite widespread and, in particular, is gaining popularity not only in Ukraine. At the same time, when it became a question for me whether to continue military service in combination with sports, the brigade commander supported me and accepted me into the service. In the unit, I deal with foster care and rehabilitation issues. My sports activity, despite the severe injury, my achievements and achievements play a certain motivational role for all wounded people, they see that life after injuries does not end. In my opinion, it is a good idea to have a patronage service in the unit that works with the wounded, promotes their rehabilitation, and, of course, there should be people there who understand this. As a person who has been in prosthetics for the fifth year, but is actively training, I know everything there is to know in the world of prosthetics and I give my positive or negative assessment to one or another prosthetist regarding the functional capabilities of existing prostheses. - Before serving in the 808th Separate Support Brigade, you had already served in another military unit. Please tell us under what circumstances you were injured? — Yes, he started his service in 2016 as part of the Right Sector Volunteer Ukrainian Corps. In 2017, he signed a contract with the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the 74th separate reconnaissance battalion, where, in particular, he was wounded while performing one of the combat missions. After being released, he started playing sports with a prosthesis. When a large-scale war began, he evacuated his family from Kharkiv to Vinnytsia to his parents and returned. Voluntarily started the fight against the occupiers from 2022 in the -Kraken- unit of the GUR MOU, the 95th Airborne Assault Brigade, the 92nd Mechanized Brigade, the 53rd Mechanized Brigade. It was then that the idea of ​​participating in marathons was formed - and it was so strong that it did not leave my head. But at the same time, there was an understanding - either I stay in the army and do sports, which, in my opinion, is the best motivator for rehabilitation, or I leave. It so happened that the commander of the 808th Brigade of Support Forces Oleg Mazurok took me from the summer of 2023 to complete my service. - Tell me, please, how long have you been running and what is the marathon you already have? - The idea of ​​running came after I pulled a 16-ton airplane on my prosthesis in 2021. That's when I set a Ukrainian record by pulling an airplane for a distance of 6 meters 40 centimeters in 44 seconds - then I believed in myself and realized that I could motivate the seriously injured, and the emphasis should be on the fact that the absence of a limb should not deprive one of incentive and movement, motivation to full life Sport has been a stimulus and motivation for me all my life, especially after my injury. Therefore, in fact, the next challenge, in 2021, was the idea of ​​running a marathon. With the beginning of a large-scale invasion, due to the fact that he took an active part in hostilities, this idea was somewhat stretched in time. But I returned to it later - and in 2023, in January, I started training. Actually, since January 2023, I have been running marathons for the second year. During this period, I managed to run five marathons from the World Marathon Majors series: London, New York, Chicago, Berlin and Tokyo. I still have a marathon in Boston. I planned to run one marathon in Ukraine, but it has not happened yet, preparing for world marathons takes a lot of time, strength and energy, because I have already completed six abroad. Therefore, it will be a little later in Ukraine. —You said that you are part of the Patronage Service of the 808th Brigade. Tell us what you do. - Our service was created to care for wounded fighters, prisoners, missing, dead and their families. At the moment, the staff of this unit is being worked out in part and the recruitment of personnel is ongoing. My direction will be directly related to the rehabilitation of wounded soldiers, because in such a situation, I know how to act in this direction like a fish in water. I believe that the best is yet to come, both for me and for the military, who will need my help and guidance. When the brigade commander is interested, it will be done. I'm just a self-motivated person who has mastered a particular direction and I intend to help others. - Returning to the question of sports, tell us what are the peculiarities of running in the marathon distance? Any techniques? What does preparation for a marathon consist of? - We are not talking now about a marathon on a prosthesis, but in principle about a marathon as a sports competition, you need to understand that it is a long-term process that requires many hours of training and a regime. It is selected for each athlete individually. So it's more math at first. You have a desire to run a marathon, the coach must know what distance, what physical indicators of a person at the beginning of training, what endurance, that is, such basic things, with which he will have to work in the future. Next, the first months of training are scheduled, the distances can be about 15-20 kilometers, we run routes. If the coach sees progress, the indicators improve, then the goal is adjusted, say 30 kilometers in total per week, which we overcome in 5-6 days. If we talk about the marathon on a prosthesis, then, of course, this is a phenomenon that is not widespread in Ukraine, it needs to be studied and spread, and this is still a difficult issue. It is difficult for an ordinary person to run 42 kilometers, and for runners with a prosthesis, you need to understand the quality of the prosthesis, the level of professionalism of the prosthetist - a specialist who makes prosthetics. Because, let's say, 80 percent of a marathon runner's success with a prosthesis is due to the technique of prosthetics. The stump receiver is important here, because the prosthesis itself is made by a machine that does not make mistakes and will do everything exactly, but the stump receiver, which is inserted into the stump, is already the work of a person. The comfort of a runner on a prosthesis depends on how well it is made. - In the last month, you have completed two of the most prestigious marathons, I think they are part of the World Marathon Majors? - Yes. There is one more marathon left before the implementation of the World Marathon Majors, which includes six marathons: London, Boston, New York, Chicago, Berlin and Tokyo. This is the Boston Marathon and I plan to run it next year. I have to qualify for this. I really hope I can do it. - What is your best result? - My personal best is 42 km in three hours and 55 minutes. And the Berlin Marathon, which was held at the end of September, and which was preceded by six months of preparation. After the first London Marathon on April 23, 2023, I became the first veteran in Ukraine to overcome such a distance with a prosthesis. The marathon was difficult to get through and it was very difficult after it. First, there was a psychological misunderstanding of what it is and how it should happen. As for my physical condition, the next day I couldn't lift my body out of bed for about the first 10 minutes after I woke up. And my -living- leg did not want to walk on its own. It was necessary to break oneself to take the first step, because the muscles were spasmed and it cost a lot of effort. After the Berlin Marathon, I just woke up. Of course, there was pain in the muscles, that's natural. But he woke up, put his foot down and drove on. In two weeks, the marathon in Chicago has already been run. So, 84,000 meters were covered in two weeks - there was everything: drive and adrenaline, pain and fatigue, and struggle&#8230; - Roman, what motivates you? - Actually, there are many, many reasons for motivation, it cannot be explained in one sentence. First of all, of course, these are my children, family and all those for whom I live and continue to fight. These are the brothers who died and those who are alive and choose our independence. The latter play a significant role, because they find an opportunity directly from the front line (thanks to good people for -starlinks-) to support information through voice messages and SMS messages. The main thing is the idea that the guys do not give up on the front lines, show indomitability, risking life and health. So, being somewhere here, in a peaceful city or even across the border, I just have to dig the ground and make my way forward, because we are the Armed Forces. It comes naturally to me. I swore to protect and defend my country, and it doesn't matter if it's on the front or in sports. This is the same struggle for the prestige of the country. - You have a very strong track record and service in the Special Forces as well. How was your injury there? - When I arrived at the Kraken, only my commander knew that I was missing a leg. Outwardly, everyone is the same - in pants, therefore, on the legs. The top management found out about a month and a half later. This was already after the assault, where you have to lead a unit with you - on a prosthesis or not - it doesn't matter. When we flew on March 25 to storm Olkhovka, it was the first successful assault after Kharkov, when the -Moscolot- was driven away, there I moved on a par with everyone. And when the tank fired at the target, destroyed houses, I ran so that you couldn't tell whether I was wearing a prosthesis or not. - Did you play professional sports before the service? - I have been in sports all my life, as long as I can remember. Back in his school years, he ran the 100-meter race for the honor of the school. Then I went to the football section, I was a midfielder. Anyone who understands football knows that defenders are the horses that run forward after the ball. And even after the injury, he began to take sports more seriously, started with CrossFit, participated in veteran competitions. Later, he tried himself as a strongman when he was pulling a plane. And came to the marathon. Actually, I stopped at the marathon now. - How much mileage do you run per week when preparing for marathons? - Before the Berlin Marathon, it was between 54 and 58 kilometers per week. Just to run a marathon at a good pace, you need to run that distance in four days, that's good. But for the goal I am pursuing, this is very little, because I need to cover 70-80 kilometers in a week at best. But it's not so much about my physical condition, I'm physically and mentally ready for it. The main issue with the prosthesis: you need to have time for recovery, sometimes you simply don't have time to recover due to wear and tear and so on. That is, these technical issues require research and analysis. Which is exactly what I'm doing when I research my condition. During the Berlin Marathon, I really felt such a combination and harmony that I completely forgot that I had a prosthesis. I thought I had a living leg, healthy, and everything was fine, I was in one piece. This is how it should work, then there will be no problems, and there will be a good physical indicator. And here is a great merit of the prosthetist - because you can be strong-minded, have the desire to run, but because of a bad prosthesis, after 10 kilometers from your kilt, there will be minced meat. This is very important. - Do you have a foreign-made prosthesis? - Prosthesis and components from the Icelandic company -Ossur-, which is one of the leading high-tech prostheses on the market, but the assembly, manufacture of the stump-receiving sleeve (the stump is inserted there) and the prosthetics themselves — this is already the work of Ukrainian specialists. - How are you perceived abroad? - Sports diplomacy against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine has its own positive solutions. We want to draw attention to Ukraine, to show the world who we are, that we are not the barbarians that the -Rashka- made of us all these years. I printed a large trident on the back of my t-shirt, in which I ran, and signed it: Ukraine. And ahead were already the insignia of the combat unit, the insignia of the Support Forces Command and the organization that I represent. We are carriers of Ukrainian identity abroad. It's nice to hear -Glory to Ukraine- in different countries with different accents, and I always answer -Glory to the Heroes-, understanding that the civilized part of humanity is aware of the meaning of the slogan -Glory to Ukraine- and our emblem, our symbols - they already know it quite well. This inspires, stimulates, motivates, because Ukraine is not only known as a country on the world map. People like me, we are all part of the information war, it is a fire that needs to be constantly maintained, constantly thrown in, so that we are heard. Sport is perhaps the best way to demonstrate to the world that we are not just strong, but invincible. —Are Russians allowed to participate in such sporting events? Do they also participate in marathons? How does the world perceive them? - I heard the Katsap language, there were especially many -Russians- in Berlin, but it is important to note that the civilized sports world is closed to veteran occupiers. -Muscovites- are not invited to places where a purely veteran -dvizhuhha- gathers. It is very important to realize that there will never be veterans of the aggressor country abroad, and even more so in sports. The information campaign of the Ukrainian diaspora in Japan turned out to be quite powerful. Two veterans from Ukraine came to us for the marathon in Tokyo, and both are amputees. It was March, on the eve of Putin's election, when the Russian propaganda machine carried out information operations outside the borders of the countries of the former USSR regarding Crimea, spreading manipulative theses that it was never Ukrainian, that the war began in 2022, because Russia came to liberate our territories. When the world media presented us - two veterans from Ukraine who came to the marathon, who were injured long before the -wide scale-. Many thanks to our diaspora in Japan, they organized an interview with us, invited representatives of the world's top media and nullified the propaganda allegations. There was already a -mismatch-. . We talked about when and how the war started, how long it has been going on, that Russia took the Ukrainian Crimea, that the referendums were held under the influence of armed aggression and under the muzzle of a machine gun. With our arrival in Japan, our participation in the marathon, we quite powerfully undermined the information strategy of the Russians, the media switched exclusively to Ukraine, to veterans. This must be done, done on a permanent basis, regularly. When I run a marathon across the border, the price for the 42 km covered is my health, while Russia poisons the world with propaganda narratives, on which it spends billions of rubles so that the world hears their false truth. There should be a lot of information about us, we should develop, wage our struggle on all fronts by all possible means. Now I call on the wounded not to give up, draw attention to themselves, fight and show everyone around and the world that look, I am a man with a prosthesis, I have difficulties, but at the same time I have no limitations, I have unlimited opportunities for realization their life goals.

Guided air bombs JSOW from the United States: what kind of weapon is this and how will it help the D...	An ArmiyaInform correspondent asked Andriy Kharuk, a well-known arms researcher, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny, about this. - Andrii Ivanovich, what general information about this weapon? – The abbreviation JSOW stands for Joint Standoff Weapon, which can be translated as -long-range joint weapon-. -Community- at the same time means that this bomb was intended for arming aircraft of both the Air Force and the US Navy and Marine Corps. It is interesting that this ammunition has the -missile- designation in the nomenclature of the US Armed Forces - AGM -154, not -bomb- (as, for example, opornomu-punkti-u-kurskij-oblasti-kadry-vid-povitryanyh-syl/-> GBU-39/В, also known as SDB, which are already used by the Ukrainian Air Force ) - although most JSOW variants do not have their own engine. - Traditionally, you share with our readers interesting stories about the creation of weapons that Western partners transfer to Ukraine. And what can be said about JSOW in this regard? - The creation of JSOW began in 1986 at the initiative of the US Navy, which needed a replacement for laser-guided munitions - guided aerial bombs of the family Paveway and guided missiles AGM-65E Maverick. The new weapon was to be used according to the -shoot-and-forget- principle, that is, it did not require target illumination or external control of the cartridge during flight. This determined the composition of the guidance system - inertial-satellite (INS/GPS). The design of the KAB was carried out by Texas Instruments (now Raytheon) in 1992. The US Air Force, which was implementing its own program to create a similar ammunition, decided not to hesitate and join the naval program. In light of the reduction in military spending after the end of the Cold War, it looked like a completely rational decision. The first drops of AGM-154A bombs took place in 1994. In 1997, the bomb was adopted by the aviation of the US Navy, and in two years their mass production began. in caliber 1000 pounds - nominally 454 kg, but its mass is slightly greater (483 kg for AGM-154A and 497 kg for AGM-154C). It is equipped with a deployable wing with a fairly large span and plumage, and the flight range when dropped from a high altitude can reach 130 km. - As far as is known, this weapon has several modifications, and you partially mentioned it above. What are their design features? – The AGM-154A variant is a cluster, it is equipped with 145 BLU-97/B submunitions of combined action (cumulative-fragmentation-incendiary). Each such bomb weighs 1.54 kg. The AGM-154B variant, equipped with self-guided anti-tank ammunition, was developed for the needs of the US Air Force, but it was never adopted. The AGM-variant The 154C has a monoblock warhead of the penetrating type, designed to hit well-protected targets. The JSOW-ER variant with a turbojet engine and a flight range of up to 560 km was also tested, but it was not mass-produced. – In addition to the United States Army, the US defense-industrial complex periodically offers its special products to partner countries. And what is the situation with JSOW exports? – In addition to the United States, JSOW guided bombs were delivered to more than a dozen countries: Greece, Turkey, Poland, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, etc. – And how many bombs Can Ukraine potentially get JSOW? - Unfortunately, not so much - considering only US arsenals, not new production. The US Air Force stopped purchasing these munitions already in the 2005 fiscal year, having received 523 bombs. They were purchased for the Navy until 2015 - a total of 1,994 bombs. This gives a total of 2,517 bombs, of which four hundred were used in combat. That is, the maximum number of JSOW in the arsenals of the US Armed Forces can be about two thousand. Obviously, we will be given a few dozen such bombs to begin with, and in the future - maybe several hundred. - How will our aircraft be able to use JSOW? &#8211; The carriers will obviously be F-16s - they do not need to be adapted. The main targets for AGM-154A damage will be planar weakly protected objects. Among these, the Americans, first of all, call air defense positions. I would also add the destruction of military equipment parks, warehouses with ammunition and fuel, etc. AGM-154S will primarily hit command posts enemy, but also road/railway bridges and other infrastructure objects.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/kerovani-aviabomby-jsow-vid-ssha-shho-cze-za-zbroya-i-yak-vona-dopomozhe-sylam-oborony-ukrayiny/	2024-10-24T20:31:05-07:00
the Russians are falsifying the data of the Institute for the Study of War (ISW): what fake statisti...	As -proof- of this, the propagandists add an infographic showing data on the share of -foreign mercenaries- who allegedly received a disability, broken down by country. The initial date chronologically coincides with the beginning of the Armed Forces operation in the Kursk region. After all, under the infographic, fakers write that the source of this data is the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), an American think tank that specializes in researching modern armed conflicts, in particular, Russian aggression against Ukraine. StopFake contacted the ISW think tank , to find out whether he published data on the number of injured foreigners fighting for Ukraine. Evan Moore, ISW's deputy director of international relations, said in response to a StopFake inquiry that the statistics shared online were not prepared by ISW and do not reflect its assessments and views. All ISW materials are available on official resources. Russian propaganda regularly spreads misinformation about so-called foreign mercenaries in the ranks of the Armed Forces. Russian propagandists are trying to spoil Ukraine's relations with partner countries and discredit the military units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in which volunteers — citizens of other countries — serve.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/rosiyany-pidroblyayut-dani-instytutu-vyvchennya-vijny-isw-yaka-fejkova-statystyka-gulyaye-v-informprostori/	2024-10-24T20:11:24-07:00
-Radio telegraphed- the enemy: a radio telegrapher and a Telegram blogger were detained in Kharkiv O...	This was reported by the Prosecutor General's Office. In July 2024, the NSU radio telegrapher voluntarily established a permanent connection with a representative of the FSB of the Russian Federation in the messenger. During personal correspondence, the woman repeatedly conveyed information about the deployment of units of the Ukrainian troops, which are directly involved in repelling Russian armed aggression in Kharkiv Oblast and adjacent territories. The second suspect is an unemployed resident of the village. Kivsharivka of the Kupyan district, who administered a pro-Russian Telegram channel about the -situation- in the Kupyan region. On the Internet resource, he systematically presented the locations of the Ukrainian military and equipment. The -blogger- called on the channel's readers to join in disseminating information about the bases and movements of the Defense Forces in the Kupyan direction. In fact, this information was necessary for the enemy to make a breakthrough and occupy the settlements of the Kupyan district. Law enforcement officers detained the suspects, they were remanded in custody without bail. Both persons were informed of the suspicion of unauthorized dissemination of information about the movement, movement or location of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Russian special services are trying to recruit even ten-year-old children in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/radiotelegrafuvaly-vorogu-na-harkivshhyni-zatrymaly-radiotelegrafistku-ta-telegram-blogera/	2024-10-24T11:57:03-07:00

Golf-kobzon — occupiers on golf carts were thinned out by the cassette and polished by drones	The video of the battle in the Pokrovsky direction was released on October 24 on the brigade's channel. An assault group of invaders on golf carts flew at speed to land. A mortar immediately flew at the golf cart, the infantry hurried and ran forward, just under the cluster ammunition of the artillery of the 59th mechanized brigade. The rest of the infantry raced to land, where they were eventually killed by FPV drones.

Further, the military medical commission, on its own initiative, will have the opportunity to review this medical data set and make its administrative decision.

Mass bankruptcies: a new trend in Russian industry	This is reported by Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. According to forecasts, the policy of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation will lead to stagflation and stop the export of high-tech products already in 2025. Today, the high interest rate of the Russian regulator is even reducing the profits of defense enterprises. This will lead to the cessation of the export of aircraft, air defense equipment, ships and other high-tech products of -growth-, and as a result - to a wave of bankruptcies of industrial companies. The high rate is also the reason for disruption of the terms of delivery of military products. Since the summer of 2023, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation has raised the interest rate seven times and brought it to 19% per annum. Another increase is expected on October 25 - up to 21%. Among the reasons for the rate increase, Russian economists cite trillion dollar infusions into the defense industry of the Russian Federation, which provoke inflation. On the other hand, the official statistics of the Russian Federation claim that there are no problems in the Russian industry: the volume of production in the country increased by 4.5% in January-August 2024, and the government in the draft budget for 2025 predicts an increase in production by another 2%.

The EU is preparing a new intelligence structure to counter threats from Russia	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The document will contain a proposal -to gradually create a full-fledged intelligence agency of the EU.- We will remind that at the beginning of 2024, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, instructed S. Nijnisto to provide recommendations on increasing the readiness of the European Union to face possible crises. The report will include possible measures to counter the aggressive policy of the Kremlin and Russia (in particular, countering artificially created migration crises), the potential consequences of conflicts in the Middle East, and China's rapid growth. In fact, S. Niinisto recommends expanding the powers and activities of the already existing EU Intelligence and Situation Center (EU INTCEN), including intelligence gathering with the help of EU diplomatic missions and conducting counterintelligence operations. The main aim is to avoid duplication of work by national intelligence services and to help counter espionage targeting EU institutions. It is argued that because the EU does not have its own intelligence service, officials analyze publicly available data and intelligence received from member states, limiting Brussels' ability to detect and respond to potential threats. Earlier ArmyInform reported that a group from Holosiivsk RTCC -helped- more than a thousand evaders. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/yes-gotuye-novu-rozviduvalnu-strukturu-dlya-protydiyi-zagrozam-z-boku-rosiyi/	2024-10-24T06:28:18-07:00

You can no longer cover yourself with a leaf: how autumn will change the situation on the battlefiel...	How autumn will change the situation on the battlefield on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon the representative of the communications service told with the public of the 13th operational brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine -Charter- Volodymyr Degtyarev. — It has been a long time since we have had massive offensives with the use of equipment. We managed to successfully repulse all previous attacks. Out of 5-6 tanks that could move towards us, one could return to the enemy, even if defeated. Therefore, it is likely that either he is running out of equipment and is not taking risks, or he is doing some kind of accumulation process, he said. The Guardsman suggested that the enemy may be preparing for a change in conditions on the battlefield in view of the onset of natural autumn with frequent rains, cold weather and falling leaves. — We understand that now the weather is changing, a cold weather is coming. Now the situation is when the situation on the battlefield will change very much from the overview to the fact that the leaves will fall - it will become more visible and more difficult to defend. The conditions of stay in the landings will become more difficult, Volodymyr Degtyarev explained. However, it is extremely difficult for the occupiers to prepare for a change in the situation on the battlefield due to the onset of autumn. -It's not easy to prepare, get equipment and bring in some equipment in conditions where the air is well filtered and controlled, in particular by us and other units,- said the representative of -Charter-. According to him, the occupiers are in significantly worse conditions than the fighters of the Defense Forces. — We see that their moral and psychological state, at least those prisoners we take, is extremely low. We understand that they are certainly in worse conditions, because even in the most remote positions we regularly deliver to our fighters, using, for example, night drones, provisions and ammunition. It is much more difficult for the enemy, they do not have such means. Therefore, they have to survive in these crevices for weeks with minimal supplies, the guard said. He thanked everyone who supports the Defense Forces of Ukraine in general and the -Charter- brigade in particular for their constant help, thanks to which the defenders of Ukraine will meet autumn and winter properly equipped with everything they need. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Forces defense told how the priorities of Russian contractors on the front are changing.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/lystochkom-vzhe-ne-prykrytysya-yak-osin-zminyt-obstanovku-na-poli-boyu/	2024-10-24T01:52:28-07:00

A representative of the public relations service of the 13th brigade told about this on the broadcasts of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon operational assignment of the National Guard of Ukraine -Charter- Volodymyr Degtyarev. — The specificity of the terrain in Kharkiv Oblast is that there is no long line of trenches here.

The occupiers set up high-quality fortifications and shelters in the -woodlands-, from which it is very difficult to -dig out- enemy personnel. — In these forest strips, the occupiers dig in very deep. They do not dig trenches there, but multi-story holes. It is very difficult to clear each of them in conditions of difficult terrain, when you cannot really see what is happening in the forest strip 3-5-10 meters away. Therefore, it was a gradual work, in which artillery, mortars, assault units, and our attack bombers were involved. It was a well-planned joint operation, the soldier explained.

Prime Minister of Ukraine: Russia's economic growth calls into question the effectiveness of sanctio...	He announced this during a speech at the ministerial round table of the World Bank. He noted that in July, Russia rose in the rating to the level of countries with a high income (High Income Country), which puts it on the same level as the most developed countries in the world. Recently, the World Bank raised its economic growth forecasts for Russia for 2024 and 2025. Denys Shmyhal emphasized that this testifies to the imperfection of the sanctions system, as Russia continues to use Western technologies to produce missiles that kill Ukrainians. The prime minister called for decisive action to reduce Russia's ability to wage an aggressive war.

Dmytro Pletenchuk recalls that the ships of the occupiers unexpectedly went out to sea several times from the base in Novorossiysk, which raised the question of what it was and why it was happening so en masse. The explanation of these maneuvers is quite simple. -They train like this because, I understand, they have fears that they can be hit directly at the base point. But we all saw that they went there just as en masse and returned quite quickly, because in principle they cannot find other bases in the Azov-Black Sea region,- the spokesman said. As reported by ArmyInform , the Navy commented on the presence of the Alrosa submarine in the Black Sea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/trenuvannya-ryvka-chornomorskyj-flot-posyleno-gotuyetsya-tikaty/	2024-10-23T23:57:18-07:00

About missing persons, non-payment of -combatants- and polygraph for colleagues. Interview with the ...	ArmyInform asked the head of the Office, Colonel Volodymyr Laguta, what questions are most often asked by army personnel and their family members. — Mr. Volodymyr, you reported that in the first four months of work, your Department processed 965 appeals and requests. In particular, with regard to non-payment of financial support and one-time benefits, issues of dismissal from military service. What are the reasons for such appeals by the military? When exactly does the moment of violation of the rights of a military man come? - The reasons can be various, but it is absolutely necessary to find out the prerequisites that contributed to this. I will give an example. The soldier was wounded in the Zaporozhye direction, he was concussed, he went to the hospital himself. In a day or two, his combatant begins to figure out where the person has disappeared to. Submitted it to the SZCH (arbitrary omission of a part - Ed.). Military allowances were stopped. He turned to us for help. My colleagues found out all the circumstances, went to the military unit, in particular, to the commander, and helped to solve this issue. In practice, sometimes everything can be fixed even by phone. Communication is important. We cooperate with the public sector. We have a crisis center at the Ministry of Defense. A very powerful team, which, in particular, monitors all social networks, any information in different directions. If they see any violation of (military rights.- Ed.), then they redirect these stories to us. We prepare both weekly and daily reports, so we can see the emergence of mass requests from the military of a certain unit. In this case, we communicate with the unit to quickly respond to similar problems and quickly restore the violated rights of servicemen, as well as to prevent such violations in the future. At one time, there was another serious problem - commanders did not accept reports. For its solution, with the participation of the -Princip- NGO, a normative legal act was prepared, which regulates the procedure for submission and their consideration. In particular, it was proposed to digitize the submission of reports. A technical task was formed for the developers of the -Army+- application, and a corresponding order was developed. So now we have e-reports, and specific deadlines for their review in written and electronic form have also been defined. No less important area of ​​our work is consideration of appeals and complaints from family members of military personnel, including when military personnel do not communicate. Sometimes they call the commanders, want to know the fate of their loved ones, but they do not answer them. In such a case, the officers of the CUZPV send appropriate requests to the military units and establish communication with the relevant officials. Many people have died or are missing. Important in this case is the creation of the Escort Service in the Armed Forces, the role of which, in particular, is aimed at communicating with the relatives of servicemen. — You recently mentioned that you are working to change the way you date the death of people who were considered missing. Please tell us in more detail. - These are changes to the decrees that regulate the payment of a lump sum benefit in the event of death. For example, a serviceman went missing four years ago. Subsequently, the Defense Forces cleared a certain area and found the remains, transferred them to a medical facility, conducted a DNA analysis and confirmed that these remains belong to the said serviceman. Currently, the date of death is recorded from the moment a person is considered missing. Following the proposed changes, the date of death will be recorded from the moment of DNA confirmation. A person can receive the right to a one-time cash payment within three years. If more than three years have passed from the moment of death to the moment of realization of the right to one-time assistance, the family can renew the right to payment only through the court. The changes proposed by the Office are currently under consideration by the CMU. — The main reasons for the violation of rights — illegal actions of officials and commanders. How can this situation be equalized and is it possible at all? - The army has increased several times, new people have arrived. They need to be trained, and we are also working on this. We launch appropriate courses, provide clarifications, give recommendations, etc. — Are you going to introduce a kind of informational and legal hygiene in the troops? — More legal. There are actually a lot of problems, they have been accumulating for years. — Another reason for appeals, according to you, is non-payment of the combat 100,000. Why does such a problem arise at all, in your opinion, and how do you influence it? - One of the last stories is mentioned. We were contacted by a serviceman who was injured and is being treated at a medical facility. According to the law, all payments, including combat pay, are retained, in particular, during treatment. He already has a court decision, which the military unit is not enforcing. We have started processing his complaint. It turns out that the commander was on a combat mission, and his subordinates did not inform him about this situation. We provided recommendations on how to get out of this situation, so the issue was resolved. — You reported that two investigations were also carried out, and in some cases there were indications of crimes that were reported to the appropriate authorities. Can you tell me more? Are there open criminal proceedings? - Do you have access to the state secret? — None. — Then I cannot comment in detail on this issue, sorry. Yes, there were indeed two investigations, the facts were confirmed and, on the instructions of the minister, the materials were transferred to the relevant authorities. — Another area of ​​your work— observance of gender equality, as well as problems related to discrimination based on gender. Why do you think this question arises in the tenth year of the war? You reported that official inspections or official investigations can also be conducted in this direction. — In my opinion, the issue of non-compliance with gender equality is precisely related to the increase in the number of military personnel and the silencing of the problem, as well as reluctance to respond to such violations both on the part of the injured person and on the part of direct management. In order to prevent this, the officers of our Office take an active part in the work on the development of the Instructions for the provision and consideration of reports on violations related to gender discrimination, offenses against sexual freedom and sexual integrity, as well as their registration in the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the Armed Forces Forces of Ukraine and the State Special Service of Transport, intelligence agencies of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and their subordinate units, institutions and centers. — How was the management team formed? Who are these people? — People learned about management from various sources: heard from acquaintances, saw vacancies on LobbyX, etc. When someone sent a resume, the organizational core of our newly formed Office was already looking at that person. The date of the interview was determined. Some even called from the battlefield via video link. One of the candidates called almost from surrounded Ugledar - and we interviewed him. We also have a principled position: all our people pass a polygraph. I personally passed the test too. This is done so that I can speak honestly with my subordinates. By the way, one of the important factors is included in the polygraph test - regarding the interaction of the candidate with the foreign special services of the Russian Federation and the Russian Federation. As for the officers themselves, they are mostly people with a legal education, some have experience in law enforcement, advocacy, almost all of them have combat experience. — Do you currently have vacant positions in the Department? — Yes, there are vacant positions in the Department. There are also candidates who have already passed all background checks, interviews and polygraphs, and we are currently preparing relocation plans. But there are certain points here: our potential candidates are smart lawyers in military units, and not all commanders want to let good specialists go(smiles- Ed.). Therefore, we help to find a replacement so that the military unit is not weakened in personnel.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/pro-znyklyh-bezvisty-nevyplatu-bojovyh-ta-poligraf-dlya-koleg-intervyu-z-kerivnykom-czentralnogo-upravlinnya-zahystu-prav-vijskovosluzhbovcziv-mou/	2024-10-23T21:21:39-07:00

What is the reason for the urgency of the Victory Plan and what is most important in it for the mili...	The head of state is convinced that if we start moving this specific plan now, it will be possible to end the war no later than next year. What is the urgency of the Victory Plan right now and what is most important in it for explains the military expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studios of Strategic Studies- Olexandr Chupak: -Currently, Ukraine is going through perhaps the most difficult period of the war after the first weeks of the large-scale invasion of Russia. The occupier is intensifying offensive actions in most directions, directly involving the DPRK in the war, finding ways to circumvent sanctions, etc. At the same time, our allies, led by the USA, show a complete unwillingness to respond adequately to the increased threat. In such a situation, Ukraine needed a strong move that would attract the attention of world leaders and return us to the center of geopolitical discussions on the eve of the American elections (to be held on November 5). Kyiv had to demonstrate to the politicians and citizens of allied countries why they are transferring their funds to Ukraine and under what conditions the assistance will no longer be needed. Among the five presented points, the second one is the most important, because it should immediately increase the defense capability of Ukraine and guarantee us an advantage on the battlefield. It is about assistance in -staffing reserve brigades for the Armed Forces, strengthening air defense, jointly with partners shooting down Russian drones and missiles, investments in Ukrainian defense production, lifting restrictions on the use of long-range weapons, providing relevant long-range capabilities and satellite data and intelligence information in real time -. In this list, only -joint shooting down of Russian drones and missiles- should be considered a distant prospect. Other items can be implemented in a short period of time or even instantly, for example, -removing restrictions on the use of long-range weapons.- If the Biden administration today allows us to strike deep into Russian territory with ATACMS missiles, tomorrow we will see many reports of destroyed warehouses with -Shaheeds- and ballistic systems that are terrorizing our cities. In general, the Victory Plan is a concise statement of what Ukrainians have been talking about since the beginning of 2022 or even earlier. Ukraine's entry into NATO was enshrined in our Constitution in 2019. Ukraine has been asking for the provision of lethal weapons since the beginning of the war in 2014, and only in 2018 did President Trump sign a decree on the transfer of Javelin complexes to us. Even before the start of the large-scale invasion, the Ukrainians emphasized that our economic and human potential cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of Russia, because it will instantly be directed against the eastern flank of NATO. Interesting are the points about the deployment of non-nuclear strategic deterrence forces on the territory of Ukraine and the replacement by Ukrainian units of certain military contingents of the US armed forces stationed in Europe. Obviously, they can be implemented only under the conditions of Ukraine's accession to NATO and a general change in the approach of the Alliance countries to the Russian-Ukrainian war. Now is such a good time, given the indecision of Washington, Brussels and others. However, the Victory Plan may receive a serious boost in the event of changes in the United States after the election.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/chym-vyklykana-terminovist-planu-peremogy-i-shho-v-nomu-najvazhlyvishe-dlya-vijskovyh-dumka-eksperta/	2024-10-23T21:09:44-07:00
F-16 in Byzantine style: what Ukraine can learn from the - cunning - Greeks	In the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine considered and commented on the possibility of receiving F-16 from this country and for some time this issue was on the agenda. After long negotiations, Ukraine signed a> in October 2024 with this country the Agreement on cooperation in the field of security. All this is about the Hellenic Democracy, which in Ukraine is traditionally called the Hellenic Republic or, for short, Greece. The modern Greek state has ancient cultural, political, military and diplomatic traditions that reach the depths of the history of the Hellenic polis of Antiquity and the Byzantine Empire and its fragments from the Middle Ages. The Hellenic heritage is one of the fundamental foundations of modern Europe. The historical legacy largely determines the place and role of Greece in modern politics, reliably ensuring its rightful place in the world community. However, the Hellenic Republic is not only revered for its ancient history and culture - its significance is also determined by its recent and current achievements and position in the political arena. In the military sphere, Greece can be proud not only of victories in the glorious battles of Antiquity and the Middle Ages, or of worthy participation in the First and Second World Wars closer to modern times. Even more important is the military power of the Greek state at the current stage, which has been convincingly demonstrated over the past decades not only during military exercises, but also during actual combat operations. Along with the ground forces and the navy, Greece has a powerful Air Force, whose air fleet includes both time-tested classic combat vehicles and the latest models of military equipment and weapons. Among the military aircraft of the Air Force of the Army of the Hellenic Republic, one of the leading places for a long time belonged to the F-16 Fighting Falcon fighters, which, among other things, participated in a combat confrontation with a real enemy in the air. The experience of the Greek Air Force in the operation and combat use of the F-16 is undeniable. In the course of the Aegean dispute with Turkey in the 1990s and 2000s, they participated not only in regular airspace patrols over the Aegean Sea, but also in repeated simulated and real combat clashes with Turkish military aircraft. The intensive use of the F-16 allowed Greek pilots and service personnel to deeply study these combat vehicles and gain invaluable experience in their operation and maintenance in combat conditions. According to the Security Cooperation Agreement between Ukraine and the Hellenic Republic, Greece will provide additional resources to accelerate the training of Ukrainian military pilots and technical personnel for F-16 aircraft. Both parties have a deep interest in such a partnership. Ukraine is receiving specialists and additional resources, and is also taking a step towards the possible acquisition, in one way or another, of Greek F-16 aircraft. Greece, on the other hand, creates additional conditions in order to transfer F-16 to Ukraine in the most profitable way for itself. The Greeks' diplomatic tradition goes even deeper than their truly thorough knowledge of the F-16, with Greek politicians repeatedly using it to bolster their country's Air Force as well. One of the clear examples is the creation of the preconditions for the Hellenic Republic to be able to purchase F-16 Fighting Falcons for its fleet from the United States of America in the mid-1980s. At that time, the US government hesitated for a long time whether to sell F-16s to Greece, because it created tension in relations with Turkey. To open a window of opportunity, in 1985 the Greeks entered into an agreement to purchase 40 Dassault Mirage 2000s from France. After that, it became much easier for the administration of US President Ronald Reagan to open a contract for the purchase of 40 F-16 Fighting Falcons to Greece. Therefore, in the person of Greece, Ukraine has not only a good friend and a reliable partner, but also an experienced teacher of the diplomatic game, because the annals remark -the Greeks are cunning even to this day- has not lost its relevance to this day. By all accounts, at least in terms of getting additional F-16s, the apprentice should prove worthy of his mentor.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/f-16-po-vizantijsky-chomu-ukrayina-mozhe-navchytysya-u-hytromudryh-elliniv/	2024-10-23T20:48:51-07:00
Vyshyvanka, Mazepinka and flag for the film festival in Venice: the story of the most colorful artil...	He already has more than seven years of combat experience behind him - he started as a mechanic-driver of an ACS, and now he has already received the rank of officer and helps manage the battery. In a conversation with ArmyInform correspondents, -Lebyd- talked about his military service and what it's like to be the most colorful soldier in the brigade. — I come from a small village in the Lviv region, near the border with Poland. Always liked to wear embroidered shirts, was interested in history. At the beginning of the great war, when we were still in Volyn, a suit was sent to me from home. I also joked that my grandfather was buried and removed from it. And he walked like that, at first everyone was very surprised, - remembers -Lebyd-. On top, he wore a jacket, a bulletproof vest, and so he went on every trip. None of the commanders were against it, on the contrary, they even asked to take a picture. — Later I found people who make historical clothes, they made me a cap for free. Already here in the East, the locals were surprised, some looked askance, others smiled. And the -Swan- also has a flag of Ukraine, which visited the famous Venice festival. In 2022, journalists who were supposed to go to Italy came to the unit. They asked the soldiers for a flag, they signed it and eventually displayed it in Venice as a sign of support for Ukraine. Military service for the -Swan- began back in 2016. During the ATO/OS, he served in the 24th Separate Mechanized Brigade named after King Danylo as a mechanic-driver of the 2C1 -Gvozdika- self-propelled artillery installation. During the ATO/OS, his unit performed tasks near Soledar, fought on the Svitlodar arc. Later there were Maryinka, Toretsk. The officer remembers that then the war was completely different compared to today's realities. - Then there was not as much work as now. We calmly left, worked out and rolled back. Then you didn't worry about drones, they worked right in the field. It was much easier. Now we are working only when we are dug in. However, stationary work has its advantages: you do not need time for travel, guidance. Nowadays, it takes 3 minutes from handing over a target to firing a shot, he explains. In 2020, -Swan- retired from the army, although he admits that he missed the service for a long time. The Great War caught him in Germany, where he was working as a truck driver at the time. —In two days I was already returning home and on the third day I was in the unit (in the 24th brigade — Ed.). When I was discharged from the army, I immediately said: there is no need to look for me, I will come myself. However, at that time there were a lot of volunteers and the staff of the brigade was already formed, so I was offered to join another one, - he recalls. After that, the units received equipment, spent some time on the training ground, then were on border guard duty in Volyn, and reconciliation took place in parallel. In April 2022, -Lebid- and its crew of -Gvozdika- ACS went to Mykolaiv Oblast, where at that time the Russians were advancing with the intention of occupying the south of Ukraine. we can't stand it And as a result, we lasted until October until we reached the seashore. Then we were sent to Bakhmut. Everything was flying there from all sides, it was very difficult for the artillery to work there, they stayed there for about two months. For more than a year, the -Swan- has been fighting with artillerymen in the Lymansky direction: - Now our main task is to deter the enemy. We only see some assault actions, 3-4 minutes and we fire the first shot. The division has aerial reconnaissance, which gives us targets to hit. He says that sometimes 40 shells were fired from one gun in a day, they tried to shoot as much as possible at every opportunity. But in two years, the nature of hostilities has changed a lot and become more complicated due to drones. - As soon as we left, the enemy -birds- already saw us and began to -arrive-. It was necessary to move to a distance where their artillery could no longer reach. At first, we were constantly on the move, sleeping for 2-3 hours straight in the cars. &nbsp; Recently, the Russians have increased the number of assaults, including with armored vehicles, in the Lyman region. -The enemy is trying to capture as much as possible before the winter,- thinks -Swan-. After receiving the rank of officer, he had much more non-combat work. — I am responsible for the condition of equipment, not only combat units, but also -loaves-, pickup trucks. Everything that drives and shoots. There has been more work with documents, now I'm definitely in the UPA, a paper army, - laughs -Lebyd-. /span> — In 2022, there was no need to look for anyone, everyone went by themselves. Now there are fewer of them, for some reason everyone is waiting until the last, but if you are mobilized, then it will be impossible to choose a brigade or a position in the TCC, - adds the artilleryman. combat experience, not just textbooks. -For a gun to fire one shot, many people need to be involved, in fact it is a whole operation,- the officer explains. ArmyInform reminds you of the opportunity to use aggregator of vacancies in ZSU on our website. In addition, a government resolution has entered into force that allows military units -bez-tczk/->mobilize reservists and conscripts who voluntarily wish to serve during mobilization.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/vyshyvanka-mazepynka-i-prapor-dlya-kinofestyvalyu-u-venecziyi-istoriya-najkolorytnishogo-artylerysta-zsu-u-stepah-donechchyny/	2024-10-23T20:37:32-07:00
What is the Humvee's successor capable of: a silent armored car was presented in the USA	The basis for the car was the Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD ZR2 SUV, as well as a 2.8-liter Duramax turbodiesel engine from GM with a 12-module battery, and drive motors for the front and rear axles. The battery capacity is 300 kilowatt-hours and the fuel tank holds 56 liters. Thanks to electric traction, the machine can operate with low thermal and acoustic load. And this, in turn, allows you to imperceptibly enter and leave the battlefield. The on-board network provides power for sensors and systems that consume a lot of energy. General Motors took into account previous mistakes, so the new car has rollover protection, which was a significant problem with the Humvee. The prototype also has other active and passive safety features, including anti-lock braking system, electronic stability control system, four- and five-point seat belts, as well as 360° cameras. Advantages include lower maintenance requirements due to a reduction in the number of parts and subsystems in the overall propulsion system. The prototype provides for the possibility of installing additional armor on it. -If you look at Ukraine, at the fighting going on right now, one of the risks is that if you're found, you can be killed,- said Pete Johnson, GM Defense's vice president of integrated vehicle business development. The Ukrainian military evacuates the wounded from the front lines in civilian vehicles because they operate more quietly than military vehicles, he added. The company learned about it from those in the war zone. According to Pete Johnson, the technology of the new GM car ensures silent movement. The car is capable of powering the systems without the engine running while idling. The driver can switch between -silent mode- and normal engine operation with the push of a switch. The presence of a battery reduces the need for external batteries, as the military can use the vehicle as a power source. Pete Johnson also added that the company has integrated instant torque technology, which allows efficient and maneuverable off-road driving. He noted that such a design reduces the burden on the supply system and logistics, as hybrid electric vehicles use fewer parts and less fuel and other batteries on the battlefield. GM Defense demonstrated the machine at the annual conference of the Association of the US Army in Washington. The prototype includes a Kongsberg remote weapon station, a Lockheed Martin Javelin anti-tank missile launcher and a Drone Buster to counter threats from unmanned aerial systems in the rear, as well as a tethered Hoverfly drone for reconnaissance. The machine can be transported by C-130 and C-17 aircraft, and can also be loaded by a CH-47 Chinook or MH-53 King Stallion cargo rotorcraft.

-Prayers from mobilization-, or How propaganda tries to discredit OCU	The other day, Ukrinform journalists exposed another fake spread by the Russian mass media and enemy Telegram channels. This is a video of an unidentified person holding a piece of paper with what appears to be a -mobilization prayer.- The video states that such a -prayer- costs 10 hryvnias. The footage is clearly a fake production. The ornament used to decorate the piece of paper in the video can be found on Russian stock Internet resources. It is called -Russian pattern-. Propagandists replaced the symbol of the Russian Orthodox Church with domes on it with the cross of the OCU. In addition, in the text of the prayer, all the letters -z- are written in Latin -z- - one of the symbols of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Latin -z- is not used in the fonts not only in the printed products of the OCU, but even in the Old Slavonic ones, which are used to print prayers in the RPC and its branches in Ukraine UPC (MP). It is also impossible to determine the location where the video of the propagandists was shot. After all, apart from a hand holding a card with a -prayer- and a church altar with candles, which can stand in any Orthodox church in the world, there is nothing else in the frame. Russian propaganda tries to show that the OCU allegedly uses religious doctrines for financial enrichment, thereby trying to sow distrust in the local Ukrainian church. By creating such fakes, Russian propagandists are also trying to demoralize Ukrainian society, undermining trust in religious and national institutions, particularly in wartime, in order to disrupt the mobilization process.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/molytvy-vid-mobilizacziyi-abo-yak-rospropaganda-namagayetsya-dyskredytuvaty-pczu/	2024-10-23T20:13:44-07:00

In addition, among the representatives was Maksym Butkevich, a Ukrainian human rights defender and soldier whom we recently managed to free from Russian captivity. Among the topics discussed by the participants during the meeting are the Victory Plan and the need for unification. The President offered to join the development of our internal action plan. -Our victory requires exactly the kind of unity that existed in the first days of the full-scale Russian invasion. We count on unity in the promotion of the partners' decision to invite Ukraine to NATO. Thank you for your help in developing the Maritime Strategy. It is important to work out the format of the technological Stavka — a good proposal. Together, we must restore justice for Ukraine, bring a reliable peace closer, and talk with our partners about everything that can make Ukraine stronger. Thank you to each and every one of you for your ideas and suggestions and willingness to work together,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized.

An application for the codification of a new type of weapon can be submitted online	About this informs the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. -Our soldiers at the front need more modern weapons and equipment. To do this, we create the most favorable conditions for OVT manufacturers. The procedure for codification of OVT samples was shortened to 10 days. Many organizational processes were optimized. The -Iron Range- project was launched. This is an opportunity for manufacturers of military equipment to test their products for free at a military training ground at various stages of production. Now a new option has been implemented - the opportunity for gunsmiths to submit an application for the codification of an OVT sample online. In the process of its processing, manufacturers will automatically receive information about the completion of the stages of codification of their OVT sample,- said the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Ivan Havryliuk. How to use the service of submitting an application online On the official website https://www.mil.gov.ua/, in the -CURRENT- section, the banner -ARSENAL- Window for OVT manufacturers- is placed. By going to the page, OBT producers can use the active link Window for OBT producers (mod.gov.ua). Access to the service occurs through authorization using id.gov.ua. Data entered by the developer is securely protected. -For convenience, we have placed sample documents that must be filled out by OVT developers. They are grouped according to some of the most popular nomenclature of OVT: EW means, BpAK, ammunition for BpAK, ground robotic complexes. The manufacturer must leave his contact details, e-mail. The developer will receive a notification about changes in the status of the application to the specified address. Each producer of OVT will receive the contact details of an MOU specialist who supports the application,- explained the head of the Main Directorate for Life Cycle Support of Weapons and Military Equipment, Colonel Volodymyr Rochniak. Documents required for submitting an application for codification: Previously ArmyInform reported that the ratio of shots fired at the Armed Forces and the occupiers has improved. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/zayavku-na-kodyfikacziyu-novogo-zrazka-ozbroyennya-mozhna-podaty-onlajn/	2024-10-23T11:31:15-07:00

The majority of stateless persons in Estonia are the Russian-speaking population, which remained stateless after the restoration of independence in 1991. According to the draft law, the right to vote in local elections will be preserved only for citizens of Estonia and citizens of those countries with which an international agreement ratified by the parliament has been concluded. Four out of six parliamentary factions supported the initiative. The bill received 28 signatures (a total of 101 deputies in the parliament), passed the first reading and will be discussed at an open meeting of the Constitutional Commission. The legislative initiative concerns primarily Russian citizens who have the status of a resident of Estonia and can participate in local elections. It is relevant against the background of poll results, which show that a significant part of Russian citizens (38%) and stateless persons (52%) do not condemn the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Mariupol schoolchildren are forced to write letters to military assassins.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/v-estoniyi-planuyut-pozbavyty-rosiyan-rezydentiv-krayiny-prava-golosu-na-vyborah/	2024-10-23T11:19:00-07:00

About how the Russian command manages to achieve this, the representative of the communications service told on the air of the Espresso TV channel of public relations of the 13th operational brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine -Charter- Volodymyr Degtyarev. — The average Russian serviceman on the frontline is very limited in his rights and means of communication. They do not have any information about what is happening in Belgorod region. All phones and means of communication are taken from them, he said. In view of this, it is almost impossible to somehow influence the morale and psychological state of enemy soldiers by informing them about the situation in Russia. In addition, the vast majority of soldiers in the Russian army have an extremely low level of critical thinking. - Any of our actions on the territory of a neighboring state in order to reduce their defense capability is certainly very important. However, it is difficult to say that this affects the moral and psychological state of our opponent. After all, the level of critical thinking in them is very low, and there are practically no methods of obtaining information in them, - the military explained.

A representative of the public relations service of the 13th brigade told about this on the air of the Espresso TV channel operational assignment of the National Guard of Ukraine -Charter- Volodymyr Degtyarev. — Of course, their first motivation is to sign a contract. It's money and parole or parole, release from their term, he said. However, the priorities of newly appointed Russian servicemen change quite quickly. - However, further, at the moment when they get closer to the battle line, their main motivation is to survive. At the same time, they are more afraid of their own commanders and -blockade troops- than of Ukrainians, the military officer said. This can be learned from the interrogations of Russian prisoners of war. — We can see this by the fact that they surrender to captivity when they could hypothetically leave. But they are told that there is no way back, said Volodymyr Degtyarev.

A representative of the public relations service of the 13th brigade told about this on the air of the Espresso TV channel operational assignment of the National Guard of Ukraine -Charter- Volodymyr Degtyarev. — The Russians are the same, only new. The service life of the average Russian at the front can now be measured in weeks, if not days, on average, because it is their main consumable, he said. The military noted that this is about regular replenishment of enemy units already present in the Kharkiv direction with new soldiers, and not about transferring new units or formations here. — Units and stickers on the map remain the same, that is, we know exactly which regiment, which division, which corps is opposite us. However, from interceptions, from interrogations of prisoners, we see that this is their main expendable personnel. It is constantly changing, constantly supplemented with some other infusions, the spokesman explained. These are usually newly recruited contract workers, often including ex-prisoners. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the occupiers are already recruiting ten-year-old children.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/dvoh-troh-tyzhniv-ne-bude-u-sylah-oborony-oczinyly-termin-prydatnosti-rosijskogo-soldata-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-10-23T09:31:28-07:00

In the area of ​​responsibility of the 57th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade — in the city of Vovchansk and its surroundings — fighting with the occupiers continues. Despite the complete destruction of the city, the enemy did not manage to achieve tactical success. They are trying to change the situation in their favor with fiber-optic drones, which cannot suppress Ukrainian EW means. However, it does not give special advantages to the enemy, Archie is sure. -The aircraft simply turns into a conventional anti-tank guided missile with wire guidance. It prevents it from successfully maneuvering like ordinary drones. We have to understand: the wire is not infinite, it weighs something, and it can catch on many obstacles that are present in the city. This is the kind of technology that they use in anti-tank guided missiles, and we know it, so we also understand how to fight it...- - notes the officer of the 57th Brigade named after Kostya Gordienko, Yak reported ArmyInform, soldiers of the 57th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade were honored at the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the name of Kostya Gordienko, the chieftain of the basket. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/i-drit-ne-neskinchennyj-i-mozhe-zachepytys-rosijske-vundervaffe-ne-lyakaye-zahysnykiv-vovchanska/	2024-10-23T09:01:25-07:00
BRICS leaders spoke out against Russia's plans to transform the union into an anti-American coalitio...	About this informs the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. In particular, the absence of Brazilian President L. da Silva overruled Putin's plans to hold a tripartite meeting between Russia, China and Brazil in order to demonstrate the economic power of the union. This year, less than 20 leaders, mostly from African countries, came to Russia. A significant number refused to go for various reasons. The President of Brazil L. da Silva, for example, was -injured-, the President of Cuba M. Díaz-Canel - due to blackouts in the country, the President of Serbia A. Vučić - due to the planned meeting with the President of Poland and a visit to the USA. There is also no representation of Saudi Arabia at the highest level in Kazan. In 2023, the BRICS summit in South Africa brought together more than 30 leaders (heads of government, vice presidents, presidents). With this in mind, Russia deliberately opened the summit on a separate day from the main sessions, in order to organize negotiations with the leaders of each country separately on the first day and impose the decisions and visions it wants. At the same time, during negotiations with Putin, the leader of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping, said that China -chose the right way of forming relations between countries, based on the principles of non-alignment, non-confrontation and non-targeting against third parties-. The head of the Indian government N. Modi emphasized that the Russian-Ukrainian war -must be resolved by peaceful means- and New Delhi supports -the earliest possible establishment of peace and stability.- One of the main tasks of the Russian Federation based on the results of the summit - the approval of an alternative system of international settlements - will also not be carried out. India, the UAE, Brazil and South Africa actually opposed the transformation of BRICS into an anti-American coalition. It is also telling that on the website of the summit, Russian organizers advise participants to take cash (dollars or euros) with them, as Visa and Mastercard cards issued outside of the Russian Federation do not work due to sanctions. In fact, the Kremlin demonstrated the failure of the Russian payment system -mir-. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that The President announced the key strategy of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/lidery-briks-vystupyly-proty-planiv-rf-iz-peretvorennya-obyednannya-na-antyamerykansku-koalicziyu/	2024-10-23T08:54:44-07:00
The Defense Forces told the story of -David- and his combat path as a self-propelled gun combatant	The defender's story was made public by the -East- Operational Command. However, his determination did not weaken: he decided to get a military education, and before choosing between a tank driver and an artilleryman, he chose artillery. After graduating from the military college, Serhii, with the rank of lieutenant, began serving in the mechanized brigade as a platoon commander and senior battery officer. His first serious test came during the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which he met in the Donetsk region. Serhiy celebrated his birthday on February 23, 2022, and the very next day the war began. Anxiety, panic, everyone is running around the location, this is exactly the picture Serhiy saw when he woke up in the morning, at first he even thought that this was another training, to which their commander was prone. But very soon everything became clear — it was a real invasion. During the war, Sergey gained invaluable combat experience and understood why he was here. The war showed him that his homeland is not just a territory, it is something much deeper. Although it was difficult at first, he adapted over time, both to training and to combat conditions. Serhiy especially emphasizes that all the knowledge he gained at the military college was of great help to him. One of the biggest problems for him remains Soviet cars, on which he has to work. He dreams of new, modernized equipment. For Serhiy, the most important thing before each combat mission is to adjust his personnel. He always explains to the fighters what the task is before them, what is expected of them, and how they can succeed. Morally prepared and confident soldiers are the key to successful mission performance. Having entered the 43rd separate mechanized brigade, Serhiy was initially worried, because a large part of his personnel at that time were rookies without combat experience. However, his fears were quickly dispelled - people turned out to be motivated and quickly learned everything necessary. Their progress impressed the commander, and they are already effectively carrying out the assigned combat tasks. Serhii always emphasizes the importance of quick execution of orders, because every minute can cost a life. As a commander, he is responsible for his subordinates, so he carefully monitors that they are not exposed to unnecessary risks. If he sees a threat to the crew, he immediately reports it to higher management. Despite the difficulties of the war, Serhiy tries to be as close as possible to his soldiers. He always supports them, makes jokes and helps to maintain their fighting spirit in difficult conditions. Serhiy remains devoted to his work, his people and his Motherland, convinced that joint efforts will lead to victory, and after the war, their friendship and brotherhood in combat will become a solid foundation for further life. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Armed Forces of Ukraine demonstrated a spectacular destruction of enemy anti-tankers in Donetsk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/syly-oborony-rozpovily-istoriyu-davida-ta-jogo-bojovyj-shlyah-na-posadi-kombata-sau/	2024-10-23T08:41:30-07:00

Now Dagestan specialists are going to Ukraine with their -priceless- experience. The worst situation with teachers is observed in the temporarily occupied territories of eastern Ukraine. The occupiers introduced a program of financial support for Russian teachers who are ready to move to Ukraine. They promise generous bonuses and benefits. The occupiers are actively bringing teachers from Russia to the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine not only because of the lack of personnel. This initiative aims to change the educational process by introducing Russian ideological narratives and censoring Ukrainian culture and history. As a result, children are exposed to systematic propaganda, which can significantly affect their worldview and identity.
