Operational actions of the SBU prevented these attacks. The fourth detainee worked for Russian military intelligence (game), transmitting data about the bridges used to transport the equipment of the Armed Forces to the Eastern Front.

The occupying power is faceless: the Kremlin closes access to data on officials -LNR-	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, head of the Luhansk OVA. In addition, restrictions on access to information about the socio-economic status of the occupied territories, where a catastrophic budget deficit is observed, have already been introduced. The propaganda about the economic development of these regions, which the Russians had been spreading for decades, began to lose its effect when people saw the real numbers. It is these data that are planned to be classified. Access to the personal data of officials and security forces will also be restricted due to the fact that many Russians refuse to go to leadership positions in the -LNR- due to the high death rate among the occupation authorities. From November 21, residents of the -LNR- will be deprived of Russian citizenship if they do not take the oath. The law, which will take effect next month, invalidates all previous citizenship decisions. Those who do not swear an oath to the aggressor country by the specified deadline will be considered as never having Russian citizenship.

Deadly Hypervelocity Shield: The US military is developing a program to counter hypersonic weapons	As highlighted in a release posted on Northrop Grumman's official portal, this innovative defense system should be the first of its kind, specially designed to neutralize hypersonic threats, which are becoming more and more influential in modern conflicts, ArmyInform reports. The American firm noted that, in close cooperation with MDA, the three-year development phase of this project led by Northrop Grumman led to the creation of an individual solution aimed at countering current and new capabilities of hypersonic missiles. GPI represents a significant technological leap in missile defense with significant potential to play a key role in future conflict scenarios. Experts of the defense site Army Recognition learned some details and said that as the program moves into the next phase of development, Northrop Grumman will focus on several critical aspects. First, the company will continue to refine the previous GPI design to enable it to be deployed against ballistic missiles on US Navy destroyers, as well as the land-based Aegis Ashore system, using a standard vertical launch system. Next, Northrop Grumman will focus on demonstrating the interceptor's performance in hypersonic environments before moving on to a preliminary design analysis. In addition, the company plans to conduct early flight tests of interceptor missiles, relying on its proven test technologies. Finally, the use of advanced digital engineering techniques will streamline the design process and accelerate the development of interceptor capabilities. Wendy Williams, vice president and general manager of Northrop Grumman's launch and missile defense division, emphasized the strategic importance of the GPI program. -GPI provides warfighters with critical engagement capabilities in situations where distance provides a tactical advantage. Our solution adapts well to meet a variety of operational needs and is designed to succeed in an ever-changing threat environment,- said Williams. The GPI design includes advanced technologies such as scanning equipment for accurate threat tracking and the ability to use hit-to-kill technology (technology to intercept and destroy enemy missiles with kinetic weapons). Experts said that in the competition for the contract to develop the anti-hypersonic weapons program with Northrop, it won over such a serious competitor as the corporation RTX. The two firms were awarded a preliminary contract to develop the GPI in June 2022 after eliminating another competitor, Lockheed Martin. In addition to fulfilling its obligations to MDA, Northrop Grumman will work closely with the Japanese Ministry of Defense as part of a joint GPI development program. This partnership aims to provide interceptors that will enhance the defense capabilities of both countries against hypersonic threats. Northrop Grumman provides comprehensive solutions to defeat enemy missiles.

A philosopher with a weapon in his hands: a locksmith - Plato - told about the battles in the Pokrov...	-Plato- comes from Kyiv and is a philosopher by education. According to the man, this science helps him in the army, as the result of thinking becomes broader, thanks to this, it is possible to take into account a large number of factors that are happening now, and it helps to make quick decisions. — In the discussion, the truth is born, or something like that, and therefore there are many points of view and there are other points where they all coincide. And it is during communication and dialogue that these points are found, and this communication is called philosophizing, Plato said. He entered the army in 2023, when a summons came to his home. While still studying at the university, he graduated from the military department, so he was a reserve officer. — I have many acquaintances who have participated in ATO since 2014. They say, if the summons comes, we know you're ready, if we can, we'll serve together. And I listened to their advice and it so happened that a summons came, and I went to the Military Commissariat without hesitation, - said Platon. However, he did not manage to get into the service of his comrades. At the same time, the man did not think long about his future call sign. After all, it is worth reminding that Plato is a philosopher by education, so he chose his nickname in honor of the ancient Greek thinker of the same name. In the TCC, Platon was informed that the 401st separate rifle battalion was being formed, in which he later became a platoon commander. For several months, combat training of recruits took place near Kyiv, where there were classes in tactical medicine, fire and tactical training. — In principle, the preparation was good, and thanks to it, we were able to hold out quite well for a while, but the advantage of the enemy's strength sometimes does not give us a chance, unfortunately, said Platon. At the same time, the military man said that in the army, in addition to direct combat operations and work -at zero-, there is quite a lot of work with documents, which requires a lot of time. Plato believes that in the current situation, quality training of soldiers should be a priority, because they have to learn something new literally every day. — Because there is no pattern that can be followed in every situation. Because the situation changes every day, maybe every hour, every half hour. Factors can always be different. They may coincide, but the situation is different. There is nothing here that we did here a week ago and we will do it now. Not a fact that it will work. And war changes very quickly, he said. Already at the beginning of June, Platon went to the Bakhmut direction, namely to the Andriivka village area. They took part in battles together with other units. According to his recollections, enemy artillery, mortars and tanks were mostly working there. — Shooting battles, of course, also took place, but mostly it was a defeat at a distance. And it was felt that the enemy had more iron than we did. When I was in the position, I tell everyone, I had nightmares about -Cornflower- for four days. It's just dawning, a drone flies in, hovers, flies away. And we hear it there, pooh-pooh-pooh-pooh-pooh-pooh-pooh-pooh. And we know that they have crept up to us, said Plato. At that time, the shelling was so constant that they did not even raise their heads from the trench, and when there was a minimal lull, they immediately took up the shovel and dug in. Plato clarified that it doesn't matter what rank and position you have on the front line - everyone works. The man took part in defensive operations in the Andriivka region, and was also engaged in setting up positions. Bakhmut's direction in a warrior is associated with both fear and joy that all his boys survived. Later, the battalion was transferred to another area, namely to the Terny village near Liman. Plato remembered the battles in this direction with bitterness, because there the enemy behaved quite unpredictably. — They counted on one development of the situation, so I said that there is no pattern. And the situation is developing differently. You need to react quickly to it. Sometimes they made it, sometimes, unfortunately, they didn't make it, the man said. Near Terny, the battles were fought almost non-stop, the enemy tried to go to the side, and in some places even to the rear due to landings. However, the occupiers managed to be stopped and even pushed back to their former positions in some places. A month later, the soldiers were already transferred to another part of the front, because they were able to fulfill their task near Terny. At the moment, Platon, already in the role of deputy company commander, and his fighters are in the Pokrovsky direction. Platon calls the extensive use of FPV drones a feature of the battles on this part of the front. Previously, they tried to hit heavy equipment, but now they are used to hit manpower. And it does not matter whether it is a group of soldiers or a single serviceman. Therefore, the fighters continue to train new recruits, give them experience. One of the stages of training is working with drones, and not only controlling them, but also being able to distinguish Mavic and FPV by sound. — The problem here is that remote warfare is taking place, but not only with the help of artillery, but also with such means of defeat as drop and FPV. Now, in principle, the line of responsibility of our brigade has more or less stabilized, and the enemy has gone the other way, but this was achieved with a very great effort at the moment when we were somewhat led here. We are talking about Novooleksandrivka and Vozdvizhenka, because then the Russians had their main attack in that direction, towards the highway, - said Platon. Platon recalled how a column of invaders advanced to the area of ​​the village of Vozdvizhenka, but the brigade artillery worked well against them. The Russians were hit with tanks, 152 caliber artillery and D-30 howitzers. Most of the invaders became -good fertilizer- after that. According to the military, proper communication with neighboring units also contributes to successful defense. Thanks to her, the soldiers of the battalion managed to effectively restrain the enemy's offensive. Platon, in the role of deputy company commander, is engaged in building an effective management system, and also tries to maintain a positive atmosphere in his team. At the moment, his battalion has fully entered the structure of the 110th separate mechanized brigade. - First of all, there should be a correct division of functions so that a person is not given tasks that he cannot perform for some reason. This is the key point. Secondly, there are mistakes that it seems that a person knows something, I put him in a workplace, and then I see that he is not suitable for this work. It is necessary to change the task for her, Plato said. There is quite a lot of work in his mouth, so Plato does not manage to get a full night's sleep, but sometimes he finds a free hour in the middle of the day to, as he says, -lie down with his eyes closed.- After our victory, Platon wants to meet his friends and have a nice rest, and also get a cat.

From head to toe: the Russian Federation disperses a fake about the conversation of Oleksandr Syrsky...	In the conversation that actually took place, the commanders discussed the current situation at the front and the organization of Ukraine's defense in certain areas. As well as the possibility of hitting military facilities deep into Russian territory. According to Syrskyi, the British side is working on its own proposals as part of the practical implementation of the Victory Plan, which indeed contains a clause about long-range strikes on the territory of the Russian Federation. In particular, Ukraine wants its partners to lift restrictions on the use of long-range Western weapons. However, Russian propaganda has turned everything upside down by spreading fake news that Great Britain is participating in military operations against the Russian Federation. Such -throwbacks- have become more frequent recently. The Russians constantly try to accuse Ukraine of involving servicemen from NATO countries in hostilities, and they try to discredit foreign partners in the eyes of Ukrainian society by saying that they do not want to accept our country into the Alliance. Literally last week, there was a fake rumor circulating in the news space that there were seven NATO countries against the invitation of Ukraine to the Alliance. The main task of the enemy is to demoralize Ukrainians and make them quarrel with international partners. Only in this way will they have at least some chance to impose their conditions for the end of the war.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/30/z-nig-na-golovu-rf-rozgonyaye-fejk-pro-rozmovu-oleksandra-syrskogo/	2024-10-29T21:21:16-07:00
The enemy has not created offensive groups in the South, there are no significant advances	This was announced by the spokesman of the Southern Defense Forces on the air of the telethon Edyny News Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn of Ukraine. -Currently, the enemy has not created offensive groups, according to our intelligence, but in several areas he is creating additional assault groups to conduct assault operations with small infantry forces,- the spokesman said. Vladyslav Voloshyn emphasized that in each of the directions in the South, the enemy distributes its forces according to where it is increasing its efforts, as well as where it maintains defenses. -The enemy has no significant advances. A few days ago, due to constant assault actions, the enemy wedged in a short distance, to the depth of a platoon support point near the village of Levadne. Now the Southern Defense Forces are conducting a stabilization operation to level the situation,- said Vladyslav Voloshyn. According to him, the enemy continues air strikes, uses UAVs, there are missile strikes every day, and a counter-battery fight is underway. The spokesman also noted that the vast majority of islands in the Kherson region are under fire control of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russians began to use FPV drones with a fiber optic cable, soldiers of the 128th separate mountain assault brigade of the Transcarpathia encountered them for the first time.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/vorog-ne-stvoryv-nastupalnyh-ugrupuvan-na-pivdni-znachyh-prosuvan-nemaye/	2024-10-29T12:57:24-07:00
The Defense Forces reported the appearance of unusual enemy drones in the Zaporizhzhia direction	An officer of the press service of the 128th separate mountain-assault division told about this on Army TV Major Yaroslav Halas of the Transcarpathian Brigade. -For the first time, our team encountered the fact that the Russians used FPV drones with a fiber optic cable 10 km long in the Zaporizhzhya region. In practice, we encountered them for the first time,- said Yaroslav Halas. According to him, the use of such a drone was conditionally successful for the enemy, he managed to damage the shelter. But our fighters did not leave their positions. -These drones are completely invulnerable to EW devices, as soon as our guys saw them, they tried to shoot them down with small arms. Anti-aircraft guns are effective against them. A big disadvantage of these drones is the limited range of use. Also, they are ineffective for dense urban development or dense plantings,- the spokesman said. He also said that today the enemy aviation was active with anti-aircraft missiles, unguided air missiles. There were no assaults on our positions, although they occur regularly. The defense is being probed, the Russians are looking for our weak points. -We know from intelligence reports that the enemy is gathering forces and the Russians may try to break through our defenses, but there are no prerequisites to believe that these attempts will be successful,- Yaroslav Halas added.

OTU -Luhansk-: the occupiers did not gain a foothold behind the canal in Chasovoy Yar	This was reported on Army TV by the spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU Major Anastasia Bobovnikova. -I want to refute the information coming from unofficial sources that the enemy has gained a foothold behind the canal. The enemy is trying to storm our positions in this direction. However, usually these are 2-3 fighters who cross the canal and hide,- said Anastasia Bobovnikova. She emphasized that the Russians cannot gain a foothold behind the canal there, they are quickly destroyed, and logistical routes are cut off. -The channel is under the cover of our drones and our artillery, so the enemy cannot storm it with equipment, as for this it is necessary to set up crossings, which is impossible,- explained the spokeswoman of the Luhansk OTU. Anastasia Bobovnikova also reported that the number of assaults has slightly decreased in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Luhansk- OTU, but the number of shelling from artillery and aviation has not decreased, even increased. -They understand that they cannot storm head-on in this direction, so they are trying to completely wipe out the surrounding cities. The aviation of the Russian Federation carries out 15 to 20 strikes every day, dropping at least 20 anti-aircraft missiles,- the spokeswoman added.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/otu-lugansk-okupanty-ne-zakripylysya-za-kanalom-u-chasovomu-yaru/	2024-10-29T12:09:13-07:00

NATO and EU leaders discussed the situation in Ukraine and the appearance of North Korean troops in ...	The General Staff of the Armed Forces informs about this. Their discussion focused on the importance of a close strategic partnership between NATO and the European Union. Both agreed that in an increasingly dangerous world, this partnership is vital to the protection and defense of peace, freedom and prosperity. Russia's war of aggression on European soil is the biggest threat to peace and security on the European continent. The Secretary General of NATO and the President of the European Commission emphasized that the deployment of North Korean soldiers in support of Russia's aggressive war represents a significant escalation of the war against Ukraine, as well as a serious threat to European security and global peace. They also discussed the growing assertiveness of authoritarian states on the world stage. These states challenge our common interests, values ​​and democratic principles using various means – political, economic, technological and military.

Photos of the destruction of the historical monument as a result of the Russian airstrike were published by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, head of Kharkiv OVA Oleg Synegubov, Head Office of DSNS of Ukraine in Kharkiv region, DSNS of Ukraine, Headquarters of the National Police of Ukraine in the Kharkiv region , National Police of Ukraine, MVS of Ukraine. -The Russian airstrike caused serious damage to the building of Derzhprom in Kharkiv, one of the most famous constructivist buildings in the world, which is under the temporary enhanced protection of UNESCO-, noted President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A video of the consequences of the Russian airstrike in the center of Kharkiv was made public by the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office. Also the consequences of the Russian shelling of the city recorded on video at the Main Directorate of the National Police of Ukraine in the Kharkiv region. About the consequences of the air strike said the head of Kharkiv OVA Oleg Sinegubov: -There were several launches of guided air bombs, several actions, at least three were hit in Kharkiv. One famous place is the city center, the administration building. Again hundreds of windows, residential buildings, again quite seriously damaged premises of the regional hospital. Currently, six people are known to have received relevant injuries as a result of this strike. Previously, it was a guided aerial bomb. Several floors were destroyed, a direct hit to the building itself. There are different categories: from the policeman who was on duty, from people passing by, because it's the center of the city around 21 [hours]. Again, it's a miracle more people weren't hurt, because this place is usually pretty crowded!- -Preliminarily, for the shelling, the enemy used a high-explosive aerial bomb with a unified planning and correction module, the specific size of which is currently being established - it is 250 or 500 kg-, - said the spokesman of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office Dmytro Chubenko. The Main Directorate of the National Police of Ukraine in the Kharkiv region reported that the enemy dropped three anti-aircraft missiles on the city of Kharkiv and the Kharkiv region yesterday evening. -One of the bombs hit one of the entrances to the administration building, where the court and other institutions are located. KAB flew directly to the office of one of the judges. This is an absolutely civilian object,- noted Volodymyr Tymoshko, head of the National Security Service in the Kharkiv region. -Partially destroyed premises of the 2nd and 3rd floors. Residential buildings, a hospital and educational institutions nearby were also damaged,- reported in the Main Department of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in the Kharkiv region. Currently, according to rescuers, there are 8 casualties as a result of the enemy attack. According to the message of the head of Kharkiv OVA Oleg Siegubov, it is known about 6 victims - they are in light and medium conditions . There are no difficult ones. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that occupiers hit the center of Kharkiv, there are wounded .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/zalizobetonnyj-derzhprom-vystoyav-u-harkovi-rosijski-zagarbnyky-namagalys-znyshhyty-symvol-mista/	2024-10-28T23:09:21-07:00

More than 130 enemy assaults per day: Russia is concentrating its efforts in two directions	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In addition, the occupiers are actively attacking in the Kupyan, Lyman and Vremiv directions. The terrorist state carried out 70 airstrikes, dropping 119 anti-aircraft missiles. The invaders also used 685 kamikaze drones for strikes and fired about 3,800 shots at the positions of our troops and populated areas. In the Kharkiv direction, Russian terrorists stormed the positions of our units in the Vovchansk region four times. Thirteen times the enemy attacked our positions on the Kupyansk direction. Near the settlements of Kolisnikivka, Sinkivka, Kruglyakivka, Pershotravnevo and Lozova, units of the Defense Forces repelled all enemy attacks. In the Lyman direction Russian troops attacked Ukrainian defenders 15 times in Grekivka, Zarichny, Terni and Torsky districts. In the Kramatorsk direction Ukrainian soldiers repelled two attempts by the invaders to advance in the Chasovoy Yar and Stupochky areas. In the Toretsk direction our troops repelled one enemy attack. In the Pokrovsky direction the aggressor attacked our positions 31 times. In the districts of Myrolyubivka, Promeny, Lysivka, Krutoy Yar, Selydovoy and Vyshnevoy, our defenders repelled all the assaults of the occupation forces. According to the available information, the losses of the occupiers in the direction are 151 people killed and wounded, two mortars, an armored fighting vehicle, a tank , a UAV control post and a car, a tank, three mortars and an armored combat vehicle were also damaged. The hottest in the Kurakhiv direction, where the invaders made 48 attempts to advance at this time of the day . The main battles are taking place near Zoryanyi, Maksimilianivka, Novodmytrivka, Katerynivka, and Antonivka. In the Vremivsk direction, the aggressor, with the support of aviation, stormed the front edge of our defense 12 times in the area of ​​Bogoyavlenka and Novoukrainka. In the Dnieper direction the enemy made two unsuccessful attempts to storm the positions of Ukrainian units. The Defense Forces of Ukraine continue the operation in the Kursk direction. Enemy aviation today carried out 28 airstrikes on Kurshchyna with the use of 39 anti-aircraft missiles. The department honored the soldiers of the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade named after Kostya Gordienko, the 38th separate marine brigade and the 425th separate assault battalion. As reported by ArmyInform, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces General Oleksandr Syrsky visited military units and units participating in the defense operation in the Zaporizhzhia region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/ponad-130-vorozhyh-shturmiv-za-dobu-rosiya-zoseredzhuye-zusyllya-na-dvoh-napryamkah/	2024-10-28T22:16:18-07:00
Microwave frying drones: the latest solution for the electronic fight against swarms of UAVs was pre...	In the official release of the developer of this high-tech equipment, the Californian company Epirus stated that the ExDECS system was designed with the Marine Corps' requirements in mind to combat the rapidly growing UAV threat . In particular, the designers of the device took into account the experience of using drones during the Russian-Ukrainian war, ArmiyaInform reports. ExDECS is the latest version of the Leonidas weapon system created by Epirus, which ArmiyaInform told in one of his previous publications. Epirus has released details of a profile contract in which it is partnering with the Office of Naval Research, the Joint Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Countermeasures Division and the US Marine Corps Warfare Laboratory to support expeditionary forward base operations and counter-unmanned systems missions for a total of 5 .5 million dollars. The program will include initial integration with the US Marine Corps' Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S), as well as field experiments and multi-platform testing in expeditionary scenarios to improve USMC (US Marine Corps) land-based air defense capabilities. Epirus has developed ExDECS, a solid-state, software-defined, long-pulse HPM system to support the US Marine Corps Expeditionary Force (EABO) and counter-unmanned systems missions. The system is designed to be compact and easy to maneuver. This makes ExDECS suitable for any expeditionary force mission. -As drone warfare dominates the daily headlines, we are proud to bring ExDECS to life and work with the Marine Corps to develop expeditionary HPM capabilities,- said Andy Lowery, Chief Executive Officer of Epirus. -We are committed to accelerating the delivery of operational HPM capabilities for cUAS across the joint force.- Leonidas Expeditionary, or ExDECS, is the latest addition to the Leonidas HPM product suite and uses Epirus' revolutionary approach to HPM, which significantly reduces system size and weight and provides greater operator control. The modular and scalable system is designed to be installed on a Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) trailer and complements the low-altitude air defense system during expeditionary operations. Authors of the popular magazine Forbes talked with the creators of the latest radio electronic weapons. As the head of the manufacturing company reported, previously the best solution against drones was considered to be radio electronic warfare (EW), but now radio electronic suppression is at best partially effective. According to him, many soldiers in Ukraine carry shotguns to protect themselves from FPV drones, but even the best shooters will have a hard time defending themselves against the simultaneous attack of more than fifty UAVs. The ExDECS system was created just for such cases. ExDECS is reportedly able to destroy both individual drones and large swarms of drones. These weapons have some similarities to laser devices, however, the laser focuses its energy on a small point, while the microwave weapon can emit a wide field of energy that disables all electronics inside the drones. The manufacturer calls economic efficiency the main advantage of ExDECS. One shot costs just five US cents (about UAH 2). As noted in the publication, the previous model of the Epirus energy weapon was -tiny- compared to a similar device of competitors. Thanks to compact solid-state electronics, the ExDECS system has been made even smaller. This is important because Marines need a lightweight rig that can be towed behind standard vehicles for maximum mobility. -The solid-state, software-controlled, long-pulse high-power microwave setup we're doing at Epirus has demonstrated effectiveness against a spectrum of electronic threats, including targets beyond drones. In theory, anything that has an electron pulse would be vulnerable to the Epirus HPM,- states Andy Lowery. As part of the contract, Epirus will deliver a ready-made ExDECS HPM system to the Marine Corps Combat Operations Laboratory by the end of 2024. Microwave weapon of Leonidas.

Consequences of the attack on Kyiv: depressurization of a gas pipe and victims	notifies the head of the KMVA Serhii Popko. The air alert was announced twice during the night in Kyiv and lasted more than 4 hours in total. Drones attacked the capital from different directions, but the air defense forces detected and neutralized the enemy drones in time. As a result of falling debris, damage was recorded in the Solomyanskyi and Sviatoshynskyi districts. In the Solomyansk district, a gas pipe depressurized near a 9-story residential building, which led to the occupation of a store and three parked cars. The fire was extinguished. Five people were injured, one of them was hospitalized with a serious leg injury. In Sviatoshyn district, debris broke windows in a three-story administrative building, but there were no casualties.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/naslidky-ataky-po-kyyevu-rozgermetyzacziya-gazovoyi-truby-ta-postrazhdali/	2024-10-28T22:02:10-07:00
Hunting for mopeds: what foreign weapons are used to destroy the enemy - Shaheds -	-the Russians managed to increase the so-called Shahed assembly production.- Because the enemy, apart from the hull itself, cannot produce anything, not even engines. The rest of the parts are bought on world markets. Indeed, cold weather and winter are ahead. the Rashists are driven by their maniacal philosophy and really believe that our power system should be destroyed. Their targets are not only critical infrastructure facilities of TPPs and HPPs. Moreover, in my opinion, the Rashists want to destroy the distribution devices of nuclear power plants and transmission substations, which are critical for the safe operation of nuclear energy in Ukraine. Ukrainian air defense systems demonstrate simply impressive performance indicators in shooting down Russian Kh-101, Kh-555, Kalibr and other missiles. The churn rate varies up to about 95 percent. Therefore, the enemy resorted to the mass use of Shaheds and wants to exhaust our air defense system. Although, in my opinion, this is not quite the correct assessment on their part. Now -Shakhed-, first of all, are shot down not by anti-aircraft missiles of various classes, but by appropriate weapons, for example, barrel artillery. Australian Slinger anti-drone combat modules are effective means of defeating enemy Shaheds. The complex is based on the 30-mm M230LF cannon and the 7.62-mm MAG58 machine gun and is installed on a regular pickup truck. The system is equipped with thermal imaging and night sights. The range of detection of aerial targets by the optical-electronic system is 12 km using the day channel, and 13.7 km using the night channel. Another effective answer to the question of how to cheaply shoot down the Russian Shaheds. Our defenders are armed with the British short-range MSI-DS Terrahawk Paladin system. Consists of a remote-controlled Mk44 Busmaster II 30mm gun, equipped with a dual-feed system that allows the use of two different types of ammunition, including programmed detonation. The Terrahawk is capable of destroying targets at a range of up to 2 km. The complex's radar allows for 360-degree surveillance of targets. Recently, the enemy began to use cheap decoy drones during attacks on Ukraine. These drones fly without a warhead. This is done in order to identify the positions of the Ukrainian air defense and, once again, exhaust our air defense assets. the Russians for some reason believe that we will spend expensive anti-aircraft missiles on them, such as the Patriot air defense missile, costing up to 3 million dollars. The Defense Forces of Ukraine have learned how to shoot down Shaheds even from helicopters. Conventional Kalashnikov machine guns, other large-caliber machine guns of foreign models and small arms are used. Means of radar and visual calculation of aerial enemy objects appeared. And most importantly, they learned, in combat work, so to speak, to set the aiming point correctly. Plus, let's not forget about the Stinger portable anti-aircraft missile complex. The Americans resumed their production. There are cases when 50 out of 50 -Shaheeds- are lost. That is, the destruction rate is 90-98%. Consequently, their effectiveness turned out to be shockingly low. But what does the adversary think? Even if one missile of a certain class hit the target or even if one -Shaheed- reached its goal, then, according to the Rashists, the terror must continue. In my opinion, this (Russian air attacks on critical infrastructure facilities and residential buildings of Ukraine - ed.) will be permanent. The production of air weapons will not stop, and Russia's big missile-drone attack on us is only a matter of time.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/polyuvannya-na-mopedy-yakoyu-inozemnoyu-zbroyeyu-znyshhuyut-vorozhi-shahedy/	2024-10-28T21:57:18-07:00
A million people, Soviet equipment and nuclear weapons: what makes up the North Korean army	Meanwhile, Russia has ratified a de facto military alliance with North Korea. In this regard, it becomes quite logical to ask the question: how many troops and what kind of weapons does the North Korean Juche regime have? The Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of the DPRK and Chairman of the Central Military Commission is President Kim Jong Un, who heads the five branches of the Korean People's Army (KPA): Ground Forces, Navy, Air Force and Air Defense Forces, Strategic Missile Forces, and Special Operations Forces . Despite the fact that North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world, its military spending is slightly less than a quarter of its GDP, which ranks first in the world in terms of military spending. In 2019, it was estimated at about $3.6 billion per year. The Korean People's Army is the world's fourth largest conventional force, with about 5% of the population serving. This is about 1.3 million military personnel and another 600,000 reserve soldiers. KPA ground forces are deployed in three echelons: — Forward operational echelon: 4 infantry corps. — Second operational echelon: 2 mechanized corps, 1 armored corps, 1 artillery corps. — Strategic reserve: 2 mechanized corps, 1 artillery corps. As the DPRK's military policy prioritizes military spending over economic development, this has increased the KNA's role in everyday life, including greater involvement in social and economic decision-making. Servicemen spend most of their military service participating in various spheres of the country's socio-economic life. Men must serve in the army for 10 years and women for 8 years. Despite the fact that the main parts of the army are infantry, it has about 4,000 armored personnel carriers. The army has a significant number of well-equipped mechanized units. These mobile forces have armored personnel carriers of Soviet, Chinese and domestic production. North Korea has about 3,500 medium and light tanks, including about 2,000 T-54/55 main battle tanks and about 175 Chinese Type 59 tanks (an upgraded version of the T-54). Since the late 1970s, North Korea has produced approximately 600 T-62 tanks, the main battle tank of the Soviet Army in the 1960s. North Korea has also supplied light tanks, including the locally produced M-1985, the Soviet R-76, and Chinese variants of the Type 62 and 63. North Korea continues to rely on a large number of artillery systems to support ground operations. The North Korean Air Force's potential vulnerability contributes to its reliance on field artillery as its primary means of warfare. Thus, Pyongyang has deployed about 8,400 artillery pieces and more than 2,000 rocket launchers. North Korea has at least 3,000 towed and 5,400 self-propelled guns and howitzers. A photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency on March 7, 2017 shows the launch of four ballistic missiles by the Korean People's Army during a military exercise at an undisclosed location in North Korea. North Korea says its nuclear arsenal and ballistic missiles are necessary to counter threats from on the part of the United States and its allies who fought against North Korea during the Korean War of 1950-1953. Pyongyang also often touts the weapon as an item of national prestige and a proof of the country's power. According to the American Arms Control Association, North Korea has the ability to deliver nuclear weapons using a variety of land-based missile systems, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with a range capable of hitting the continental United States. But critics, including in Washington and Seoul, say the weapons destabilize the situation, pose a threat to North Korea's neighbors and divert resources from the country's poor citizens. State media have shown photos of various types of warheads, but North Korea has never disclosed the number of weapons it possesses, and analysts and foreign intelligence agencies have only rough estimates. A July report by the Federation of American Scientists concluded that the country may have produced enough fissile material to build up to 90 nuclear warheads, but that about 50 are likely to have been assembled. Lee Sang-kyu, a nuclear engineering expert at South Korea's Korea Institute for Defense Analysis, said , that North Korea is estimated to have 80-90 nuclear warheads made of uranium and plutonium, and that number is expected to increase to 166 by 2030. North Korea has facilities scattered throughout the country that support its nuclear program, including mines where raw uranium is collected, enrichment facilities and nuclear reactors to convert uranium and plutonium into bomb fuel, as well as weapons assembly plants. The North Korean Air Force is the second-largest branch of the Korean People's Army, with more than 100,000 servicemen. In 2022, the name was changed to the Korean People's Army Air and Anti-Aircraft Forces (KPAAF). Historically, the North Korean Air Force had a fairly large fleet of various equipment. With the support of China and the Soviet Union, the KPAAF was one of the first to introduce jet aircraft into its combat fleet. North Korea also sent forces overseas during the Vietnam War. After the end of the Cold War, the KPAAF was left with aircraft and combat equipment that were decades old. With ongoing sanctions over the past decades, North Korea has been unable to purchase newer aircraft. In addition, the sanctions affected the existing supply of aircraft, including spare parts, maintenance and even aviation fuel. Several different reports indicating the current state of affairs in the KPAAF indicate that it has an active fleet of between 500 and 900 combat aircraft. They still operate the outdated MiG-17, MiG-19, MiG-21 and MiG-23 fighters, but use the more modern and quite powerful MiG-29 fighters. Analysts have also long speculated whether Korea is fielding the MiG-25, but there is no evidence yet as to whether they are fielding the MiG-25. The KPAF's most numerous fighter is the MiG-21, which is effectively obsolete. North Korea's special operations forces, one of the largest in the world, are organized into 22 brigades and 7 separate battalions. These forces have five main tasks: conducting reconnaissance, conducting combat operations alongside conventional operations, creating a second front behind the enemy's rear, countering the South's special operations in the rear areas of North Korea, and maintaining internal security. The Ministry of People's Armed Forces has two main commands that oversee special operations units, the Intelligence Bureau and the Light Infantry Training Bureau. North Korea classifies its special operations units as reconnaissance, light infantry and snipers. Command-sized units conduct reconnaissance to gather intelligence or information about targets. Light infantry operations are combat operations conducted by units up to the size of a company or battalion against military, political, or economic objectives. Sniper operations are basically the same as light infantry, except that they are carried out in groups. The North Korean Air Force supports special operations missions through aerial infiltration and resupply operations. The North Korean Navy provides amphibious operations and resupply. The main ship for amphibious operations is the landing craft NAMPO. Small submarines and semi-submersible landing craft also support most missions. North Korea's special operations forces conduct operations at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Basically, strategic operations support national or departmental objectives, operational operations support corps objectives, and tactical operations support division and brigade maneuvers. North Korea's 60,000-strong navy is primarily a coastal defense force. Most of the naval vessels are small patrol vessels that cannot operate more than 50 nautical miles from the coast, but are capable of guarding North Korea's territorial waters. North Korea's naval forces are geographically divided into East and West Coast fleets, which do not exchange ships. The country has neither aircraft carriers nor destroyers. The Navy's most powerful force is 39 patrol boats with guided missiles. The Navy also has 12 Soviet SOJU-class patrol boats. Other ships, such as the Soviet guided missile patrol boat KOMAR and its North Korean derivative SOHUNG, are smaller in size. North Korea's attack submarine inventory includes 4 Soviet WHISKEY-class submarines, 4 Chinese ROMEO-class submarines, and 16 North Korean ROMEO-class submarines. Therefore, the full involvement of North Korea in the war as one of the main suppliers for Russia may not have a decisive impact, but it still remains dangerous and provides an additional resource for the Russian army. Although the indiscriminate and imprecise weapons typically relied upon by less technically advanced armies are not highly accurate, they are still destructive and dangerous.

Assault of the Russians, a drone with a thermobar and combat cats: a day at the position of the 79th...	The paratroopers have been holding back the enemy's advance in the East for more than two years and preventing the Russians from advancing in the Kurakhiv direction. We fly into the broken village and quickly pass several turns. You can't linger — the enemy is just a few kilometers away in a nearby settlement. There is constant shelling and circling enemy drones. Currently, only our soldiers and their war cats remain in this village. Correspondents of ArmiyaInform spent the day with the Taurian paratroopers and saw with their own eyes how they repelled the Russian assault. Three cats — the first ones you meet at the entrance to the dark basement. Under the wall are their food bowls and the weapons of our fighters. There are nine cats in total. — They reach out to people, nobody lives around here anymore, — say the guys. In the basement there is a control and observation point (KSP) of a company of one of the battalions. Here, near the huge monitor, there is round-the-clock duty, the situation around our positions is monitored from the stream in online mode, and the battle is managed in cooperation with other units in the event of enemy assaults. — U enemy tactics are not uniform. For example, one or two armored groups enter from one direction, and from the other — -motorcycle troops- on motorcycles, buggies, -loaves-, — explains paratrooper -Doc-, who is watching the situation on the monitor. This is a common suicidal tactic of the Russians, because even if these -motorcyclists- reach our positions, they are immediately destroyed. -Dok- is from Volnovakha, has considerable combat experience, and served in the 79th brigade even before the beginning of the large-scale invasion. He says that after the loss of Ugledar, the situation in their direction became more complicated. — They are trying to trap us, — he summarizes briefly. — The funniest thing has started recently, — a platoon leader with the call sign -Vinny- joins the conversation. He comes from the Lviv region and has been in the brigade for over a year. He wanted to join the Armed Forces when he was not yet 25 years old, which is why he was rejected by the TCC: — But I pushed them, — he recalls with a smile. The enemy tries to attack at different times of the day, regardless of the weather, and often even without the support of their own drones. — They probe us as much as we probe them. They can leave three units of equipment for each of our battalions, carry out combat reconnaissance, check where there are mine barriers, how the ATGM works. And they retreat, and after two or three days they chase a large column, — explains the officer. -Vinny- recalls the battles in Novomykhailivka, where our the paratroopers were opposed by the 155th brigade of the Russian marines, which during the large-scale invasion rozstrilyanyh-pobratymiv/->committed numerous war crimes: — They then had the task of storming the center of Novomykhailivka. Then they went on rotation. If compared to them, children are now fighting against us. Literally immediately after these words, the duty officer notices the movement of enemy vehicles on the monitor: -They are coming!- On the stream we see three units of armored vehicles, which rush through the open area along the landing. The enemy is covered by smoke screens to make it harder for UAV operators to track them. In a few minutes, three more -boxes- appear. All units are included in the work — drones track targets, commanders adjust and transmit instructions to artillery, report the situation to the soldiers in the front positions. We hear the -outputs- of our guns, again and again. In a few seconds, on the screen we see a hit on an infantry fighting vehicle, before that another enemy -beha- is blown up by a mine. One still manages to break through close to our positions and land the infantry. Almost immediately after that, the BMP is destroyed, in about half an hour it was possible to find the mech driver — he is seriously wounded and is trying to hide in the ruins. Our drones end his suffering with a well-timed reset. -The bastards are hiding in the house, let's hit them with a thermal bar-, — we hear the drone operators talking, who are preparing to defeat the enemy. Two more Russians reach the position of our paratroopers in a row, -Dok- immediately reports this to the -point-: several automatic rounds — and 3-4 grenades destroy the invaders. Further, the sweep takes place, and the enemy assault is repulsed, the paratroopers held their positions. In total, up to 15 occupiers were eliminated and several units of armored vehicles were knocked out. At KSP, everyone exhales from the tension, smokes a cigarette and talks about the 18-year-old Javelin operator, who during several assaults destroyed a dozen and a half units of equipment. In one of the battles, he managed to destroy three tanks. Today, he also has damaged equipment. Doc recalls that at the beginning of the large-scale invasion, there was a constant flow of volunteers to the brigade. — Motivating people now requires a comprehensive approach. Both rotations and recovery time, increased payouts for attack aircraft are at zero. And certain social guarantees for soldiers already after the end of their service, so that they have some certainty in their future, — he ponders. -Vinny- tells , who has already twice completed officer courses — for platoon commander and company commander. — We can guarantee a quick growth spurt. There are opportunities for sergeants — three-month officer courses, — says a serviceman. Guys immediately favorably respond to the recent span>decision to allow military units to mobilize people directly, bypassing TCC and SP. They only regret that this did not happen earlier. — Although in reality not all TCCs are as bad as they are reported to be. I would also like to have longer recovery times. People have been in positions for one and a half to two years. They get tired, they burn out, but they have to keep working because there's just no one to replace them, — emphasizes -Vinny.- The officer explains the simple math: the more personnel arrive, the more there is a reserve, so people have the opportunity to rest more between combat missions. — For example, there are 10 people in positions, 10 are resting and another 10 are in reserve. Then I can guarantee vacations for everyone, people are interchangeable, — adds the platoon commander. We are talking separately about the training of new recruits in training centers. Recently, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces General Oleksandr Syrskyi stated the need to increase the period of basic military training and improve training programs. Paratroopers emphasize the need to review and update the training plans for the mobilized in order to they met the requirements of modern warfare as much as possible. After all, combat brigades simply do not have time to train or retrain new arrivals. At the same time, everyone notes positive changes in the training of the sergeant corps. In this unit, sergeants are mainly paratroopers with extensive combat experience who can perfectly train new arrivals. — Here is one of our sergeants, who traveled from our battalion to teach people at the training center. Now he can safely be left on duty at the KSP, — says -Vinny-. Of course, the topic of mobilization and its coverage in mass media and social networks. -And outside the window&#8230; almost Desna,- — hums -Winnie,- laughs, and asks if I've seen the meme that emerged after the TCC and the police checked the documents of visitors to the -Ocean Elsa- concert in Kyiv. — Why swim across the Tisza? Come here, change people for me, and you will also earn in a year. I have a fighter who has five children, he is 50 years old, he voluntarily mobilized, he did not hide from them. He recently received an injury, but he is already writing to me to talk to the commander and while I have at least taken him on paper work, he wants to help the boys, - says the officer. Military personnel believe that the mass media should talk more about the need for mobilization, about the need to change people who are fighting at the front for the third year. — If there are more of us, we we will be able to fight back faster and return home faster. In the same way, if there are more of us, we will be able to go home from time to time, — the paratroopers say, adding that they are sorry to read on social networks about war fatigue among civilians. span> — We have a boy who was crushed in Marinka, he was injured for a day. After the injury, he still decided to stay with us. Yes, now he no longer participates in assaults, but deals with documents. Another boy was drafted — his religion forbids him to pick up a weapon, and he is an Haitian. But they found him a job, he works at the rear point. There are many positions in the army, except for stormtroopers, people are needed everywhere, — they tell in the unit. Currently, the 79th brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is actively conducting a recruiting campaign, volunteers are recruited every month sign contracts for military service. Everyone can choose a suitable specialty and defend the Motherland. And the fighting cats will be released here.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/shturm-rosiyan-dron-z-termobarom-i-bojovi-koty-den-na-pozycziyi-79-brygady-dshv-zsu-yaka-trymaye-kurahivskyj-napryamok/	2024-10-28T21:29:22-07:00
The Russian Federation is spreading a fake about renaming a street in Kyiv in honor of the NATO Secr...	This -news- uses as confirmation the fake -order- on renaming No. 267, supposedly issued by the Kyiv Regional Military Administration. The first thing that catches your eye is &#8211; the decision to rename a street in Kyiv was apparently made by the Kyiv regional government. This is not possible, because the capital of Ukraine is a separate administrative-territorial unit and is in no way subordinate to the regional government. Also, the authors of the fake -document- made grammatical errors that are already traditional for this kind of forgery, which are not characteristic of speakers of the Ukrainian language. For example, fakers use the phrase -help withholding-. If you translate it into Russian, you will get -help content-. Instead, the -document- meant -receiving help-, which in Ukrainian would be written as -receiving help-. In addition, Kyivans know that the Kyiv City Council at the beginning of 2024 had already renamed part of Heroiv Sevastopol Street to honor of Ukrainian surgeon Oleksandr Shalimov. The local authorities did not make any other decisions regarding this street. Decolonization of toponymy is one of the most painful processes for enemies inside Ukraine. After all, Russia uses its own imperial heritage to preserve, restore and strengthen the imperial influence on our country. The common names of streets and settlements, monuments, and the same traditions are for her an argument in favor of the thesis that underlies the current aggression: -Ukrainians are one people with Russians.- If there is one people, then the Ukrainian state is a mistake, or an unnecessary and harmful invention, either by the Austrian General Staff, Lenin, or NATO. That is why propagandists from time to time try to at least somehow suppress this process.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/rf-poshyryuye-fejk-pro-perejmenuvannya-vulyczi-kyyeva-na-chest-genseka-nato/	2024-10-28T21:17:42-07:00

The situation in Toretsk was stabilized: where it was possible to stop the invaders	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — Unlike other areas of hostilities, the number of assaults in the East has decreased somewhat in comparison.

The IT structure of the Armed Forces is being optimized: the reforms should be completed by the end ...	About the consequences of the audit for the IT sphere in the Armed Forces media-ta-memnogo-tureczkogo-strilczya-olimpijczya/->in an interview with ArmiyaInform, the spokesman of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Captain Dmytro Lykhovii, told: - Among other things, it was about the need to slightly reduce the number of staff positions. This process affected many areas, including the IT sector of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which includes the Center for Geospatial Data and the Center for Scaling Technological Solutions. The importance of IT solutions in today's high-tech warfare is undeniable, so there has been an improvement in the organizational and staffing structure of the Center for Scaling Technology Solutions. Such optimization involves more rational use of human resources, concentration on important areas, and improvement of the efficiency of specialists who remain in their positions. The Center for Scaling Technology Solutions has been given time to reform until the end of the year. At the same time, the Armed Forces continue to actively and effectively support technological innovations and the IT sector, and accusations about the destruction of the IT sphere in the Ukrainian army are false. More details about the work of the military spokesman and what the main message of military communicators should be to Ukrainian society, read in ArmiyaInform's interview with Captain Dmytro Lyhovij.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/28/it-strukturu-zsu-optymizuyut-reformuvannya-mayut-zavershyty-do-kinczya-roku/	2024-10-28T07:42:38-07:00

As a result of comprehensive measures in Zakarpattia, Lviv and Cherkasy regions, the organizers of the riots were detained.

The government has approved a plan to combat corruption in the MSEK system: what will change	About this informed the Ministry of Health. The MSEK system consists of institutions of the central and regional level. The Ministry of Health forms only the Central MSEK, which performs organizational and methodical functions. The regional vertical includes 328 MSEK, including 25 regional bureaus and more than 300 central-city and interdistrict commissions. The activities of MSEK regional bureaus are managed by a manager who is appointed and dismissed by the founder — the regional council. The government adopted amendments to the Regulation on medical and social expertise, which allow the Ministry of Health to impose the rights and obligations of the Central MSEK on an enterprise, institution or organization that belongs to the sphere of management of the Ministry of Health and has a license to carry out economic activities in the field of medical practice. This allows you to optimize the process at the central level as quickly as possible. According to the decision of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, the performance of the functions of the Central MSEC, in particular, regarding the consideration of appeals and the verification of the validity of decisions made by the regional level MSEC, has been completely transferred to the Ukrainian State Research Institute of Medical and Social Disability Problems of the Ministry of Health in the city of Dnipro. Here, during 2024, the Ministry of Health created the necessary material and technical base, which should significantly simplify the process of passing an examination for people. The reform plan also provides: The algorithm for appealing decisions of the MSEC has not changed at the moment. If your case was sent for appeal to the Central MSEC, it will be forwarded to the Ukrainian State Research Institute of Medical and Social Disability Problems of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine in the city of Dnipro. You will be contacted regarding the review and further actions, the order of consideration will be preserved. As reported by ArmyInform, recently a meeting of the NSDC took place regarding numerous facts of violations of the CSEC and false disabilities for officials. There are numerous facts of unjustified disabilities among customs officials, prosecutors, tax officials, in the Pension Fund system, and in local administrations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/28/uryad-zatverdyv-plan-shhodo-protydiyi-korupcziyi-v-systemi-msek-shho-zminytsya/	2024-10-28T06:53:00-07:00
The wave of public dissatisfaction with fortifications was extinguished: the materials are still use...	With the experience of how, in the winter and early spring of 2024, the communicators of the -Tavria- OSU managed to cover the construction of fortifications in the East in such a way as to calm society and at the same time not harm the security of the military, in an interview ArmyInform shared the spokesman Captain Dmytro Lykhovii of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: — In the Tavria air defense system, we organized active coverage of the construction of fortifications in our area of ​​responsibility, near Avdiivka. It was shown that construction is provided by engineering units, relevant companies of mechanized brigades, emergency services, regional administrations, etc. They showed new defense lines, concrete freshly built dugouts, trenches, trenches with overlaps, built according to the requirements of the infantry, which take into account the modern challenges of combat and the operational environment. Photos and videos were taken, I recorded a lot of stand-ups from the trenches and bunkers, and we made all these files freely available to all willing TV viewers. Those materials are used to this day, if there is a need to illustrate one or another thematic plot. Thanks to the fact that we showed and explained all this, the wave of -popular discontent- about the fortifications was then extinguished. After all, fortifications were actually built, in large numbers, and the fortifications are not bad. I believe that this was an exemplary case of responding to a crisis call that arose in the information field in February-March. Again, effective -communication of solved problems-. Once again, I thank the excellent team from the public relations department of the -Tavria- OSU, whose area of ​​responsibility included the Avdiyiv direction.

In this way, they try to motivate their soldiers so that they do not surrender. They create such a picture that it is the -Ukrobander- troops who do not take prisoners, torture and destroy them. Therefore, they also give such orders to their own, so that they do not take us captive, - explained the spokesman.

The international coalition should help return 20,000 kidnapped Ukrainian children to their families	President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told The Times of India about this in an interview. -Tens of thousands of deportees, thousands have had their names changed. They were forced to speak another language. Some, who were teenagers, they sent to war against their own country. And it's just terrible. Unfortunately, if tens of thousands were stolen, we returned less than a thousand,- the President said. As Volodymyr Zelenskyi said, a coalition of states has been created to facilitate the return of children to their families. Now there are four dozen countries in the coalition, and it is very important that large countries join it. -Unfortunately, very few countries have been able to return our children. As I told you, this is a small number compared to the number of children who were abducted. If 20,000 Ukrainian children are deported, each leader must take responsibility and return 1,000 children. They didn't just -sit at the table-, but really helped,- the Ukrainian leader stated. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Mariupol schoolchildren are forced to write letters to military assassins.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/28/dytyacha-koalicziya-maye-povernuty-v-rodyny-20-tysyach-vykradenyh-ditej/	2024-10-28T03:19:16-07:00
Bomber Zmiiny, survived a missile hit and a collision with a stork, got into the cinema - the story ...	About the pilot told on October 28 t.v.o. head of the communications department of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Yuriy Ignat. Viktor is one of those who bombed the enemy on Zmiino. Then the Ukrainian bombers filigreely placed five hundred kilogram bombs directly -in the apple-, leaving no chance for the enemy. One of these sorties could be the last for Victor and his brother. -We had to eject. They flew in a group of planes, worked well with high-explosive aerial bombs... U-turn, and to the operational airfield. They shout to us from the ground: -Rockets, they are working for you...-. We did everything we could to save the car, until the last, as they say, we tried to escape from them. But the chances melted away. Closer to the coast - they felt a blow, but continued to pull the board to land. After crossing the coastline in Odesa, we completely lost control. There is only one way out - a catapult! The Su-24 is designed in such a way that after firing the lantern, the navigator's catapult pyro cartridge is activated first, and the pilot's after one and a half seconds. And, believe me, sometimes those one and a half seconds are worth life... That time my commander survived, is serving, but was unable to return to flying work. Any catapulting is a trauma for the body, to a lesser or greater extent, it's a matter of luck. After rehabilitation, I returned to combat work again,- Viktor said. Its commander, Colonel Yevhen Bulatsyk, said that a feature film is currently being shot abroad, the main episode of which is the combat work of the pilots to liberate Zmiiny Island. And Viktor sometimes has to fly on two-seater L-39 training and combat aircraft. This can be a task of maintaining flying skills, i.e. recovery after a break, or other special tasks where the use of this type of aircraft will be sufficient. Viktor flew out with his brother on one of these missions. Looking ahead, I will say that this case is unique in the history of aviation and probably has no analogues in world practice! The task was completed. Returning to the base, the pilots got into a rather unpleasant situation - the cockpit of the plane was rammed by... a stork. The cabin light was thrown away, but only the first catapult worked. Viktor's seat remained in place... He instantly took control of the plane, got out of the dangerous pique and continued the flight without a cockpit light and, as it turned out later... without his brother, he did not survive... The flying profession is not only romantic, but also dangerous, every detail is important. The main thing is not to lose concentration at a critical moment. In this difficult situation, the experienced pilot-navigator showed steel endurance and landed the plane at the nearest airfield. It is difficult not only in heaven, but also on earth. The dawn in Starokostyantynov for the third full-scale year already usually takes place to the accompaniment of a siren... The war made the city quite a well-known district center. Starkon, as the city is called for short, survived the unprecedented missile and drone attacks of the Russians. What's more, the local tactical aviation brigade of the Air Force drank Putin's blood well, because it effectively hits the rear of the aggressor in the occupied territory, freed Zmiiny, destroyed the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and even sank several of its ships. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilot of the Ukrainian Su-24M said that with his colleagues -storm-shadow-pilot-ukrayinskogo-su-24m/->get in line to work on the Storm Shadow enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/28/bombyv-zmiyinyj-perezhyv-vluchannya-rakety-i-zitknennya-z-lelekoyu-potrapyv-u-kino-istoriya-lotchyka-viktora/	2024-10-28T03:06:48-07:00

About this informs October 28 SBU. -The task of the Russian agent was to identify the locations of Ukrainian infantrymen and artillery that are holding the defense under the district center. In order to find the coordinates, the person involved traveled around the district center and nearby settlements under the guise of delivering humanitarian aid to local residents,- the report says. According to the case file, he sent the received data via messenger to his Russian curator, a staff member of the FSB, whose identity has already been established by the counter-intelligence of the Security Service. -The Russians used information from the agent to plan new attacks on Pokrovsk using guided air bombs and FPV drones,- the SBU said. Counter-intelligence agents exposed the agent at the initial stage of his intelligence activity and detained him. Simultaneously, comprehensive measures were taken to secure the positions of the Defense Forces. During the searches, a mobile phone with an anonymous chat in the messenger, which he used to communicate with an FSB employee, was seized from the detainee. On the basis of the received evidence, the investigators of the Security Service notified the detainee of suspicion under Part 2 of Article 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The perpetrator is in custody. He faces up to life in prison with forfeiture of property. As reported by ArmyInform, the Security Service completed the pre-trial investigation regarding the members of the criminal organization that carried out information sabotage against Ukraine on the order of the FSB. Among those involved is the head of the UOC (MP) capital temple, who belonged to the agency apparatus of the Russian special service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/28/pid-vyglyadom-dostavok-gumanitarky-shpyguvav-za-oboronczyamy-pokrovska-zatrymano-psevdovolontera-oon/	2024-10-28T02:49:36-07:00

- We are signing up to work on the enemy Storm Shadow - Ukrainian Su-24M pilot	On October 28, Vol. Acting head of the communications department of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Yuriy Ignat. Su-24M pilot Victor leisurely enjoyed his coffee with his cigarette. He says he does it traditionally, before he gets on the plane. Now the aviators are focused on the use of Western high-precision weapons. There are serious strategic tasks at hand. It would seem that everything is simple. Pilots must clearly go to the launch line of Storm Shadow/Scalp cruise missiles, press the launch button, sit down at one of the operational airfields and ... wait for objective control - confirmation of the destruction of the enemy object. Everything is simple only at first glance. In fact, these are complex operations that involve a large number of specialists from various fields. Strike planning, missile programming, reconnaissance - everything requires the most accurate mathematical calculations, otherwise - there will be no result. And Storm Shadow or Scalp should hit the target! And full stop. We don't have many of those missiles. -We sign up in line to let in the -winged ones-. And why are you surprised, it is. Everyone wants to complete this honorable mission. There are crews, there are planes, but Western missiles are not enough... The guys are very motivated and purposeful, that's why it's the turn! When it is necessary to go to combat, we do not have questions: -Why should I...- We are told: -Can I...-, Viktor said. In the first months of the war, there were no Western weapons yet, so the pilots struck with short-range air missiles and free-falling air bombs. At the beginning of the war, our pilots did not have any -red lines-, they broke through the enemy's anti-aircraft defense and in one sortie sent to hell hundreds of occupiers, tens of units of armored vehicles, which pearled on Kyiv in columns. Yes, it was a one-way ticket for many, but the bombers made an incredible contribution to the victory. Needless to say, in the first weeks of the full-scale operation, the pilots successfully flew near Bryansk more than once, destroyed the enemy's offensive pace on its territory, and destroyed logistics. In many directions, these were bold, daring operations of the Air Force aviation, in which Victor also took part. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukrainian missiles destroyed key command points of the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/28/my-zapysuyemos-v-chergu-shhob-vidpraczyuvaty-po-vorogu-storm-shadow-pilot-ukrayinskogo-su-24m/	2024-10-28T01:04:23-07:00
Snow collapse: MOU prepares for logistical challenges in extremely difficult weather conditions	This was reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on October 28. According to the legend of the exercises, the biggest blizzard in recent decades happened in Ukraine, which caused the collapse of the roads. The storm paralyzed traffic, it accumulated on the roadway and at the entrances to large settlements in the central and northern parts of the country. The MOU noted that in the conditions of war with the Russian aggressor, such a situation on roads of defensive significance would threaten the disruption of military logistics. It would become impossible to move personnel, military equipment, weapons, ammunition and humanitarian cargo. The participants of the exercises identified a network of the main highways of defensive importance and sections with long uphill and downhill sections, where snow removal and other special equipment will primarily work. In addition, monitoring of the situation and collection of hydro-meteorological data, prompt informing of the population and carriers, an algorithm for introducing restrictions or traffic bans, as well as an overview of the technical condition of vehicles were worked out. The training took place on the basis of the Information and Analytical Center of the State Agency for Reconstruction and Development of Infrastructure of Ukraine. They were attended by representatives of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Reconstruction Agency, officials of the regional and Kyiv city military administrations, the Department of Patrol Police, the State Emergency Service and Ukrtransbezpeka. The Ministry of Defense was represented by Colonel Artem Voronin, the Chief Specialist of the Emergency Prevention Department of the Civil Protection Department of the Main Department of Mine Action, Civil Protection and Environmental Safety. He drew attention to the fact that the maintenance of roads of defense importance in proper condition is a guarantee of reliable logistical support for the fulfillment of tasks by the Defense Forces of Ukraine.

From the sky to the ground: air-to-ground missiles were used in a special anti-tank vehicle	How inform experts of the defense portal Army Recognition, Wolfram is an anti-tank complex that combines a special purpose vehicle Supacat HMT 6×6, equipped with a Brimstone missile launch module, ArmyInform reports. The main idea of ​​Wolfram is to install a launch platform with eight Brimstone missiles on an HMT vehicle, which will provide a mobile strike capability against ground targets. The Brimstone missile, which was originally an air-to-surface warhead used by ground attack aircraft, was adapted for surface-to-surface missions, in particular, to counter enemy armor. About the similar use of these winged fired by the Defense Forces of Ukraine in ground operations, our editorial office has already repeatedly told in her materials. However, it is worth recalling that the Brimstone warhead is an air-to-surface and surface-to-surface missile developed by the United Kingdom, designed primarily for precision strikes on ground targets. It has been involved in several military conflicts and has been used by such armed forces as the Royal Air Force of Great Britain, the Royal Air Force of Saudi Arabia, the German Luftwaffe, and more recently the ZSU. Brimstone is a compact missile weighing about 50 kg and 1.8 m long. Its design includes a tandem HEAT warhead weighing 6.3 kg, specially designed to penetrate armored targets. This missile is powered by a solid-propellant rocket engine and has a supersonic speed of about Mach 1.3, or about 450 meters per second. One of its key features is its sophisticated guidance system, which integrates an active 94GHz millimeter-band radar and an inertial navigation system (INS) that provides impressive accuracy with an error of less than one meter. Later versions, such as the dual-mode sensor variant and the Brimstone 2 and 3, also include laser guidance capability, increasing the missile's versatility in various combat environments. The land-based version of the Brimstone missile uses fire-and-forget technology, allowing operators launch the missile and rely on its autonomous guidance system to locate and destroy the target without further intervention. This advanced capability is made possible by the missile's dual-mode homing system, which combines millimeter-range radar and laser guidance. Once launched, the missile uses its radar to target targets even if they are moving, ensuring high accuracy and minimizing risk to the operator. The fire-and-forget feature increases battlefield effectiveness by allowing multiple missiles to be launched simultaneously or in rapid succession, increasing the chance of success against enemy armored vehicles and other targets. In turn, the autoplatform for this ground-based anti-tank system is provided SC Group is a British multifaceted engineering company , which is a world leader in the creation of modular structures, including the HMT 600 vehicle, which can use different modules depending on the tasks. Installation of the missile module is possible on 4x4 and 6x6 platform variants. The Wolfram project became the first specialized ground-based anti-tank complex with these missiles, which were created for strike and multi-purpose aircraft. The Wolfram anti-tank system using the ground version of the Brimstone air-to-surface missile.

What it's like to be a military spokesman: Captain Lykhovi on mobilization, civilian media and the m...	Also, the spokesman of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Captain Dmytro Lykhoviy, spoke about mobilization, security of operations, coverage of the construction of fortifications and the peculiarities of the perception of the official spokesperson's posts on a private Facebook account specially for ArmyInform. —Say a few words about your work as a spokesperson for the -Tavria- OUV - when did you accept and hand over the position in the South of Ukraine? — I was the spokesperson for the -Tavria- OUV in the summer and autumn of this year. Before that, in the winter, I was the head of the public relations department and at the same time the spokesperson of the previous OSUV -Tavria-, which covered, in particular, a part of the Donetsk region - the Avdiyiv direction. That is, this year it was my second rotation at Tavria. We are talking about slightly different operational areas. At the same time, I am the spokesperson of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It should be noted that both in the OUV/OSUV and in the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the spokesperson is not a position, but a function. Many journalists do not take this into account. In fact, I have a position in the Main Directorate of Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in the department of interaction with the media. I also have responsibilities that consist in communication on behalf of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This is what is called the -spokesman of the General Staff-. In Kyiv, we alternate with captain Andrii Kovalev. In addition, servicemen of the Main Directorate of Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine can be sent to strengthen communication directions in the OSUV or OUV, which are temporary bodies of military management. So this year, I had two business trips to fulfill certain functional duties at the Tavria Higher Secondary School, rather than moving to a new position. During such a business trip, the spokesperson reports to the commander of the OSU or the OUV, but he also maintains contact and coordinates his actions with the Main Directorate of Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. — So the spokesman for OSUV or OUV is a certain role, the performance of certain duties, or, as you put it, a function. What are the responsibilities of a spokesperson? — These are responsibilities related to communication with media representatives, providing interviews, comments, clarifications in oral and written form, inclusion in TV and radio broadcasts, preparation of texts, summaries for distribution in social networks, etc. A spokesman has a wide range of responsibilities. It should be closer to the media, to journalists, to the audience, intermediaries with which journalists, websites or TV channels are. The spokesperson should be open to constant contact and communication with a wide range of people. When someone becomes a spokesperson, they automatically become a public figure with a heavy workload. This work is intense, difficult, but for me it is very interesting. Actually, this is what I joined the Armed Forces for the second time. - You are a journalist with many years of experience. How did this affect the fulfillment of the duties of a military spokesman? - I have been working in the media since the end of 1991, when I became a correspondent for the newspaper -Ukraine Moloda-. For a long time he worked as the head of the political department, deputy editor-in-chief. The newspaper was very popular in its time and had a large circulation. In 2014, after the beginning of anti-terrorist operation, I first mobilized to the ranks of the 1st tank brigade. According to my VOS (military accounting specialty), obtained at the military department at KNU, I was the deputy battery commander for personnel work. Back then it was called -zampolit-. After demobilization, he founded the online publication -Newspaper-, which writes about the army and war. Its motto: -News of warring Ukraine.- I was convinced that if there was a war going on in the country, then this should be the main topic. I could no longer work in another direction. That is, the specifics of military journalism have been with me since 2015. When the large-scale invasion began, I was also working in the news. The topic of war, for obvious reasons, began to be in much greater demand among readers. The monthly attendance of Novynarna reached 10 million. It helped a lot that all the previous years I was in close contact with many press officers, brigades, servicemen and veterans. After all, -Novynarnia- specialized in coverage of ATO/OOS and everything related to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and earned a good reputation. When I mobilized for the second time in 2023, I chose the path of a communicator, came to serve in the Main Department of Public Relations of the Armed Forces. This was my environment. That is, relatively speaking, I remained on the same information platform, I just moved from one side of the table to the other. — That is, you both came and at the same time remained in the same field in which you have been working professionally for more than three decades. Does it help? - Here I work with many of the same journalists, the same military, in fact the same units that I have been working with since 2015. But no longer as a civilian journalist, but as a military journalist and communicator. At the same time, in my work in the Armed Forces, I profess the principle that Ukrainian civilian journalists are our allies, colleagues and partners. I think it is a huge advantage when I have contacts and approaches to many journalists interested in our topic since I worked side by side with them. I believe that I am doing the same thing with them in the same war, but as a representative of the Armed Forces. In those periods when I was seconded to OSUV and OUV -Tavria-, this cooperation became as contact as possible. I could perform my work much better and in larger volumes, because I know journalists well, their problems, their requests, strengths and weaknesses, the specifics of publications, etc. —Has anything fundamentally changed in the coverage of the war in the media since the beginning of the large-scale invasion? It's not the amount of news and public attention to the topic that matters - it's too much to compare the scale before and after, everything is obvious. I have in mind the requests of society and journalists for information about the war and the work of the media in general. - As a civilian journalist in the recent past, I understand what the media want. I understand that they are always eager to learn more. At the same time, it is equally obvious that those journalists who have been working on the military topic for a long time are aware of the logic of certain limitations in connection with the challenges facing the military. It is easy to work with such experienced colleagues. They have an understanding of how and why all this is being done, and who is fighting and how, and how it should be covered so that everyone remains alive. It is clear that both the amount of information and the scale of the war after February 2022 have increased many times. Now, in the third year of repelling the large-scale invasion of Russia, we must help maintain the interest of the Western media, our media, and our society in general in the events at the front, in the issues of the army. Actually, to engage in objective reporting about what is happening in the war and in the army. —You mentioned Western media working in the national media spaces of their countries and at the international level. With the main messages about them, everything seems to be clear - Ukraine is waging a just war against a brutal aggressor who has not only committed an act of aggression, but has committed numerous war crimes. As an aggressor state, the Russian Federation despises international law and tries to undermine the fundamental principles of the world order. Therefore, Great Britain, the USA, Canada, Australia, the states of the European Union and other countries should continue to effectively support Ukraine in this war - this is correct both from a moral and ethical point of view, and from a purely pragmatic point of view. And what should be the main message to Ukrainian society, what should be addressed to it? - A citizen of Ukraine should be aware that he has not only rights, but also responsibilities. That military duty is prescribed in the Constitution. That assistance to the Defense Forces and mobilization is a matter of the survival of the Ukrainian state, Ukrainian society, and the Ukrainian nation as such. The task of military communicators, in my opinion, is very serious here. This is both direct information and cooperation with our media, which are actually mediators between the army and society. Of course, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have many channels in various social networks, they have millions of subscribers. But still, without cooperation with Ukrainian journalists, we will not be able to communicate with our society better, more qualitatively, more efficiently. So to speak, influence the basic settings. Honest communication - and above all communication about solved problems - can improve the situation with mobilization, and therefore improve the situation in the Armed Forces and at the front in general. In the opposite case, there is a collapse of specific aspects on the battle line - when there are simply not enough personnel, in particular, because the information vacuum has been filled by fakes and manipulations. That is why I say that cooperation with civilian journalists is so important for us. - Let's return to your work as a spokesperson at the Tavria State Educational Institution - how did the interaction with civilian media take place in practice? - During my business trip to the Tavria Educational Institution in February-March 2024, first events with the withdrawal of our troops from Avdiyivka and the subsequent Russian offensive. The question of fortifications also arose. There was a lot of active crisis communication, both reactive and proactive. In addition, during the same period, there were changes to the Order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine No. 73 -On the organization of interaction between the Armed Forces of Ukraine, other components of the defense forces and representatives of the media during the legal regime of martial law-. I believe that the changes that were made to this order in particular and the efforts of our communication department in cooperation with professional public organizations, brought to the press services in the troops and to civilian journalists, were progressive. They greatly facilitated and simplified the work of journalists in war zones. Our team of the public relations department of -Tavria- OSUV was one of the first to start implementing these innovations for the media in practice. The result was, for example, a report by Anna Kalyuzhnaya from Robotyn: the -red zone- can -open- under certain conditions. I will also emphasize that the spokesperson's quality communication is based on the possession of a large amount of up-to-date information regarding the operational situation in the area of ​​responsibility of the OSU/OUU. To do this, it is necessary to constantly work daily with information sources of military structures, social networks, open sources, press services of brigades in the operational zone, keep statistics, receive information from intelligence, from colleagues from other components of the defense forces, etc. That is, as a spokesperson, you can only answer the questions and requests of journalists when you are deep in the topic, have information, statistics and analytics, and at the same time know how to weigh and dose all this. After all, when you monitor yourself every day, write something for yourself, keep tables in Excel. After all, if we talk only about -cotton- in general terms, no one has been interested in it for a long time. Such communication does not satisfy either the journalists or the audience and society. - You said that journalists always want more - more information, more photos and videos, more interesting characters and speakers, more comments and explanations. However, this is not always possible, and, I will make no secret, sometimes some of the military directly say that it is easier to ban and not let anyone anywhere, than to run the risk of leaking important information through publications in the media. How to find a balance here between the interests of journalists and society's right to information and security requirements and the non-disclosure of important details, the data of which could contribute to the enemy? How did you manage to do this? — Of course, there is such a thing as operational security, and the officers concerned are careful to ensure that no information that could be useful to the enemy is made public. Their position is clear: if the enemy, for example, learns the thickness of the armored door in a new bunker on a certain section of the front, he can prepare accordingly to overcome these fortifications. Therefore, in the opinion of the security of operations, it is better not to show any fortifications that we have at all. And nothing to show at all (smiles). On the other hand, if we don’t show the fortifications, don’t talk about them, then the society will start to get nervous, because they will think that the defense line has not been built, there are no fortifications at all or they are of poor quality. People will think that the armed forces are retreating only because they are not properly fortified. To prevent this from happening, military communicators need to show the construction of the same fortifications in a way that does not harm the security of the military and operations, on the one hand, and to provide the public with objective, reassuring information, on the other. That's why in the -Tavria- OSUV we organized an active coverage of the construction of fortifications in our area of ​​responsibility, near Avdiivka. It was shown that construction is provided by engineering units, relevant companies of mechanized brigades, emergency services, regional administrations, etc. They showed new defense lines, concrete freshly built dugouts, trenches, trenches with overlaps, built according to the requirements of the infantry, which take into account the modern challenges of combat and the operational environment. Photos and videos were taken, I recorded a lot of stand-ups from the trenches and bunkers, and we put all these files freely available to all willing TV viewers. Those materials are used to this day, if there is a need to illustrate one or another thematic plot. Thanks to the fact that we showed and explained all this, the wave of -popular discontent- about the fortifications was then extinguished. After all, fortifications were actually built, in large numbers, and the fortifications are not bad. I believe that this was an exemplary case of responding to a crisis call that arose in the information field in February-March. Again, effective -communication of solved problems-. Once again, I thank the excellent team from the public relations department of the -Tavria- OSU, whose area of ​​responsibility included the Avdiyiv direction. —Now you have returned from a business trip and are acting as the spokesman for the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Is it just a matter of scaling between OUV and ZSU or are there other more important differences? - There is a significant difference in features. After all, the spokesman of the operational group works with all the components in his operational area and daily communicates the necessary operational data within his own communication framework. Only sometimes, when the situation requires it (in particular, if there is a significant change in the situation), the spokesman coordinates his message with the command of the OUV. At least it was like that for me. The spokesman of the General Staff has a much wider range of topics. But there are clear limitations here. After all, one spokesman is unable to accumulate all the information about the actions of all the components of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in all directions. This would require both the appropriate level of access and communication approvals. Unfortunately, there is no magic drawer in which you can find answers to any urgent media inquiries about the activities of all the Armed Forces in one minute. And the spokesman of the General Staff cannot provide fast communication at the same level as the spokesman of the General Staff. However, we are trying to improve the work and ensure more active communication of the spokespersons of the General Staff. Consideration is also given to being on TV and providing direct comments to media inquiries today. I will give an example. Recently, there has been a lively media interest in the reform in the IT sector of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The information on this matter was critical and somewhat distorted. The media, including, asked for a comment from the General Staff of the Armed Forces. We promptly prepared a response the same day. - What exactly was it about? - The question related to the alleged -collapse- of the IT structure of the Armed Forces. And the fact is that in the spring of 2024, the Main Inspection of the Ministry of Defense conducted an audit of the functional purpose of military organizational structural units and military management bodies. Among other things, there was talk of the need to somewhat reduce the number of staff positions. This process affected many directions, including the IT sector of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which includes the Center for Geospatial Data and the Center for Scaling Technological Solutions. The importance of IT solutions in today's high-tech warfare is undeniable, so there has been an improvement in the organizational and staffing structure of the Center for Scaling Technology Solutions. Such optimization involves more rational use of human resources, concentration on important areas, and improvement of the efficiency of specialists who remain in their positions. The Central Committee was given time to reform until the end of the year. At the same time, the Armed Forces continue to actively and effectively support technological innovations and the IT sector, and accusations about the destruction of the IT sphere in the Ukrainian army are false. - As can be seen from the examples you mentioned - both about the fortifications in the East and about the reform of the military administration - the role of the spokesperson is very responsible. Is there a situation where every word you say or written is perceived as an official position? After all, any word said in public space can be seen as an official comment. There was a fun case. In the summer, as an individual, as a sports lover (and a former curator of the sports department in the newspaper) commented on Facebook a speech at the Turkish Sagittarius Olympiad - an athlete in glasses, without headphones, a former police officer who fired, holding his hand in his pocket. Then he became a world meme - they say, look at what a cool police in Turkey, that here is an ordinary police officer on a relaxed shot of titled professionals! And then I wrote a comment that he is actually a professional athlete who has been firing for decades, he already has dozens of medals from the World and Europe Championships, that all the pneumatic gun shooters hold his hand in his pocket, after all, many shooters in Berushi's ears. And in this Turk. Then this comment dispersed on the Internet, from my private post made publications on many sites with headings: -The spokesman of the Tavriya- put -in the place of Turkish Sagittarius.- Therefore, I am on Facebook now careful (smiles) . In the continuation of the interview with the Armyinform with the spokesman of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by Captain Dmitry Likhovy, read soon about the Krynki, the left bank of the Dnieper in Kherson region, Gulyaypilsky, Zaporizhia, Orikhiv directions and robots, as well as about mobilization and distinction between chemical substances.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/28/yak-cze-buty-vijskovym-rechnykom-kapitan-lyhovij-pro-mobilizacziyu-czyvilni-media-ta-memnogo-tureczkogo-strilczya-olimpijczya/	2024-10-27T21:44:09-07:00
Another scandal about filtering in the Armed Forces: which indicates a fake	Such nonsense could come to mind only to a stubborn Russian propagandist who had read the Kremlin's manual and Gundyaev's prayers. Even without analyzing the content, this -document- is a fake for a number of other reasons. First, the text contains a number of linguistic errors, incorrect wording and is overly emotional. This indicates that the -letter- was written by a person who does not speak the state language and does not work with official documents. Secondly, the code of EDRPOU (Unified State Register of Enterprises and Organizations of Ukraine) in the header of the document and on the seal are different. This is a serious inconsistency - in such an official document, the codes must match. Thirdly, given the document's other shortcomings, the presence of the QR code and electronic signature information may be an attempt to make it look official. What seems strange about the design of the -document- is that the -letter- is addressed to two divisions of the TCC of the JV at different levels: the Odesa Regional Territorial Center of Recruitment and Social Support and the Khadzhibey Territorial Center of Recruitment and Social Support of the City of Odesa. At the same time, the names and surnames of the managers are not indicated, which is atypical for official documents. Note -App. No- is also not filled in, which is a violation. It usually means -instance number- and indicates which instance is the original or the copy. In conclusion, we would like to emphasize that such -throw-ins- are aimed at inciting conflicts on linguistic grounds and undermining unity among Ukrainian military. Fact checkers state that fake reports about the alleged discrediting of the Russian-speaking population in Ukraine and about the so-called -increasing conflict- between Ukrainian and Russian-speaking citizens of Ukraine have become more frequent recently.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/28/chergova-ahineya-pro-filtracziyu-v-zsu-shho-vkazuye-na-fejk/	2024-10-27T21:23:58-07:00
New support packages for Ukraine and thanks to the combat brigades: address of the President	This was announced by the head of state on October 27 in his evening address. The President also thanked several combat brigades for this week. -25th Separate Airborne, 79th Assault, 35th Separate Marine Brigade, 65th Separate Mechanized, 425th Separate Assault Battalion and 27th Separate Artillery Brigade.

In addition, the head of state listened to the reports of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine General Oleksandr Syrskyi regarding the front and the Kursk operation, as well as the Minister of Defense Rustem Umerov regarding contracts for the domestic production of weapons. -Today we are preparing to work with partners for the week. We have created a new format of cooperation — Ukraine plus the countries of Northern Europe. And within the framework of this format, we are constantly increasing our interaction. Defense, political, economic. And the basis of all this is our valuable interaction,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He is grateful to every country in this format: Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland. The President of Ukraine expects all partners to support the Victory Plan. In his opinion, the key priority is the support of Ukrainian positions in the most difficult directions, soldiers, domestic production of weapons, in particular, drones. Earlier, President called the highest priority of drones, which can bring down -shahedis-. As reported by ArmyInform, more than 1,100 guided air bombs, -prezydent/->over 560 attack drones and about 20 missiles of various types were used by the occupiers against Ukraine this week.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/novi-pakety-pidtrymky-ukrayiny-ta-podyaka-bojovym-brygadam-zvernennya-prezydenta/	2024-10-27T11:58:55-07:00
Canadian Roshel armored car vs. Russian FPV drone: the story of border guards	They told about him in the video. According to the border guards, the Ukrainians gave her the gentle nickname -Roshelka-. It is used to bring soldiers to and from positions, to evacuate the wounded. -We were beaten near Vovchansk. FPVishka hit. The glass survived. It didn't fly away. It was broken, the road was not visible, but it was possible to drive,- recalled the fighter under the pseudonym -Sensei-. Armored body is just one of its charms. Defenders of Ukraine assured that -Roshelka- will pass without problems where ordinary pickup trucks can get into a difficult situation. -And it is managed by ordinary guys who, before mobilization, were either forwarding drivers or computer science teachers. Because mastering it, despite its large dimensions and 8-ton weight, is not so difficult,- the border guards noted. Earlier, ArmyInform showed how border guards of the -Hart- brigade destroyedan enemy howitzer gun D-20 in the Vovchansk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/kanadskyj-broneavtomobil-roshel-proty-rosijskogo-fpv-drona-istoriya-prykordonnykiv/	2024-10-27T11:26:06-07:00
Drone attacks and artillery fire: the Russian army attacked two districts of the Dnipro region	informs head of Dnipropetrovsk OVA Serhiy Lysak about this. -In Nikopol, infrastructure, an enterprise, 2 five-story buildings and 8 private houses were mutilated.

Experts are investigating the consequences of the attacks. -In the afternoon, the Russians also struck the Zelenodol community of Kryvorizka district with a drone. Due to which the damage is on the territory of one of the enterprises. -Fortunately, there were no casualties or damage everywhere,- noted Serhiy Lysak. As reported by ArmyInform, today, October 27, the Russian military throughout the day naselenyh-punktah/->attacked populated areas of the Kherson region, as a result of which the civilian population suffered.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/dronovi-ataky-j-artylerijski-obstrily-armiya-rf-atakuvala-dva-rajony-dniprovshhyny/	2024-10-27T11:03:27-07:00
Uterine drones near Selidov: the enemy broke through to the city thanks to a significant advantage i...	At the same time, the Russians practically did not use armored vehicles, instead they resorted to innovations in the use of drones, using drones. The defense forces are making maximum efforts to prevent the enemy from advancing further. The spokesperson of the 15th Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine -Kara- Dag- Vitaly Mylovydov: — The situation in Selidovo remains very difficult and very difficult. For almost a week now, the enemy has continued active assaults, deploying large reserves, partially transferring units from the northern part of the Pokrovsky Front and carrying out, starting and continuing attacks not from two, but from three flanks, that is, the northern outskirts were approached from the northern, eastern and southern outskirts. He used all the bridgeheads that he tried to prepare during September and advanced along the settlement of Selidove, i.e. further north and south. Since the beginning of the week, on Monday, having conducted a preliminary massive artillery training, for about twenty hours, the maximum number of assault units, personnel, due to a large accumulation of manpower, has been trying to capture the city of Selidove. In part, he managed to get to the eastern and southern outskirts, in part to gain a foothold due to a huge number of personnel. But the Defense Forces, 15 Brigade, adjacent units are doing their best to check the enemy's advance. In recent days, the enemy has focused more attention and is using forces partly with the use of equipment, light equipment, trying in the direction of the settlement of Vishneve, which is located further south, with an attempt to create conditions for the encirclement of the city and the displacement of our units directly from Selidowo, cutting off the logistical routes and the supply of our units . Previously, the enemy had very massively used artillery and means of air damage, namely anti-aircraft missiles. The enemy attacked point by point, calculating the positions. Partially struck, destroying some of the western outskirts of the city of Selidove to make it impossible to defend and consolidate our units on those outskirts. I also want to note that the enemy uses a lot of force, but did not use armored vehicles, and due to the movement of infantry groups, taking into account the peculiarities of the geographical area, that is, forest strips that almost come close to the outskirts of the city and reach the first 50 by 70 meters there houses Even the leaves, unfortunately, did not cover these movements in our favor, therefore, at the expense of a significant number, it was possible to infiltrate the territory of the city with an attempt to further entrench. Artillery is now less actively used, but, nevertheless, the positions of our units and adjacent ones are subject to constant and regular attacks by both aviation means of destruction and artillery. Also, it was on this route that we probably first encountered such a combination of a drone that had an FPV drone attached. That is, the zone of its damage was expanded due to the depth of advancement of the main reconnaissance UAV, which corrected and, when calculating the movement of the equipment, dropped the FPV drone directly in the area of ​​damage to the targets. Thus, getting caught in those areas where you least expect damage, catching our equipment or the movement of forces. This bothered me and that's why EW devices were already used at entrances even where, theoretically, it was not planned to use it and counter FPV drones. Selidove is a more or less large settlement, and therefore it can be used as a bridgehead for quartering, or accommodation, or pulling up some resources. Therefore, in any case, the loss of any settlement that retains any logistical routes or capabilities will pose a problem. Geographically, Selidove is in the lowlands, but still it is a fairly large settlement, and further on we see that they are trying to push the Pokrovsky Front very hard, they are not stopping and are pulling up fresh reserves. All measures are being taken and every effort is being made to prevent the enemy from advancing further. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Selidovoy district, the Russian occupiers take pity on their own soldiers and literally step on the corpses of their henchmen.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/drony-matky-pid-selydovym-vorog-prorvavsya-do-mista-zavdyaky-znachnij-perevazi-v-zhyvij-syli/	2024-10-27T10:41:19-07:00
The occupiers are taking North Korean mercenaries to the front in trucks with civilian license plate...	This is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The driver who was in the trailer of reinforcements from North Korea did not have a combat warrant. In another radio intercept obtained by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the staff members of the 810th separate brigade of marines of the Russian occupation army, to which the North Korean assistance from KamAZ was intended, are trying to find out whether they have a stopped truck on the balance sheet and why the driver does not have the proper papers. The GUR of the IOU emphasized that there will be a fair retribution for every war crime committed against Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine intercepted the conversations of servicemen of the 810th separate brigade of marines of the 18th army of the Southern Military District (of the Russian Federation), which is participating in hostilities in the Kursk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/okupanty-vezut-na-front-pivnichnokorejskyh-najmancziv-vantazhivkamy-z-czyvilnymy-nomeramy/	2024-10-27T10:28:59-07:00

They walk over corpses: in the East, the Russians put 600 of their own soldiers behind a village fro...	About the tactics of the Russian occupiers in the East, the ruthlessness of the Russian invaders towards local civilians and their own soldiers, and the situation in the Selidovoy district on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon told Vyacheslav, commander of the company of the -Shershni Dovbush- strike unmanned aerial systems of the 68th separate hunting brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush. — We held positions on the outskirts of Selidovoy for a long time, and our friendly units of the brigade also stood. They held out for a long time, but constant assaults, a constant meat grinder, constant attacks of manpower and equipment&#8230; How many are being destroyed in this direction - the numbers are colossal - and the assaults are in fact never ending, he said. The military described the ruthless attitude of the enemy command towards its own soldiers. — I have very little understanding of how this can happen, when the army can afford to put 600 men in a week in our small direction, when they stormed a village with a length of one street in a kilometer. There, the whole road was covered with the dead bodies of Russian soldiers. I thought they should have retreated, regrouped. But, apparently, they have such reserves that they constantly attack and the attack does not decrease. Therefore, they still have some success, the commander of the drones reported. The defender explained how this happens. — Someone somewhere will fix the -300-m-, one or two, and they will come. And this is what happened to Selidov. They held advanced positions, somewhere they broke through, everyone started pushing into that gap, started to pass, Vyacheslav said. The soldier compared the attitude of Ukrainians to their brothers and the occupiers to their henchmen. - We don't even have that, you see, if there is movement in our country and someone there is injured or something else, then an evacuation is carried out, we stop such actions, and they don't pay attention, said the soldier. the Russians continue to advance, regardless of their own soldiers - neither dead nor even wounded. — If a -brother- falls, they continue moving anyway, regardless of whether he is the -300th- or the -200th-, whether they can help him, provide assistance - no one cares about that, Vyacheslav explained. He described one situation recorded by Ukrainian drones. — It was even worse: once we hit enemy infantry with a drone. Two units were moving, we -triggered- one. He fell, taking his weapon. And the second one continued to move, he did not provide any help to his -brother-, he continued to move. Then this wounded man took a machine gun and started shooting at his comrade, who ran away from him. That is, their interaction is like this, said the commander of -Shershniv Dovbusha-. Earlier, he recalled the following behavior of the occupiers: - The enemy does not understand during the offensive. It even happens that [they shoot] at their own people, not only at civilians, but they also open fire at their own people, when they land infantry with vehicles. Let's say that we have already repeatedly observed the situation that even when turning around, the armored personnel carrier tries to go quickly so that we do not hit it with drones or artillery. And he even simply chokes [his own] infantry with his own equipment and turns back. He does not always return successfully - very rarely, - said the Ukrainian military officer. In view of this, he is not surprised that the occupiers also shoot civilians - not valuing their own lives, they do not value the lives of others even more. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that The Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine for Rights person reacted to the information spreading in social networks about the alleged shooting of two women by the occupiers in the city of Selidove, an investigation has been launched into the facts of the killing of civilians by the occupiers of Selydovogo. Meanwhile Ukrainian fighters in Selidovo saved two civilians from Russian shelling.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/idut-po-trupah-na-shodi-rosiyany-poklaly-za-tyzhden-600-vlasnyh-soldativ-za-selo-z-odniyeyi-vulyczi/	2024-10-27T09:41:45-07:00
The takeoff was successful, the landing is doubtful: modified FPV drones are hunting Russian reconna...	They published a video of combat work on their channel. The war with the Russian occupiers continues not only on the ground, but also in the sky. -46 OAeMBr cuts the enemy's wings. Enemy planes do not even come close to Ukrainian positions, because they know: there was a takeoff, landing is unlikely. But drones, especially reconnaissance drones, are still a real nuisance to our fellow citizens,- the report says. According to the paratroopers, reconnaissance UAVs are mostly invisible from the ground to the naked eye, they direct and adjust the fire of artillery and MLRS, point the way to Iskanders and KABs. The 46th OAeMBr said that recently, with the joint efforts of the air defense and RUBpAK units, freelance calculations (crews) were created to detect and destroy small aerial targets - UAVs of the operational-tactical level in the defense zone of the 46th OAeMBr. It is about the use of modified FPV drones to intercept Russian reconnaissance drones such as Zala, Supercam, etc. -So soon the free and impunity flights of the enemy's -wings- and -eyes- will be put to an end. Or at least the ability of the occupiers to conduct aerial reconnaissance is significantly limited,- the paratroopers said. Earlier, ArmyInform showed how during the day the occupiers tanky-ta-avtivky-rosiyan/->six times resorted to assaults in the zone of responsibility of the 46th separate air mobile brigade of the Russian Air Force in the Kurakhiv direction, but the Ukrainian defenders repelled the enemy attacks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/zlit-buv-posadka-navryad-nashi-modyfikovani-fpv-drony-polyuyut-na-rozviduvalni-bpla-rf/	2024-10-27T09:26:30-07:00

The Ombudsman reacted to the alleged shooting of two women by the occupiers	Dmytro Lubinets wrote about this in his Telegram channel. According to him, if the facts of the crime are proven, this is not only a violation of human rights, it is a gross violation of the laws and customs of war, the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. -The alleged shooting of two women by the occupiers in Selidove is a war crime! And the culprits must be brought to justice! He immediately sent letters to international organizations: the UN and the ICRC. I am waiting for a reaction. Russia commits crimes every day in Ukraine!- he assured. Dmytro Lubinets emphasized that the aggressor must be stopped, and the criminals must be punished now. Let us remind you that the released video shows how representatives of the aggressor state's troops probably shot a civilian car with an automatic weapon. During the attack, two citizens were in the salon, one of them was wounded. Currently a pre-trial investigation is being conducted in criminal proceedings for violations of the laws and customs of war. As reported by ArmyInform, after that at the scene military forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces arrived and, pulling the victim out of the line of fire, provided him with first aid and evacuated civilians from under fire.

The fighter entered the army recently, waiting for the country to call. -The HR department received a summons at work. I've been thinking about mobilizing since the first days of the full-scale invasion, but there have been one reason to put it off and another. And then the summons came and I didn't argue anymore. Then passed the BZVP. I don't regret for a moment that I ended up here. It's very cool, I met many interesting people,- said Mazai. In the brigade, he mastered the specialty of a sniper. He says that he has been interested in weapons since childhood. -Before the war, I worked as a forester for five years. He kept various accounts, planted a forest, managed some people. The same as now: he walked around the forest with a weapon, shooting various pests. So, the work has not changed,- the fighter joked. At the beginning of the Kursk operation, Mazai and his partner were in reserve. A little later, they received the command to move forward. -I gathered my thoughts, we were brought to a combat position, everything was wonderful. At first it looked like chaos to me, then I began to notice order. I listened carefully to what they told me, because I really want to live. And they told me: you will live if you obey. I did not retreat from that memorandum, not even for a second,- Mazai shared his memories. During the advance through enemy territory, the sniper detected the first opponents by ear. This gave the advantage of several important seconds to prepare for contact. -My first fight started with a beautiful journey through the dreamlands. We went into landing, there were Russians from several sides. Two groups of boys were walking in front, and we had to cover their rear. We went into the forest, met them, and they told us that the Russians were walking behind us. They sat down and began to wait. I overheard the conversation. There was very dense vegetation everywhere, a kind of mini-jungle. And then I saw a red bandage. At that moment, he was confused and not at the same time. He started shooting, shot one in the shoulder. Then he noticed that people can run very fast. When he started to shoot, the boys felt elation and started to pour there too. Words are difficult to convey those emotions. Then I changed my position, saw how the Russians were moving. The guys found a trophy machine gun somewhere. It was impressive, to say the least. Even during the movement, he -took off his hat- from one enemy soldier. I hope he caught a bad cold from that,- the fighter joked. On the same day, Mazai received his first wound. -At first I thought it was not difficult. Then I hurried a little, got up and the enemy bullet passed between the kidney and the liver, stopped near the spine. At first, it was not felt. But when I tried to shoot two more times, my ribs hurt a lot. My first question then was whether you can smoke in battle. I never had a panic attack. I didn't think that everything was bad, that I was dying. I had very good support from my comrade in arms. For the next two days I continued to perform my combat duties. We took a prisoner even then. In the evening, our enemies left their wounded. Their paramedic was supposed to go after him and stay with him until the evacuees arrived. But the nurse came to visit us. He really wanted to live, and instantly gave up. That orderly even helped me a little,- said Mazai. For a fighter, experience on the battlefield has shown that the most difficult part of a sniper's job is the need to walk a lot. And also, it is important to work not only with weapons, but also with the head. -I thought it would be difficult to shoot people. But when it came down to it, it turned out to be the easiest. Not such a terrible enemy as it is portrayed. It was probably quite easy for me to stay in the positions. The first time in the positions I was worried, but everything went smoothly. If you obey the commanders, remember what you were taught, everything will be fine. Taking the initiative into one's own hands is fatal. And if there is a comrade nearby who can help, give advice, then it is most useful,- the fighter noted. After a few months in the ranks of the 80th brigade, the young paratrooper is motivated most by his family and the desire to liberate the country from the invaders. -Actually, I have been very ideological since childhood. My great-grandfather fought for Ukraine. Father also wants to join the army, but he cannot do it, because he does not have one hand. He supports me morally, he can always find the right words,- said Mazai. Currently, he continues to recover from his injuries and is waiting to return to his duties. -First of all, I would like my brothers who are currently in Kurshchyna to take all instructions and advice seriously. Don't ignore what they tell you. Constantly learn, analyze your actions, what you did right and what you didn't. It is also important to carry a lot of water, because you won't last long without it,- said the fighter. As reported by ArmyInform, the anti-aircraft missile unit of the 80th Airborne Assault Brigade of the Airborne Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces shot down in the sky in the Kursk Oblast of the Russian Federation the latest Russian reconnaissance and strike unmanned aerial vehicle -Orion-. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/dva-dni-voyuvav-z-kuleyu-bilya-hrebta-a-pershu-dopomogu-nadav-polonenyj-sanitar-snajper-mazaj-pro-boyi-na-kurshhyni/	2024-10-27T06:47:25-07:00

Civilians are being hunted in transport: in the South, the enemy is terrorizing local residents	Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — At the moment, the situation in our country is quite difficult, although we do not have as many assaults as there are in some other areas. However, in the same Vremiivsk direction, 22 assaults are quite a large number. It was the day before yesterday or the day before yesterday, and yesterday there was a constant amount of assault going on there, he said. In Kherson region, Russian invaders are trying to move closer to the regional center to terrorize the city. — As for the Kherson direction, there, too, the enemy carries out about 5-7 to 10 assaults every day, trying to take control of the island part of the Dnieper and advance closer to Kherson. The enemy is constantly launching missile strikes, airstrikes and drone strikes on Kherson, the spokesman said. When shelling populated areas, the Russians hit civilian objects and local residents not only randomly, but also purposefully target the civilian population. — In particular, over the past day we had almost 350 strikes by kamikaze drones. These are strikes not only on civilian infrastructure, the enemy is conducting a real hunt on civilian road transport, on public transport, the civilian population is suffering, the officer said. The situation in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast is the same. -In addition, the enemy is constantly shelling the Dnipropetrovsk region, in particular, shelling the Nikopol community and the Marganets community, which are located on the right bank of the former Kakhovsky reservoir,- the military officer said. The spokesman explained the actions of the Russian occupiers as a desire to terrorize Ukraine in various ways with the aim of making the lives of Ukrainians unbearable. — The situation in the South is quite complicated, the residents of Ukraine are constantly suffering from enemy attacks, because the enemy sees here as a direction from where he can at any moment increase the influence of fire, increase terror against Ukraine, Vladyslav Voloshyn said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that komentar/->UU -Tavria- provided an official comment on The Economist's information about the alleged plans of the Russian invaders for Zaporizhzhia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/polyuyut-na-czyvilnyh-u-transporti-pa-pivdni-vorog-teroryzuye-misczevyh-meshkancziv/	2024-10-27T06:03:14-07:00
New trends — a Russian quadrocopter attack aircraft was destroyed in Donetsk region	The video was released on October 27 on the brigade's channel. It is not known for what reasons the invader switched to locomotion with 4 limbs at once, but he stubbornly, although not quickly, climbed the forest strip. The quadrober was spotted by our aerial scouts, who hit the Russian with an FPV drone. This is how the miraculous life path of a Russian, and not only, broke off. As reported by ArmyInform, interesting behavior of the Russian attack aircraft was recorded by the fighters of the -Shershni Dovbush- attack drone company of the 68th hunting brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/novi-viyannya-na-donechchyni-znyshhyly-rosijskogo-shturmovyka-kvadrobera/	2024-10-27T05:43:50-07:00
To hit over the Hydropark — the drones of Holdonoyar won the pilot competition in Kyiv	The video of the competition was released on October 27 on the unit's channel. During the competition, pilots had to hit a balloon attached to a Mavic quadcopter. -This is a very difficult exercise, because the ball does not move along a straight path - it is constantly lobbed in all directions. And you need to be a real ace to impress her. It took 5 minutes to perform the exercise, but Lyolik managed it in 14 (!) seconds — just a phenomenal result,- the unit commented on the video with the exercise. The competitions themselves were held in the Hydropark in Kyiv. Congratulations to the winner and all participants.

The Economist's information about the plans of the Russian invaders for Zaporizhzhia on the air of the national telethon -Edyni Novyni- commented by the spokesperson of the OUV -Tavria- Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn. — According to our intelligence, no offensive groups have been identified in the South. That is, if the enemy has any ambitious plans and The Economist has its data, its insiders among the Russian General Staff, then they can say anything. I am stating what our intelligence can see and what it has found out: that is, there are no offensive groups there, he said. However, in general, the intentions and plans of the enemy are clear - the Russians seek to advance further with the aim of improving their tactical position and creating the threat of shelling large population centers, including with the aim of terror against local civilians. — But, of course, it is logical that the adversary will try to reshape the configuration of the battle line for its own benefit, to bring forces and means closer to such large cities, to such large population centers as Zaporizhzhia, in order to inflict damage by certain means from there, and not only our Defense Forces of Ukraine, and to carry out terror, which the enemy is doing, against the local [civilian — ed.] population, striking Zaporizhzhia with guided aerial bombs, the spokesman emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the enemy's success in the area of the front in the Levadny region is of a limited nature, the dominant heights around the field state are controlled by the Defense Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/zaporizhzhya-the-economist-ta-mozhlyvi-plany-okupantiv-v-ouv-tavriya-nadaly-oficzijnyj-komentar/	2024-10-27T05:11:32-07:00

The Levadny district is controlled by the Armed Forces: the enemy's success is limited	Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . -On that section of the battle line after Ugledar, the enemy increased certain efforts, regrouped and carried out massive assault actions, as a result of which he had partial success, that is, he wedged into our defense to the depth of approximately a platoon's strong point,- he said. However, the Defense Forces are currently taking measures to stabilize the situation and restore lost positions. — As for Levadny itself, I would not be in a hurry to call it a settlement, because it is a simple field state, which was located in a certain lowland, and therefore it is somewhat difficult to defend it, to conduct defensive actions, let's say. Currently, all command heights in this area of ​​the combat clash are under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and a defensive operation to restore the position is ongoing, the spokesperson assured. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that, resorting to air terror tactics, the occupiers turned Orikhiv into a ruin, and also informed that the enemy does not abandon the intention to take control of the islands in the Dnieper river and a real river war is going on there.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/rajon-levadnogo-kontrolyuyut-zsu-uspih-voroga-maye-obmezhenyj-harakter/	2024-10-27T04:14:47-07:00

Ironing with KABs and advancing with the cheapest resource: the Armed Forces revealed the goal of th...	In detail about the repulse of the enemy assault, the situation on the left bank of the Oskil River, the threat of guided aerial bombs and the cheapest resource of the occupiers on the air of the -Espresso- TV channel told captain Yury Fedorenko, commander of the battalion of unmanned attack aircraft complexes -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket captain Ivan Sirk. - This was not some unexpected attack. The enemy is now very active in the Kupyan district. A decision was made on the forced resettlement of Ukrainian citizens from the Kupyan Oblast, because there is an immediate threat to their lives and health. Why does this happen? The enemy still has the ability to use aviation in a highly intensive manner, guided air bombs attack the left bank of the Kupyan region from morning to night and fly into Kupyansk itself, so it was necessary to take these measures to preserve life and health, he said. The task of the occupiers, with the help of Yury Fedorenko, remains unchanged. -The enemy's task remains the same - to reach the left bank of the Oskil River, gain a secure foothold and expand to Kupyansk-Vuzlovoi in order to fully take control of the left-bank Kupyan region,- explained the soldier. In an effort to achieve their goal, the Russian occupiers regularly carry out offensive actions in the Kupyan direction. — As a result, the enemy has been very actively conducting shock and assault operations for more than two and a half months. Two weeks ago, there was a massive assault with the involvement of armored vehicles - 50 units were used by the enemy and the Defense Forces destroyed almost all of them on the battlefield. Then the -Achilles- battalion destroyed 20 units, another 20 were shot down and then burned by the Defense Forces, the officer recalled. The new enemy assault was also considerable, although much smaller than this previous one. — This time the enemy deployed 17 units of armored vehicles at the moment along with assault infantry. As a result, 15 units were destroyed and an additional 2 were hit. The -Achilles- battalion destroyed 8 BMPs that day, as well as 2 tanks and, of course, assault infantry, the military said. The commander of the drones reminded that at the moment the main and cheapest resource in the Russian army is manpower. — Where the enemy cannot succeed through the use of his armored vehicles, he tries to succeed through the use of manpower. For the enemy, it continues to be the cheapest resource at the moment, Yuriy Fedorenko explained. The defense forces of Ukraine are giving a decent rebuff to the Russian invaders. - In one way or another, the enemy can start fresh replenishment and keep the level of hostilities at the -high intensity- mark. Today, too, fierce, complex battles continue. At the moment, we managed to eliminate 6 occupiers and wound another 14. There was also additional training on equipment - not only armored, but also highly mobile. This is what the enemy uses for operational movement, in particular, and to the front line of the battle - two-wheeled motorcycles, buggies, said the military officer. He assured that despite all the efforts of the enemy and the difficulty of the battles in the Kupyan direction, the Defense Forces manage to restrain the enemy. — Now very difficult battles are going on in Kupyansk, very difficult. But the Defense Forces stopped the advance of the enemy. Despite the insane losses he suffers on the battlefield, he is unable to complete the task set before him. They were not able to gain a full foothold on the left bank of the Oskil River, so the battle continues, the officer said. Yuriy Fedorenko told how it was possible to restrain the advance of the invaders. — Did the enemy manage to fully entrench, dig in and hold this territory? No. Currently, systematic work is being carried out, in certain shades there is a living force of the enemy that is migrating, trying to find shelter. Unmanned systems work in it, artillery works in it. Unfortunately, the enemy managed to sneak into the settlement. But has it managed to gain a foothold? No! said the soldier. The captain predicted that the opponent would not be successful in the near future. — The fighting continues now and I am convinced that the enemy will not succeed in the short term in fully reliably occupying the bridgehead and begin expanding their zone of influence along the left bank of the Kupyanska in the Oskil River, said Yuriy Fedorenko. The military explained that it is necessary for the Defense Forces to confront the enemy even more intensively. -Therefore, it is about the fact that in order to achieve a positive result, the defense forces need a little more equipment and means, because the activity of the enemy remains highly active, although it would be correct to use another word,- said the commander of the -Achilles- battalion. Earlier, ArmyInform explained, will the mud with the onset of natural autumn stop the offensive actions of the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/prasuyut-kabamy-ta-prosuvayutsya-najdeshevshym-resursom-u-zsu-rozkryly-metu-okupantiv-na-kupyanshhyni/	2024-10-27T01:53:18-07:00

The video of the lesions was released on October 27. -Gerbers- cost less than -shahedis-, so the enemy often launches them without a combat unit, as a decoy to distract our air defense. Shooting down -Gerbers- with the help of FPV drones is a sign that soon our pilots can start shooting down -Shahedis- in the same way. FPV drones are cheaper than missiles or projectiles for air defense systems, and their use will prevent Russian plans to deplete Ukrainian air defense. As reported by ArmyInform, our drones arranged -heavenly rusoriz- to the hostile -maviks-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/dotyagnutsya-i-do-oryginalu-syly-oborony-pochaly-zbyvaty-dronamy-rosijski-analogy-shahediv/	2024-10-27T01:25:31-07:00

By the end of the year, the Rheinmetall plant in Ukraine will produce the first batch of Lynx BMPs	About this in an interview with TSN director of Rheinmetall Armin Papperger said. According to him, the first factory is already in operation, the equipment is being serviced there and the production line for the Lynx BMP production is in operation. The second and third plants, still under construction, will produce gunpowder and ammunition. Finally, the company's fourth plant will produce air defense systems. The director of Rheinmetall said that he is quite satisfied with the protection of these plants in Ukraine. -We run a strong training program for people to teach them what to do there. I am glad that we can move forward very quickly on some issues. Of course, from the German side, from the Ukrainian side, the issue of bureaucracy sometimes arises, but in the end, everything works,- said Armin Papperger. As reported by ArmyInform, a German-Ukrainian seminar was held of defense industries DFNC2.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/do-kinczya-roku-zavod-rheinmetall-v-ukrayini-vypustyt-pershu-partiyu-bmp-lynx/	2024-10-27T00:39:57-07:00

No casualties. Also, according to law enforcement officers, servicemen of the army of the Russian Federation beat the villages of the Boriv community of the Izyum district with KABs. In Borova, as a result of shelling, two houses were partially destroyed, three private households and farm buildings were damaged. As a result of an enemy air strike, a private house was partially destroyed in the village of Zagryzove of the Borivska hromad of the Izyum district.

Mud tanks, crossroads and Russian assaults: will the mud stop the offensive actions of the occupiers	This was discussed on the Espresso TV channel by the commander of the Achilles unmanned aerial systems battalion of the 92nd separate Captain Yury Fedorenko of the assault brigade named after Ivan Sirko of the Koshovo Otaman. -The intersection will not significantly affect the course of hostilities, since assault operations are carried out by infantry units, and infantry moves in almost any weather,- he said. The military officer explained that under insurmountable weather conditions, the enemy, of course, suspends offensive operations. However, it immediately restores them after the weather improves. — It is clear that when it rains heavily, the enemy also stops at that moment. But as soon as the rain stops, his infantry goes forward, and for them the crossroads does not present significant obstacles, explained the officer. The change in weather conditions will also affect the logistics of the occupiers, making conditions somewhat worse, but this effect will not be critical. - As for logistics, the intensity of supply, of course, it will decrease somewhat, but the enemy will not lose the ability to conduct shock-assault actions, - said Yuriy Fedorenko. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the East, the Russian command of the occupying army more often throws not only infantry into the assaults, but also armored vehicles, which it tried to save before that and explained, why Russians voluntarily die by the thousands in -meat- assaults.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/tanky-brudu-rozdorizhzhya-ta-rosijski-shturmy-chy-zupynyt-bagnyuka-nastupalni-diyi-okupantiv/	2024-10-27T00:11:04-07:00

Kadyrivtsev, known for their exploits in the field of cinematography, filmed a video showing how strong and brave they are before the battle. -However, all their self-confidence was blown away on the battlefield, and they died one by one - the paratroopers destroyed them all. However, among the Russians there were two intelligent people who value their lives more than their dictator. Yes, they surrendered and remained alive. They were immediately provided with medical assistance,- the brigade reported. Kadyrivets, as the elite of the Russian army, are replaced by the Russians in the first place, in contrast to simple -vanoks-. As reported by ArmyInform, scouts of the 95th Polish Assault Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces destroyed a group of the 155th marine brigade of the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Federation, which was supposed to mine the paths of advancement of Ukrainian units.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/ahmad-salo-garmatne-na-kurshhyni-chastkovo-znyshhyly-a-chastkovo-polonyly-kadyrivskyh-tiktokeriv/	2024-10-26T23:55:58-07:00
The defense forces repelled 174 enemy attacks per day — the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukr...	Operational information as of at 08:00 on October 27 was published by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The situation at the front remains difficult. The enemy, using their advantage in manpower and equipment, is relentlessly attacking our positions. Ukrainian defenders steadfastly restrained the onslaught of the occupiers and inflicted significant losses on the enemy. The aggressor carried out airstrikes, in particular, in the areas of the settlements of Khrapivshchyna, Yablunivka, Myropyllya, Basivka, Hoptivka, Kozacha Lopan, Odradne, Pischane, Hlushkivka, Berestov, Zagryzove, Terny, Chasiv Yar, Toretsk, Kostiantynivka, Mirnograd, Uspenivka, Mali Shcherbaki, Mala Tokmachka , Lviv. Over the past day, aviation, missile forces and artillery of the Defense Forces hit two enemy command and observation posts, six areas of concentration of personnel, weapons and military equipment, one air defense vehicle and two enemy guns. In the Kharkiv direction, the enemy stormed our positions seven times near the settlements of Vovchansk and Staritsa. In the Kupyan direction, 14 attacks by invaders took place during the day. The defense forces repelled enemy assaults near Kindrashyvka, Synkivka, Petropavlivka, Kruglyakivka, Zagryzovy, Vyshnevoy, Berestovoy, and Pershotravnevyo. The enemy actively used bombing and attack aircraft for strikes on the direction. In the Lyman direction, the aggressor attacked 18 times. He tried to penetrate our defenses near Kindrashyvka, Synkivka, Petropavlivka, Kruglyakivka, Zagryzovy, Vyshnevoy, Berestovoy and Pershotravnevy. On the Siverskyi direction, Ukrainian defenders repelled two assaults by Russian invaders near Bilogorivka. In the direction of Toretsk, the enemy, with the support of aviation, launched nine attacks in the direction of Toretsk and Shcherbinivka. In the Pokrovsky direction, our defenders stopped 41 assault and offensive actions of the aggressor in the areas of the settlements of Vozdvizhenka, Myrolyubivka, Promin, Lysivka, Krutyy Yar, Krasnyy Yar, Mykolaivka and Selidove. The greatest concentration of enemy attacks was near Selidovoy. In the Kurakhiv direction, the Defense Forces repelled 43 attacks. The occupiers most actively tried to advance near Antonivka and Katerynivka. In addition, the enemy attacked in the direction of Novoselidivka, Gostroy, Dalnyi, Kostyantynivka, Elizavetivka. In the Vremivsk direction, the enemy carried out five assaults on our positions in the Bogoyavlenka and Novoukrainka districts. In the Orichiv direction, the Russian invaders once stormed the positions of our soldiers in vain. Five times in vain, the invading troops tried to dislodge units of the Defense Forces from their positions in the Dnieper direction. The operation is ongoing in the Kursk region. Russian aviation continues to bomb its villages and cities. Over the past day, Russian planes have carried out 30 airstrikes with 45 anti-aircraft missiles on their own territory. No signs of the formation of enemy offensive groups were detected in the Volyn and Poliske directions. On the border with the Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the enemy from the territory of the Russian Federation is actively using artillery and aviation in the areas of Ukrainian settlements. Our soldiers inflict significant losses in manpower and equipment on the occupying forces and actively undermine the offensive potential of the enemy in the rear. In general, the Russian invaders lost 1,440 people last day. Ukrainian soldiers also destroyed 4 tanks, 23 armored combat vehicles, 39 artillery systems, 73 operational-tactical UAVs, 100 vehicles and a unit of special equipment. As reported by ArmyInform, more than 1,400 soldiers and almost 40 guns voroga-genshtab-zsu/->made up the losses of the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/syly-oborony-vidbyly-174-vorozhi-ataky-za-dobu-genshtab-zsu/	2024-10-26T23:28:22-07:00

The video of the battle was published on the channel of the Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi. Aerial reconnaissance of the 3rd mechanized battalion detected the accumulation and advancement of the enemy column in time. The enemy used a total of several dozen pieces of equipment: tanks with trawls, armored personnel carriers and BMPs with infantry. -Thanks to the prompt response, the joint efforts of our units: 3 mechanized battalions, 1 special purpose company, as well as operators of the 194th pontoon-bridge brigade of the State Special Transport Service managed to hit about 20 pieces of equipment. The number of liquidated infantry is difficult to count,- the brigade commented on the video. Several interesting moments of the battle can be noted. So at 0:17 you can see how the occupiers opened the landing compartment to meet our drone. Russian armored vehicles were encased as much as possible in the additional armor of grill screens, but this did not prevent the drones of the Bulava nf -Chimera- units from successfully hitting a large number of enemy combat vehicles. During the offensive test, the Russians tried to move exclusively along the tracks from the tracks of the cars that had passed earlier. The reason for this caution, most likely, is the large minefields created by the Defense Forces in this direction. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 2nd mechanized battalion of the Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky destroyed an assault group of Russians that tried to approach our positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/goryt-palaye-tehnika-vorozha-ponad-20-odynycz-vidbyttya-velykogo-rosijskogo-shturmu-bilya-vugledaru/	2024-10-26T23:21:17-07:00

Then they suppressed them with cluster and high-explosive munitions, and combat vehicles landed assault groups that cleared the area.

Maly and Minion cleaned up the positions they had recaptured from the Russians. The minion threw a grenade into the Russian dugout and ran across its roof. The ammunition ignited from the explosion. Suddenly, they heard a shout from the dugout: -Yours!-. However, the Russian occupier with the call sign -Georgian- turned out to be -his-. He almost burned, was slightly wounded and begged not to be killed. Later it turned out that he had been hiding in this dugout for more than a month - it was deadly dangerous to go back, as well as forward. The Georgian survived the FPV strike and hid from our troops, who managed to enter these positions earlier. In particular, Little and Minion were able to take trophies from there: weapons, walkie-talkies and a helmet with the inscription -Georgian-. But her owner managed to remain unnoticed at that time, and he met with the Ukrainian soldiers much later. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the 93rd mechanized brigade -Cold Ravine- were able to track down and hit the Russian Lancet kamikaze drone, which was flying to strike at our equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/ponad-misyacz-hovavsya-u-blindazhi-boyavsya-i-svoyih-i-nashyh-rosijskyj-polonenyj-z-pozyvnym-gruzyn-perezhyv-pozhezhu-ta-udar-fpv/	2024-10-26T22:31:10-07:00

The Russian occupiers are most active in the areas of Vozdvizhenka, Myrolyubivka, Promenya, Lysivka, Krutoy Yar, Krasnoy Yar, Mykolaivka, and Selidovoy. In total, Ukrainian defenders have already repelled 36 attacks in the direction, four more clashes are ongoing. The situation is difficult, but controlled by the Defense Forces.

The Kursk operation: will it be able to change the course of the war. Expert opinion	-It turned out that their all-powerful intelligence could not see such a large-scale operation. And this is a large-scale corps-level operation. No less. Why corps level? Because the forces and means that are concentrated there, up to 50 thousand people, this is exactly what a corps is. Second moment. It turns out that a non-nuclear country can launch a conventional military strike against a nuclear country and a nuclear apocalypse does not occur. True, this is not the only case in history. Argentina also struck a nuclear country in 1982 during the Falklands War. Here it is necessary to emphasize very correctly that this is not the only precedent. What tasks in the interests of Ukraine continues to be performed by the Kursk operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine? The operation in Kurshchyna focuses on itself a part of Russian reserves, which the Kremlin cannot use to strengthen its offensive in Ukraine. Indeed, the Russians have attracted a considerable amount of forces and resources there, primarily from the Pokrovsky direction. As we can see, as a result, their offensive stalled there. Second, the exchange fund is replenished with Russian prisoners of war, and this is also no less important. Putin is no longer the -security guarantor- of Russia. The Ukrainian offensive undermines the image of the Russian dictator. I think the Kursk region is important in the future as a possible exchange fund for territories. Why not? It's quite a working tool. Conditionally, we are changing the Kursk bridgehead to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Waiting for precipitation is literally several weeks, a month. The weather will make it impossible for the enemy's heavy equipment to pass. And then it will be time for a counter-battery. The defense forces of Ukraine will suppress and destroy the artillery of the Russian invaders. In this aspect, we are head and shoulders above the Rashists. In recent months alone, more than 18,000 different enemy artillery systems have been destroyed (damaged). We have simply unique American counter-battery systems AN/TPQ- 36, 48, 50. The German COBRA radar system, which at a distance of up to 100 km is capable of detecting and classifying up to 40 units of artillery systems in two minutes. This accuracy is a very important component. This is exactly the phenomenon of this war: we outplay the Russians in quality, not quantity in the counter-battery fight. Of course, time will tell how it will be in reality. In my personal opinion, we should strengthen our (military-diplomatic - ed.) positions for the summer of 2025. The next cycle of dry weather could see a fundamental upheaval in this war. It is important that it is in our favor.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/kurska-operacziya-chy-zmozhe-zminyty-hid-vijny-dumka-eksperta/	2024-10-26T22:00:56-07:00
The war of drones in the Black Sea and the failure of special operations of the Russian Federation: ...	However, the use of mine weapons in the Russian-Ukrainian war will enter a new page in the history of mine warfare at sea. After all, mine weapons have never before been used as a means of modern robotic warfare. This happened for the first time and it was done by Ukrainians. About the specifics of mine warfare in the Black Sea, the loss of Russian control over the sea area, the destruction of enemy ships, the strengthening of the anti-mine capabilities of our Navy, ArmiyaInform told a candidate of military sciences, captain of the 1st rank in retired Stepan Yakymyak: -Mine weapons during the repulse of a large-scale invasion of Russian troops into Ukraine became a cementing element of the anti-landing defense of the sea coast of Ukraine in the Black Sea. On the eve of the invasion, the Russians increased the landing capabilities of the Black Sea Fleet with six more large landing ships from the Northern and Baltic Fleets. The enemy had a firm intention to capture Odesa and Mykolayiv Oblast, the loss of which could lead to the enemy's capture of Ukraine from the south. However, defensive anti-landing sea mine barriers were created in advance and officially declared by Ukraine to be prohibited for navigation seven coastal areas became a barrier for groups of enemy forces. Thus, having complete superiority in the air and at sea in the first days, the enemy clearly understood that he could not overcome this obstacle , because for this it was necessary to destroy coastal artillery and spend considerable time searching for and destroying sea mines. However, as it turned out, this was only the beginning of this new mine warfare at sea. The next stage of mine warfare was the use of rf drifting sea mines on the surface. The enemy did this purposefully to stop international shipping, compromise Ukraine in the eyes of its partners, and exert psychological pressure on the crews of civilian ships. In violation of the norms of International Maritime Law, in particular the Hague Convention of 1907, the Muscovite military leadership created a threat to shipping uncontrolled use of mine weapons. Acting according to the techniques of information struggle, the enemy in the person of the captain of the port of Sochi, who is an official representative of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, on March 18, 2022, distributed an -interesting- letter under the number 348/0162. It states that there is a mine threat in the southwestern and northwestern parts of the Black Sea due to the fact that, as a result of the storms, about -420 UM and YRM mines- installed by the -Ukrainian Navy on the approaches to the ports of Odesa, Ochakiv, Chornomorsk, Pivdenny-. But this message turned out to be more than just misinformation. Drifting mines do appear throughout the water area of ​​the southwestern part of the Black Sea, and more precisely in the maritime space of coastal states: March 26, 2022 - in the Turkish Bosphorus, March 28 - off the coast of Turkey and Romania, April 6 - off the coast of Turkey, 31 July and December 10, 2022, August 13, 2023 – in Romanian waters. It was no longer an information war, but a real threat to the lives of the crew members of ships flying the flags of various countries that carried out non-military transportation in the Black Sea and the waters of non-belligerent states. However, the Russian Federation did not succeed in compromising Ukraine in the eyes of its partners. True information was provided, which dispelled the myths of misinformation. Already on March 29, 2022 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine distributed a statement regarding the illegal activities of the Russian Federation in the Black Sea. On the other hand, the international community faced the problem of ensuring the safety of shipping and bringing the Russian Federation to criminal legal responsibility for crimes at sea. On the part of the Russian Federation, it was a real, well thought out, but ineffectively conducted special operation with the use of mine weapons. The next and again unprecedented step of the Russian Federation in violating the norms of international law was the mining of the areas near the mouth of the Danube River and the Snake Island. That is, on the shipping lanes of the -grain corridor- created by Ukraine after the refusal of the Russian Federation to implement the agreement on the Black Sea Grain Initiative. This corridor was also used as a humanitarian one for the withdrawal of foreign ships that were blocked in Ukrainian ports as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Without the possibility of attracting surface ships and submarines to lay mines in these areas, in early autumn 2023 2018, the Muscovites attempted to drop mine-explosive devices by bomber aircraft from what seemed to them to be a safe border at the time. That is, the planes carried out mortars without entering the damage zone of air defense equipment deployed on the Ukrainian coast. From the very beginning, the insidious plan of the enemy was almost immediately discovered by the Ukrainian military sailors. Understanding the enemy's intentions, they observed the laying of mines by the enemy's aircraft and destroyed the mines in the sea. Finally, on December 5, 2023, the enemy's actions to mine the areas of the -grain corridor- by aircraft were stopped. Air defense forces shot down an enemy Su-24 aircraft that was trying to drop mines. The enemy realized that it had become dangerous here and refused to continue this operation. The successful defense of the -grain corridor- by the Defense Forces of Ukraine during the first four months created the conditions for the export by sea of ​​seven million tons cargo. From August 8 to the beginning of December 2023, 200 ships left the ports of Odessa and 226 entered. The mine countermeasures of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine played an important role in this. ships under the flags of foreign states. Only from September to December 2023, 5 ships under the flags of Togo, Turkey, Liberia and Panama were blown up by mines. For example, the bulk carrier Vyssos under the flag of Panama, which was heading to one of the Danube ports to load grain, was blown up by a mine in Ukrainian waters. The ship lost speed and control, a fire broke out on the upper deck. Two sailors were injured. Unfortunately, the list of bombings of civilian ships under the flags of foreign states that did not participate in the war in the Black Sea is not exhaustive. There were other cases and, in the end, the war continues... However, the purpose of the enemy's actions was not achieved. The export of grain and other cargo from Ukrainian ports through the -grain corridor- successfully continued. In October 2023, as a result of a covert operation to lay sea mines by the forces of the Armed Forces Navy of Ukraine and SBU with the use of unmanned sea systems during the external raid of Sevastopol, four Russian warships were hit. In the course of this unique operation, modernized sea unmanned vehicles of the type Sea Baby was exposed to at least 15 sea mines, each weighing about 180 kg. Preparation lasted at least one and a half months, in particular, during this time, the maneuvering routes of Russian warships on the external raid of Sevastopol were monitored. The entrance to the internal raid of Sevastopol (to the Sevastopol bay) was at that time tightly protected by the enemy with booms and other barriers, which made it difficult for unmanned vehicles to penetrate the ships in the bay. As you know, the laying of mines lasted several weeks, in total the devices traveled more than 3,000 miles to their staging areas and back. During one of the outings at sea, the unmanned device was discovered by three Raptor-class patrol boats. That is why it struck a grenade launcher (our unmanned aircraft is equipped with a grenade launcher &#8211; ed.) at Russian boats, as a result of which one of the enemy boats was damaged. However, the enemy failed to detect the placement of mines exposed mine barriers and after that the events on the external raid of Sevastopol became more and more interesting and fun every day. Yes, on October 11 2023, the patrol ship -Derzhavin- was blown up while moving to the Sevastopol base (the starboard side was probably damaged); Two days later the same ship blew up again while trying to move to another base for repairs. On the same day, a tugboat that was going to help -Derzhavin- was also blown up by a mine. And a few days later, in the same area during mine countermeasures, one of the two newest project 12770 mine countermeasure ships in the Russian Navy was blown up. Preliminary analysis of the events and consequences of this operation testified that marine robotic systems significantly change the nature of actions at sea. It is possible that only the insufficient amount of explosive substance in the exposed sea mines did not allow to achieve the maximum result and ensure the complete destruction of the ships. However, and this is the most important, what effect did this operation have on the nature of the enemy's actions in the war at sea? Some time after this operation, it can be argued that it became one of the main factors in the loss of Russian control over the approach areas to the main naval base. And also the withdrawal of the main forces from it, including ships with the Kalibr missile complex and amphibious assault ships, to the bases in the eastern part of the Black Sea.- . After all, the available forces are not sufficient. Currently, the Ukrainian fleet has limited capabilities to deal with mine hazards at sea. After the loss of a significant number of warships under the conditions of Russia's occupation of Crimea, including a number of anti-mine ships, the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine had only the project 1258 raid minesweeper -Genichesk- in its composition. But in June 2022, it became known about his death under enemy strikes. Thanks to the measures taken and the provision of military-technical assistance by partners, the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine currently carries out mine action primarily to ensure the defense of forces at base points and protection of civil shipping. It is about ensuring the functioning of the -grain corridor-, preventing the detonation of civilian ships by mines in ports and during sea crossings. Are these forces sufficient? Certainly not. After all, the spectrum of anti-mine tasks is very wide. Currently, only the main tasks are partially performed. Currently, one of the most important sources of development of anti-mine capabilities is the Coalition of maritime capabilities, which was created on December 11, 2023 at the initiative of Great Britain together with Norway. Several other states joined the Coalition. The surface forces of the fleet already include two anti-mine ships - minesweepers of the Sandown type with the names -Chernigiv- and -Cherkasy-. They were transferred to Ukraine in 2023 by Great Britain in accordance with the agreement of January 2022. However, due to the effect of the Montreux Convention, they cannot be sent to the Black Sea at the moment, so they are in Great Britain and are involved in joint exercises. In addition, two more anti-mine ships - mine hunters from the Netherlands are expected to be transferred to the Ukrainian fleet (approximately in 2025). It is likely that these will be ships of the Alkmaar type. The main anti-mine armament of these ships is a hydroacoustic minesweeping station and underwater vehicles of the PAP104 type. Considering the capabilities of the anti-mine forces, it should be noted that the mine anti-complexes Seafox Atlas and Remus 100 include modern underwater vehicles that have high search capabilities. At the same time, it is known that the Ukrainian Navy can also use some other complexes to search for mines, in particular, German-made sonar stations of the Cerberus Mod 2 type, purchased in 2019.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/vijna-droniv-v-chornomu-mori-ta-proval-speczoperaczij-rf-shho-vpershe-zrobleno-same-ukrayinczyamy/	2024-10-26T21:44:14-07:00
The one that is loaded with missiles: Turkey is building its first air defense destroyer	How claimed on the official website of ASFAT (Askeri Fabrika ve Tersane İşletme AŞ, Administration of Military Factories and Shipyards), a subsidiary of the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of Turkey, the first domestic destroyer of the TF-2000 series, which was developed by the Project Bureau of the Military Command naval forces and the construction of which was decided to start at the meeting of the Defense Industry Executive Committee (SSİK), will be laid at the Istanbul Shipyard under the leadership of the main contractor ASFAT, ArmiyaInform reports. Actually speaking, the need for such vessels was announced by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan two years ago. -Turkey intends to strengthen the power of its navy&# 8230; With the help of the TF-2000 destroyer with an air defense system, the construction of which will begin at the Istanbul shipyard, we will gradually provide air defense of our country from the sea - emphasized Turkish leader. How notes the Turkish portal MarineDeal, the TF-2000 HSHM will have the basic functional capability of using the sea as a shield to detect guided missiles short/medium/long-range missiles and ballistic missiles at low/medium/high altitudes and destroy them before they approach the mainland (except for ballistic missiles). The functionality of the future watercraft should include the ability to air defense (HSH), anti-submarine (DSH) and surface (S/S) long-range warfare. At the same time, it will receive the means and capabilities to effectively perform the tasks of non-combat operations, such as peacekeeping, evacuation of non-combatants, countering manifestations of international terrorism, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and maritime control operations. Tactical requirements - the technical characteristics of the destroyer of the TF-2000 series are put forward as follows: &#8211; a maximum speed of at least 28 knots, a range of at least 5,000 nautical miles at a speed of 18 knots and an average duration of operation of 5,000 hours per year; &#8211; unlimited operational capability in sea conditions up to 5 points (on a nine-point sea roughness scale), which is defined by international standards as -Significant roughness-; &#8211; the ability to carry out operations for at least 45 days without integrating logistics (except for refueling); &#8211; the ability to work autonomously for 180 days without entering home bases; &#8211; service life of at least 40 years; &#8211; availability of system programs to reduce the radar cross section (RCA), underwater acoustic, magnetic and infrared (I/R) signatures; &#8211; must be designed according to the main design features, such as the durable structure of the hull structure within the framework of high survivability. The destroyer TF-2000 HSH, which will have an overall length of 149 m, a beam of 21.3 m, a draft of 5.75 m and a displacement of 8,300 tons, will be equipped with a main propulsion plant in the CODOG configuration consisting of two LM2500 gas turbines and two diesel engines. TF-2000 will use various missiles developed in Turkey. Air defense missiles will consist of HİSAR-D (medium range), SAPAN B1/B2 (actual performance not released, possibly medium range), SİPER Block 1D and SİPER Block 2D (100+ km and 150+ km). At the same time, missiles of the -surface-to-surface- class - ATMACA anti-ship missile and GEZGİN long-range cruise missiles will be placed with a vertical (mine) launch option. An effective long-range anti-aircraft defense system created under with the help of a multi-purpose radar with a phased array (ÇAFRAD). The destroyer will be equipped with an Airborne Long Range Radar (UMR) that can produce aerial images from a minimum range of 200 miles and work with an integrated IFF system that allows for three-dimensional surveillance of enemy aircraft and the detection of modern G/Ms. The ship will have an integrated hydroacoustic system (Sonar Suit) for anti-aircraft defense purposes, an anti-torpedo protection system and a torpedo system against underwater targets. The TF-2000 HSHM ship will be able to land 2 medium cargo transport helicopters with a maximum take-off weight of less than 15 tons and 2 shipborne unmanned aerial vehicles (GIAVs) with fixed or rotary wings for reconnaissance/attack missions. For this, a fixed platform and a hangar, an arsenal of spare weapons and the possibility of fuel supply will be available. It will have level 1 certification, which allows working in meteorological conditions by instruments day and night. As the main material of the hull and superstructures, it is planned to use high-strength shipbuilding steel of domestic production. Aluminum material will be used in the superstructures of the deck superstructures to reduce weight as much as the strength requirements will allow. It is stated that the ship will have living space and a service area for at least 200 people. It is especially emphasized that during the construction of the first destroyer of the TF-2000 HSHM series, a high level of localization will be achieved: thanks to the planning of the level of localization, that is, the confirmation of the production of elements of the future ship on the territory of Turkey. In this particular project, at 85% in the elements of its design and armament, the ship should demonstrate the growing capabilities of the Republic of Turkey in the defense industry.

Fake stories about the deportation of Ukrainians from EU countries: why is it an enemy?	How to experts of the StopFake project explained, in fact, this incident was not about evasion of mobilization, but about deportation due to violation of Polish laws, but rather suspicions of assisting illegal migration. Official sources do not confirm allegations of mobilization reasons for deportation. The spread of fakes about the deportation of Ukrainians from EU countries, in particular Poland, is part of the disinformation campaign of Russian propaganda. Previously, they actively distributed a fake letter on behalf of the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine (in 2020-2024) Dmytro Kuleba. In it, he allegedly asked Poland to deport -all men to be sent to the front- from the country. Agitprop also falsely wrote that Ukrainian diplomats sent similar letters to Latvia and Lithuania. But to date, no EU government has introduced a policy of returning Ukrainian citizens through mobilization. European Commissioner for Internal Affairs Ylva Johansson said that the deportation of Ukrainians of conscription age contradicts the Directive on temporary protection, which regulates the status of refugees in the EU.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/fejkovkydy-pro-deportacziyu-ukrayincziv-iz-krayin-yes-navishho-cze-vorogu/	2024-10-26T21:15:49-07:00

Hit 11 targets on the first shift: how a skiff truck driver became an FPV pilot	The fighter himself says with a modest smile that in his peaceful life he rode around Europe behind the wheel of a truck, and never imagined himself a pilot. Yes, he picked up a soldering iron already in the army. He planned to do programming, but he didn't have time to study seriously - a large-scale invasion began. After joining the Armed Forces, the boy was a driver who rotates positions, and was a -zampotech-, the commander of an anti-tank platoon. Even at the beginning of 2023, he was critical of FPV, because it seemed something incomprehensible, but already in the fall he stopped enemy attacks as a drone operator. — We had a commander who gave a push. I was assigned the task of selecting and training pilots from the anti-tank platoon. At first, I dealt with purely organizational issues: the training schedule on the simulator, I looked at who has the talent and who does not want to do it. Then we bought our first -tiny whoop- (tiny whoop - a small FPV drone. - Ed.) - training drones, - recalls Skif. At first, all training took place in the unit. After 30 hours in the simulator, the fighters were allowed to practice on small drones in the hangar, where an obstacle course was set up. Then the pilot trained in the field already on working UAVs. Only after 20 successful drops on an improvised target was he admitted to combat duty. — Not all stages went smoothly. You know that feeling, as if you are running, and someone pulls you back by your T-shirt. And at some point he lets go. The dialogue with the new commander was decisive for us. A question of approximately the following content was sounded: what is necessary for it to fly? And we said in one voice: -do not disturb.- In response: -understood, accepted.- And we started going to study with experienced pilots and engineers in other units, to learn from experience, - says the guy. The next stage was solving the issue of supplying drones, components, and explosives. And that was a turning point. Comrade -Scyph- from a peaceful life was engaged in volunteering and helped to close the requests of the unit. - I called him, I said that it is not possible to kill p..v something as a humanitarian, we have a more interesting topic - FPV. He started ordering us drones. I got to know the engineer who assembled them, they started working together. I took on the search for components and financing. We were in constant communication about the nuances: how it should be done for effective application. They found a middle ground — and for the drone to fly with a load, and for the funds to be raised, -Skif- recalls. Actually, this was the birth of the -Wild Hornets- project, which developed from a collection of -from what God will send- before the release of unified series. Now a party with the same components does not require a lot of effort from the settings. The -Queen of the Hornets- was born out of this communication. And the unit, after the tactics of accurate airdrops in conditions of shortage of means, got the opportunity to effectively repulse assaults with dozens of FPV-kamikazes. The moment came when -Skif- switched from organizational work to practice. He remembered his first combat duty forever. — Of course, I worried and checked several times to make sure everything was working. On September 26, we entered, the next day an experienced pilot left, and on the 28th at 4 a.m. mass artillery training began. They followed her. He was in the air almost continuously until 4 p.m. Used more than 25 drones. 11 lesions. Two tanks and two BMPs were burned, the rest were seriously damaged. The equipment that managed to leave the battlefield fled without a landing party, which simply flew apart from the armor under the blows of drones. The enemy was stopped 5-7 km from our positions, - says the soldier. you have to be ready, as if tomorrow in any case p..ts-. - From 11 in the evening until 2 in the morning I could personally check each drone, that it is armed, that there is a video. A minimum of 15 drones, which I am completely confident is the best calming. I well understand the value of time when you are messing around and tanks are shooting at your brothers. We trained with a calculation so that from the moment of decision making to the direct take-off there was no more than a minute. In a clear interaction and sequence. In order to avoid the situation when the drone is turned on, the charge is raised, and the pilot is sitting in the trench, and he has no picture, says the military man. He calls the sense of responsibility and the ability to make decisions quickly on the spot essential components of effective work . — There is my sector. When I see that the enemy roll begins, I do not wait for coordination. I'm already in the air. Here you already feel the seconds. 30 seconds — and the tank drove by. If you are the first to intercept the movement and take off, then you will be in time before he starts working on ours with direct fire. The guys in the trenches don't call the headquarters with questions: -can I go with an RPG, because we have a tank advantage here?-. We are talking about the fact that the enemy has a numerical advantage and fights according to the anthill principle we have to invent the same insecticide, the technological advantages that will allow quality to stop quantity. And save human lives. -Skif- dreams of drones with machine guns and grenade launchers surrounding enemy groups breaking through to our positions. - During my work as a driver, I saw those who leave the battle, who are carried away. He took out the wounded. In my experience, the picture of active combat operations from the stream is superimposed, and in my head there is always the question of how to make part of the tasks of stormtroopers in close combat performed by drones. People get exhausted, and exhausted people make mistakes. It is very difficult to keep fighting. And by the time help arrives, it may no longer be relevant. Or simply not reach. You know what I mean. And it's time. And here it's a matter of minutes. I remember that the sound of FPV in itself exerts considerable psychological pressure. -Scyth- with a smile tells how he tested it on himself when he was still studying. - If you are caught by the FPV pilot's camera and you have no cover where he can't fly, your chances are almost zero. I understand this clearly as a pilot. Others, I think, just feel instinctively. And this is a very strong fear. When we were studying, I asked my partner to fly on me. He said, I will run, and you fly almost to the end. And when he was 10–m away from me, I was filled with fear - apparently he forgot that he had to leave the trajectory, although I knew - he was flying empty. span> He felt this fear already when he became a pilot, when he had to leave on the M113 for the wounded in the gray zone. Couldn't get rid of the unpleasant feeling, as if you see yourself from above as a target. Therefore, the fighter considers the psychological factor, multiplied by the drone's ability to fire for at least three minutes, to be a significant factor in putting pressure on enemy infantry. software configuration of drones. He makes sure that the drones behave stably and do not overheat. He makes overflights himself. We laugh that dreams come true in a strange way - the division is, of course, not an IT company, but probably the best option where -to be right now, while having the opportunity to perform creative tasks.- — After I am being flown by a pilot who will work with them to immediately deal with the issues that arise. Brings, says, there is such and such a problem, I solve it on the spot. And he is already taking the equipment in which he is completely confident, says -Skyf-. Already having awards (order -For Courage- III degree and -Golden Cross-. - Ed.) and a list of confirmed injuries. He says that one question was pressing morally: no matter how cool you are in the military environment, for the system you are a line in the papers, and at any moment your experience and skills can be disregarded, handing over a conditional shovel. — In no way do I devalue the work of an anti-tanker or a driver, I did it myself. But let's talk about efficiency. With the help of these means, we have been preventing the enemy from advancing in our area for a long time. I think this should be taken into account. When you interview for an IT company, the determining factor is not your diplomas, but how you cope with a technical task. If you are able to solve problems, you are needed. If you can only speak and show a folder with papers, it is not about competence. Efficiency is when there is a real result. The unit began to receive batches of drones from the state a little more than six months ago. -Scyth- believes that it is better that certain latest developments become known only when they appear on the battlefield, in the form of an unpleasant surprise, but the realities are different. — Of course, it is better when something from is already in working form and in working volumes. But there is a nuance. Censorship in this area is understandable and necessary when it comes to the development of government defense agencies. And when the necessary means are made by developers who survive at the expense of donations, it will not work like that. In general, part of our work resembles a reality show. The best series means more money for funds for the next series. When I hear criticism that the enemy sees and zooms in, I remind you that every video is followed by a call to your own - do it, zoom in - says Skift. The fighter has feelings for the drones assembled -in the kitchen- complex -Skif- advises those who want to help, to contact a specific division, with engineers and ask how best. The ideal option is to purchase something ready and tested, with which they already work. The manufacturer must test the drone under the load and action of a serious REB, civilians rarely have this opportunity. — When people decide to organize a drone from a school or club, they should understand that it will mostly be a talisman, not a weapon. I hung it on the wall and look at it with gratitude, like a picture. In order for me to put the pilots in position for combat use of the drone, there must be professional soldering, it must be configured and tested. My heart bleeds when I receive 28 drones that someone has assembled, spent money on, but are essentially spare parts. the development of people with combat experience. - Maybe it's naive, but it seems to me that the one who repelled more than one assault, who took more than one drone in his hands, which turns over at you on takeoff, and the charge is raised , will have a high level of responsibility. Part of the work of engineers is still related to self-made BC or intervention in staff, and this applies to all such units. — There is a question of constant improvement: we still have a lot of things to solve, roughly speaking, screed, chewing gum, scotch tape and glue. The current form of initiation fees is a temporary solution. It must be finished. And not taking out a check every time to think that your life depends on how responsible the person who made it is. Finally, let's talk about fatigue, supports and motivation. Painful points and vision of the future. — There are difficult experiences. A certain disappointment related to how it was in the first days of the invasion and what processes are currently taking place in society. In the army next to me, I see people who stick to principles, brotherhood, when the unit has the opportunity to work and develop. But we know and have observed different stories. There are fewer of us, and those who come now often have a problem with motivation. How to solve it? Much is determined by our dependence on the close connection of the human level and the level of technology. Drones can be configured on site, and the people who are responsible for making decisions cannot be asked. If one is driven by false and dangerous narratives and is not held accountable for the consequences of one's actions while in high office, it undermines the overall ability to resist the enemy. Speaking of our direction, there must be people in leadership positions in this field , in which the eyes will burn, which are understood in the technical part. In particular, I was lucky with this. I know what it's like when they speak the same language to you, and a conversation solves a problem that used to take weeks. It adds motivation. What else adds motivation? When there is support, when there is no pressure on you. You cannot be constantly pinned down from two sides, when on one side is the enemy, and on the other - your own. In the army, they often want everything here and at once. When we were still studying and some things were not perfect, excessive pressure sometimes became the reason why some refused to train. We have not yet revealed our full potential, the direction will develop. And it will enter all spheres of life. Perhaps, if we imagine the end of the war optimistically, I will work with these technologies, there will be an expansion of production and exports, - says the fighter and, pausing, he looks into my eyes with that deep look familiar to all of us, as if ashamed of his directness, and adds: - But maybe first I want to live on a deserted island. Too much painful and difficult accumulated inside. While saying goodbye to -Scythia-, I thought about the fact that for a state that strives to endure and survive, it is important to make sure that its brave and sincere defenders see here not only a difficult the battle path behind, but also the future, where there is a place for development, self-improvement and creativity.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/26/na-pershomu-cherguvanni-vrazyv-11-czilej-yak-vodij-fury-skif-stav-pilotom-fpv/	2024-10-25T21:09:22-07:00

The BRICS summit: what Moscow wanted to -extract-	As of autumn 2024, BRICS members, in addition to the founding countries, also include Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. Several other developing countries have expressed interest in joining this coalition. On October 22-24, the 16th BRICS summit was held in the Russian city of Kazan. About how this event will affect the situation in the world, what Moscow wanted to -push- and whether it succeeded, Oleksandr Chupak, an expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Studies-, tells: -According to the Kremlin's statements, more than 20 heads of state attended the BRICS summit +, which took place in Kazan, Russia. This was the main goal of Vladimir Putin: to show that his -empire- is not isolated from the world, but on the contrary enjoys the support of great powers that form an alternative to the American-centric order. However, BRICS in general has never set itself the goal of confronting the West. As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently said, -BRICS is not anti-Western; it is simply different from the West.- Putin's attempts to pit the summit against his enemies are resonating, perhaps only with his Chinese and Iranian partners. The rest, led by India and Brazil, see their priority as balancing between global centers of influence for maximum economic benefit. Several issues were put on the agenda of the current summit, in the resolution of which Moscow is directly interested: on October 23, the final declaration of the BRICS summit was made public, which did not meet the Kremlin's expectations. In particular, with regard to Ukraine, the participants only recalled the national positions of their countries and testified to their commitment to the goals and principles of the UN Charter, as well as to peaceful settlement and diplomacy. Putin apparently failed to impose his neo-imperialist views on the BRICS member states and secure their unanimous support in the aggression against Ukraine. Therefore, Moscow's hopes that BRICS would become a tool for dividing the international community have once again not come true. Oleksandr Chupak explains: -Despite Moscow's desire to strengthen its military and political positions, BRICS continues to be a club of economic interests. India, South Africa, Brazil and others will not go to a direct confrontation with the US, because it will result in significant losses for them. However, Washington should react much more actively to the economic support of the aggressor, for example, from India, which in two years became one of the two largest sales markets for Russian oil. The visit of the President of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping, who apparently has nothing against deepening relations between the Russians and the DPRK, is worthy of attention. It is worth saying that this is only his third trip abroad after the lifting of coronavirus restrictions; two of them were in Russia, and one more in the USA. If Xi goes somewhere, it's only when it's really important.- The biggest surprise was the visit to the summit of UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who, as is known, refused to go to the Global Peace Summit organized by Ukraine and Switzerland in June. There is a version that Guterres came to Kazan not to Putin, but to Xi. After all, over the decade, the United States has greatly lost its position in the UN, and China has bought up all available positions there. Guterres is considered a pro-China general secretary who, under the guise of -globalization-, trivially promotes the Chinese agenda. That is why he has such rhetoric and such actions. But it is sad that by these actions he is improving the status of Putin in the international arena&#8230; -Putin has achieved his goal by showing that he is not isolated and is not afraid of a long struggle against the West. The BRICS summit should become another lesson of missed opportunities for our partners: they do not work enough with countries that could be realistically kept in their sphere of influence. Europe, the USA and others can offer Brazilians, Indians and companies much more than economically backward Russia or the same China. However, the BRICS summit perfectly fits into the general trend of indecision and weakness of the Western world,- Oleksandr Chupak believes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/26/samit-briks-shho-hotila-protyagnuty-moskva/	2024-10-25T21:03:24-07:00
What is the feature of the 199th training center of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine:...	ArmyInform was told by the head of the Airborne Assault Troops 199 Training Center of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Lt. Col. Oleksiy Gerasimchuk. -One of the key areas of work of our Training Center is basic combined military training for the mobilized. We train scouts, mechanic drivers, snipers, gunners, machine gunners, combat medics, etc. This is professional training. In the center, we conduct combined training of sergeants — department commanders, in particular, at different levels from units and units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We are preparing the non-commissioned staff to replace the positions of the officer staff. We train the mobilized for real combat operations: we polish the skills of defenders in owning personal weapons, in fire training, we teach tactics and tactics in defense and attack, assault operations, the order of movement on the battlefield, work in a combat group (department), local orientation, etc. Anything that will help save lives in war. Instructors work with the mobilized from the morning until the very evening. The terms of training for professional training in different specialties are different. It all depends on the specifics of the profession to be mastered or the type of weapon mastery. In the training programs, we take into account the experience of conducting military operations, the tactics of the enemy, the use of the latest types of weapons and military equipment of both domestic and foreign production. No less important is the psychological preparation of the mobilized. And it's not just passing an obstacle course - we add a run-in with a tank. A person must be morally prepared for war and better adapted. Military personnel should not feel the transition between, in fact, training and combat operations. This is our goal. I will not reveal the secret that with well-trained soldiers it is much easier and faster to carry out combat coordination of a platoon, company, battalion, brigade than with untrained ones. Look, there are no fixed things in preparation, just like there are no fixed things in combat. We must be guided by the principle: a trained soldier is a saved life on the front line. Therefore, we are analyzing combat actions both from our side and the actions of the Russian Army. We learn from the enemy's mistakes, so to speak. We are looking for countermeasures at every step of the enemy. Of course, the exchange of experience with foreign partners is important. Our instructor-teaching staff has extensive combat experience. In addition, instructors regularly go to the front for combat missions. There they see what's new in the battle, what trends are currently relevant. Plus, they were trained abroad: in Germany, France, Lithuania, Spain and other countries, so they know the -motherland- very well. The constant exchange of experience with the commanders of units of various branches, parts and units of the DSHV helps. The combat experience gained in battles with the enemy and its introduction into the educational process as soon as possible is our main task today. Flexibility is important. The golden mean, unfortunately, is difficult to find. The combat is very dynamic and fast-paced. It is necessary to adapt everything to modern realities. So practice and practice again. Training programs should help our paratroopers on the battlefield not only to survive, but also to successfully destroy the enemy with all types of weapons. The advantage in the battle lies in those who quickly used technological weapons and adapted their strategy to it. This is a key moment in the Russian-Ukrainian war. The course of hostilities and their results depend on this direction. The main thing is the ability to do as much damage as possible to the invaders, destroy the enemy, disable his equipment and weapons, while saving the lives of our paratroopers. In this context, drones have become an integral part of the modern military arsenal. At us, almost every lesson takes place with the use of FPV drones, drones of various types. In addition, we actively use electronic resources. As it happens on the battlefield: if the enemy jams one frequency, we switch to another. This is, so to speak, a kind of technology race. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, Ukraine has received dozens of types of various weapons and military equipment from the Allies. No army of the world in history has ever had such a -zoo- of the most diverse equipment and weapons. Students master both small arms (machine guns, machine guns and grenade launchers of various models), and more complex weapons systems (anti-tank missile systems of various types, etc.). For example, paratroopers train to destroy the enemy with American heavy-caliber Browning M2 machine guns. This machine gun is effective against infantry, unarmored and lightly armored vehicles, fortifications, and helicopters at low altitudes. Regarding armored vehicles. Gunners and driver mechanics are trained on combat vehicles such as Stryker, Marder, etc. The DSHV units are armed with the British Challenger 2 tank. It has excellent maneuverability, maneuverability, firepower and ease of control. But this tank must first be thoroughly mastered, its technical characteristics should be studied. Next, in practice, check its maneuverability, maneuverability and combat capabilities to destroy targets. This all requires scrupulous preparation. A person who comes here for the first time from civilian life cannot help but make mistakes, so we repeat it several times to remember all the details. We polish actions to automaticity. There are many fears in society about mobilization. One of the reasons is the lack of proper training before sending the unit to the front. This myth needs to be dispelled. Preparation is underway, and it is of high quality. Of course, we would like to increase the number of study hours in different subjects, because better training requires time and even more practical training. As far as I know, according to the decision of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, it is already planned to increase the duration of basic general military training from one to one and a half months. Therefore, in the end, I will turn to those who are still thinking or hesitating: you should not wait for the enemy to come with -Russian peace- to your home and kill you. Learn and be prepared for resistance. It is necessary to finally knock out the occupiers from our territory&#8230;&#8221;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/26/u-chomu-fishka-199-navchalnogo-czentru-dshv-zsu-armiyainform-diznalas-yak-i-chogo-navchayut-mobilizovanyh/	2024-10-25T20:51:23-07:00
Can work without operators: a new drone with artificial intelligence was presented in the USA	The goal of the new Bolt-M drone, presented by the American company Anduril, is to reduce the demands on operators and provide more information than traditional first-person attack drones. As the company notes, Bolt-M can work without the need for specially trained operators. One of the main features of Bolt-M is its standalone software, which runs on the Anduril platformLattice. The operator can draw a bounding box on the battlefield display, set a few specifications and send the drone on its way. Thanks to artificial intelligence, Bolt-M is able to independently track moving objects and deliver precise strikes. -Once the target is identified in Lattice, the operator can specify the position that the Bolt-M should maintain, instructing the system to track the target out of visual or acoustic detection range, even if the target is moving and closing in.- When it's time to strike, the operator can determine the grip angle to ensure the most effective strike, while on-board vision and navigation algorithms support guidance even if connection with the operator is lost,- the developers say. The Bolt-M also performs reconnaissance tasks that are not available to cheaper strike drones. Anduril chief strategist Chris Brose explained that this drone helps the operator better understand the situation on the battlefield, recognize targets and, if necessary, issue commands for surveillance or damage. Brouse added that the Bolt-M is capable of detecting new variants of older weapons. Bolt-M complies with the Pentagon's principles that robotic systems should involve humans in making lethal decisions. Brouse noted that their efforts are based on the experience of the campaign in Ukraine, including feedback from Ukrainians facing Russian electronic warfare. The drone can fly according to the given GPS coordinates. However, in areas where GPS is suppressed, operators can take control and continue to control the drones, maintaining control over the target and executing previously set commands, even if communication is lost. The US Department of Defense supports ethical principles for artificial intelligence that emphasize the importance of human judgment and responsibility in the development and use of AI-based weapons. Last year, the Pentagon tried to clarify what actions are allowed, leaving the possibility to adjust the rules if circumstances change. A key lesson from the Ukrainian experience is that conditions on the battlefield can change rapidly, and different countries may have different policies regarding autonomous weapons. This underlines the need for more powerful autonomous systems as attacks on human-drone communications become increasingly effective. Anduril's Brose expects that US policy will change, and the company wants to be ready for the Pentagon's new requirements.

They want to pass off wishful thinking: the Russians -in their own way- count Ukrainian losses	The table being circulated is unreliable, and several signs indicate this. First, there is no original source. The screenshot with the table, which is spreading on the Internet, contains the name of a Russian propaganda Telegram channel, but even there the source is not mentioned, only it is indicated - -according to Western estimates.- The error table itself states in English that this data is an estimate based on -numerous sources of information-. -troops losses-, -airplanes- instead of -aircrafts-, -missed in action- instead of -missing in action-, etc. The third feature is the data itself. They are clearly made up, like the entire table. Even if we do not take into account the human losses, the data on the losses of military equipment do not stand up to any criticism. For example, the table mentions -650 aircraft lost since February 2022-. On the eve of Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine, the air fleet did not have even close to such a number of aircraft. Another example is -18,700 tanks and armored vehicles lost-. These figures are also very far from the real ones. Russian propaganda constantly raises the issue of losses during the war, and due to the fact that the real data is not revealed, the Kremlin speculates on this topic and regularly throws out fakes. Such -throwbacks- are primarily aimed at demoralizing Ukrainians and the Ukrainian army.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/26/hochut-vydaty-bazhane-za-dijsne-rosiyany-po-svoyemu-rahuyut-ukrayinski-vtraty/	2024-10-25T20:17:26-07:00

To organize sabotage, the special services of the Russian Federation remotely engaged local unemployed people who were looking for -easy- earnings in Telegram channels. However, instead of Russian funds, the perpetrators can receive life imprisonment with confiscation of property. Two residents of Fastov, aged 25 and 29, who set fire to the local office of Ukrposhta and facilities of Ukrzaliznytsia were detained in Kyiv region. The perpetrators filmed the fire on a mobile phone camera for -reporting- to the Russian curator, and then tried in vain to escape from the crime scene. In Vinnytsia, a couple was arrested -on hot pursuit- who burned two relay cabinets of signal installations that regulate traffic on important sections of Ukrzaliznytsia. The extras are two recidivists from the city of Gnivan: a 28-year-old woman who had a criminal record for forging documents, and her 29-year-old friend who previously served a sentence for theft. A 27-year-old local resident was detained in Sumy, who set fire to two relay cabinets of a railway connection and was preparing further sabotage in the regional center. All detainees were notified of suspicion under Part 2 of Art. 113 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (sabotage committed under martial law). As reported by ArmyInform, the Security Service and the National Police detained 7 people who burned military cars and facilities of Ukrzaliznytsia in Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk and Cherkasy regions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/do-zaliznyczi-dodalasya-poshta-speczsluzhby-rf-onovyly-spysok-czilej-dlya-pidpalyuvachiv/	2024-10-25T11:59:27-07:00

An ex-policeman received 15 years of well-deserved rest for a new career on the side of the Russian ...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. Prosecutors proved that an active police officer voluntarily cooperated with the enemy during the occupation of the Chkalov settlement territorial community in Chuguyiv Oblast. From the first days of March 2022, he started working in a pseudo-law enforcement agency. For this, the occupiers gave him a firearm and a car marked with the letter -Z-. The traitor tried to -form- the collective, agitating his former colleagues to cooperate with the enemy. In addition, the person involved showed the Russian military places for the best tactical and strategic location of enemy artillery and other equipment on the territory of the district in order to prevent the offensive of the Ukrainian military. He even took turns with the Russian military and L/DPR militants at checkpoints, and on his days off he brought food, water and cigarettes to the occupiers. In July 2022, the person involved was appointed -head of the criminal investigation department- in the pseudo-law enforcement agency of the occupiers in the village of Shevchenkove, Kupyan district. The -chief- supervised the activities of the department, detained local residents and interrogated them personally. And he continued to work at checkpoints in the same way. The guilty verdict was handed down by the Kyiv District Court of Poltava. The term for an appeal continues. The traitor was dismissed from the ranks of the National Police of Ukraine. Since the convicted person is still hiding from Ukrainian justice on the territory of the Russian Federation, the term of his sentence will begin to be calculated from the moment of his actual detention. As long as he avoids serving the sentence imposed by the court, the statute of limitations is suspended. Earlier ArmyInform reported that 19 members of the network that tried to disrupt the mobilization were detained.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/15-rokiv-zasluzhenogo-vidpochynku-otrymav-eks-policzejskyj-za-novu-karyeru-na-storoni-rf/	2024-10-25T10:49:49-07:00
The first villages - in Kyiv, 7 people received sentences for evading mobilization	About this reported on October 25 by the Main Directorate of the National Police in Kyiv. According to him, a resident of the Solomyan district was sentenced to 4 years in prison, and a resident of the capital's Oboloni will spend the next five years behind bars. In general, since the beginning of the year, investigators have completed the pre-trial investigation and sent indictments to the court in 26 criminal proceedings, which were investigated for the fact of evasion of the draft and registration for the military. 51 persons were notified of the suspicion. In most cases, pre-trial investigation in criminal proceedings under Art. 336, 337 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine is initiated upon notification of the Territorial Centers of Recruitment and Social Support. We would like to remind you that the current legislation stipulates liability in the form of deprivation of liberty for a period of three to five years for those conscripts who evade conscription for military service during mobilization and military registration. In addition, the violator is not removed from the military register and is subject to conscription in the future.

Moscow's partnership with the Houthis increases destabilization in the Red Sea region	Relevant information published by the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. According to the researchers, Moscow's partnership with the Yemeni Houthis may allow this radical movement to intensify its destabilizing activities in the Red Sea region. Especially if modern Russian-made long-range weapons fall into their hands. Russia is known for its ability to use crises around the world to its own advantage. From the first days of the civil war in Yemen, the Kremlin tried to demonstrate neutrality. However, the deterioration of Russia's relations with the West after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine prompted it to seek new friends to implement its anti-American plans. Iran became such an ally. At the same time, the Yemeni Houthis, a proxy of Tehran, began to be considered by Moscow as potential partners of the global anti-Western coalition. Researchers suggest that relations between Moscow and Canada can be used by the Russian Federation as a bargaining chip against Saudi Arabia. Riyadh seeks cooperation with the United States, which the Kremlin does not like very much. Russia is also trying to contrast its -friendship- with the Houthis with the possibility of the US and the West granting permission to Ukraine to use long-range weapons for strikes deep into the Russian Federation. In case of such permission, the aggressor country threatens to transfer similar weapons to potential opponents of the countries of the -free world-, in particular the -Hushi-. The Kremlin's partnership with a radical Shiite organization classified as a terrorist group by the UN Security Council is not unusual. Russia is very flexible in its definition of terrorism: it has excluded the Taliban from its own list of terrorist organizations and has maintained close ties with radical paramilitary groups around the world since Soviet times. Therefore, a shared vision of a future where the US will have less influence provides the Russians and the Houthis with sufficient basis for cooperation, even with the use of terrorist tools. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, that the shadow fleet of the Russian Federation met its biggest enemy — insurance.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/partnerstvo-moskvy-z-husytamy-posylyuye-destabilizacziyu-v-regioni-chervonogo-morya/	2024-10-25T10:40:57-07:00

FSB in the service of the UOC (MP) undercover: from prayer to information sabotage	The Security Service of Ukraine informs about this. According to the case materials, the cleric coordinated three accomplices - the so-called -polyexperts- who, while in Kyiv, massively spread Kremlin narratives. In their materials, they justified the Russian Federation's war against Ukraine and incited inter-religious hatred in our country. We will remind that in March 2024, SBU employees detained all four persons involved. Currently, the indictments against the detainees have been sent to the court. Perpetrators face life imprisonment with confiscation of property. As the investigation established, the defendants were part of one of the largest FSB intelligence networks, which has been operating in Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale war. Thanks to the prompt response of the SBU, the enemy cell was neutralized at the beginning of its subversive activities against Ukraine. A special pre-trial investigation is ongoing with regard to more than 10 members of the Russian intelligence agency, as they are hiding abroad. It was established that the accused cleric personally oversaw the distribution of anti-Ukrainian content through controlled channels in Telegram and YouTube, Facebook pages and official websites of various dioceses of the UOC (MP). Immediately after the publication of the ordered materials, they were instantly -picked up- by the central TV channels and Internet publications of the Russian Federation, which spread fakes about our state. In this way, the Rashists hoped to discredit Ukraine in the international arena, especially in front of our Western partners. On the basis of the collected evidence, the arrested persons are charged under the following articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: Previously ArmyInform reported that the soldiers of the Russian Federation are very -glad- to new comrades.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/fsb-na-sluzhbi-upcz-mp-pid-prykryttyam-vid-molytvy-do-informdyversij/	2024-10-25T09:23:49-07:00

Drones of the border guard - Ukha - are the last thing the occupier sees and hears	The story of the fighter was made public by the State Border Service of Ukraine.

-Failure crept in unnoticed-: the shadow fleet of the Russian Federation met its greatest enemy - in...	About this informs the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. In response, Great Britain plans to increase inspections of tankers with questionable insurance. In particular, they will be required to provide details of their insurance status when crossing the English Channel. The main insurance options for Russian tankers according to the research: Western insurers: before the start of the Russian-Ukrainian war, most cargoes of Russian oil tankers were insured by Western companies that are part of the -International Group of Protection Clubs and indemnity- (-International Group of Protection & Indemnity Clubs-). Insurers from the G7 countries are able to conclude insurance contracts only if there is written confirmation that Russian oil is purchased at a maximum price of $60. US per barrel; Russian insurers:after the introduction of sanctions, the number of appeals to Russian insurers by the owners of Russian -shadow fleet- vessels has increased. The main Russian companies: spat -ingosstrakh-, insurance group -alfastrakhovanie-, JSC -sogaz-. The financial guarantee for these companies is provided by the state reinsurer JSC -Российская национальная перестраховочная компания- (rnpc), which is under international sanctions; new entrants: insurance companies from Cameroon and Kyrgyzstan provided insurance coverage for at least two tankers from the -shadow fleet- each. As a result, the rejection of Western insurers and the transition to companies with a low reputation increases the risk of payment delays or non-payments in the event of accidents, oil spills, etc. This increases economic and environmental threats to European countries. At the same time, problems in the field of insurance as a result of international sanctions indicate that Russia's use of the -shadow fleet- is becoming more and more complicated. We remind you, Russian generals will be responsible for the strikes that could have caused the catastrophe in Kharkiv.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/nyeudacha-padkralas-nyezamyetna-tinovyj-flot-rf-zustriv-svogo-najbilshogo-voroga-strahuvannya/	2024-10-25T04:21:43-07:00

- The country is huge - did not stand up: why did the Russian Federation add Korean sauce to the war...	Oleksandr Musienko, head of the Center for Military Legal Research, told about this in an exclusive comment to ArmyInform. -Putin's invitations to the North Korean military show that the so-called policy of -get up a huge country- with the rise of a mass volunteer movement in Russia, voluntary mobilization of Russian society with the aim of attracting a sufficient number of soldiers to the front is not working. We see different stages of manpower recruitment in Russia. The first is the ongoing mobilization. It has a hidden character - summonses are sent out, but then the mobilized are forced to either sign a contract until the end of the so-called -svo- under duress, or buy them with payments, constantly increasing the amounts. Thus, such a category as the so-called voluntary contractors appears in Russia, but there are still not enough of them. Secondly, Russia constantly raises payments and increases the number of monetary rewards specifically for contract workers. This indicates that they have quite serious problems, because why pay more if you already have the necessary amount. Moreover, this is definitely not characteristic of the Putin regime in relation to its own population - to pay something, to take care of someone there. On the contrary, we see that Putin is angry at his own population, because they strike at their own settlements in the Kursk region, even knowing that civilians are hiding there. Possible victims among their own civilians do not stop them. There are also prisoners and, finally, mercenaries from different countries. It is obvious that Russia is faced with a lack of manpower, it is obvious that it does not have enough capabilities and resources to meet its own operational needs, to support -meat assaults- directly on the front. Therefore, Putin asks Kim Jong Un to provide appropriate assistance. This indicates that the Kremlin does not yet dare to announce any significant mobilization measures in Russia, because it is afraid that this will affect the socio-political situation and shake the existing stability of the regime. In view of this, Putin is engaging external forces. This testifies to his insecurity and the weakness of his position. At the same time, this also indicates that the enemy does not have enough strength to implement the plans he has conceived, because the Ukrainian armed forces are destroying a significant amount of the manpower of the aggressor. Another positive consequence of reports that the Russians are inviting troops from the DPRK to fight against Ukraine is the Russian Federation's loss of subjectivity on the international stage. Putin, who visited North Korea for the first time since 2000, is forced to ask for help, actually begging Kim Jong-un in the DPRK, first for shells, ammunition, and now manpower, looks humiliated. russia asks for help in north korea! Even 10 years ago, no one could even think about it either in Russia itself or anywhere in the world. And today these are realities - Russia is losing its subjectivity and signing on to its own inability to defeat Ukraine on its own. This is seen by external players who look at Russia and understand that Putin is weakening. At the same time, it strengthens North Korea, because the DPRK extracts from Russia the technology necessary for the production of weapons. Such as, for example, the modernization of nuclear submarines and others. Of course, in any case, the DPRK military is a force. It, like any troops, forces and means of the enemy on the front, can pose a threat. While training in Russia, the North Korean military can create certain problems in certain areas and may even have some minor tactical successes. So this is an additional challenge for us. This is the understanding that there will be more enemy manpower to be destroyed. However, as previous experience shows, the Russian Federation has no chance of defeating Ukraine thanks to North Korean soldiers. Russia was no longer helped by mercenaries from other countries. Strategically, North Korean and Iranian weapons did not help to turn the tide of the war. Therefore, the North Korean soldiers will not help her either.- Earlier, ArmiyaInform reported that the Russians are trying to intimidate Ukrainians and the world with North Korean soldiers , the Kharkiv OTU assessed the quality of ammunition from the DPRK, the head of the GUR told where Russia will send the first batch of North Korean infantry, and North Korean soldiers tried to escape from Bryansk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/strana-ogromnaya-ne-vstala-navishho-rf-dodala-korejskyj-sous-u-vijnu-z-ukrayinoyu/	2024-10-24T20:58:48-07:00
-The idea of ​​running arose after pulling a 16-ton airplane on a prosthesis-. Roman Kashpur and his...	Every year, more and more running enthusiasts from all over the world join this event, but for the Ukrainian community, this year's event is symbolic. Participant in the marathon distance race (42 km 195 m) was Roman Kashpur, an active serviceman of the 808th separate Dniester support brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who in 2019, during a combat mission as part of the 74th separate reconnaissance battalion in the settlement of Olenivka in Donetsk region, as a result of receiving a mine-explosive wound, he lost part of his leg. Roman told ArmiyaInform about how he managed to go through all the difficulties of rehabilitation after a serious injury, and did not leave either military service or his love for sports. —Mr. Roman, please tell me how, after being seriously wounded, you got into the service of the 808th separate Dniester brigade of the Support Forces? — The wife, on a volunteer basis, helped units in Odesa, in particular, and the personnel of the 808th th brigade. Having joined the project to establish a rehabilitation center for veterans right on the shores of the Black Sea, we began to actively spread the topic of rehabilitation of wounded soldiers or veterans through sports activity, which is quite widespread and, in particular, is gaining popularity not only in Ukraine. At the same time, when it became a question for me whether to continue military service in combination with sports, the brigade commander supported me and accepted me into the service. In the unit, I deal with foster care and rehabilitation issues. My sports activity, despite the severe injury, my achievements and achievements play a certain motivational role for all wounded people, they see that life after injuries does not end. In my opinion, it is a good idea to have a patronage service in the unit that works with the wounded, promotes their rehabilitation, and, of course, there should be people there who understand this. As a person who has been in prosthetics for the fifth year, but is actively training, I know everything there is to know in the world of prosthetics and I give my positive or negative assessment to one or another prosthetist regarding the functional capabilities of existing prostheses. - Before serving in the 808th Separate Support Brigade, you had already served in another military unit. Please tell us under what circumstances you were injured? — Yes, he started his service in 2016 as part of the Right Sector Volunteer Ukrainian Corps. In 2017, he signed a contract with the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the 74th separate reconnaissance battalion, where, in particular, he was wounded while performing one of the combat missions. After being released, he started playing sports with a prosthesis. When a large-scale war began, he evacuated his family from Kharkiv to Vinnytsia to his parents and returned. Voluntarily started the fight against the occupiers from 2022 in the -Kraken- unit of the GUR MOU, the 95th Airborne Assault Brigade, the 92nd Mechanized Brigade, the 53rd Mechanized Brigade. It was then that the idea of ​​participating in marathons was formed - and it was so strong that it did not leave my head. But at the same time, there was an understanding - either I stay in the army and do sports, which, in my opinion, is the best motivator for rehabilitation, or I leave. It so happened that the commander of the 808th Brigade of Support Forces Oleg Mazurok took me from the summer of 2023 to complete my service. - Tell me, please, how long have you been running and what is the marathon you already have? - The idea of ​​running came after I pulled a 16-ton airplane on my prosthesis in 2021. That's when I set a Ukrainian record by pulling an airplane for a distance of 6 meters 40 centimeters in 44 seconds - then I believed in myself and realized that I could motivate the seriously injured, and the emphasis should be on the fact that the absence of a limb should not deprive one of incentive and movement, motivation to full life Sport has been a stimulus and motivation for me all my life, especially after my injury. Therefore, in fact, the next challenge, in 2021, was the idea of ​​running a marathon. With the beginning of a large-scale invasion, due to the fact that he took an active part in hostilities, this idea was somewhat stretched in time. But I returned to it later - and in 2023, in January, I started training. Actually, since January 2023, I have been running marathons for the second year. During this period, I managed to run five marathons from the World Marathon Majors series: London, New York, Chicago, Berlin and Tokyo. I still have a marathon in Boston. I planned to run one marathon in Ukraine, but it has not happened yet, preparing for world marathons takes a lot of time, strength and energy, because I have already completed six abroad. Therefore, it will be a little later in Ukraine. —You said that you are part of the Patronage Service of the 808th Brigade. Tell us what you do. - Our service was created to care for wounded fighters, prisoners, missing, dead and their families. At the moment, the staff of this unit is being worked out in part and the recruitment of personnel is ongoing. My direction will be directly related to the rehabilitation of wounded soldiers, because in such a situation, I know how to act in this direction like a fish in water. I believe that the best is yet to come, both for me and for the military, who will need my help and guidance. When the brigade commander is interested, it will be done. I'm just a self-motivated person who has mastered a particular direction and I intend to help others. - Returning to the question of sports, tell us what are the peculiarities of running in the marathon distance? Any techniques? What does preparation for a marathon consist of? - We are not talking now about a marathon on a prosthesis, but in principle about a marathon as a sports competition, you need to understand that it is a long-term process that requires many hours of training and a regime. It is selected for each athlete individually. So it's more math at first. You have a desire to run a marathon, the coach must know what distance, what physical indicators of a person at the beginning of training, what endurance, that is, such basic things, with which he will have to work in the future. Next, the first months of training are scheduled, the distances can be about 15-20 kilometers, we run routes. If the coach sees progress, the indicators improve, then the goal is adjusted, say 30 kilometers in total per week, which we overcome in 5-6 days. If we talk about the marathon on a prosthesis, then, of course, this is a phenomenon that is not widespread in Ukraine, it needs to be studied and spread, and this is still a difficult issue. It is difficult for an ordinary person to run 42 kilometers, and for runners with a prosthesis, you need to understand the quality of the prosthesis, the level of professionalism of the prosthetist - a specialist who makes prosthetics. Because, let's say, 80 percent of a marathon runner's success with a prosthesis is due to the technique of prosthetics. The stump receiver is important here, because the prosthesis itself is made by a machine that does not make mistakes and will do everything exactly, but the stump receiver, which is inserted into the stump, is already the work of a person. The comfort of a runner on a prosthesis depends on how well it is made. - In the last month, you have completed two of the most prestigious marathons, I think they are part of the World Marathon Majors? - Yes. There is one more marathon left before the implementation of the World Marathon Majors, which includes six marathons: London, Boston, New York, Chicago, Berlin and Tokyo. This is the Boston Marathon and I plan to run it next year. I have to qualify for this. I really hope I can do it. - What is your best result? - My personal best is 42 km in three hours and 55 minutes. And the Berlin Marathon, which was held at the end of September, and which was preceded by six months of preparation. After the first London Marathon on April 23, 2023, I became the first veteran in Ukraine to overcome such a distance with a prosthesis. The marathon was difficult to get through and it was very difficult after it. First, there was a psychological misunderstanding of what it is and how it should happen. As for my physical condition, the next day I couldn't lift my body out of bed for about the first 10 minutes after I woke up. And my -living- leg did not want to walk on its own. It was necessary to break oneself to take the first step, because the muscles were spasmed and it cost a lot of effort. After the Berlin Marathon, I just woke up. Of course, there was pain in the muscles, that's natural. But he woke up, put his foot down and drove on. In two weeks, the marathon in Chicago has already been run. So, 84,000 meters were covered in two weeks - there was everything: drive and adrenaline, pain and fatigue, and struggle&#8230; - Roman, what motivates you? - Actually, there are many, many reasons for motivation, it cannot be explained in one sentence. First of all, of course, these are my children, family and all those for whom I live and continue to fight. These are the brothers who died and those who are alive and choose our independence. The latter play a significant role, because they find an opportunity directly from the front line (thanks to good people for -starlinks-) to support information through voice messages and SMS messages. The main thing is the idea that the guys do not give up on the front lines, show indomitability, risking life and health. So, being somewhere here, in a peaceful city or even across the border, I just have to dig the ground and make my way forward, because we are the Armed Forces. It comes naturally to me. I swore to protect and defend my country, and it doesn't matter if it's on the front or in sports. This is the same struggle for the prestige of the country. - You have a very strong track record and service in the Special Forces as well. How was your injury there? - When I arrived at the Kraken, only my commander knew that I was missing a leg. Outwardly, everyone is the same - in pants, therefore, on the legs. The top management found out about a month and a half later. This was already after the assault, where you have to lead a unit with you - on a prosthesis or not - it doesn't matter. When we flew on March 25 to storm Olkhovka, it was the first successful assault after Kharkov, when the -Moscolot- was driven away, there I moved on a par with everyone. And when the tank fired at the target, destroyed houses, I ran so that you couldn't tell whether I was wearing a prosthesis or not. - Did you play professional sports before the service? - I have been in sports all my life, as long as I can remember. Back in his school years, he ran the 100-meter race for the honor of the school. Then I went to the football section, I was a midfielder. Anyone who understands football knows that defenders are the horses that run forward after the ball. And even after the injury, he began to take sports more seriously, started with CrossFit, participated in veteran competitions. Later, he tried himself as a strongman when he was pulling a plane. And came to the marathon. Actually, I stopped at the marathon now. - How much mileage do you run per week when preparing for marathons? - Before the Berlin Marathon, it was between 54 and 58 kilometers per week. Just to run a marathon at a good pace, you need to run that distance in four days, that's good. But for the goal I am pursuing, this is very little, because I need to cover 70-80 kilometers in a week at best. But it's not so much about my physical condition, I'm physically and mentally ready for it. The main issue with the prosthesis: you need to have time for recovery, sometimes you simply don't have time to recover due to wear and tear and so on. That is, these technical issues require research and analysis. Which is exactly what I'm doing when I research my condition. During the Berlin Marathon, I really felt such a combination and harmony that I completely forgot that I had a prosthesis. I thought I had a living leg, healthy, and everything was fine, I was in one piece. This is how it should work, then there will be no problems, and there will be a good physical indicator. And here is a great merit of the prosthetist - because you can be strong-minded, have the desire to run, but because of a bad prosthesis, after 10 kilometers from your kilt, there will be minced meat. This is very important. - Do you have a foreign-made prosthesis? - Prosthesis and components from the Icelandic company -Ossur-, which is one of the leading high-tech prostheses on the market, but the assembly, manufacture of the stump-receiving sleeve (the stump is inserted there) and the prosthetics themselves — this is already the work of Ukrainian specialists. - How are you perceived abroad? - Sports diplomacy against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine has its own positive solutions. We want to draw attention to Ukraine, to show the world who we are, that we are not the barbarians that the -Rashka- made of us all these years. I printed a large trident on the back of my t-shirt, in which I ran, and signed it: Ukraine. And ahead were already the insignia of the combat unit, the insignia of the Support Forces Command and the organization that I represent. We are carriers of Ukrainian identity abroad. It's nice to hear -Glory to Ukraine- in different countries with different accents, and I always answer -Glory to the Heroes-, understanding that the civilized part of humanity is aware of the meaning of the slogan -Glory to Ukraine- and our emblem, our symbols - they already know it quite well. This inspires, stimulates, motivates, because Ukraine is not only known as a country on the world map. People like me, we are all part of the information war, it is a fire that needs to be constantly maintained, constantly thrown in, so that we are heard. Sport is perhaps the best way to demonstrate to the world that we are not just strong, but invincible. —Are Russians allowed to participate in such sporting events? Do they also participate in marathons? How does the world perceive them? - I heard the Katsap language, there were especially many -Russians- in Berlin, but it is important to note that the civilized sports world is closed to veteran occupiers. -Muscovites- are not invited to places where a purely veteran -dvizhuhha- gathers. It is very important to realize that there will never be veterans of the aggressor country abroad, and even more so in sports. The information campaign of the Ukrainian diaspora in Japan turned out to be quite powerful. Two veterans from Ukraine came to us for the marathon in Tokyo, and both are amputees. It was March, on the eve of Putin's election, when the Russian propaganda machine carried out information operations outside the borders of the countries of the former USSR regarding Crimea, spreading manipulative theses that it was never Ukrainian, that the war began in 2022, because Russia came to liberate our territories. When the world media presented us - two veterans from Ukraine who came to the marathon, who were injured long before the -wide scale-. Many thanks to our diaspora in Japan, they organized an interview with us, invited representatives of the world's top media and nullified the propaganda allegations. There was already a -mismatch-. . We talked about when and how the war started, how long it has been going on, that Russia took the Ukrainian Crimea, that the referendums were held under the influence of armed aggression and under the muzzle of a machine gun. With our arrival in Japan, our participation in the marathon, we quite powerfully undermined the information strategy of the Russians, the media switched exclusively to Ukraine, to veterans. This must be done, done on a permanent basis, regularly. When I run a marathon across the border, the price for the 42 km covered is my health, while Russia poisons the world with propaganda narratives, on which it spends billions of rubles so that the world hears their false truth. There should be a lot of information about us, we should develop, wage our struggle on all fronts by all possible means. Now I call on the wounded not to give up, draw attention to themselves, fight and show everyone around and the world that look, I am a man with a prosthesis, I have difficulties, but at the same time I have no limitations, I have unlimited opportunities for realization their life goals.

Guided air bombs JSOW from the United States: what kind of weapon is this and how will it help the D...	An ArmiyaInform correspondent asked Andriy Kharuk, a well-known arms researcher, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny, about this. - Andrii Ivanovich, what general information about this weapon? – The abbreviation JSOW stands for Joint Standoff Weapon, which can be translated as -long-range joint weapon-. -Community- at the same time means that this bomb was intended for arming aircraft of both the Air Force and the US Navy and Marine Corps. It is interesting that this ammunition has the -missile- designation in the nomenclature of the US Armed Forces - AGM -154, not -bomb- (as, for example, opornomu-punkti-u-kurskij-oblasti-kadry-vid-povitryanyh-syl/-> GBU-39/В, also known as SDB, which are already used by the Ukrainian Air Force ) - although most JSOW variants do not have their own engine. - Traditionally, you share with our readers interesting stories about the creation of weapons that Western partners transfer to Ukraine. And what can be said about JSOW in this regard? - The creation of JSOW began in 1986 at the initiative of the US Navy, which needed a replacement for laser-guided munitions - guided aerial bombs of the family Paveway and guided missiles AGM-65E Maverick. The new weapon was to be used according to the -shoot-and-forget- principle, that is, it did not require target illumination or external control of the cartridge during flight. This determined the composition of the guidance system - inertial-satellite (INS/GPS). The design of the KAB was carried out by Texas Instruments (now Raytheon) in 1992. The US Air Force, which was implementing its own program to create a similar ammunition, decided not to hesitate and join the naval program. In light of the reduction in military spending after the end of the Cold War, it looked like a completely rational decision. The first drops of AGM-154A bombs took place in 1994. In 1997, the bomb was adopted by the aviation of the US Navy, and in two years their mass production began. in caliber 1000 pounds - nominally 454 kg, but its mass is slightly greater (483 kg for AGM-154A and 497 kg for AGM-154C). It is equipped with a deployable wing with a fairly large span and plumage, and the flight range when dropped from a high altitude can reach 130 km. - As far as is known, this weapon has several modifications, and you partially mentioned it above. What are their design features? – The AGM-154A variant is a cluster, it is equipped with 145 BLU-97/B submunitions of combined action (cumulative-fragmentation-incendiary). Each such bomb weighs 1.54 kg. The AGM-154B variant, equipped with self-guided anti-tank ammunition, was developed for the needs of the US Air Force, but it was never adopted. The AGM-variant The 154C has a monoblock warhead of the penetrating type, designed to hit well-protected targets. The JSOW-ER variant with a turbojet engine and a flight range of up to 560 km was also tested, but it was not mass-produced. – In addition to the United States Army, the US defense-industrial complex periodically offers its special products to partner countries. And what is the situation with JSOW exports? – In addition to the United States, JSOW guided bombs were delivered to more than a dozen countries: Greece, Turkey, Poland, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, etc. – And how many bombs Can Ukraine potentially get JSOW? - Unfortunately, not so much - considering only US arsenals, not new production. The US Air Force stopped purchasing these munitions already in the 2005 fiscal year, having received 523 bombs. They were purchased for the Navy until 2015 - a total of 1,994 bombs. This gives a total of 2,517 bombs, of which four hundred were used in combat. That is, the maximum number of JSOW in the arsenals of the US Armed Forces can be about two thousand. Obviously, we will be given a few dozen such bombs to begin with, and in the future - maybe several hundred. - How will our aircraft be able to use JSOW? &#8211; The carriers will obviously be F-16s - they do not need to be adapted. The main targets for AGM-154A damage will be planar weakly protected objects. Among these, the Americans, first of all, call air defense positions. I would also add the destruction of military equipment parks, warehouses with ammunition and fuel, etc. AGM-154S will primarily hit command posts enemy, but also road/railway bridges and other infrastructure objects.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/kerovani-aviabomby-jsow-vid-ssha-shho-cze-za-zbroya-i-yak-vona-dopomozhe-sylam-oborony-ukrayiny/	2024-10-24T20:31:05-07:00
the Russians are falsifying the data of the Institute for the Study of War (ISW): what fake statisti...	As -proof- of this, the propagandists add an infographic showing data on the share of -foreign mercenaries- who allegedly received a disability, broken down by country. The initial date chronologically coincides with the beginning of the Armed Forces operation in the Kursk region. After all, under the infographic, fakers write that the source of this data is the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), an American think tank that specializes in researching modern armed conflicts, in particular, Russian aggression against Ukraine. StopFake contacted the ISW think tank , to find out whether he published data on the number of injured foreigners fighting for Ukraine. Evan Moore, ISW's deputy director of international relations, said in response to a StopFake inquiry that the statistics shared online were not prepared by ISW and do not reflect its assessments and views. All ISW materials are available on official resources. Russian propaganda regularly spreads misinformation about so-called foreign mercenaries in the ranks of the Armed Forces. Russian propagandists are trying to spoil Ukraine's relations with partner countries and discredit the military units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in which volunteers — citizens of other countries — serve.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/rosiyany-pidroblyayut-dani-instytutu-vyvchennya-vijny-isw-yaka-fejkova-statystyka-gulyaye-v-informprostori/	2024-10-24T20:11:24-07:00
-Radio telegraphed- the enemy: a radio telegrapher and a Telegram blogger were detained in Kharkiv O...	This was reported by the Prosecutor General's Office. In July 2024, the NSU radio telegrapher voluntarily established a permanent connection with a representative of the FSB of the Russian Federation in the messenger. During personal correspondence, the woman repeatedly conveyed information about the deployment of units of the Ukrainian troops, which are directly involved in repelling Russian armed aggression in Kharkiv Oblast and adjacent territories. The second suspect is an unemployed resident of the village. Kivsharivka of the Kupyan district, who administered a pro-Russian Telegram channel about the -situation- in the Kupyan region. On the Internet resource, he systematically presented the locations of the Ukrainian military and equipment. The -blogger- called on the channel's readers to join in disseminating information about the bases and movements of the Defense Forces in the Kupyan direction. In fact, this information was necessary for the enemy to make a breakthrough and occupy the settlements of the Kupyan district.

Mass bankruptcies: a new trend in Russian industry	This is reported by Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. According to forecasts, the policy of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation will lead to stagflation and stop the export of high-tech products already in 2025. Today, the high interest rate of the Russian regulator is even reducing the profits of defense enterprises. This will lead to the cessation of the export of aircraft, air defense equipment, ships and other high-tech products of -growth-, and as a result - to a wave of bankruptcies of industrial companies. The high rate is also the reason for disruption of the terms of delivery of military products. Since the summer of 2023, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation has raised the interest rate seven times and brought it to 19% per annum. Another increase is expected on October 25 - up to 21%. Among the reasons for the rate increase, Russian economists cite trillion dollar infusions into the defense industry of the Russian Federation, which provoke inflation. On the other hand, the official statistics of the Russian Federation claim that there are no problems in the Russian industry: the volume of production in the country increased by 4.5% in January-August 2024, and the government in the draft budget for 2025 predicts an increase in production by another 2%.

Once near Terni, he and his comrades spent five days in a position with no escape - they repelled assaults, and dug trenches in between,- says the combat medic.

The EU is preparing a new intelligence structure to counter threats from Russia	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The document will contain a proposal -to gradually create a full-fledged intelligence agency of the EU.- We will remind that at the beginning of 2024, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, instructed S. Nijnisto to provide recommendations on increasing the readiness of the European Union to face possible crises. The report will include possible measures to counter the aggressive policy of the Kremlin and Russia (in particular, countering artificially created migration crises), the potential consequences of conflicts in the Middle East, and China's rapid growth. In fact, S. Niinisto recommends expanding the powers and activities of the already existing EU Intelligence and Situation Center (EU INTCEN), including intelligence gathering with the help of EU diplomatic missions and conducting counterintelligence operations. The main aim is to avoid duplication of work by national intelligence services and to help counter espionage targeting EU institutions. It is argued that because the EU does not have its own intelligence service, officials analyze publicly available data and intelligence received from member states, limiting Brussels' ability to detect and respond to potential threats. Earlier ArmyInform reported that a group from Holosiivsk RTCC -helped- more than a thousand evaders. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/yes-gotuye-novu-rozviduvalnu-strukturu-dlya-protydiyi-zagrozam-z-boku-rosiyi/	2024-10-24T06:28:18-07:00

How autumn will change the situation on the battlefield on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon the representative of the communications service told with the public of the 13th operational brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine -Charter- Volodymyr Degtyarev. — It has been a long time since we have had massive offensives with the use of equipment. We managed to successfully repulse all previous attacks. Out of 5-6 tanks that could move towards us, one could return to the enemy, even if defeated. Therefore, it is likely that either he is running out of equipment and is not taking risks, or he is doing some kind of accumulation process, he said. The Guardsman suggested that the enemy may be preparing for a change in conditions on the battlefield in view of the onset of natural autumn with frequent rains, cold weather and falling leaves. — We understand that now the weather is changing, a cold weather is coming. Now the situation is when the situation on the battlefield will change very much from the overview to the fact that the leaves will fall - it will become more visible and more difficult to defend. The conditions of stay in the landings will become more difficult, Volodymyr Degtyarev explained. However, it is extremely difficult for the occupiers to prepare for a change in the situation on the battlefield due to the onset of autumn. -It's not easy to prepare, get equipment and bring in some equipment in conditions where the air is well filtered and controlled, in particular by us and other units,- said the representative of -Charter-. According to him, the occupiers are in significantly worse conditions than the fighters of the Defense Forces. — We see that their moral and psychological state, at least those prisoners we take, is extremely low. We understand that they are certainly in worse conditions, because even in the most remote positions we regularly deliver to our fighters, using, for example, night drones, provisions and ammunition. It is much more difficult for the enemy, they do not have such means. Therefore, they have to survive in these crevices for weeks with minimal supplies, the guard said. He thanked everyone who supports the Defense Forces of Ukraine in general and the -Charter- brigade in particular for their constant help, thanks to which the defenders of Ukraine will meet autumn and winter properly equipped with everything they need.

Audit of US military aid: Ministry of Defense of Ukraine tightens control over the use of equipment	This is reported by Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. -The study of the process did not identify any significant deviations. Instead, we have established a gap in the regulatory framework that complicates the circulation of spare parts from damaged military equipment provided to Ukraine by the American side as international military aid. Now, according to the decision of the Ministry of Defense, a bilateral official regulation is being developed jointly, which will increase the efficiency of the use of the relevant parts and units-, said the director of the Department of Internal Audit of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Colonel Oleksandr Tytkovskyi. In addition, according to him, the possibility of introducing a unified software product is being considered, which integrates the records of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of security services into a single system and updates the current information, taking into account the constant updating of the data of the Security Assistance Group - Ukraine. -This is a vivid example of trust between the US and Ukraine, as well as the use of the best international practices by the Ukrainian side. Yes, this time the Internal Audit Service of the Ministry of Defense conducted research taking into account auditing standards accepted by the US Government. We will develop the achievements that will allow us to strengthen bilateral relations between our states and consolidate the status of equal partners in the matter of accounting for international military aid,- Oleksandr Tytkovsky emphasized. A Memorandum between the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the Office of the Inspector General of the US Department of Defense on Ukrainian-American cooperation in the field of internal audit is currently being prepared.

Weeding the forest: the Defense Forces talked about the specifics of the liberation of Kharkiv Oblas...	A representative of the public relations service of the 13th brigade told about this on the broadcasts of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon operational assignment of the National Guard of Ukraine -Charter- Volodymyr Degtyarev. — The specificity of the terrain in Kharkiv Oblast is that there is no long line of trenches here. Instead, there are large fields interspersed with forest strips. It is precisely these forest strips that are being fought for, he said. The occupiers set up high-quality fortifications and shelters in the -woodlands-, from which it is very difficult to -dig out- enemy personnel. — In these forest strips, the occupiers dig in very deep. They do not dig trenches there, but multi-story holes. It is very difficult to clear each of them in conditions of difficult terrain, when you cannot really see what is happening in the forest strip 3-5-10 meters away. Therefore, it was a gradual work, in which artillery, mortars, assault units, and our attack bombers were involved. It was a well-planned joint operation, the soldier explained. The spokesman explained what is driving the enemy's tactics. — The tactics of the enemy strongly depend on the specifics of the terrain and his intentions. In particular, in our area of ​​responsibility in the lane of the 13th -Charter- brigade, we manage to control the movement of the enemy, he assured. Volodymyr Degtyarev assured that in the Lipetsk part of the Kharkiv direction in the north of the Kharkiv region, the Guardsmen manage to repel all enemy assaults and restrain the enemy's offensive actions.

The explanation of these maneuvers is quite simple. -They train like this because, I understand, they have fears that they can be hit directly at the base point. But we all saw that they went there just as en masse and returned quite quickly, because in principle they cannot find other bases in the Azov-Black Sea region,- the spokesman said.

About missing persons, non-payment of -combatants- and polygraph for colleagues. Interview with the ...	ArmyInform asked the head of the Office, Colonel Volodymyr Laguta, what questions are most often asked by army personnel and their family members. — Mr. Volodymyr, you reported that in the first four months of work, your Department processed 965 appeals and requests. In particular, with regard to non-payment of financial support and one-time benefits, issues of dismissal from military service. What are the reasons for such appeals by the military? When exactly does the moment of violation of the rights of a military man come? - The reasons can be various, but it is absolutely necessary to find out the prerequisites that contributed to this. I will give an example. The soldier was wounded in the Zaporozhye direction, he was concussed, he went to the hospital himself. In a day or two, his combatant begins to figure out where the person has disappeared to. Submitted it to the SZCH (arbitrary omission of a part - Ed.). Military allowances were stopped. He turned to us for help. My colleagues found out all the circumstances, went to the military unit, in particular, to the commander, and helped to solve this issue. In practice, sometimes everything can be fixed even by phone. Communication is important. We cooperate with the public sector. We have a crisis center at the Ministry of Defense. A very powerful team, which, in particular, monitors all social networks, any information in different directions. If they see any violation of (military rights.- Ed.), then they redirect these stories to us. We prepare both weekly and daily reports, so we can see the emergence of mass requests from the military of a certain unit. In this case, we communicate with the unit to quickly respond to similar problems and quickly restore the violated rights of servicemen, as well as to prevent such violations in the future. At one time, there was another serious problem - commanders did not accept reports. For its solution, with the participation of the -Princip- NGO, a normative legal act was prepared, which regulates the procedure for submission and their consideration. In particular, it was proposed to digitize the submission of reports. A technical task was formed for the developers of the -Army+- application, and a corresponding order was developed. So now we have e-reports, and specific deadlines for their review in written and electronic form have also been defined. No less important area of ​​our work is consideration of appeals and complaints from family members of military personnel, including when military personnel do not communicate. Sometimes they call the commanders, want to know the fate of their loved ones, but they do not answer them. In such a case, the officers of the CUZPV send appropriate requests to the military units and establish communication with the relevant officials. Many people have died or are missing. Important in this case is the creation of the Escort Service in the Armed Forces, the role of which, in particular, is aimed at communicating with the relatives of servicemen. — You recently mentioned that you are working to change the way you date the death of people who were considered missing. Please tell us in more detail. - These are changes to the decrees that regulate the payment of a lump sum benefit in the event of death. For example, a serviceman went missing four years ago. Subsequently, the Defense Forces cleared a certain area and found the remains, transferred them to a medical facility, conducted a DNA analysis and confirmed that these remains belong to the said serviceman. Currently, the date of death is recorded from the moment a person is considered missing. Following the proposed changes, the date of death will be recorded from the moment of DNA confirmation. A person can receive the right to a one-time cash payment within three years. If more than three years have passed from the moment of death to the moment of realization of the right to one-time assistance, the family can renew the right to payment only through the court. The changes proposed by the Office are currently under consideration by the CMU. — The main reasons for the violation of rights — illegal actions of officials and commanders. How can this situation be equalized and is it possible at all? - The army has increased several times, new people have arrived. They need to be trained, and we are also working on this. We launch appropriate courses, provide clarifications, give recommendations, etc. — Are you going to introduce a kind of informational and legal hygiene in the troops? — More legal. There are actually a lot of problems, they have been accumulating for years. — Another reason for appeals, according to you, is non-payment of the combat 100,000. Why does such a problem arise at all, in your opinion, and how do you influence it? - One of the last stories is mentioned. We were contacted by a serviceman who was injured and is being treated at a medical facility. According to the law, all payments, including combat pay, are retained, in particular, during treatment. He already has a court decision, which the military unit is not enforcing. We have started processing his complaint. It turns out that the commander was on a combat mission, and his subordinates did not inform him about this situation. We provided recommendations on how to get out of this situation, so the issue was resolved. — You reported that two investigations were also carried out, and in some cases there were indications of crimes that were reported to the appropriate authorities. Can you tell me more? Are there open criminal proceedings? - Do you have access to the state secret? — None. — Then I cannot comment in detail on this issue, sorry. Yes, there were indeed two investigations, the facts were confirmed and, on the instructions of the minister, the materials were transferred to the relevant authorities. — Another area of ​​your work— observance of gender equality, as well as problems related to discrimination based on gender. Why do you think this question arises in the tenth year of the war? You reported that official inspections or official investigations can also be conducted in this direction. — In my opinion, the issue of non-compliance with gender equality is precisely related to the increase in the number of military personnel and the silencing of the problem, as well as reluctance to respond to such violations both on the part of the injured person and on the part of direct management. In order to prevent this, the officers of our Office take an active part in the work on the development of the Instructions for the provision and consideration of reports on violations related to gender discrimination, offenses against sexual freedom and sexual integrity, as well as their registration in the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the Armed Forces Forces of Ukraine and the State Special Service of Transport, intelligence agencies of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and their subordinate units, institutions and centers. — How was the management team formed? Who are these people? — People learned about management from various sources: heard from acquaintances, saw vacancies on LobbyX, etc. When someone sent a resume, the organizational core of our newly formed Office was already looking at that person. The date of the interview was determined. Some even called from the battlefield via video link. One of the candidates called almost from surrounded Ugledar - and we interviewed him. We also have a principled position: all our people pass a polygraph. I personally passed the test too. This is done so that I can speak honestly with my subordinates. By the way, one of the important factors is included in the polygraph test - regarding the interaction of the candidate with the foreign special services of the Russian Federation and the Russian Federation. As for the officers themselves, they are mostly people with a legal education, some have experience in law enforcement, advocacy, almost all of them have combat experience. — Do you currently have vacant positions in the Department? — Yes, there are vacant positions in the Department. There are also candidates who have already passed all background checks, interviews and polygraphs, and we are currently preparing relocation plans. But there are certain points here: our potential candidates are smart lawyers in military units, and not all commanders want to let good specialists go(smiles- Ed.). Therefore, we help to find a replacement so that the military unit is not weakened in personnel.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/pro-znyklyh-bezvisty-nevyplatu-bojovyh-ta-poligraf-dlya-koleg-intervyu-z-kerivnykom-czentralnogo-upravlinnya-zahystu-prav-vijskovosluzhbovcziv-mou/	2024-10-23T21:21:39-07:00

What is the reason for the urgency of the Victory Plan and what is most important in it for the mili...	The head of state is convinced that if we start moving this specific plan now, it will be possible to end the war no later than next year. What is the urgency of the Victory Plan right now and what is most important in it for explains the military expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studios of Strategic Studies- Olexandr Chupak: -Currently, Ukraine is going through perhaps the most difficult period of the war after the first weeks of the large-scale invasion of Russia. The occupier is intensifying offensive actions in most directions, directly involving the DPRK in the war, finding ways to circumvent sanctions, etc. At the same time, our allies, led by the USA, show a complete unwillingness to respond adequately to the increased threat. In such a situation, Ukraine needed a strong move that would attract the attention of world leaders and return us to the center of geopolitical discussions on the eve of the American elections (to be held on November 5). Kyiv had to demonstrate to the politicians and citizens of allied countries why they are transferring their funds to Ukraine and under what conditions the assistance will no longer be needed. Among the five presented points, the second one is the most important, because it should immediately increase the defense capability of Ukraine and guarantee us an advantage on the battlefield. It is about assistance in -staffing reserve brigades for the Armed Forces, strengthening air defense, jointly with partners shooting down Russian drones and missiles, investments in Ukrainian defense production, lifting restrictions on the use of long-range weapons, providing relevant long-range capabilities and satellite data and intelligence information in real time -. In this list, only -joint shooting down of Russian drones and missiles- should be considered a distant prospect. Other items can be implemented in a short period of time or even instantly, for example, -removing restrictions on the use of long-range weapons.- If the Biden administration today allows us to strike deep into Russian territory with ATACMS missiles, tomorrow we will see many reports of destroyed warehouses with -Shaheeds- and ballistic systems that are terrorizing our cities. In general, the Victory Plan is a concise statement of what Ukrainians have been talking about since the beginning of 2022 or even earlier. Ukraine's entry into NATO was enshrined in our Constitution in 2019. Ukraine has been asking for the provision of lethal weapons since the beginning of the war in 2014, and only in 2018 did President Trump sign a decree on the transfer of Javelin complexes to us. Even before the start of the large-scale invasion, the Ukrainians emphasized that our economic and human potential cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of Russia, because it will instantly be directed against the eastern flank of NATO. Interesting are the points about the deployment of non-nuclear strategic deterrence forces on the territory of Ukraine and the replacement by Ukrainian units of certain military contingents of the US armed forces stationed in Europe. Obviously, they can be implemented only under the conditions of Ukraine's accession to NATO and a general change in the approach of the Alliance countries to the Russian-Ukrainian war. Now is such a good time, given the indecision of Washington, Brussels and others. However, the Victory Plan may receive a serious boost in the event of changes in the United States after the election.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/chym-vyklykana-terminovist-planu-peremogy-i-shho-v-nomu-najvazhlyvishe-dlya-vijskovyh-dumka-eksperta/	2024-10-23T21:09:44-07:00
F-16 in Byzantine style: what Ukraine can learn from the - cunning - Greeks	In the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine considered and commented on the possibility of receiving F-16 from this country and for some time this issue was on the agenda. After long negotiations, Ukraine signed a> in October 2024 with this country the Agreement on cooperation in the field of security. All this is about the Hellenic Democracy, which in Ukraine is traditionally called the Hellenic Republic or, for short, Greece. The modern Greek state has ancient cultural, political, military and diplomatic traditions that reach the depths of the history of the Hellenic polis of Antiquity and the Byzantine Empire and its fragments from the Middle Ages. The Hellenic heritage is one of the fundamental foundations of modern Europe. The historical legacy largely determines the place and role of Greece in modern politics, reliably ensuring its rightful place in the world community. However, the Hellenic Republic is not only revered for its ancient history and culture - its significance is also determined by its recent and current achievements and position in the political arena. In the military sphere, Greece can be proud not only of victories in the glorious battles of Antiquity and the Middle Ages, or of worthy participation in the First and Second World Wars closer to modern times. Even more important is the military power of the Greek state at the current stage, which has been convincingly demonstrated over the past decades not only during military exercises, but also during actual combat operations. Along with the ground forces and the navy, Greece has a powerful Air Force, whose air fleet includes both time-tested classic combat vehicles and the latest models of military equipment and weapons. Among the military aircraft of the Air Force of the Army of the Hellenic Republic, one of the leading places for a long time belonged to the F-16 Fighting Falcon fighters, which, among other things, participated in a combat confrontation with a real enemy in the air. The experience of the Greek Air Force in the operation and combat use of the F-16 is undeniable. In the course of the Aegean dispute with Turkey in the 1990s and 2000s, they participated not only in regular airspace patrols over the Aegean Sea, but also in repeated simulated and real combat clashes with Turkish military aircraft. The intensive use of the F-16 allowed Greek pilots and service personnel to deeply study these combat vehicles and gain invaluable experience in their operation and maintenance in combat conditions. According to the Security Cooperation Agreement between Ukraine and the Hellenic Republic, Greece will provide additional resources to accelerate the training of Ukrainian military pilots and technical personnel for F-16 aircraft. Both parties have a deep interest in such a partnership. Ukraine is receiving specialists and additional resources, and is also taking a step towards the possible acquisition, in one way or another, of Greek F-16 aircraft. Greece, on the other hand, creates additional conditions in order to transfer F-16 to Ukraine in the most profitable way for itself. The Greeks' diplomatic tradition goes even deeper than their truly thorough knowledge of the F-16, with Greek politicians repeatedly using it to bolster their country's Air Force as well. One of the clear examples is the creation of the preconditions for the Hellenic Republic to be able to purchase F-16 Fighting Falcons for its fleet from the United States of America in the mid-1980s. At that time, the US government hesitated for a long time whether to sell F-16s to Greece, because it created tension in relations with Turkey. To open a window of opportunity, in 1985 the Greeks entered into an agreement to purchase 40 Dassault Mirage 2000s from France. After that, it became much easier for the administration of US President Ronald Reagan to open a contract for the purchase of 40 F-16 Fighting Falcons to Greece. Therefore, in the person of Greece, Ukraine has not only a good friend and a reliable partner, but also an experienced teacher of the diplomatic game, because the annals remark -the Greeks are cunning even to this day- has not lost its relevance to this day. By all accounts, at least in terms of getting additional F-16s, the apprentice should prove worthy of his mentor.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/f-16-po-vizantijsky-chomu-ukrayina-mozhe-navchytysya-u-hytromudryh-elliniv/	2024-10-23T20:48:51-07:00
Vyshyvanka, Mazepinka and flag for the film festival in Venice: the story of the most colorful artil...	He already has more than seven years of combat experience behind him - he started as a mechanic-driver of an ACS, and now he has already received the rank of officer and helps manage the battery. In a conversation with ArmyInform correspondents, -Lebyd- talked about his military service and what it's like to be the most colorful soldier in the brigade. — I come from a small village in the Lviv region, near the border with Poland. Always liked to wear embroidered shirts, was interested in history. At the beginning of the great war, when we were still in Volyn, a suit was sent to me from home. I also joked that my grandfather was buried and removed from it. And he walked like that, at first everyone was very surprised, - remembers -Lebyd-. On top, he wore a jacket, a bulletproof vest, and so he went on every trip. None of the commanders were against it, on the contrary, they even asked to take a picture. — Later I found people who make historical clothes, they made me a cap for free. Already here in the East, the locals were surprised, some looked askance, others smiled. And the -Swan- also has a flag of Ukraine, which visited the famous Venice festival. In 2022, journalists who were supposed to go to Italy came to the unit. They asked the soldiers for a flag, they signed it and eventually displayed it in Venice as a sign of support for Ukraine. Military service for the -Swan- began back in 2016. During the ATO/OS, he served in the 24th Separate Mechanized Brigade named after King Danylo as a mechanic-driver of the 2C1 -Gvozdika- self-propelled artillery installation. During the ATO/OS, his unit performed tasks near Soledar, fought on the Svitlodar arc. Later there were Maryinka, Toretsk. The officer remembers that then the war was completely different compared to today's realities. - Then there was not as much work as now. We calmly left, worked out and rolled back. Then you didn't worry about drones, they worked right in the field. It was much easier. Now we are working only when we are dug in. However, stationary work has its advantages: you do not need time for travel, guidance. Nowadays, it takes 3 minutes from handing over a target to firing a shot, he explains. In 2020, -Swan- retired from the army, although he admits that he missed the service for a long time. The Great War caught him in Germany, where he was working as a truck driver at the time. —In two days I was already returning home and on the third day I was in the unit (in the 24th brigade — Ed.). When I was discharged from the army, I immediately said: there is no need to look for me, I will come myself. However, at that time there were a lot of volunteers and the staff of the brigade was already formed, so I was offered to join another one, - he recalls. After that, the units received equipment, spent some time on the training ground, then were on border guard duty in Volyn, and reconciliation took place in parallel. In April 2022, -Lebid- and its crew of -Gvozdika- ACS went to Mykolaiv Oblast, where at that time the Russians were advancing with the intention of occupying the south of Ukraine. we can't stand it And as a result, we lasted until October until we reached the seashore. Then we were sent to Bakhmut. Everything was flying there from all sides, it was very difficult for the artillery to work there, they stayed there for about two months. For more than a year, the -Swan- has been fighting with artillerymen in the Lymansky direction: - Now our main task is to deter the enemy. We only see some assault actions, 3-4 minutes and we fire the first shot. The division has aerial reconnaissance, which gives us targets to hit. He says that sometimes 40 shells were fired from one gun in a day, they tried to shoot as much as possible at every opportunity. But in two years, the nature of hostilities has changed a lot and become more complicated due to drones. - As soon as we left, the enemy -birds- already saw us and began to -arrive-. It was necessary to move to a distance where their artillery could no longer reach. At first, we were constantly on the move, sleeping for 2-3 hours straight in the cars. &nbsp; Recently, the Russians have increased the number of assaults, including with armored vehicles, in the Lyman region. -The enemy is trying to capture as much as possible before the winter,- thinks -Swan-. After receiving the rank of officer, he had much more non-combat work. — I am responsible for the condition of equipment, not only combat units, but also -loaves-, pickup trucks. Everything that drives and shoots. There has been more work with documents, now I'm definitely in the UPA, a paper army, - laughs -Lebyd-. /span> — In 2022, there was no need to look for anyone, everyone went by themselves. Now there are fewer of them, for some reason everyone is waiting until the last, but if you are mobilized, then it will be impossible to choose a brigade or a position in the TCC, - adds the artilleryman. combat experience, not just textbooks. -For a gun to fire one shot, many people need to be involved, in fact it is a whole operation,- the officer explains. ArmyInform reminds you of the opportunity to use aggregator of vacancies in ZSU on our website. In addition, a government resolution has entered into force that allows military units -bez-tczk/->mobilize reservists and conscripts who voluntarily wish to serve during mobilization.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/vyshyvanka-mazepynka-i-prapor-dlya-kinofestyvalyu-u-venecziyi-istoriya-najkolorytnishogo-artylerysta-zsu-u-stepah-donechchyny/	2024-10-23T20:37:32-07:00
What is the Humvee's successor capable of: a silent armored car was presented in the USA	The basis for the car was the Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD ZR2 SUV, as well as a 2.8-liter Duramax turbodiesel engine from GM with a 12-module battery, and drive motors for the front and rear axles. The battery capacity is 300 kilowatt-hours and the fuel tank holds 56 liters. Thanks to electric traction, the machine can operate with low thermal and acoustic load. And this, in turn, allows you to imperceptibly enter and leave the battlefield. The on-board network provides power for sensors and systems that consume a lot of energy. General Motors took into account previous mistakes, so the new car has rollover protection, which was a significant problem with the Humvee. The prototype also has other active and passive safety features, including anti-lock braking system, electronic stability control system, four- and five-point seat belts, as well as 360° cameras. Advantages include lower maintenance requirements due to a reduction in the number of parts and subsystems in the overall propulsion system. The prototype provides for the possibility of installing additional armor on it. -If you look at Ukraine, at the fighting going on right now, one of the risks is that if you're found, you can be killed,- said Pete Johnson, GM Defense's vice president of integrated vehicle business development. The Ukrainian military evacuates the wounded from the front lines in civilian vehicles because they operate more quietly than military vehicles, he added. The company learned about it from those in the war zone. According to Pete Johnson, the technology of the new GM car ensures silent movement. The car is capable of powering the systems without the engine running while idling. The driver can switch between -silent mode- and normal engine operation with the push of a switch. The presence of a battery reduces the need for external batteries, as the military can use the vehicle as a power source. Pete Johnson also added that the company has integrated instant torque technology, which allows efficient and maneuverable off-road driving. He noted that such a design reduces the burden on the supply system and logistics, as hybrid electric vehicles use fewer parts and less fuel and other batteries on the battlefield. GM Defense demonstrated the machine at the annual conference of the Association of the US Army in Washington. The prototype includes a Kongsberg remote weapon station, a Lockheed Martin Javelin anti-tank missile launcher and a Drone Buster to counter threats from unmanned aerial systems in the rear, as well as a tethered Hoverfly drone for reconnaissance. The machine can be transported by C-130 and C-17 aircraft, and can also be loaded by a CH-47 Chinook or MH-53 King Stallion cargo rotorcraft.

-Prayers from mobilization-, or How propaganda tries to discredit OCU	The other day, Ukrinform journalists exposed another fake spread by the Russian mass media and enemy Telegram channels. This is a video of an unidentified person holding a piece of paper with what appears to be a -mobilization prayer.- The video states that such a -prayer- costs 10 hryvnias. The footage is clearly a fake production. The ornament used to decorate the piece of paper in the video can be found on Russian stock Internet resources. It is called -Russian pattern-. Propagandists replaced the symbol of the Russian Orthodox Church with domes on it with the cross of the OCU. In addition, in the text of the prayer, all the letters -z- are written in Latin -z- - one of the symbols of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Latin -z- is not used in the fonts not only in the printed products of the OCU, but even in the Old Slavonic ones, which are used to print prayers in the RPC and its branches in Ukraine UPC (MP). It is also impossible to determine the location where the video of the propagandists was shot. After all, apart from a hand holding a card with a -prayer- and a church altar with candles, which can stand in any Orthodox church in the world, there is nothing else in the frame. Russian propaganda tries to show that the OCU allegedly uses religious doctrines for financial enrichment, thereby trying to sow distrust in the local Ukrainian church. By creating such fakes, Russian propagandists are also trying to demoralize Ukrainian society, undermining trust in religious and national institutions, particularly in wartime, in order to disrupt the mobilization process.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/molytvy-vid-mobilizacziyi-abo-yak-rospropaganda-namagayetsya-dyskredytuvaty-pczu/	2024-10-23T20:13:44-07:00

In addition, among the representatives was Maksym Butkevich, a Ukrainian human rights defender and soldier whom we recently managed to free from Russian captivity. Among the topics discussed by the participants during the meeting are the Victory Plan and the need for unification. The President offered to join the development of our internal action plan. -Our victory requires exactly the kind of unity that existed in the first days of the full-scale Russian invasion. We count on unity in the promotion of the partners' decision to invite Ukraine to NATO. Thank you for your help in developing the Maritime Strategy. It is important to work out the format of the technological Stavka — a good proposal. Together, we must restore justice for Ukraine, bring a reliable peace closer, and talk with our partners about everything that can make Ukraine stronger. Thank you to each and every one of you for your ideas and suggestions and willingness to work together,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized.

An application for the codification of a new type of weapon can be submitted online	About this informs the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. -Our soldiers at the front need more modern weapons and equipment. To do this, we create the most favorable conditions for OVT manufacturers. The procedure for codification of OVT samples was shortened to 10 days. Many organizational processes were optimized. The -Iron Range- project was launched. This is an opportunity for manufacturers of military equipment to test their products for free at a military training ground at various stages of production. Now a new option has been implemented - the opportunity for gunsmiths to submit an application for the codification of an OVT sample online. In the process of its processing, manufacturers will automatically receive information about the completion of the stages of codification of their OVT sample,- said the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Ivan Havryliuk. How to use the service of submitting an application online On the official website https://www.mil.gov.ua/, in the -CURRENT- section, the banner -ARSENAL- Window for OVT manufacturers- is placed. By going to the page, OBT producers can use the active link Window for OBT producers (mod.gov.ua). Access to the service occurs through authorization using id.gov.ua. Data entered by the developer is securely protected. -For convenience, we have placed sample documents that must be filled out by OVT developers. They are grouped according to some of the most popular nomenclature of OVT: EW means, BpAK, ammunition for BpAK, ground robotic complexes. The manufacturer must leave his contact details, e-mail. The developer will receive a notification about changes in the status of the application to the specified address. Each producer of OVT will receive the contact details of an MOU specialist who supports the application,- explained the head of the Main Directorate for Life Cycle Support of Weapons and Military Equipment, Colonel Volodymyr Rochniak. Documents required for submitting an application for codification: Previously ArmyInform reported that the ratio of shots fired at the Armed Forces and the occupiers has improved. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/zayavku-na-kodyfikacziyu-novogo-zrazka-ozbroyennya-mozhna-podaty-onlajn/	2024-10-23T11:31:15-07:00

The majority of stateless persons in Estonia are the Russian-speaking population, which remained stateless after the restoration of independence in 1991. According to the draft law, the right to vote in local elections will be preserved only for citizens of Estonia and citizens of those countries with which an international agreement ratified by the parliament has been concluded. Four out of six parliamentary factions supported the initiative. The bill received 28 signatures (a total of 101 deputies in the parliament), passed the first reading and will be discussed at an open meeting of the Constitutional Commission. The legislative initiative concerns primarily Russian citizens who have the status of a resident of Estonia and can participate in local elections. It is relevant against the background of poll results, which show that a significant part of Russian citizens (38%) and stateless persons (52%) do not condemn the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Mariupol schoolchildren are forced to write letters to military assassins.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/v-estoniyi-planuyut-pozbavyty-rosiyan-rezydentiv-krayiny-prava-golosu-na-vyborah/	2024-10-23T11:19:00-07:00
Yolops in a vacuum: the Defense Forces explained what ensures the political and ideological stabilit...	About how the Russian command manages to achieve this, the representative of the communications service told on the air of the Espresso TV channel of public relations of the 13th operational brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine -Charter- Volodymyr Degtyarev. — The average Russian serviceman on the frontline is very limited in his rights and means of communication. They do not have any information about what is happening in Belgorod region. All phones and means of communication are taken from them, he said. In view of this, it is almost impossible to somehow influence the morale and psychological state of enemy soldiers by informing them about the situation in Russia. In addition, the vast majority of soldiers in the Russian army have an extremely low level of critical thinking. - Any of our actions on the territory of a neighboring state in order to reduce their defense capability is certainly very important.

A representative of the public relations service of the 13th brigade told about this on the air of the Espresso TV channel operational assignment of the National Guard of Ukraine -Charter- Volodymyr Degtyarev. — Of course, their first motivation is to sign a contract. It's money and parole or parole, release from their term, he said. However, the priorities of newly appointed Russian servicemen change quite quickly. - However, further, at the moment when they get closer to the battle line, their main motivation is to survive. At the same time, they are more afraid of their own commanders and -blockade troops- than of Ukrainians, the military officer said. This can be learned from the interrogations of Russian prisoners of war. — We can see this by the fact that they surrender to captivity when they could hypothetically leave. But they are told that there is no way back, said Volodymyr Degtyarev.

The service life of the average Russian at the front can now be measured in weeks, if not days, on average, because it is their main consumable, he said. The military noted that this is about regular replenishment of enemy units already present in the Kharkiv direction with new soldiers, and not about transferring new units or formations here. — Units and stickers on the map remain the same, that is, we know exactly which regiment, which division, which corps is opposite us. However, from interceptions, from interrogations of prisoners, we see that this is their main expendable personnel. It is constantly changing, constantly supplemented with some other infusions, the spokesman explained. These are usually newly recruited contract workers, often including ex-prisoners.

In the area of ​​responsibility of the 57th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade — in the city of Vovchansk and its surroundings — fighting with the occupiers continues. Despite the complete destruction of the city, the enemy did not manage to achieve tactical success. They are trying to change the situation in their favor with fiber-optic drones, which cannot suppress Ukrainian EW means. However, it does not give special advantages to the enemy, Archie is sure. -The aircraft simply turns into a conventional anti-tank guided missile with wire guidance. It prevents it from successfully maneuvering like ordinary drones. We have to understand: the wire is not infinite, it weighs something, and it can catch on many obstacles that are present in the city. This is the kind of technology that they use in anti-tank guided missiles, and we know it, so we also understand how to fight it...- - notes the officer of the 57th Brigade named after Kostya Gordienko, Yak reported ArmyInform, soldiers of the 57th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade were honored at the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the name of Kostya Gordienko, the chieftain of the basket. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/i-drit-ne-neskinchennyj-i-mozhe-zachepytys-rosijske-vundervaffe-ne-lyakaye-zahysnykiv-vovchanska/	2024-10-23T09:01:25-07:00
BRICS leaders spoke out against Russia's plans to transform the union into an anti-American coalitio...	About this informs the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. In particular, the absence of Brazilian President L. da Silva overruled Putin's plans to hold a tripartite meeting between Russia, China and Brazil in order to demonstrate the economic power of the union. This year, less than 20 leaders, mostly from African countries, came to Russia. A significant number refused to go for various reasons. The President of Brazil L. da Silva, for example, was -injured-, the President of Cuba M. Díaz-Canel - due to blackouts in the country, the President of Serbia A. Vučić - due to the planned meeting with the President of Poland and a visit to the USA. There is also no representation of Saudi Arabia at the highest level in Kazan. In 2023, the BRICS summit in South Africa brought together more than 30 leaders (heads of government, vice presidents, presidents). With this in mind, Russia deliberately opened the summit on a separate day from the main sessions, in order to organize negotiations with the leaders of each country separately on the first day and impose the decisions and visions it wants. At the same time, during negotiations with Putin, the leader of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping, said that China -chose the right way of forming relations between countries, based on the principles of non-alignment, non-confrontation and non-targeting against third parties-. The head of the Indian government N. Modi emphasized that the Russian-Ukrainian war -must be resolved by peaceful means- and New Delhi supports -the earliest possible establishment of peace and stability.- One of the main tasks of the Russian Federation based on the results of the summit - the approval of an alternative system of international settlements - will also not be carried out. India, the UAE, Brazil and South Africa actually opposed the transformation of BRICS into an anti-American coalition. It is also telling that on the website of the summit, Russian organizers advise participants to take cash (dollars or euros) with them, as Visa and Mastercard cards issued outside of the Russian Federation do not work due to sanctions. In fact, the Kremlin demonstrated the failure of the Russian payment system -mir-. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that The President announced the key strategy of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/lidery-briks-vystupyly-proty-planiv-rf-iz-peretvorennya-obyednannya-na-antyamerykansku-koalicziyu/	2024-10-23T08:54:44-07:00
The Defense Forces told the story of -David- and his combat path as a self-propelled gun combatant	The defender's story was made public by the -East- Operational Command. However, his determination did not weaken: he decided to get a military education, and before choosing between a tank driver and an artilleryman, he chose artillery. After graduating from the military college, Serhii, with the rank of lieutenant, began serving in the mechanized brigade as a platoon commander and senior battery officer. His first serious test came during the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which he met in the Donetsk region. Serhiy celebrated his birthday on February 23, 2022, and the very next day the war began. Anxiety, panic, everyone is running around the location, this is exactly the picture Serhiy saw when he woke up in the morning, at first he even thought that this was another training, to which their commander was prone. But very soon everything became clear — it was a real invasion. During the war, Sergey gained invaluable combat experience and understood why he was here. The war showed him that his homeland is not just a territory, it is something much deeper. Although it was difficult at first, he adapted over time, both to training and to combat conditions. Serhiy especially emphasizes that all the knowledge he gained at the military college was of great help to him. One of the biggest problems for him remains Soviet cars, on which he has to work. He dreams of new, modernized equipment. For Serhiy, the most important thing before each combat mission is to adjust his personnel. He always explains to the fighters what the task is before them, what is expected of them, and how they can succeed. Morally prepared and confident soldiers are the key to successful mission performance. Having entered the 43rd separate mechanized brigade, Serhiy was initially worried, because a large part of his personnel at that time were rookies without combat experience. However, his fears were quickly dispelled - people turned out to be motivated and quickly learned everything necessary. Their progress impressed the commander, and they are already effectively carrying out the assigned combat tasks. Serhii always emphasizes the importance of quick execution of orders, because every minute can cost a life. As a commander, he is responsible for his subordinates, so he carefully monitors that they are not exposed to unnecessary risks. If he sees a threat to the crew, he immediately reports it to higher management. Despite the difficulties of the war, Serhiy tries to be as close as possible to his soldiers. He always supports them, makes jokes and helps to maintain their fighting spirit in difficult conditions. Serhiy remains devoted to his work, his people and his Motherland, convinced that joint efforts will lead to victory, and after the war, their friendship and brotherhood in combat will become a solid foundation for further life. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Armed Forces of Ukraine demonstrated a spectacular destruction of enemy anti-tankers in Donetsk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/syly-oborony-rozpovily-istoriyu-davida-ta-jogo-bojovyj-shlyah-na-posadi-kombata-sau/	2024-10-23T08:41:30-07:00

Now Dagestan specialists are going to Ukraine with their -priceless- experience. The worst situation with teachers is observed in the temporarily occupied territories of eastern Ukraine. The occupiers introduced a program of financial support for Russian teachers who are ready to move to Ukraine. They promise generous bonuses and benefits. The occupiers are actively bringing teachers from Russia to the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine not only because of the lack of personnel. This initiative aims to change the educational process by introducing Russian ideological narratives and censoring Ukrainian culture and history.

Також пільгу можуть оформити члени родини за довіреністю. Зокрема, чоловік або дружина. Довіреність не обов’язково має бути нотаріально завірена. Посвідчити її може командир військової частини. Але подати документи можна й дистанційно через Інтернет. Для чинних військовослужбовців такий варіант як раз може бути в пригоді, адже під час служби не так легко особисто відвідувати різні державні установи. Відпустки не настільки великі, аби витрачати на це час. Наразі запроваджено експериментальний проєкт, який має спростити учасникам бойових дій та ветеранам війни отримання пільг на оплату житлово-комунальних послуг. Раніше пільговикам потрібно було подавати декілька заяв. Нині ж подається одна заява. І вона спрощена. Сенс у тому, що значна кількість даних тепер збирається автоматично через електронну інформаційну взаємодію між державними реєстрами. Результат розгляду заяви можна відстежувати у розділі -Мої звернення- — -статус звернення-. Наразі пільга на оплату житлово-комунальних послуг надається у грошовій формі. За замовчуванням Пенсійний фонд може відкрити рахунок в Ощадбанку і повідомити про це пільговика. А пільговик має підписати договір банківського рахунку. Якщо хочете, аби гроші були переказані на рахунок в іншому банку, то потрібно звернутися із заявою до територіального органу Пенсійного фонду. Для оформлення потрібно надати свій рахунок, куди нараховуватимуться гроші. Зазвичай на оформлення та нарахування йде певний час. Але згодом гроші надходять. Загалом пільга передбачає такий процес — ви оплачуєте повні суми за житлово-комунальні послуги, які зазначені у платіжках. Але на картку вам надходять кошти у вигляді компенсації. Слід пам’ятати, що якщо ви не будете платити за комуналку, то нарахування пільги може припинитися.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/znyzhka-na-komunalku-dlya-ubd-yak-vijskovomu-zekonomyty-vzymku/	2024-10-22T21:01:59-07:00
Mice are breaking through the front: in the trenches, the intensity of actions of the DRG of rodents...	The onset of natural autumn with cooling and frequent prolonged rains changes the behavior of animals in the ecosystem. Some species start looking for shelter - a dry, warm place with easily available food. One of these animals are mouse-like rodents, of which two dozen species are known only in Ukraine, known under the generalized popular (household) name -mice-. During the war, in addition to the usual houses, economic and industrial buildings, these rodents also have access to dugouts, firing and observation positions, trenches and other shelters built by the fighters. Ihor Zahorodniuk - zoologist, terriologist, leading researcher of the National Science and Natural History Museum of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine - told ArmiyaInform about mice and people in the trenches. This year it is not an invasion, and even less a plague, but a normal seasonal migration. The term -plague- should not be used now, because plagues or invasions are those situations when the population grows to such a number that animals eat their entire feed base, begin to migrate and appear everywhere in unusual places for them. This is what happens with locusts in the South, especially in Asia or in Africa, they are real plagues. In Ukraine, there were mouse plagues in cities during the Holodomor of 1932-1933. Professor Mykola Gavrylenko from Poltava recalled that when he left home for work, he would involuntarily crush two to three dozen mice with his feet every day. We do not have such phenomena now. But last year's spike in numbers, for example, came close to that. At the time, it was caused by a combination of several factors - failed crops and warm winters, which contributed to the massive reproduction of rodents. When the mice came for the second reproduction cycle, there was no such food in the ecosystems, and the military operations made it impossible to cultivate the fields. Then, in search of food, mice went en masse to people and what is called mouse plague or mouse invasion happened. It should be taken into account that there are factors of migration. Not all animals climb up to people, there are some that are very attached to their natural habitats and biotopes, they do not migrate anywhere. And there are those that migrate very easily. Very often these are animals that move away from people seasonally. For example, house mice. They can form a field population, which with the onset of cold weather returns to the warmth. After all, for such species, a person himself creates a certain attractiveness, that is, attractive conditions for staying. Among those attractions is, first and foremost, that the places where people live and stay are places that radiate heat and contain food. Animals sense infrared rays and ultraviolet radiation well and quickly find out that there is a lot of easily accessible food near people. So the combination of food base and heat are the main factors that attract rodents with no previous experience, because they were born in the fields. Animals will climb up to people more actively, the more a person attracts them. If you arrange a clean trench, build chances in which there will be no unnecessary economic activity, then you will not find mice there either. When, for example, a person lays out various boxes, cases of shells or rockets, throws away leftover food, leaves some other garbage, including clothes, packaging materials, etc., mice will definitely appear there. Because, in addition to heat and food, household garbage will provide mice with a third factor of attraction — the presence of safe shelters and hiding places. It is not for nothing that there is a saying that mice start in old dirty things. It should also be noted that mice also eat food that people leave for cats or dogs. This is often forgotten by everyone except mice, who are happy to feed on food left for four-legged burrowing pets. The fourth important factor for rodents is easy access to water. Along with a crowd of people, there will definitely be some spilled water - a puddle or a puddle, some container in which rainwater has accumulated, or even simple splashes and moisture from a hand sink. A combination of all four of these factors—warmth, food, shelter, and water—we're bound to see wherever people are. This is quite natural, because humans as mammals themselves need these same things and, creating them, also provide them to other mammals, first of all such small rodents as mice. The first danger from mice to people is a chronic feeling of anxiety and stress, because the constant mouse smell, climbing on your face while you sleep, getting into your shoes (when you jump in and need to put on your shoes quickly!) - all this leads to chronic stress. And it can obviously reduce the combat effectiveness of specific fighters and even entire units. The second danger is biodamage. Rodents love to gnaw on something, this is even reflected in their name. Clothes, wires, equipment cases - anything that has an edge that you can grind your teeth under, especially if it's not iron, but some kind of plastic - they will do. Because their teeth are constantly growing, they need to be sharpened, especially when the rodents are -hooked- on the soft -free- food available near people. There is a very well-known story about German tankmen from the 4th Panzer Army of the Wehrmacht, actually from the 13th Panzer Division, who first hid the tanks in straw, and in two weeks, when the command to advance came, they could not get them, because the mice had gnawed the wires and pipes. They started only 30 machines out of about 100. The offensive failed. That's why biodamage is a terrible thing in war: mice can gobble up anything - communications, guidance, medical supplies, etc. Rodents can damage anything that is suitable or available for gnawing. The third extremely important problem is zoonoses, that is, infectious diseases of humans, the source of which are infected animals. To put it simply, these are infections that normally run among wild animals, but can spread to humans. People, as a rule, cannot infect each other with this. The causative agent is usually excreted with feces or, even more often, with urine. For example, leptospirosis, which affects the kidneys, is excreted in the urine. It most often enters the human body through the mouth, with contaminated water or contaminated food. No less dangerous is tularemia, which has more ways of spreading, including through the respiratory system. The share of diseased mice in places where zoonoses are spread is usually 3–5%, but it can reach 30–40%, and even 90% in foci of infection. But even if the percentage of infected mice is low, it may well be enough to infect a person. A dangerous signal is also the discovery of dead mice that have recently been killed by zoonosis. This means that the infection was very strong, and it remains in all areas that were once visited and marked by their urine marks or mouse droppings. You should be very attentive to the symptoms, because it is extremely difficult to treat these diseases, and if you start to the extreme stage, then in many cases it is impossible at all. So a simple rule of thumb is to be safe than sorry. The first way to deal with mice is the -Chinese method-, that is, relatively speaking, you should sit on the shore and wait for the corpse of your enemy to swim past you. That is, you should wait for winter - and the mice will disappear by themselves. They will be eaten by predators, they will freeze, they will starve, or they will migrate somewhere else. But this is dangerous, because while you wait and intend to survive, mice are active and can harm or even infect you. The second option is to provide so-called -mouseproofing-. To fix it, you should eliminate any attractions for mice and create insurmountable obstacles for rodents to get what they want - water, food, shelter, warmth. You cannot remove all rodents from the ecosystem, but it is quite possible to prevent mice from coming into contact with dishes, food, and hygiene products. All food products must be in sealed, mouse-proof packaging. There are a lot of possibilities for this - any hermetic boxes, containers, containers will do. Of course, by masking fortification shelters from the outside with branches, leaves, grass, turf, moss, etc., the soldiers themselves create hiding places for mice as well. But inside the dugout, it is possible to observe cleanliness and not to clutter it. If mouseproofing is a method of passive control, then cats and cats should be placed in the first place among active means of mouse control. They not only exterminate, but also deter and discipline rodents with their very presence. In second place after -cat remedies- comes mouse poison and finally, traps. These can be traps that kill the mouse or catch it alive, after which the rodent can be released outside the shelter or eliminated. Ordinary mousetraps are well known to everyone, so it is worth paying attention to very simple, but at the same time extremely effective homemade traps. First of all, these are the hunting pits, analogues of the -wolf hole-, but smaller, for mice, and the -mouse cylinder-. They work according to a similar principle. A -mouse hole- is a two-liter PET bottle with a cut bottom, dug into the ground with the neck downwards flush with the soil cut. -Mouse cylinder- is a pipe or tube, open on both sides, placed on the ground, inside which you should put a bunch of dry grass. In the -mouse hole- or -mouse cylinder- you should put a bait - something smelly. A piece of bread, or even a foam roll or a wick soaked in sunflower oil, will do. Attracted by the smell, mice will gather in such traps in large numbers. The plastic bottle with mice should then be covered with something on top and removed from the ground, and the -mouse cylinder- should be similarly closed on both sides and taken out of the room or trench. What can be done after that with mice is too much to explain. However, resorting to sadism is unacceptable. There are also velcro traps, which are generally effective, but this is also a somewhat sadistic method. Therefore, as a zoologist, I will not advertise it, but I will understand if soldiers in wartime resort to it as well. Finally, there are also various electronic means, but I am extremely skeptical about them. Most colleagues claim that they are not very efficient, to put it mildly. In addition, they require power and can potentially harm the operation of other military equipment or weapons, or even help the enemy identify the positions of Ukrainian defenders. There is a special section about mice at war and how to fight them - Biota of war and foreign species (theriological component)- on the website of the Ukrainian Theriological Society, that is, the scientific society of Ukrainian zoologists who study mammals. This section contains tips and information from dozens of our interviews, videos and other must-know materials. Some people are just curious to know about it, some want to navigate the situation, but for others it can be vital, literally a matter of life and death. Everyone who lives in the field, and during war, it is primarily the military, should remember the risks of any contact with rodents and take care of their own health and hygiene, preventing the risk of infection and creating the desired minimum comfort .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/myshi-proryvayut-front-v-okopah-zrosla-intensyvnist-dij-drg-gryzuniv/	2024-10-22T20:53:20-07:00
-A forester drove a car from Finland, who -has a tooth- on a Russian-: how does mobile dentistry wor...	Recently, the 46th Separate Airmobile Brigade of the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has an additional option of medical care - a mobile dental office. Since July, doctors have already received 179 patients. ArmiyaInform correspondents saw with their own eyes how military dentists work. — We provide almost a full range of assistance to servicemen, except for cases that already require extremely complex surgical intervention, says doctor Oleksandr. He is a maxillofacial surgeon by profession. Before the appearance of the dental office, he worked at the stabilization station of the brigade. For the third year, he has been serving under a contract in the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The idea of ​​mobile dentistry in the brigade was implemented in cooperation with Finnish volunteers. They helped purchase and convert the car. — The car was brought to us by a guy from Finland, he works as a forester. When I asked why he was helping, he answered: I have a -tooth- for Russians, my great-grandfather died during the Russo-Finnish war, Oleksandr recalls. According to him, so far all consumables are provided by volunteers, doctors also work with Ukrainian materials, in particular, they use domestic photopolymers and anesthetics. — I have a dynasty of dentists, I had a certain supply of tools. Furniture, equipment - from Finland. The Finns are ready to take more, the doctor adds. Recently, an X-ray was added to the equipment, it is done right there on the spot - four seconds, and the picture is revealed. At the time of our arrival, a military serviceman came to the doctors with a complaint of toothache. He says that this is not the first time he has turned to mobile dentistry in the brigade. — At first, I did not trust a little, the guys are young, I doubted whether they had enough experience. But now I'm sure: they're doing great, he says. If necessary, the mobile office can also work stationary, the car is connected to the sewage system, there is heating for the winter period. -We are ready to help our brothers at any time,- the doctors add.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/z-finlyandiyi-prygnav-mashynu-lisnyk-kotryj-maye-zub-na-rosiyan-yak-praczyuye-mobilna-stomatologiya-na-fronti/	2024-10-22T20:40:39-07:00
The electronic eye of Ukrainian air defense systems: what is known about the radar integrated in NAS...	About how productively these complexes defend the Ukrainian sky, ArmyInform repeatedly told in her materials. Therefore, it is quite natural to take a closer look at the -electronic eyes- of this air defense system, which are the AN/MPQ-64 F1 Sentinel radar. But first, let us remind you that NASAMS is a medium-range anti-aircraft missile complex developed by the Norwegian company Kongsberg and the American Raytheon. Its acronym stands for Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System, i.e. -Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System-. This air defense system is designed to attack air targets at low and medium altitudes in any weather conditions. Sentinel (Ukrainian: -Sentinel-, -Defender- or -Guardian-) is a short-range 3D radar that is used to identify threats and quickly alert air defense forces. The radar system operates in the X-band of radio frequencies (8–12 GHz) and uses the Doppler effect — the change in frequency and wavelength as the source moves relative to the device. The maximum range is up to 120 km, but effective operation is limited to 75 km. One of the key features of the AN/MPQ-64 F1 radar is its ability to simultaneously track more than 60 targets while maintaining the ability to constantly search for new threats. This guarantees excellent situational awareness, which is especially important in difficult combat conditions. Three-dimensional tracking is provided by narrow beam technology, which provides operators with the detailed data necessary to make operational decisions. This radar not only detects targets, but can also classify them, which increases the effectiveness of air defense systems. The antenna provides phase-frequency electronic scanning, forming a three-dimensional picture of large surveillance. It is mounted on a fast-rotating platform (30 revolutions per minute) for fast 360-degree scanning. The towed platform allows the antenna to be away from the main unit and work autonomously, maintaining communications. communication with the fire control center over a broadband fiber optic line or SINCGARS, a military-style single-channel ground radio system used by the US Army. Developers have made the radar highly resistant to electronic warfare and anti-radar missiles. Sentinel interacts with the architectures of several air and missile defense systems, including the Increment I anti-missile, artillery, and mortar (C-RAM) system to protect friendly aircraft when firing at complex targets. It should be noted that with In 2022, these radars began to be integrated with the Patriot air defense system, which is known to belong to long-range anti-aircraft systems. Integration takes place with the help of the new American combat control system IBCS (Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System). It is the -brain- of the complex air defense system. IBCS processes data received from various sources, including satellites and reconnaissance aircraft, and on the basis of this, further decisions on opening fire are made. The radar is powered by a built-in diesel generator with a frequency of 400 Hz. The transmission line to the weapons system consists of a broadband fiber optic cable. This data can also be transmitted to the radar data network. Weighing in at 1,800 kg, the AN/MPQ-64 F1 is easily transported using various platforms such as all-terrain vehicles, helicopters or mounted on rooftops for extended range. span> The mobility of the radar makes it ideal for use in difficult combat conditions that require a quick reaction. The design allows the system to be deployed in less than 15 minutes, which reduces the time required to start work and ensures operational efficiency in combat conditions. AN/MPQ-64 Radar.

Lying Drama: Propaganda spreads staged videos about International Legion soldiers	So, Russian resources shared a video about a tragic story that allegedly happened in Poland. In the video, it is said that a Polish soldier from the International Legion allegedly killed his wife and her -Ukrainian lover-, then set fire to his own apartment and committed suicide. In addition, the Russians spread a fake that the body of a soldier from the International Legion was returned to Colombia without internal organs. In the fabricated story, the mother of this soldier allegedly claims that she asked for an explanation from the leadership of the International Legion and was told that her son's organs were transplanted to wounded comrades. Both videos are productions that have no connection with reality. Information about these incidents could not be found on any of the foreign resources. Obviously, this -news- is completely fabricated. With such intrusions, Russian propagandists are trying to spoil Ukraine's relations with partner countries, worsen the attitude towards Ukrainian refugees abroad, and cultivate a negative image of our country in the world. And the main thing is to discredit the military units of the Armed Forces, in which volunteers - citizens of other countries - serve.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/brehlyva-dramaturgiya-rospropaganda-poshyryuye-postanovochni-video-pro-vijskovyh-internaczionalnogo-legionu/	2024-10-22T20:14:31-07:00
Destruction in portions - Azovs destroy assault groups of Russians in New York	The video of the battles was released on October 22 on the brigade's channel. The occupiers use armored personnel carriers to throw their stormtroopers into the city, where they try to attack. But the people of Azov destroy them in abandoned houses and on the paths of the private sector. -The suburbs of New York are a place where there is no place for calm and busy days. Here, every hour, the enemy -throws- the Defense Forces with equipment and people, tries to break through the defense line or go to the rear. -In recent weeks, the fighters of -Azov- managed to level and stabilize the front line, thereby stopping the pace of the enemy's advance,- the brigade commented on the video.

The occupiers are already recruiting ten-year-old children	reported this on October 22 by the prosecutor's office of the Kharkiv region with reference to the interview of its head Oleksandr Filchakov. According to his data, since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupying forces, 243 persons have been notified of suspicion of treason, 1,031 persons of collaboration activity, 64 persons of assistance to the aggressor state, and of unauthorized dissemination of information on the direction, movement of weapons, armaments and military supplies to Ukraine, movement, transfer or deployment of armed forces, etc. — 65. According to the results of the pre-trial investigation of criminal proceedings under the specified articles, indictments against 1,003 persons were sent to the court. 25 people have already been convicted of treason. 511 collaborators were also convicted. 5 people were found guilty of aiding the aggressor state, and 32 people were found guilty of disseminating information about the movement of the Armed Forces, etc. As reported by ArmyInform, two schoolchildren in Kharkiv accused of arson. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/22/okupanty-vzhe-verbuyut-desyatyrichnyh-ditej/	2024-10-22T11:42:56-07:00

For bezREB, Ukraine is looking for ways to combat Russian electronic warfare	This was reported by the Deputy Prime Minister for Innovation, Development of Education, Science and of Technologies, Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov. Enemy EW is one of the main challenges on the front. Because of it, drones lose their signal and do not complete their tasks, fighters do not receive important orders, and missiles go off course. The front needs effective solutions in the direction of countering WEB. To find them, Brave1 organized a -REB vs FPV- Demo Day. The event brought together 45 teams with the best developments in the field of drones and countermeasures against radio-electronic warfare. The teams tested their developments under the influence of powerful EW systems in the field. The work was evaluated by representatives of the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine and feedback was given. The military's focus has been on fiber-optic FPV kamikazes, repeater copters, and drones, which are carriers of lighter strike drones. The military and developers must work as one ecosystem to maximize the effectiveness of front-line technologies. Brave1's Demo Day helps manufacturers realistically assess the battlefield and adapt designs to the challenges of war. As reported by ArmyInform, Brave1 already more than 2,800 defense developments, most of which appeared after 2022. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/22/dlya-bezrebya-v-ukrayini-shukayut-sposoby-borotby-z-rosijskym-reb/	2024-10-22T11:09:36-07:00

-Heroes- in stacks - dead Russian soldiers are carried like firewood	The video with stacks of coffins was published by the Perm independent channel -36.6-. The Russian authorities do not want to pay for even such an economical way of transporting the dead, so they force the widows of the -heroes of the SVO- to pay for the delivery of the bodies. Wives of war participants, who are in the -Hammer- volunteer battalion, complained about this. On the other hand, this very method of transportation seems quite fair for creatures who went to kill in a foreign country for money, but did not think that they could kill them.

The -death line- in Kursk was moved: the Russians were forced to appoint a new sentence of the opera...	About the above deadline the Russian military-political leadership has now determined and how realistic it is on the air of the national marathon -Edyni Novyni- said the spokesman of OTU -Siversk- Vadym Mysnyk. — From the first days of the operation, the Russians have been trying to displace our forces. But we see that their deadlines were first counted in days, then weeks, and finally months. Now they immediately moved the deadline to the end of winter, he said. All the loud statements of the enemy's propaganda once again turned out to be empty chatter. — They already see that they will not succeed in anything. The daring counterattacks announced by their propaganda, when they have already surrounded Suja and everything else, all this does not work. Our Defense Forces carry out combat tasks, fight back and destroy the enemy as much as possible, the military officer emphasized. He noted that the enemy had transferred significant forces to the Kursk direction, intended for conducting assault operations, but had not achieved any notable successes. — We are watching the enemy overturn. These are amphibious units and marine units. It is these units that are to carry out assault operations. There is also a lot of armored military equipment. However, we are already thinning it out very well here, he said. The spokesman predicts that, due to worsening weather conditions, the activity of the enemy's offensive actions will decrease. -Weather conditions are being signaled and the activity of offensive actions should decrease, so they immediately move another deadline to the end of winter,- explained Vadym Mysnyk. However, the Defense Forces do not believe any of the enemy's claims, as they may be part of an information operation. — In particular, we do not pay attention to such statements, because they can also be false messages, so that we relax a little in some sense. We have intelligence, we see who is fighting against us, what forces the enemy is throwing. Therefore, we are carrying out appropriate countermeasures in order to continue the Kursk operation, hold these territories, strike the enemy and destroy him, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, worked with units operating in Sumy and Kurshchyna and presented awards, including more than 60 state awards, to servicemen of the Airborne Assault Troops brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for their participation in combat operations in the Kursk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/22/liniyu-smerti-na-kurshhyni-posunuly-rosiyan-zmusyly-pryznachyty-novyj-rechenecz-operacziyi/	2024-10-22T10:37:09-07:00

According to the results of comprehensive measures in Kyiv and Vinnytsia region, the organizers of the riots were detained. Among them is a lawyer and an official of the VLK, as well as a fraudster who posed as a Ukrainian volunteer. For money, dealers helped evaders to avoid the draft due to forged documents, and the cost of their services was from 6 to 10 thousand US dollars. The amount depended on the urgency and type of -scheme-. In this way, he -guaranteed- evaders to avoid mobilization and unimpeded travel abroad under the guise of a business trip.

Two factories in Mariupol will be handed over to	Mariupol City Council informs about this. The goal, according to the occupiers, is to -restore production activities of enterprises.- But it is unlikely that the occupiers will particularly invest in the modernization of destroyed industrial facilities. After all, they do not even seek to restore metallurgical plants. Most likely, they plan to start electric furnaces and melt the stolen scrap metal into more convenient forms for transportation. We will remind that -Azovmash- was one of the largest machine-building concerns of Ukraine. The group's businesses effectively ceased operations in 2015 due to bankruptcy.

This was announced by the President in his evening address. -All this must be dealt with carefully and promptly. The MSEK system should be liquidated.

The problem is not only that officials make themselves disabled through connections, but also that people who have received a real disability - in particular, in combat - often cannot get the appropriate status and fair benefits. The government has little time to fix this. -There should also be personal responsibility and personnel decisions due to this situation in the central authorities - along the vertical control over MSEK. The decision of the National Security Council now provides for a full audit of pensions and other payments to all officials who -organized- their disabilities,- he added.

What to expect from the military of North Korea: the expert talked about the consequences for Ukrain...	It became known that Russia plans to involve more than 10,000 soldiers. How will the involvement of the North Korean military in the Russian army change the situation at the front? What are the consequences for Ukraine? Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmyInform about this: -Does North Korea have enough forces and means to help the Russian Federation? Yes, it has. Gotta give them their due. A small nation of 25 million, it has a powerful and numerous army. More than one million hundred thousand, this is a regular army and at least three million mobilization resources. Since 1953, when the Korean War took place and the 50th parallel was drawn, North Korea has managed to put a huge amount of artillery weapons and ammunition in its warehouses. Up to one and a half million munitions were delivered to our territory from North Korea to meet the needs of the troops. These are barrel artillery (122 1,152 mm) and mortars, primarily of 82 mm caliber. North Korea managed to continue the Iskander missile program even better than the Russians themselves. They created the KN-23 missile. In fact, the KN-23 is a North Korean copy of the Russian Iskander, which is why it is sometimes called the Kimskander. There are confirmed facts that these missiles have already been used against us. It is known that they were used in Kharkiv, Selidovo in Donetsk region, wreckage with North Korean markings was found near Kyiv. So, de facto, they are already engaged in a war against us. From the point of view of geopolitics, the participation of North Korean units in the war against Ukraine is a major historical event. After all, the global axis of evil is emerging, which includes Russia, North Korea, Iran, Syria, and partly China. Plus, even Cameroon may soon join here. Recently, a low-profile African president like Paul Biya attended Putin's reception. The president of Cameroon, a de facto dictator who has been in power in that country since 1982. Putin groups this global axis of evil around himself. That is, there is a struggle between tyranny and democracy. In fact, a military-political alliance was concluded between North Korea and the Russian Federation. The relevant documents have been submitted for ratification in the State Duma of the Russian Federation. And such a step is the final nail in the modern international security system. Putin destroys it and shows that he will not count with anyone. In order for there to be something tangible at the front, it is necessary to create a fully mechanized brigade of North Koreans in the composition of the Russian Federation. This is up to 5 thousand people. They need to be equipped with armored vehicles, more than 100 units, artillery, communications and so on. And the most important thing is the compatibility of troops. North Korean language is very difficult to learn. I can't imagine how they will be able to interact with the Russians at the level of platoon and company commanders. And without interaction on the battlefield, such a unit is definitely doomed to death, no matter how well armed and trained it is. It is quite possible that DPRK units can be involved, for example, in Kurshchyna as engineering teams to prepare lines of fortifications, mine territories, build caponiers and other engineering structures. These tasks do not require operational interaction. Accordingly, the Russians can release their engineering units, turn them into infantry and send them, for example, to reinforce their troops in Donetsk. Another possible use of North Korean units. They can replace, for example, Russian brigades that perform tasks on the border with the regions of Ukraine. I emphasize that in order for the North Korean troops to really make a difference in the Russian-Ukrainian war, a full-fledged corps must be sent. This is up to 40 thousand personnel. I very much doubt that will happen. Why? Because North Korea started war tensions with South Korea. Railways and highways have been blown up, and it looks like somewhere there is going to explode. I can't imagine how Kim Jong-un can disperse even his large army on our military bridgehead and on a potential South Korean one. The most important conclusion: Putin raised the stakes again. What should be the answer? The answer is very clear and simple. We need weapons and more weapons.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/22/chogo-chekaty-vid-vijskovyh-pivnichnoyi-koreyi-ekspert-rozpoviv-pro-naslidky-dlya-ukrayiny/	2024-10-21T21:00:10-07:00
Two kilometers under artillery fire and drops from drones. Lieutenant Sokolyuk told why he received ...	ArmyInform tells more about the soldier. Dmytro has no service experience, he has a military department at the Precarpathian National University named after him. V. Stefanyka. Graduated from it in 2016. Private entrepreneur, ski, snowboard and motorcycle instructor. -He worked part-time as a watchman, and because of that, he got his call sign - -Watchman- - because the TCC was mobilized from the watchhouse,- he says, laughing. Joined the army in August 2023. Assigned to the position of platoon leader. But sometimes he says, he also had to perform the duties of a company commander. From the end of 2023, his infantry company performed combat missions in the Zaporizhzhia region. One of his combat episodes is the events in Zaporozhye. -We were assigned to the 82nd brigade and given the most difficult defense area for us all the time. We had to walk approximately 2 kilometers under constant artillery fire and drone attacks with drops and FPV, at the end we were waiting for enemy trenches, turned by loopholes in our direction, which had to be shot through before going west, occupy them and dig in as deep as possible - so that in the event of enemy attacks, we did less damage. -Birds- constantly flew above us and watched so that no one approached us unnoticed. The shelling was almost continuous, but we dug in well and, apart from some light contusions, they did not affect us in any way. After that, we were replaced by guys from another company, and we safely left our positions under fire after 2 days of travel,- he recalls this episode. Later, in the application for the state award, the military command described these events as follows: -In the course of conducting defensive operations, he repeatedly personally went to firing positions, leading groups of servicemen, led personnel during combat missions and ensured the implementation of assigned tasks. Thus, the group led by him successfully completed the combat task of occupying positions at the front edge of the defense, thereby establishing fire control over the specified sector and preventing the enemy from occupying new lines.- We ask you to recall the brightest moment from this foray. The officer says the following: -On the way, we hid in a hole that was surrounded by tank mines. And drops from drones between them began. But we left our backpacks near another hole and because of that it was bombed more,- says the officer, laughing. Colleagues say that the military man is proactive in battle, skillfully and coolly makes important decisions. -In my opinion, the most important thing for a commander during the execution of tasks is not to panic, because it can have a very negative impact on decision-making, because of which you can lose the most valuable thing - the lives of your comrades,- states the officer. They were also asked about the lack of personnel in the army, about -Busification- in the rear cities and what the officer would like to say to people who have not yet joined the Defense Forces for various reasons. Dmytro Sokolyuk answers this as follows: -The question is very controversial. In my opinion, unmotivated -dodgers- often become a burden for fellow students. It is better to have fewer people in the unit, but only those who can be relied on.''

-No one will be put on it just like that-: we show the -secret- Valuk armored personnel carriers in ...	Correspondents of Army TV -found- these vehicles in the 44th separate mechanized brigade, whose fighters spoke in more detail about their armored personnel carriers, their weapons, training, war fears and motivation to defend their home. The boys are happy to meet us at their dugout, and before taking us to the caponira with the -beater-, we are traditionally treated to coffee. In the East, the first cold weather is about to begin - the fighters say that it got a little cold that night. Together with us to the place where Valuk is hiding, through the already soft ground, which will soon turn into a swamp, the dog Balbes went. Even he lives here in a booth covered with a camouflage net so as not to reveal his position to enemy drones. The vehicles of the 44th OMBr are carefully camouflaged, now they are on combat duty, the crew is ready to go on a mission at any moment. And while the guys have a little time, they will tell us what kind of armored personnel carrier it is and how it is used. Almost a quarter of a century ago, Slovenia produced these vehicles for its Armed Forces thanks to a license agreement with the Austrian manufacturer of light wheeled armored vehicles Pandur. They were named in honor of the prince of the ancient Slovenian state of Karantania. The guys say that they now have a -commander's- car on duty. Here, in contrast to the base model, there are not six landing places, but four. Such an armored personnel carrier is also distinguished by the fact that it has a separate hole in the armor for the commander to view. Three more seats in all models are provided for the crew. But if necessary, the landing party can also be carried on armor. It is interesting that in almost all photos on the Internet, cars have special -huts- for mechanical drives. But the guys said that they only protect from rain and are intended purely for transportation. Therefore, they removed them from their car. &nbsp; In general, these 12-ton light armored vehicles are also purely transport, sanitary and even mortar. But the soldiers of the 44th OMBr Valuk are equipped with a grenade launcher. The manufacturer claims that it has a range of 600 km. But Oleksiy, the driver-mechanic, tells us that on a dirt road, a full tank is enough for 300 km, and the tank holds 270 liters of -diesel-. -In terms of speed, it gains a hundred on asphalt, and it drives on a country road, that's if it's dry,- says the fighter and admits that the car, although not new, is clearly made of high quality. Before engaging Valuk in combat operations, the Ukrainian and Slovenian military conducted thorough training of equipment and personnel. First, training in combat work in Ukraine, and then all the subtleties, technical points and fixing already in Germany. Oleksiy remembers the time spent abroad very fondly. Slovenian instructors taught our boys at the German training ground. They practiced taking tank ditches, overcoming minefields, transporting infantry. The gunner-operator of the armored personnel carrier with the call sign -Password- does not recall particularly funny situations during the training, because there was a lot of work. Instead, he says that our guys used to get stuck in the hatches, because there is not much space for the crew in these cars. Oleksiy remembered how the Slovenes saw off the Ukrainians after the exercises with tears in their eyes: -They treated us kind of well. I liked both the training itself and their attitude towards us. It can be seen that it was not a command instruction, it was human.- Mehvod adds that the Slovenian military perfectly understood everything and supported, one might even say, took care in order to have time to teach everything and transfer the equipment while there is such an opportunity. In general, guys positively evaluate the construction of this -beater-. Nothing difficult in maintenance and use, especially after intensive training, is not seen. Of the additional -chips-, Mekhvod mentions interior heating and -Webasto-. He starts Valuk with us and says that he will not let his car out of the hood without blowing it. We must note that the APC itself is not silent. If we talk about weather conditions, then there is no need to talk about any exceptional passability. As for any wheeled vehicle. It is difficult in the mud, more or less drives on sand and snow, says Oleksiy and adds that this APC has a Scania engine, an American gearbox, an automatic fire extinguishing system and a radiation/chemical protection system. -Everything is done reliably, you can feel it,- he says. Mentions that there are means to work at night, but notes that technologically this is not what is currently relevant on the battlefield. The gunner -Parol- already tells us about the open turret: -You stand up to your waist in it. The turret itself is barely below my chest. Looks like a lot, actually, that's the big minus of it.- -That is, imagine, you drive a kilometer and a half to the goal and you look half of it. We have a drone war, it's very dangerous.- When it comes to the use of these -beaters-, we joke with the guys that Valuk is an armored -taxi-. Gunner -Parol- fixes it right away: a lightly armored -taxi- with a grenade launcher and a solid bottom that can protect against anti-personnel mines. Yes, in addition to the main armor, which is designed to hit 7.62 mm caliber, there are also Kevlar plates inside. Separately, there is an external hinged ceramic protection, but our fighters did not see it. The frontal armor is designed to hit 12.7 mm caliber. A gunner-operator, who used to serve in a machine gun platoon, sets up, loads and tells us about his German 40 mm automatic grenade launcher, an analogue of the Mk 19. He says that the range of the grenade launcher, so that it works on target, is one and a half kilometers. -Anyone will not be allowed to work on such equipment,- explains Parol, who joined the army long before the large-scale invasion and fought in the 72nd OMBr. He was in the infantry, then he was wounded and ended up in the 44th OMBr. Killing power is 105 squares, and it covers 15 squares with shrapnel. m; against infantry, against lightly armored vehicles, the tool is very good, effective, -Password- states. But still, he believes that the Valuk is best suited as a delivery or evacuation of infantry. His brother Oleksiy agrees with him, adding that due to the risk of falling under the FPV pack, it is difficult to use this -beater- for its direct purpose. -He maneuvers very well, the speed is there. You can fly in quickly, the rear ramp has been lowered, the infantry is already in place, what is needed. He does a very good job at this,- summarizes Parol. The guys say that they are released on vacation according to the law. But still, 30 days a year is not that much. They advise you to join the Armed Forces, taking into account your skills, because simply wanting to take up a position is not enough. When asked what he remembers most about the war, -Password- answers: -It's primarily the people, not the combat stories. Most of all, I will remember my brothers, the team, the boys, the people present here. Here, someone always saves someone, we help each other.- And yes, if we talk about combat operations, he admits that it is often scary. -But it's natural, and you have to learn to control your fear,- says the gunner and adds that a well-coordinated team, brothers in whom you are confident, helps especially in this. -I'm only interested in one thing - that everyone is alive, healthy and doing their job,- the fighter explains. When asked what he would say to civilians who are still hesitating whether to join the army, Parol answers that he should go help. -It's just necessary. There is such a word -must-. And that's it. Scary, yes. There is nothing good here. We have to, because it will be worse. Worse for everyone. They will just come home to you, he reasoned emotionally. -Something must be done, because we will be destroyed as a people.- It's hard not to agree with what Password says.

The US conducted the first successful tests of missile reloading and ship rearmament at sea	The US Navy is moving closer to re-arming its surface combatant ships at sea because of the ongoing missile threat to military and commercial shipping, writes U.S. Naval Institute. -Without the ability to re-arm at sea, our servicemen must return to port, sometimes thousands of miles away, as they sometimes have to do in the Red Sea. After we launch the missiles, we will have to return to other ports to re-arm. The ability to rearm at sea will be critical to any future conflict in the Pacific and elsewhere,- US Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said. The Minister was personally present at the tests and observed the Transportable At-Sea Reloading Method (TRAM) during the resupply operation of the MK-41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) when both ships were underway. The TRAM concept is not new. In the 1990s, engineers at the Naval Surface Warfare Center developed a prototype idea for replenishing VLS stores on warships. But after the Gulf War, the prototype was never fully developed, and the system remained in storage as the anticipated need for such sea-based refueling capabilities diminished. In 2022, Del Toro revived the idea. Early experiments involved reloading two destroyers using a crane and a support vessel in San Diego Bay in October 2022. Despite the fact that TRAM is a 30-year-old idea, according to Rear Admiral Peter Small, the technology is certainly helping and has allowed for the demonstration of control and precision in mission execution. -This will really affect our next steps as we move towards scaling this capability and deploying it on both cruisers and destroyers,- Small said. Currently, experts are studying the collected data to scale the project to all possible types of weapons on American surface combat ships. Research is also underway to integrate TRAM on other US Navy vessels.

A ticket to a sanatorium or TV: propaganda lies about -inviting- pensioners to join the army	How found out fact-checkers of Ukrinform, the leaflet distributed on the network is a fake created by propagandists. At most, the photo of a man in American military uniform, which was used for a fake, can be found on stock image sites. The Russians like to use the image of this particular man in a uniform for various advertisements. For example, it appears in publications about military stocks in the Russian Federation. It is not the first time that the occupiers have speculated on the topic of pensioners. Earlier, propagandists launched a fake that allegedly -employees of the TCC and SP pay pensioners to turn in evasion.- Such -news- are outright lies and delusions aimed at discrediting the Ukrainian military. In this way, the Russian special services seek to weaken Ukraine's defense capabilities. Such fakes are created to confirm the opinion that nobody in Ukraine wants to defend their country, and war seems to benefit only the ruling elite. Russia also promotes the narrative that Ukraine no longer has the human resources to fight the aggressor with lies about service in the retired army.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/22/putivka-do-sanatoriyu-abo-televizor-rospropaganda-breshe-pro-zaproshennya-pensioneriv-do-vijska/	2024-10-21T20:19:33-07:00

The spokesman reported that the Russian aggressors are constantly experimenting and trying to improve anti-aircraft missiles, and explained what this is all about. — They are experimenting with the application and modernization of these tools. This technology is not perfect, but they are forced to do it because they can no longer get so close to the launch points of these KABs, the officer explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that last day, the Russian military chaotically hit Kharkov with KABs to terrorize local residents and collected photo and video evidence of these war crimes of the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/21/modernizuyut-kaby-shho-zmushuye-okupantiv-do-tehnichnyh-novaczij-na-harkivskomu-napryamku/	2024-10-21T11:57:55-07:00

The President announced this on October 21 in his evening address. -Today, Ukraine is grateful for this support. We need Ukraine to be able to defend its sovereignty and independence despite any political threats in the world,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He promised that every meeting with partners will be dedicated to this. -Today, with US Defense Secretary Austin, we talked about the implementation of our Victory plan, about concrete steps that can implement the plan's points. We need the determination of our partners, especially against the background of information about North Korea's new role in supporting Russia,- the President said. In his opinion, Putin is afraid of peace and that is why he is looking for ways to increase aggression and now bring North Korea to the front. -This is a clear signal to the whole world who only wants war. And in such a situation, I am grateful to every leader and every state that is now increasing its support for Ukraine. Those who supported the first inaugural peace summit are also helping us prepare for the second summit. To prepare it in such a way that it becomes truly effective,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He reminded that more than a hundred countries and international organizations were with Ukraine at the first peace summit. All the principles of peace restoration that Ukraine proposed are completely based on the UN Charter and key international documents. -Then, in June, when 100 participants gathered to support peace for Ukraine and the full effectiveness of the UN Charter. Indeed, they felt that all states were equal at the table. There was real respect for the norms of international law. And this is exactly what the second peace summit should be,- said the President. According to him, today he also held important meetings with the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine General Oleksandr Syrskyi, Chief of the General Staff Lieutenant General Anatoly Barhylevych, and Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov. -They discussed in detail the situation at the front, in the main directions: Toretska, Pokrovska, Kurakhivska, Kharkiv and others.

The Kursk operation was discussed separately. We hold our positions there,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy assured. He thanked each soldier for their bravery. -We must remember that the Kursk operation provides a strategic goal: the war must return to the territory from which it came. This is true when a buffer zone is created on the aggressor's territory. Also, the Kursk operation allowed Ukraine to do more active work regarding exchanges and returning our soldiers from Russian captivity,- the President noted. He thanked the combat brigades, every unit fighting on the front lines. But he also touched on the problems in the rear. -And one more thing. Today, the necessary preparatory meetings were held before the National Security Council. Lots of new details.

What are the enemy's technical innovations and how can they be countered on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- he told spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Lt. Col. Yevhenii Romanov. — Technologies in war are developing very rapidly, so certain technical solutions are based on other technical solutions for countermeasures. Therefore, the enemy, in the conditions of using various countermeasures, decided that wire technologies would help him, he said. However, the military officer noted, such innovations also have certain limitations. -But they impose certain restrictions, that is, the unmanned aerial vehicle turns into a conventional anti-tank guided missile with wire guidance, which imposes certain restrictions on the tactics of its use,- the officer noted. At the same time, it is not only about the range of use of the aerial drone, but also about the ability of the UAV to maneuver among obstacles and the dependence on control over the fiber optic thread. — The wire is not infinite, it weighs something and it can get caught or on some obstacles, obstacles. This is the kind of technology used in anti-tank missiles, the spokesman explained. He noted that there are already ways to counter such drones, including adaptation to the new conditions of standard anti-aircraft defense schemes. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the north of the Kharkiv region, Russians are using fiber-optic drones, strengthening EW devices and trying to adapt to weather conditions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/21/drony-na-motuzochczi-zapuskayut-okupanty-na-harkivshhyni-chy-ye-poryatunok-vid-drotovyh-bpla/	2024-10-21T10:08:54-07:00

3 Russians who tortured a Ukrainian patriot in the Mykolayiv region will be tried	About this reported on October 21 by the National Police of Ukraine. For this, the occupiers first beat and tortured him: they tied his hands with plastic cuffs and sawed his teeth with a saw, and then they cut off his fingers and shot him. This information was reported by eyewitnesses of the crime during inspections of the scene, interrogation of witnesses, conducting investigative experiments and hundreds of other investigative actions. Police officers discovered this crime while processing information about war crimes in the Mykolaiv Region. Among the found evidence of Russian atrocities was the interception of a conversation of Russian military personnel, which testified to the torture and murder of a civilian. With no information about victims or witnesses at the time, investigators did painstaking work and identified three invaders who tortured and killed a civilian man. In order to identify the perpetrators and the victims, the police checked all the facts of the murders of civilians in the de-occupied territory of the Mykolaiv and Kherson regions and contacted all the heads of local villages and territorial communities. After interviewing them, they discovered the fact that took place at the end of March 2022 in one of the settlements of the Sniguriv district of the Mykolaiv region. Having established the place of burial of the murdered, the police exhumed the body for forensic examination and comparative genetic molecular examination with relatives of the deceased. Specialists of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine helped establish the identity of the killers. Having all the necessary information, the investigators of the National Police established and proved the involvement in the torture and murder of a civilian of three Russian military personnel, namely, the commanders and a soldier of the 108th Airborne Assault Regiment from the Krasnodar Territory, who at the time of the crime were stationed on the territory of the Sniguriv District of the Mykolaiv Region.

To carry out enemy tasks, the participants used flammable mixtures, and the fires were recorded on video, which were then -reported- to the Russian Federation. In this way, they hoped to receive -easy- money from their Russian curators. However, instead of the promised funds, the arsonists received suspicion from Ukrainian law enforcement officers. &nbsp; For example, in Dnipro Oblast, law enforcement officers exposed two 16-year-old residents of the Nikopol district, who set fire to a military vehicle and a relay box near an important railway line. -Before the arson, the perpetrators performed the -verification- tasks of the Russian curator, in particular, painted -Z-graffiti- on the walls of the buildings,- the report says. Also in Cherkasy region, following hot pursuit, law enforcement officers detained two residents of Uman, aged 16 and 21, who, during the day, burned a multivan and an SUV of the Armed Forces of Ukraine that were undergoing maintenance after completing combat missions at the front. -Three more youths who set fire to eight relay cabinets on railway lines were detained in Odesa. In this way, the enemy hoped to disrupt the logistics of the Defense Forces in the direction of the southern front,- the SBU said. Currently, all detainees have been notified of suspicion (according to the crimes committed) under the following articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: The extras face from 8 years in prison to life imprisonment with confiscation of property.

Masters of Hide and Seek: The Black Sea Fleet is almost impossible to find	About this told spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk According to him, the Russians currently cannot actually use their fleet as intended. Their choices are limited to either hiding in ports or participating in combined missile attacks. Returning to Crimea is not even considered now. -And in fact, if they were guided, first of all, by military expediency, they would probably have already left the Azov-Black Sea region. This would be in the tradition of the Russian Imperial Navy, they have done it many times. And during the Second World War and in the middle of the 19th century,- noted Dmytro Pletenchuk. In fact, the Russians can no longer use their fleet for their intended purpose. -Yes, they can go to sea and join a combined attack and launch some number of 'Calibres'. In the last attack, they did just that — they launched 28 units. 100% of these missiles were destroyed. Therefore, the effectiveness of the presence of the Black Sea Fleet in the Azov-Black Sea region is in great question. And we know the answer to this question, which the Russians still cannot accept,- stated the spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

-Chinese-, -Grandfather-, -Chaplain- and -Doctor-: how the -four musketeers- stormed the house at In...	During Russia's modern aggressive war against Ukraine, it is difficult in Cuba, because aerial bombardment, massive artillery fire, as well as air and, to a lesser extent, ground drones make their corrections. It is possible to prepare for battle under such circumstances only under the conditions of multi-stage training, which involves a combination of various components and modules, the combination and composition of which will allow the fighter to choose the correct tactics of action in a specific tactical situation. An ArmyInform correspondent tells about one of these -tactical modules- from instructors of NATO countries during the BZVP as part of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. During training, we are not given callsigns - it would be too difficult for instructors, especially foreign ones, to remember familiar Ukrainian words and relate them to a specific cadet. So we have numbers - 24 or 26, 32 or 36. We call each other by our names, but we have already managed to come up with -call names-: -Chaplain-, -Chinese-, -Grandfather- and -Doctor-. It's more of a want than a necessity during training, but the girls decided and insisted that everyone in the department must have a call sign. I really don't like my call sign or the call signs of my comrades, because they are clearly not original: -Chaplains-, -Chinese-, -Grandfathers- and -Doctors- in the ZSU are already plentiful. Therefore, I consider callsigns -educational- and just as temporary as numbers. During classes, we often practice exercises with just such a four, changing places in it from the first to the fourth. It helps a lot, because we learned to understand each other in half a word and even in moments. However, there is also the flip side of the coin - when we, on our own initiative or on the orders of the instructors, individually or in pairs, move to another four, the developed coordination disappears. However, the ability to interact with all the soldiers of the unit and platoon, so we are -shuffled- from time to time. We do not object and often resort to -internal rotation- ourselves, even without the orders of the instructors. However, when it comes to the -testing and demonstration- performance of the exercise, we try to gather exactly -our- four. And this time, when we go to -test- with -foreign- instructors. They are strangers only conditionally, because they train one of the other platoons on a regular basis. However, neither they nor we know them as well as the instructors who train us all the time. The replacement of teachers is resorted to from time to time for various reasons - to give colleagues a break, to organize classes with the best specialist, or, as is the case now, to accept the test without prejudice to the cadets. -Our- instructors, after several weeks of continuous classes, not only perceive us as close people, but also sometimes show this attitude. So, in order to prevent any kind of leniency, we are sent to -spouses- as a test. However, it is thanks to working with -foreign- instructors that we are able to assemble our usual four. Not knowing our -inner kitchen- in detail, trainers from the neighboring platoon do not pay attention to it. More than anything, if we were to pass the test to our instructors, they would make us shuffle. However, for now, we are relishing the opportunity to get together as a foursome. We let others go ahead of us, because we decided to be the last to go to the test. We remind each other of the actions during the storming and clearing of the house. Previously, we had already worked out all the modules as separate elements and assembled them several times. So now it's obviously going to be a comprehensive exercise taking into account all the actions we know. Finally, it's our turn and we head down the street in the direction of the house. We know how to approach a building, what factors to consider and how to control dangerous sectors. We know how to climb the stairs, open the door, go inside and climb the stairs again. We know how to move between floors and rooms, how to detect mine traps and avoid them, how to notice the presence of the enemy and react to it. We now apply all our knowledge comprehensively and act as one team. Eyes, trunks and bodies move as if in a dance that is understandable only to those who know why and why each of us performs this or that action in this way and not otherwise. During practice outside and inside the house, we change places several times, when the first becomes the second, third or last, and the fourth, on the contrary, takes the place of the first. When we switch places, the fuses click quietly and harmoniously. Actions with automatic weapons resemble fencing techniques - lunges are sharp or smooth, fast or slow, visible or hidden. Movements are honed to automatism - we act first, and then we realize why we acted the way we did. Only later will I realize that I felt like a musketeer and belatedly give myself the commands -En guarde- and -Allez!-. It will happen after the command to stop sounds and the instructors invite us to step-by-step review of our actions. At some point, I open fire into a dark doorway a split second earlier than a counter-shot from a notional enemy. The sounds of the two shots almost merge into one and I pile on another 5 or 7 shots until the enemy stops firing back. What made me shoot first can be found out only later during the -after-action review- - -flight analysis-. Instructors invite to him and ask in detail why we acted in this way and not in another way. They approvingly listen to their fellow citizens - who, how and why opened the door, entered the room first, threw a grenade. Everything is done right - from the moment of driving down the street to the command -Halte!-. At some point I have to answer why I shot into the dark hole and at first I don't know what to say. -The movement of air ahead, the hint of a dark silhouette and the click of an enemy weapon's safety,- I finally articulate. -Is that enough to open fire?- the instructor asks. I have to admit that I didn't, because I didn't identify the enemy with sufficient certainty and could have shot at best into the void and at worst into a civilian, maybe even a child. -But it turned out to be the enemy and I even outran the enemy in the first shot!- - I try to justify myself, but it does not help. My mistake is too obvious, and because of it, I am doubly sorry. Now it remains only to wait for the verdict of the instructors. We are offered to evaluate our actions on our own, and I honestly admit that I messed everything up, but my brothers did not make any mistakes. -It's good that you focused on the mistake, but evaluate the actions as a whole,- insist the instructors. We hesitate to say that we generally followed the instructions and, with the exception of my actions, made no other critical errors. In our opinion, on the whole, we coped with the task. -This is too modest an estimate,- says the instructor. — Today you are the last in this competition out of three platoons. We have seen the work of more than one and a half hundred cadets. The four of you have done the best job of all.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/21/kytayecz-did-kapelan-i-doczent-yak-chotyry-mushketery-shturmuvaly-budynok-na-interflex-u-brytaniyi/	2024-10-20T20:43:43-07:00
Simply -the most powerful in the world-: the British Air Force is testing a new radar	As informs defense portal Zona Militar, the first Typhoon from the United Kingdom Air Force is already equipped with the appropriate system and is ready for practical tests in the air, ArmiyaInform reports. The advanced ECRS Mk 2 radar with an advanced Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) system and a unique positioning mechanism will allow the Typhoon to realize its full potential, it said. The ECRS Mk2 active phased array radar promises to be a game-changer for the Royal Air Force's Eurofighter Typhoon and will provide the Typhoon with a host of new capabilities that will allow the aircraft to better complement Britain's F-35B stealth fighters. -ECRS (European Common Radar System) Mk 2 is developed by Leonardo UK and integrated into Typhoon by BAE Systems, which now boasts that the new ECRS Mk 2 radar is -the world's most powerful combat airborne radar-, - write the authors of the portal The Drive. According to the stated capabilities, the ECRS Mk2 device combines all 3 traditional functions of an AFAR (Active Phased Array) radar, such as search and guidance, electronic warfare tasks, as well as secure high-speed communication and data transmission tasks. The Eurofighter Typhoon with ECRS Mk2 will now be able to detect and disrupt enemy radar use with a powerful electronic suppression attack while remaining out of range of the enemy countermeasures threat. The ECRS Mk 2 has an auto-tilt, a pivot mount which means the antenna can be rotated face-to-face at much greater angles to the centreline. This provides a much wider field of view with a significant increase in angular (azimuth) coverage. Compared to traditional mechanical scanning technology, the AFAR of the ECRS Mk2 radar can detect and track a target at a much greater distance, faster and with a greater degree of accuracy. This also applies to smaller threats, including those with a limited radar signature or flying at very low altitudes, which are much harder for older radars to detect. The long range of the ECRS Mk2 means that AESA radars are a significant advantage when using air-to-air missiles beyond visual range, the report said. The UK Ministry of Defense has invested £2.35 billion ($2.83 billion) in this modernization project, which aims not only to improve existing capabilities, but also to integrate advanced features such as broadband electronic attack and advanced jamming capabilities. These innovations will allow Royal Air Force pilots to hit targets at long distances while remaining protected from enemy air defenses. The ECRS Mk2 is designed to give pilots enhanced situational awareness and an unprecedented tactical advantage by detecting and prioritizing threats while automatically coordinating countermeasures, including decoys such as Brite Cloud. As such, this radar is a key element of the UK's defense strategy, confirming its desire to maintain technological leadership in the area of ​​air defense. With the new radar, the Typhoon will benefit from a unique ability to suppress enemy air defenses (SEAD), enabling it to operate in complex and congested electromagnetic environments. In addition, the radar will greatly enhance the aircraft's air-to-air and air-to-surface capabilities, thus expanding its operational range. The ECRS Mk2 also serves as a technological bridge to the Tempest project. The technologies and skills developed for the ECRS Mk2 radar are transferred to the ongoing development of Leonardo and BAE Systems as members of Team Tempest. This will reduce Tempest development costs and time while improving overall system performance. Some detailed characteristics of this radar are not given, referring to the secrecy of this project. However, it is known that the United Kingdom plans to install ECRS Mk 2 radars on new Tranche 4 Eurofighter Typhoon models, as well as 40 of its Tranche 3 Typhoon combat aircraft. In addition, Britain plans to offer these radars for export, including on Saudi Arabia's Typhoon fighter. ECRS Mk2 radar for Eurofighter Typhoon fighters.

Why does propaganda disperse a fake about the refusal to provide medical assistance - to the petitio...	This time he dispels the lie that allegedly men who have not updated their data in the TCC and SP are denied medical care. However, since October 1, a rule came into force in Ukraine, according to which primary medical care institutions stopped paying for the treatment of patients if they did not specify their phone numbers and registration numbers of tax payers' registration cards. And they are not going to treat -evaders- at the expense of the hospital itself, on the conviction of fakers. After sharing this information, StopFake decided to check whether in Ukraine they are really refusing to provide medical assistance to those who have not updated their data in the TCC. As expected, this information is not true. In order to receive medical assistance in Ukraine, it is not required to update data in the territorial centers of recruitment and social support. This time, the enemy is manipulating the information that, as of October 1, the norm really came into force in Ukraine, according to which hospitals partially stopped payments for patients. This is provided for by Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 1394 -On some issues of implementation of the program of state guarantees of medical care of the population in 2024-. But if you look at the document, you will find that it does not refer to the update of data in the TCC. Hospitals were required to verify patients 18 years of age or older who have declarations of choice of primary care physician. And if their data (contact phone number and TIN) are not included in the declaration, doctors will no longer receive funds for helping such patients. Kremlin propaganda once again invented a lie about the TCC and SP for another attempt to discredit the mobilization campaign in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/21/navishho-rospropaganda-rozganyaye-fejk-pro-vidmovu-nadannya-meddopomogy-uhylyantam/	2024-10-20T20:21:19-07:00

President: The war will continue if the alliance between Russia and North Korea is not stopped	About this he declared in his evening address. A significant part of the -martyrs- are shot down by Ukrainian soldiers, however, according to the President, this is not enough. Volodymyr Zelenskyi called for increasing international pressure on Russia and destroying the infrastructure for the production and storage of these drones. In addition, the President emphasized a new threat — Russia's criminal alliance with North Korea. He expressed his gratitude to the leaders of the states who speak frankly about the supply of weapons from the DPRK to Russia and the possible consequences of this cooperation. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyi, North Korean military personnel are already in Russia, which actually makes the DPRK a participant in the war against Ukraine. The President also announced support from partners under the Victory Plan. The head of state thanked France, Lithuania, Scandinavian countries and other EU allies for the assistance provided, and also noted -good signals- from the United States. Ukraine agreed on new packages of defense and energy support. At the same time, Volodymyr Zelenskyy drew attention to internal problems, in particular corruption in medical and social expert commissions (MSEK). He condemned the facts of falsification of disabilities by some prosecutors and called on the Security Service of Ukraine, the Security Intelligence Service, and the Prosecutor General's Office to act quickly and harshly. The President instructed to consider this issue at a meeting of the National Security Council. As reported by ArmyInform, in a week Russian terrorists used more than 20 missiles of various types, about 800 guided aerial bombs and more than 500 attack drones of various types against Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/20/prezydent-vijna-prodovzhytsya-yakshho-ne-zupynyty-soyuz-rosiyi-ta-pivnichnoyi-koreyi/	2024-10-20T13:20:48-07:00

As a result, the Russian equipment never reached our positions. As reported by ArmyInform, as a result of the collaboration of the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade and the Black Forest Artillery Reconnaissance Brigade in the South there were a dozen or a half less occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/20/nyshhyty-vse-shho-yide-rozgrom-vorozhogo-shturmu-na-pivdni/	2024-10-20T09:50:31-07:00
In the fog of war, the occupiers change into civilian clothes: how the weather affects hostilities i...	About this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon the spokeswoman of the OTU -Luhansk- told Major Anastasia Bobovnikova. — It works well in the city. In Chasovoy Yar and Toretsk, cases were recorded when the enemy disguised himself in civilian clothes and tried to infiltrate our rear under the guise of civilians, she said. However, such cases were isolated and the Ukrainian military quickly dealt with them. The enemy's actions are also affected by the change of season and the onset of natural autumn with long rains and thick fogs. — [Weather] changes have already begun, fogs have begun, which are very thick in the Donetsk region. This affects the change of tactics, because in the fog it is very easy to carry out assault actions, to be invisible. The fog helps both us and the enemy to carry out assault actions and contributes to the actions of the DRG, - explained Anastasia Bobovnikova. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the urban development of Toretsk and other cities in the East, Russian soldiers change into civilian clothes, thus occupiers treacherously resort to a ruse with the aim of conducting hostilities without identifying themselves, or throwing the DRG behind units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/20/v-tumani-vijny-okupanty-perevdyagayutsya-v-czyvilne-yak-pogoda-vplyvaye-na-bojovi-diyi-na-shodi/	2024-10-20T09:29:30-07:00
Paratroopers shot down a UAV with 4 missiles in Kurshchyna	The video of the defeat was made public by the airborne assault troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Our paratroopers are already repelling these assaults. Three armored vehicles with landing forces were destroyed, 17 occupants were eliminated. Also, yesterday the Russians attacked on motorcycles and our paratroopers destroyed seven of these crazy racers. The assault once again suffocated and did not achieve what the Russian command expected. This is the merit of our entire brigade, coordinated work from the command to the paratroopers in the trenches on the front line,- said Orest Drymalovskyi. He separately focused on the enemy's use of motorcycles during attacks. -The motorcycle tactic is such a suicidal, you know, tactic where the Russians try to avoid meeting our strike drone operators, try to get close to our forward edge, engage in a firefight.

Devil's Dozen -Otkaznikov-: How Russians Eliminate Mass Refusals and Desertions	About this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon the spokeswoman of the OTU -Luhansk- told Major Anastasia Bobovnikova. — They have a low moral and psychological state, there are frequent cases of desertion or simply refusing to complete tasks. At the same time, cases of desertion are not one or two people, but dozens of people. For example, recently there was a case when, according to our intelligence, about 13 Russians refused to complete the task, she said. The spokeswoman also reported that Russian soldiers, who had time to understand that if they continue to participate in hostilities, only death or severe mutilation awaits them, they are happy to surrender. Surrender was the only way for Russian soldiers to survive and preserve their health. However, the awareness of this simple fact comes to the occupiers only when they manage to take part in at least one first battle and see actual combat. It is the scale of losses among the henchmen and the attitude of the Russian command towards them as expendable materials that amazes those enemy soldiers who survived. Therefore, they resort to desertion, refuse to perform tasks or surrender to captivity. The tactic of leveling these phenomena at the enemy is simple - throw in newly recruited soldiers who do not yet have an idea of ​​the real state of affairs at the front. — We are not talking about a large number of personnel, that is, the Russians are not raising new brigades, divisions or regiments. However, every day they put new personnel in advanced positions, thus replenishing the losses, said Anastasia Bobovnikova.

The first Ukrainian pilot who used the F-16 against Russian missiles: who was the officer -Munfish-	This is talking in their social networks. Today, October 20, Oleksiy Mes would have celebrated his 31st birthday. But on August 26, 2024, while repelling one of the most powerful missile and drone attacks, Oleksiy died. -Moonfish pilot Oleksiy Mes will forever remain the first for us. The first Ukrainian F-16 pilot. The first to land an F-16 in Ukraine. The first to shoot down an F-air target,- the Air Force said. His wife Yuliya notes that everyone knew him as -Munfish- - the world-famous Ukrainian pilot who was the first to retrain the F-16 and use the American fighter jet against Russian missiles. -I knew him as a gentle and humble Lyosh- An imperfect, stubborn and always busy, but loving, attentive man&#8230; Lyosha, who has traveled more or less halfway around the world on official matters: Norway, Dubai, America, Denmark &#8230; and with whom I never managed to go to the sea as a threesome for a short family vacation,- said the woman. According to his wife, he really did not want to be public. Valued freedom and privacy, cared about her and her daughter's safety. Already on the first day of the large-scale invasion, Oleksiy flew from airfield to airfield, had to face significantly superior enemy forces. -Did he tell anything? From time to time I received messages - -I'm working.- Everything is normal.- Occasionally - chatted, without details, just to hear the voice. Lyosha never said that it was difficult or scary for them. And it was terrible,- Yulia recalled. She said that between combat tours, he was constantly on the phone with someone, discussing planes, missiles, opportunities. -He was the first to land an F-16 in Ukraine. And then he was the first to make a combat sortie, the first to shoot down an air target on the F-ts,- said his wife. The day before August 25, he came home very late. Wrote to Julia: -Go or spend the night at the service? Because at six o'clock in the morning you have to be there, and that's on the condition that the Shaheds don't leave.- The woman and her daughter saw him from the balcony. He also texted someone's phone number. The wife recalled that she had written a message: -How much is it possible? Let's go home!-. Alexei raised his head and smiled. -We went for a walk in the park, drank coffee&#8230; Before going to bed, Oleksiy washed his daughter's hair, dried it, put her to bed&#8230; These are actually very thrilling moments&#8230; And then the bell rang, the first -shahedis- entered. Nothing out of the ordinary. Got together. Rushed to work,- Yulia shared. At around 7am he texted her one last time. I didn't read the answer because I went to work. At 11 o'clock dad Oleksiy called: -Lyosha can't get in touch-. My wife tried to dial - she did not answer. According to her, then began the most terrible period of their entire lives. -I would very much like that, after many years, gray-haired grandfather Oleksiy Serhiyevich Mes would tell in the lessons of patriotic education how our pilots won victory in the sky of Ukraine. So that we can help each other in the apiary, as grandfather Lyoshin dreamed. So that the family would go to the sea dozens of times- Julia sighed. As reported by ArmyInform, by order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to Lieutenant Colonel Oleksiy Mesy awarded the military rank of colonel posthumously. Mykola Oleschuk notified , that the causes of the plane crash in which the pilot of the F-16 plane, Colonel Oleksiy Mes, died, will be established.

There were 4 skirmishes in the Toretsk direction, aviation also worked, she said, the officer noted that the enemy's tactics in the Kramatorsk and Toretsk directions remain unchanged - assault actions by small infantry groups. - It is not possible to talk about a radical change in tactics, because the enemy uses the tactics of small assault groups, especially in the Kramatorsk and Toretsk directions. This tactic proved to be effective, because they do not spare manpower and simply throw assault groups around the clock, endlessly and for quite some time now, trying to break through our defenses, the military said. However, despite all the efforts of the Russian occupiers, the Defense Forces manage to effectively restrain the enemy. — In Toretsk itself, despite the fact that the situation there is very difficult, the city is almost destroyed, we are holding back the enemy. The enemy has not been able to advance into Toretsk for a long time, the spokeswoman said. — If we talk about the Kramatorsk direction, in particular the Chasovoy Yar area, there they also use tactics similar to those they use in the Toretsk direction. The situation there is such that the enemy is running across the channel, also using small assault groups, since the equipment cannot pass there. We block and destroy them, said Anastasia Bobovnikova.

They took up the old: Britain and Singapore are establishing the production of 120-mm self-propelled...	For information of the official portal of Babcock International Group PLC, the start of production of 120 mm self-propelled mortar systems is a historic step for of the defense-industrial complex of the United Kingdom, which has not produced weapons of this caliber since the last century, concentrating exclusively on 81-mm mortars, reports ArmyInform. The basic requirement for the creation of production facilities for the assembly of 120-mm mortar systems directly on of the British Isles is related to the program to increase the firepower of the new combat battalions of the country's army on the battlefield. The GDAMS system is planned to be produced in the Devonport area of ​​the city of Plymouth, in southwestern England. And the assembly of new weapons was entrusted to the specialists of the Perfect Bore Manufacturing company, which works in various sectors, including oil and gas, automotive, nuclear, aerospace and, of course, defense, and has the most modern machine park and the corresponding equipment. 120-mm GDAMS (an acronym for Advanced Ground Deployment Mortar System) can be operated by a crew of two and boasts a rapid deployment and stacking time of just 15 seconds, providing unmatched mobility and agility in high-tempo operations. Its articulated mortar system is vehicle-independent, allowing the weapon to be mounted on a variety of platforms, including vehicles already in service with the British Army, such as the Jackal, Coyote and Foxhound. GDAMS is compatible with a wide range of standard smoothbore guns. munitions, including high-explosive, illumination, infrared (IR), illumination mines and smoke shells. It also has the accuracy and extended range capabilities of reaching targets up to 9km away, and supports manual, electronic and smart fuzes, making it a versatile choice for a variety of combat mission profiles. What directly to the intricacies of managing mortar systems, the 120-mm GDAMS are additionally equipped with advanced fire control and aiming devices, which increases accuracy and efficiency, as well as shortens the time to engage targets. A patented diffuser minimizes noise levels, improving stealth and ensuring crew safety. The system's fully digitized communication circuit speeds up operations and reduces the risk of human error when entering coordinates, allowing for faster deployment and more accurate setup. Tom Newman, Sector Chief Executive of Babcock&#8217;s Land, highlighted the importance of GDAMS, saying: -Babcock's 120mm GDAMS can help support the modernization of the British Army by increasing firepower and improving availability and combat capabilities critical equipment.- For his part, Brigadier General (retd) Jin Kiat Chua, head of international business at ST Engineering, described GDAMS as -an outstanding tactical fire control solution that pushes capacity to the limit and increases firepower -. The representative of the Singaporean manufacturer emphasized the role of partnership in the development of a sovereign solution that is in line with the UK Industrial Strategy. An interesting feature of this project is the fact that when assembling the GDAMS mortar systems in Singapore the ST Engineering company preferred to install the weapons complex on the base of commercial pickups of the 4x4 formula. At the same time, the barrel of the mortar was placed almost horizontally in the trunk of an ordinary car during transportation, and the cartridges were fixed in containers on both sides of the trunk or in its front part. The weapon is loaded manually and can fire 16 mines in 3 minutes: then the barrel must be cooled. This, however, according to the Singaporean developers, is not a problem, because the fire calculation needs to be redeployed to avoid any possible counter-battery fire. Therefore, in less than a minute, a vehicle equipped with GDAMS quickly leaves the pre-deployment area and will be ready to repeat its fire actions from another position. It should be noted that the GDAMS system can also be equipped with an 81 mm medium caliber barrel. In the 120 mm configuration, the GDAMS weighs 700 kg. After deployment on the ground, it can be used in the ±90° fire sector, and the elevation angle is from 45° to 80°. In its turn, the British version of the self-propelled mortar is planned to be mounted on the Supacat HMT 6&#215 highly mobile platform. ;6, which, according to local experts, offers unparalleled versatility on the battlefield. And the deployment of production facilities in Devonport also opens up future export opportunities, strengthening defense cooperation with allied countries, while developing the UK's defense industry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/20/vzyalysya-za-stare-brytaniya-z-singapurom-nalagodzhuyut-vyrobnycztvo-120-mm-samohidnyh-minometnyh-system/	2024-10-19T21:07:01-07:00
About the bachelor squads, special status for the Irish and the women's movement -shame-: the experi...	Before the First World War, the British army did not know mass conscription: there were always enough people willing to serve the monarchy in the country. So at the beginning of the war, in 1914 and 1915, the military command managed to recruit the planned number of military personnel thanks to volunteers. The plan was even more than fulfilled: thanks to the patriotism that swept the country at the beginning of the war, half a million young people applied instead of the required 100 thousand. But the longer the war lasted, the fewer there were willing to fight, and -m The -jaw-cutter- on the continent demanded more and more manpower. During the First World War, military aircraft, chemical weapons, tanks, anti-aircraft machine guns and many other deadly -innovations- were used for the first time, so people died in this war many times more than in the good old days. In January 1916, the country introduced mandatory military service for the first time in its history. The Military Service Act was passed, according to which all unmarried men between the ages of 18 and 41 were initially subject to conscription (later, married men were also included, and the age was raised to 51). I, representatives of professions necessary in the rear, breadwinners of families and, for the first time in world history, Conscientious objectors - a person who could not serve in the army or hold a weapon in his hands due to moral or religious principles. Such people had to prove their convictions to the local military tribunal. But it is known that the members of the tribunals, appointed by the command and interested in increasing the number of soldiers, often refused those who tried to become an -evader-. - Eighteen. - So, you are old enough and have enough conscience not to shy away from serving your country. Following-. If someone still managed to get a special status, he was sent to other army jobs not directly related to combat operations. It is interesting that all Irishmen were also exempted from military service in 1916. After all, that spring, Ireland was engulfed in riots known as the Easter Rising, which in a few years turned into the War of Independence. The metropolis prudently decided not to put weapons in the hands of those who can turn them against them. The general mobilization caused an ambiguous reaction in society. Thus, in April 1916, 200,000 opponents of mobilization gathered on Trafalgar Square in London. On the other hand, many people warmly supported her. For example, the participants of the suffragette movement, who fought against discrimination against women in the legal field, political and economic life. Young women workers at military enterprises (so-called munitionettes) replaced men not only at industrial machines, but also in pubs . They became one of the brightest signs of that time. Women's patriotic organizations became an important element in state propaganda campaigns. They shamed men who did not want to join the army. Women's movements invented a special symbol of the -white feather- as a sign of cowardice, which was handed out on the streets to men of military age who were dressed in civilian clothes. And vice versa - they supported those who were drafted, encouraged with parcels and letters. In March 1917, women activists formed the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC), which united all separate women's organizations that helped the military. There were five broad categories of employment in the WAAC: service staff, cooks, driver mechanics, clerks and gravesiders. The history of the corps became the story of women's struggle for equal rights with men. In November 1918, about 90,000 women served in the WAAC and similar services in the Navy and Air Force. There is still debate in British society about the motivations that led young women to join the ranks of the WAAC during the First World War. Mobilization continued until 1920. A total of 5 million British servicemen went through the First World War, of which about 2.5 million were conscripted. Great Britain lost 886,000 servicemen of all branches of the military. This war is still the bloodiest in the history of the country. For the second time in Great Britain, conscription was introduced in May 1939 - a few months before the start of the Second World War, when it became clear what was going on. At first only young people aged 20 to 22 were drafted. Already in May 1939, they began a six-month military training. Conscripts were not enrolled in the regular army, the number of which before the war was less than 400,000 (including the reserve) and which was professional and supplemented by volunteers, but in the -militia- or -militia- (Militia). Unlike the professional military, these forces received not only uniforms, but also civilian clothes. In September, when Hitler attacked Poland and Great Britain declared war on him, the rules changed: the National Service Act was introduced, under which all men aged 18 to 41 were subject to conscription. By December 1939, one and a half million people out of 47 million inhabitants of the United Kingdom (excluding colonies) were mobilized into the armed forces. Of them, 1.1 million went to the British Army, the rest were sent to the Navy and Air Force. Becoming a soldier, despite expectations, was not easy. First, the recruit had to undergo a medical examination. Not only the unfit, but also those who were allergic to foods that were regularly supplied to the army for the soldiers' food, were not taken into service. Residents of Northern Ireland were also not accepted - due to the same fears as during the First World War. In addition, those who were fundamentally against the war were not accepted into the armed forces, as before. However, they had to prove their beliefs in court. But even if the court confirmed that the conscript really could not take up arms, he could still be recruited to perform non-combat duties. And the duties were different: it was good if pacifists were taken to the kitchen, to the orderlies or storekeepers. And they could easily send them to sappers - demining work was no less dangerous than participating in battles, but it was not considered combat. Students and workers of -critical infrastructure- were also exempted from military service. These included railway workers, policemen, telegraph operators, priests, lighthouse keepers and bakers. Some workers were fired only after reaching a certain age. For example, accountants over the age of 30 were not subject to conscription. In 1942, the mobilization boundaries were expanded again: men aged 18 to 51, unmarried women aged 20 to 30, and those who did not have children under the age of 15. Since 1943, conscripts were sent not only to the army, but also to compulsory work in coal mines. This practice continued even after the war - until 1948. The miners were nicknamed the Bevin boys - in honor of Ernest Bevin, Minister of Labor in Churchill's coalition government. The people did not like them very much: they said that they -sit in the mines while the boys fight.- The mobilized coal miners did not receive awards for their service, and Her Majesty's Government only recognized their contribution to the victory over Nazism in 1995. From 1939 to 1945, 3.5 million men and women served in the British Army. According to V. Churchill, the armed forces of Great Britain during the Second World War lost 303,240 people killed and missing, and together with the dominions, India and colonies — 412,240. The civilian population lost 67,100 people, and the fishing and merchant fleet lost — 30,000. National military service continued for another 18 years after the end of the war. British soldiers served, in particular, in the occupied sectors of Germany and Japan. In those years, all men between the ages of 18 and 30 carried out compulsory military service. Again, there was a list of non-conscriptions - from representatives of -critical- professions to Irish and British of colonial origin. The service was 18 months and included six weeks of training. Soldiers received a very modest salary - until 1960 it amounted to almost two pounds a week, although the average weekly salary in those years was more than 15 pounds. military The last conscripts were demobilized in 1963, and the British armed forces once again became fully professional, which they remain today. army is constantly shrinking. To remedy the situation, the previous Prime Minister of Great Britain, Rishi Sunak, intended to bring back conscription for young people in the country from September this year, but he lost the election in the summer, so nothing changed. However, as recently as June 16, 2022, the British Chief of Staff, General Patrick Sanders, told British soldiers that they were the generation that had to prepare -to fight in Europe again.- He warned that in the event of a war with Russia, the British would face a new mobilization.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/20/pro-zagony-holostyakiv-speczstatus-dlya-irlandcziv-ta-zhinochyj-ruh-soromu-dosvid-mobilizacziyi-velykoyi-brytaniyi/	2024-10-19T20:55:01-07:00
- In war, everyone is afraid: both the soldier and the general-: how psychologists of the 46th briga...	— The training of a serviceman is carried out in three stages. With it, a run-in with a tank is carried out, overcoming a psychological obstacle course. In addition, there are psychologists who provide theory, for example, how to deal with such phenomena as stupor, fear, stress, that is, those mental phenomena that a military serviceman will 100% encounter during combat missions. - How does a person who, relatively speaking, walked the peaceful streets of the city yesterday, passed the BZVP, and today she is already at the front, manages to cope with such stresses? - There are concepts of combat stress, stupor and just fear. People are afraid, that's understandable. When everything around is thundering, exploding, especially when it comes under shelling, fire or bombing for the first time. The same people do not exist, in principle. We are all different, and everyone has their own psychological threshold. In some it is on average, in others &#8211; at a low or high level. Conventionally, the civilian population that comes to us for training can be divided into several categories. The most important thing is that the brain of a serviceman during training in training centers perceives everything as unreal. You will not fool our brain in any way. We just give, first, the theory, I repeat, and explain what he will 100% face and how to deal with it. — How to deal with it? — Banal , just for example. We tell the serviceman that when he arrives at the concentration area of ​​his future unit, that day or evening or night will come when he will be brought into position. You'll feel butterflies in your stomach, you'll hear your heart beat, etc. when you're being hit by artillery, maybe FPV drones. When you feel this way, remember that it is completely normal. All people are afraid - and that's normal. The soldier is afraid, the colonel is afraid, the general is afraid. Any sane, adequate person is scared when an FPV drone is flying at them or artillery is hitting them. There is nothing like that in this. We explain it and tell you how to deal with it. How can I stop hearing my heartbeat, which is deafening? You should do the correct breathing for 4 counts, for example, this is when you are turned on. When you will stand in position for the first day, when you will not sleep for 3-4 days or you will sleep no more than 2-3 hours, as it usually happens, the perception of reality will be completely different. We also talk about it. This is a specific course conducted by our trained psychologists. This, as they say, is preparation in the early days. The next stage is combat situations. There cannot be, for example, four infantrymen at any position. As a rule, these are two experienced, two new recruits. Those who are experienced are usually one of them a sergeant who knows these techniques, who is trained, who also has some combat experience. And also by word and deed it can prompt, can neutralize a certain threat in the form of, for example, a stupor, which also sometimes happens to military personnel. - How exactly do you get out of a stupor? - This individual approach, best of all you need to know the person. If it's a person you're seeing for the first time, the first thing you should do is take away the weapon, if possible. If it is not possible, do not touch it. That is, act according to the situation. There is an option that it is possible to take away weapons and it is necessary, there is a situation and an option when this cannot be done categorically. - In your experience, what affects people the most? FPV, anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, approaching the enemy when throwing a grenade, shooting, departure of equipment? From your practice, according to the feedback of fighters, what is the scariest thing? — The scariest thing is FPV drones. It is difficult to hide from him. If the artillery works, you understand where the projectile falls, you understand that you need to take two steps forward, back, left-right. If it's an FPV, no matter where you take that step, it follows you. That's all. This is the biggest danger. How to fight with them? REB. And fire. — How quickly, on average, does a person adapt to combat conditions? — Also in different ways. There are people born for war. This is such a conditional category. They are about 10% of the total number of fighters who come to us. But they are. These are those who immediately show leadership qualities. This is the sergeant category, which we select in the future for sending to officer courses. In general, the infantry is a symbiosis of youth and experience. It is very good when an experienced sergeant is 35+ and he has 3-4 subordinates who are directly in the trenches with him, aged 20-25. It must be taken into account that fighting is physically difficult. To the point, for example, evacuation, to entering the trench, there can be a distance of up to 10 kilometers, when it is necessary to overcome it in full equipment with weapons, with water, with ammunition, with dry rations. And it's not just to pass and rest, but you come, overcome this distance and immediately begin to perform a combat mission. So, when you're completely exhausted, and it can be 30, and 40, and 50, and 60 days in a row, when you're there, you're doing a task, and you still have to go that distance back. There are situations when a wounded serviceman, who cannot reach the evacuation points on his own, has to be carried and returned the same long kilometers. The best option for recovery after completing tasks is to change the combat environment to home — After leaving combat positions, how exactly can a person be returned from a combat state to a more or less peaceful, well, relatively peaceful course? What do you do in this case, what are the difficulties, what should you pay attention to? — After completing combat missions, you should remember that there are no identical people. The first day we do not touch them at all. If possible, the second day too. We start working somewhere from the third day. When a person is already banal, if it is a cold season, he will warm up, drink tea and get some sleep. Until a person does this and does not get enough sleep, the psychologist's work is simply inappropriate and impractical. There is a category of people who do not need psychological help. When you offer it to him, he himself says, please, I don't need it, I'm fine, I just want to sleep, give me this opportunity. We do not impose ourselves in any way. There is a category of people who, on the contrary, do not mind, but are somehow ashamed to tell the commander that he needs the help of psychologists. So we clearly identify such a category, it is immediately visible by certain signs. And we start working. You can tell by the person. Looking nowhere from exhaustion. A certain retardation, the psyche works in the wrong mode. It is visible. But it is clear that it will recover. It happens that people try to get out of stress by drinking alcohol. There are such cases, unfortunately, they are not isolated. To be honest, it really helps a certain category of people. In fact, it does not solve problems, but it has a temporary effect. - Is the dry law preserved in combat, or is it still allowed to drink alcohol? - Let's start with the fact that a fighter simply won't take this bottle of vodka. It is illogical because it is weight. It is better to take water. In combat, the law is dry, and they know it. The first reason for the dry law is that any medic knows and tells them about it during training sessions: if a person gets injured while in a state of alcohol intoxication, it is very difficult for him to stop the bleeding. Therefore, this is their life, and this is what they remember. It's better, if you really want to, then complete the task, come back, and that's another matter. You can be granted a release, you can leave the concentration area with permission for a certain time and rent an apartment, just be alone or your wife will come to you, what are the problems? We handle it, it's not a problem. We always meet. And the wives also come. And this also has a positive effect. The best option for the recovery of a serviceman after completing tasks is to stay with his family or go home, change the combat environment to a home environment. many divorces, conflicts in families after the war. Is it true or are these isolated cases? If so, what kind of help is appropriate here? - This is absolutely true, I see no point in hiding it. People who go through the war, they change. They will never be the same again. When you and a friend drink tea or coffee in the morning, and by lunchtime he is gone, then such a thing cannot pass without a trace. And the family, the family, for example, the wife, and she just doesn't know it.... - Do you work with family members? - This is not one of our responsibilities, because we work primarily with military personnel, that is, those who perform combat tasks. If possible, we try to do it point by point. But we simply do not have the physical capacity to help the entire civilian population. This should be done at the national level. A comprehensive approach is needed here.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/20/na-vijni-boyatsya-vsi-i-soldat-i-general-yak-psyhology-46-brygady-dshv-gotuyut-novobrancziv-do-vijny/	2024-10-19T20:43:54-07:00

Ukraine is counting on France's support for the Victory Plan	About this informs the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. Diplomats focused their negotiations on allies' support for the Victory Plan and the Peace Formula of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi, countering Russia's attempts to escalate the war by enlisting the support of the DPRK, intensifying Ukrainian-French defense cooperation, and supporting Ukraine's energy stability ahead of winter. Andriy Sybiga expressed his gratitude to France for its comprehensive support since the beginning of the full-scale Russian aggression and noted that thanks to the dialogue between the leaders Volodymyr Zelensky and Emmanuel Macron, our countries managed to build special, partnership relations. The minister emphasized that Ukraine highly values ​​France's support on the way to the EU and NATO. The head of the Foreign Ministry emphasized the need to further strengthen Ukrainian-French defense cooperation and implement joint defense projects. -Currently, the basis for extensive cooperation with France in the defense industry has already been laid. This applies, in particular, to the localization and joint production of the most necessary weapons in Ukraine, as well as the transfer of a number of French innovative technologies,- the minister noted. In this context, Andriy Sybiga thanked the French side for implementing the decision to form a Ukrainian brigade in France and expressed hope that this initiative would become an example for other partners of Ukraine. The minister noted that Ukraine is counting on France's support for the Victory Plan and emphasized that the implementation of the initiative will be the best response of the Allies to Russia's escalation of the war, in particular plans to involve North Korean troops. The head of the Ukrainian foreign policy department emphasized the leadership role of France in the implementation of the Peace Formula and thanked for the successful organization of a thematic conference on the topic -Nuclear safety- in Paris this week. He added that Ukraine and France are fruitfully working on preparations for the second Global Peace Summit. Andrii Sybiga noted the active work of France and personally of Minister Barro in the direction of the return of Ukrainian children and welcomed the recent French-Canadian statement. According to him, the parties discussed in detail the implementation of the relevant clause of the Peace Formula and the involvement of as many participants as possible in the ministerial conference on October 30-31 in Canada. The Foreign Minister also thanked his colleague for France's support for the EU's decision to provide Ukraine with macro-financial assistance in the amount of 35 billion euros as part of the Group of Seven leaders' agreements in June and expressed hope for its speedy implementation. Another important area of ​​work is the deepening of cooperation between regions. Andrii Sybiga emphasized that Ukraine already has a number of successful examples of such cooperation and plans to develop this direction in the future. He added that Ukrainians highly value France's patronage over the reconstruction of Chernihiv region. A special element of the visit was the presentation at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine of specially selected archival diplomatic documents from the time of the Ukrainian People's Republic. The presented historical monuments reflect the friendly character of Ukrainian-French relations of that period, in particular active bilateral diplomatic contacts and joint projects of cultural diplomacy. Presenting the exhibition to his French colleague, Andrii Sybiga emphasized that friendly relations between Ukraine and France have deep historical roots. Earlier ArmyInform reported that Ukraine and Italy plan to deepen cooperation in the field of the defense-industrial complex.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/19/ukrayina-rozrahovuye-na-pidtrymku-francziyeyu-planu-peremogy/	2024-10-19T09:51:44-07:00
Cold calculation and no emotions in battle is the story of Guardsman Andriy Prysiazhniuk	History made public by the National Guard of Ukraine. After a full-scale invasion, his village was occupied, but he found a way to get to the Dnipro. Almost immediately, Andriy voluntarily joined the ranks of the 31st brigade of the NGU and took the position of an armored car driver. After intensive training, the guardsman went on his first rotation to Velika Novosilka, where he received the call sign DJ. The main task was to transport soldiers to positions, deliver ammunition, provisions, weapons and evacuate damaged equipment. At that period of hostilities, the main threat to an armored car was the -Grady-, which had to be constantly bypassed. For the Guardsman, the first rotation was almost uneventful and allowed him to gradually adapt to combat operations. -During that rotation, I thought I was at war, but I hadn't seen a real war yet,- the soldier recalls. DJ's second rotation was also in Velika Novosilka, but it was radically different in the intensity of combat and the active use of FPV drones. Therefore, the tasks of rotating soldiers in positions were very difficult and required considerable effort and training of the driver. Enemy FPVs actively hunted our equipment, trying to cut off the logistics routes, and the roads were cut by trenches from anti-aircraft guns, which could fully accommodate the Cossack armored vehicle. -We then held positions in Urozhany, and it was there that I saw the real war. Everything around was broken, and something was constantly burning,- says Andrii. On one of the tasks, DJ went to pick up guys from positions and was alone in -Cossack-. The fighter moved at night, with the headlights turned off and the instrument panel covered, so that even they did not shine and did not unmask the car. The night lamp helped to see the road. At the entrance to Harvest, the guardsman saw a flash and felt that something had hit the car, because his ears immediately rang. DJ stopped to avoid crashing and assessed the situation and his condition. Realizing that the car was moving and it did not receive significant damage, he continued driving. On the way back, one of the soldiers saw a hole in the roof of the car and a badly burned seat. -At first I thought the guys were picking on me,- DJ recalls.

If a person had been there at the time of the impact, the consequences would have been fatal. The next trip to Urozhayne was also difficult for DJ: this time the car was hit by a mortar, and fortunately, the shrapnel did not penetrate the armor and got stuck in the body. The projectile damaged the wheels, but the personnel remained intact. After a short repair, -Cossack- returned to service and continued to perform combat missions. -Special respect is due to the fighters of the repair crews, who in the fields, without the necessary equipment, literally do miracles out of nothing and put our equipment back on its feet,- noted Andriy. Now the DJ is on rotation in the Kharkiv region, where his experience helps a lot. On the very first task, his car received three direct hits from the FPV, but thanks to his cool mind and nerves of steel, the fighter continued to move and did not panic. Again, it was lucky that no one was in the cabin, as the driver and assistant were on their way to pick up BC and groceries. The fighters completed the task and returned unharmed.

After the premiere of the film, a panel discussion was held with the participation of servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the heroes of the film. -Through the prism of art, it is possible to understand and overcome the challenges facing our state.

Therefore, the occupiers chose a different tactic - they announce the start of restoration, replace several windows or doors and abandon the house, having received funds for the entire order. Several such unfinished works, together with the residents, have been waiting for the completion of the works since the spring. Residents of Lysychansk complain about the arbitrariness of the city's occupation authorities. More than a year has passed since the local Gauleiter was replaced, and in the summer, the curator from the cauldron, but these actions almost did not lead to anything. They could not establish even elementary processes of interaction with the population. Certificates ordered by local authorities for the registration of social benefits and other documents are produced by the occupying authorities for longer than their validity period. Therefore, it is no longer possible to provide them to another structure - it is necessary to issue them again. The queues and dissatisfaction of the citizens are increasing.

Realistic Training: An indigenous development to improve combat skills has been approved for use by ...	About this notifies the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. It is manufactured by one of the domestic enterprises for the practical training of soldiers in conditions as close as possible to real combat. The individual kit consists of a laser emitter, which is attached to the small arms and ammunition, fixing the damage, and a -stress belt- (bracelet). A mounted emitter on a personal weapon simulates firing. It sends laser pulses, which are detected by sensors on the helmet or vest of a hypothetical opponent. The bracelet is worn on the arm for a tactile sensation of hits. When hit, the fighter feels the electrical impulse of the -stress belt-, and his ammunition is illuminated with red light. The use of such sets during tactical training allows instructors to determine the effectiveness of each of the participants in the class according to many parameters: accuracy, movement skills, etc. Accordingly, it is then possible to conduct an analysis of actions and provide recommendations for further improvement of practical skills.

Three wars -Dida- with the DSHV: the story of the staff sergeant who searched for the body of his de...	— All my military life is connected with the landing forces. I am 54 years old, 17 of them in the army. I started my service back in 1988. He graduated from the school of junior commanders and spent four months in Afghanistan as a sergeant. We already went out as part of a limited contingent of Soviet troops. Then there was Stepanakert - it was also quite hot there&#8230; It was different. In 2014, -Grandfather- returned to the army again. ATO began. Due to the specifics of the tasks, the unit was constantly in the center of events. Paratroopers visited everywhere. — Yes, I was at Donetsk airport twice - two rotations. One lasted 27 days, the second lasted 12 days. When we were already leaving, a week later it was blown up. And in the Luhansk region there were, and in Karachun, and in Slovyansk&#8230; My eldest son was with me. I have two sons. Both paratroopers. After demobilization, he engaged in business, worked in Poland. But in 2022, without hesitation, he returned to the paratroopers again. — Started from Poland on February 25. And already on the 26th at 7 in the morning, or rather at 7:15, I was already at the 95 checkpoint. I will immediately turn to our commander, whom I treat with respect, this is Anatoly Kozel, call sign -Kupol-. This is a person with a capital letter, real, with whom it was good to fight side by side. Our direction was 51 kilometers, this is an intersection, how to go to Kyiv, in the Makarova district. During the battles for Kyiv, the paratroopers held the crossroads, and the Russians did not advance - neither to Fastiv, nor to Makariv, nor to Zhytomyr. In April 2022, the formation of the 46th brigade began, and the serviceman joined it. — I, one might say, stood at the origins of creation, I had the honor of serving with all the commanders. When another battalion of ours began to form, I was taken to him by its commander, now he is the Hero of Ukraine, nicknamed -Smoke-, Oleg Volodymyrovych Dmytruk. Now a lieutenant colonel, it was an honor to serve with him. We went to the execution area, it was Kherson Oblast. The paratroopers also fought fierce battles there. There were losses that -Grandfather- constantly mentions. — Yesterday I ate with him, we drank tea, coffee, and today we are going out on an assignment and&#8230; he is gone This is the hardest loss, especially since my eldest son died. This was also in the Kherson region, the area of ​​the settlement of Sukhy Stavok. He was a soldier, he was a soldier in the ATO, and he was a soldier here. I took it as a&#8230; Apparently, it had to be like that. So, he invested his life, part of his life, in our victory. The hardest thing is when you lose relatives, friends, siblings. The son's body could not be found for almost six months. - Why couldn't the bodies be found? As it turned out later, the infantry was coming, not from our assault troops, just infantry. And they collected all the dead. We still hoped that he was in captivity. Requests were submitted to all possible authorities. From the Red Cross and along the SBU line. After all, hope is the last to die, they thought that it was still alive. But, unfortunately, a notification came to the wife who was giving the DNA. And the DNA matched. And it was already at the end of February. He died on August 22, 2023, and was buried on March 4, 2024. In one of the battles, -Grandfather- was hit by a tank shot, survived, but was seriously wounded. After the hospital, he was sent to an educational center for further service. About the cadets, -Grandfather- willingly talks: - The people are different, the people have different hair. Someone perceives better, someone worse, someone more, someone less. Now they do not have such a desire, as it was in our time, as in the early days, when queues were near the TCC, near military units, near checkpoints. Now, unfortunately, this is not the case. But still people go. I did not ask anyone, no one brought anyone here by force, no one broke their hands, as they show on TV. These are bread workers, tractor drivers, programmers, teachers, different strata of the population. Called - came. And it is our business, no matter who comes, to teach. The serviceman says that the instructors try to prepare recruits as much as possible, taking into account all the changes that take place on the battlefield. - There is such a war going on at the moment - something new appears every month. Both weapons and tactics are changing, new different drones. Now the war of drones mostly. And it is necessary to know everything, to understand everything. So, of course, we have to be ready for that. Of course, we have to prepare refills in the same way. So we are working in this direction. According to -Dida-, during the BZVP, instructors try to see the strengths of new recruits in order to choose specialties for them accordingly. — During the BZVP course, department commanders and instructors pay attention to who has what abilities. If he is already, for example, a programmer, then he can already be a UAV operator, a REBov and the like. Those who shoot accurately can be sent to sniper courses. Fighters are evaluated, and as they already finish the BZVP and join us in the unit, we give recommendations on who is capable of what. It also happens that a person comes, under 2 meters tall, a pumped-up athlete, and as soon as a critical situation arises, he simply swims. He does not orient himself, he does not know what to do. And it happens that a boy comes, and you think that he is wearing that machine gun, that helmet and bulletproof vest, but in a critical situation he shows himself in such a way that wow. Now the main thing is to come here, to show desire. And here we will already tell, we will indicate the right way, what a person should do.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/19/try-vijny-dida-z-dshv-istoriya-shtab-serzhanta-yakyj-piv-roku-shukav-tilo-zagyblogo-syna/	2024-10-18T21:31:05-07:00
The first leave after mobilization: when they can be sent home	ArmyInform tells about all possible leave options that are available during martial law and when they can be obtained. First of all, it is necessary to understand what types of leave are available in the Armed Forces. And when such leave can be granted. The main one is annual leave. Every year a serviceman can get up to 30 days of basic leave. It is provided in parts during the calendar year, provided that the main continuous part of it will be not less than 15 calendar days. If compared to civilian life, in the Armed Forces there is no requirement to serve half a year in order to be able to go on vacation. But of course, you are unlikely to be able to mobilize and go on vacation almost immediately. First, more than a month will be spent on basic military training. Then everything will depend on which division you fall into. Most likely, the vacation schedule will already be written there. And, of course, those who have been serving for some time will go first. Usually 1-2 people from a platoon or up to 4 servicemen from a company are released. Therefore, you will have to wait your turn. In small units, for example, security, the picture is a little different. But the schedule is still there. In addition, there are other nuances that must be taken into account. It is legislated that basic leave is granted -under the conditions of simultaneous absence no more than 30 percent of the total number of servicemen of a certain category of the corresponding unit.- So, if the unit is less than 70 percent staffed, there may be no vacations at all for a certain period of time. Although, even in such situations, military units usually try, at least a little at a time, to let people go on vacation. You also need to consider the environment in which the unit is located. After all, the withdrawal of even a small number of servicemen can significantly affect combat capability. That is, there are reasons for refusing to grant leave. But such a refusal must be justified. Lawyers advise making 2 copies of the report. One should bear the number, date and signature of the person who accepted the report. So that later you can appeal the refusal or inaction. But in practice this does not always work. If you believe that you are being unreasonably denied vacation, you can contact the hotline of the Ministry of Defense. But if there is a serious reason to go on vacation, then there is an option of family leave. This is the second type of leave granted during martial law. It can be provided for up to 10 days. At the same time, the payment of cash security is preserved. The military serviceman must indicate in the report what family circumstances or good reasons prompt him to go on such a leave, and also, if possible, provide relevant documents to the report. If this is not done, the leave may be refused. You can read more about how to go on vacation for family reasons read here. There are several other options for receiving leave in the Armed Forces. It is unlikely that they will be immediately available to newcomers to the army. But it is worth reminding about them. This is a relatively new type of leave that appeared after the passage of the mobilization law. On May 21, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved the procedure the granting of such leave. In particular, for which equipment and how many days of additional leave a serviceman can receive in the event of the destruction of enemy equipment. We note that, in general, you can get no more than 15 days of such leave per year. It can be given not only to the person who directly destroyed the equipment, but also to other servicemen who participated in the detection and destruction of enemy equipment. They can receive the same number of days as the serviceman who destroyed the equipment. But it is important to remember that the destruction of equipment must be confirmed! Read more about it in our material. If a serviceman, released from captivity, expressed a desire to continue his service, but needs rest, then at his request, he additional leave is granted with the preservation of cash security for the duration of 90 calendar days without division into parts . Such leave can be revoked only with the consent of the serviceman. Such leave is granted based on the conclusion of the VLK for treatment in connection with an illness or after an injury (contusion, injury or mutilation). The term of such leave is determined by doctors. But the total period of treatment can last not more than 12 months. All this time, the military serviceman keeps the payment of cash support.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/19/persha-vidpustka-pislya-mobilizacziyi-koly-mozhut-vidpustyty-dodomu/	2024-10-18T21:20:34-07:00

Fifty-one engagements have been completed, with four more still ongoing. In the Vremivsk direction the enemy attacked our units near Novoukrainka and Bogoyavlenka ten times. In the Orikhov direction the occupation forces once stormed the positions of the Defense Forces in the areas of Novodanilivka. Six times the enemy attacked our defenders in the Dnieper direction in vain.

We will remind, state on the morning of October 18, the Russian invaders lost 1,530 personnel killed and wounded in one day at the front.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/19/vid-pochatku-doby-vidbulosya-195-bojovyh-zitknen-z-nyh-55-na-kurahivskomu-napryamku/	2024-10-18T21:15:28-07:00
About takmed, updating hospitals and the primary military rank for doctors: an interview with the he...	How was the volume of pre-hospital medical care approved? How are military hospital upgrades going? How do civilian and military healthcare systems interact and what does the Department of Healthcare of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine do for this and what are its plans for the future? Oksana Sukhorukova, head of the Department of Health Protection of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, told about this and other things in an interview with ArmiyaInform. — Ms. Oksana, you have been in your position for almost a year. What did you manage to do during this time? Where were the biggest stumbling blocks in the work? - I believe that the biggest achievement is the formation of a capable team in such a short time. And I am very proud of the people with whom I serve in public service together. These are both civilians and military personnel, particularly those who fought from the first days of the large-scale invasion and then expressed a desire to continue serving in the department. — It's about a team of people. And what about the processes? - The main task of the Department is policy formation in the field of military medicine. Until March of this year, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine formed the policy in the entire field of health care. In February, the Verkhovna Rada adopted the law, at the beginning of March it was signed by the President. This document delegates authority to the Ministry of Defense to formulate pre-hospital health policy during a special period for all security forces and the Defense Forces. That is, we are talking about the fact that the process at the pre-hospital level - until the moment when the military enters the hospital with an illness, with an injury, with an injury, with a contusion - will be according to the same standards. What did we manage to do? If we are talking about tactical medicine, then we have finally approved our scope of pre-medical care. In the tenth year of the war. There is such an order of the Ministry of Defense (number 436) that speaks of four levels of pre-medical care. This is tactical medicine. By the way, we have submitted changes to the BZVP program in the section of the takmed. As for the higher levels of assistance, it should be implemented, for example, in vocational training. That is, we are talking about all types of individual training of military personnel. There was also an order of the Ministry of Defense, which talks about the composition of first-aid kits. We are talking about first-aid kits, and shoulder bags for paramedics, and a car first-aid kit, and a backpack for combat medics. Further, on the basis of these volumes, typical training standards and conditions for training are being developed today, including equipment tables for training centers. That is, the property that should be in educational centers for high-quality training of military personnel is standardized. Today, we continue to improve and standardize knowledge for instructors of the School of Tactical Medicine, which is under the command of the Command of the Medical Forces. All this is done with the aim of improving the quality of training of servicemen in providing pre-medical care. In addition, we are currently working on creating a turnstile testing laboratory in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Samples of turnstiles have already been selected, which should go for research. After all, unfortunately, we know the state of equipment of our research institutes. We are also negotiating with partners to complete the equipment, and we were able to complete a full cycle of these tests. Currently, we already have a simplified procedure for obtaining the primary officer rank for doctors who went to serve without having a military department. I think this problem is familiar to many: when doctors without a military department got into the recruiting centers, received the 100th VOS and went to serve in non-medical positions. But we know that a doctor needs to be trained for 10 years. We cannot afford that our doctors, if they want to serve in medical positions, do not serve where many of them end up. In addition, we have established cooperation with our partners on training courses for doctors. These are both international partners and, for example, Ukrainian partners - the Razom for Ukraine organization. Currently, a separate military accounting specialty is distinguished - -psychologist-, with the establishment of qualification restrictions for candidates for positions. In particular, psychological education should be mandatory. We already have combat trauma protocols approved by the Ministry of Health - there are 12 of them today. Another 19 protocols are currently being developed by experts of the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Health and the Security Service of Ukraine, which is a huge step forward. We have approved volumes of pre-hospital medical care. The document is based on the real experience of Ukrainian doctors at stabilization centers and advanced surgical units. And the medical doctrine of NATO forces 410, which speaks of four levels of assistance, was taken as a framework. The drug formulary was updated for the year 2025 - since then, at most, drugs without proven effectiveness have been deleted. Military servicemen who underwent treatment in Ukraine are equal in rights. It used to be four months. And those who undergo treatment abroad - 12 months with savings. Currently, the duration is 12 months, regardless of where the patient is treated. A reintegration center for servicemen released from captivity has also been identified in the Armed Forces. This is the first center in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We have several projects, for example, with Recovery, which are updating our military hospitals: starting with equipment, for example, boiler rooms and their re-equipment, modernization, renewal - and ending with repairs in several of our hospitals. This is also very good. If we talk about general processes, I would like to single out the implementation of the electronic health care system in military hospitals and military units. Our specialists have finished testing the primary medical record of the wounded in one of the directions in the area of ​​hostilities. And now we will implement a pilot project on the digitalization of medical services of military units in the combat zone. We have launched a system for declaring economic activity from medical practice. The process now takes up to two minutes. The same declaration has worked with the licensing of activities related to the use of narcotic anesthetics and analgesics. After our interview, we will have a coordination meeting with the nuclear regulatory inspectorate regarding the declaration and use of ionizing radiation sources. It is an X-ray that is used in a combat zone, but we do not have a license for this use. — Human resource in the field of health care for the military. Is it enough? Are there enough medical facilities in Ukraine to provide medical services to the military? And overall capabilities? Do we plan to open new ones? - Yes, there is a problem with human resources, they are exacerbated by military actions, and this is understandable. It must be understood that the number of doctors in our country is not growing like this (clicks fingers.- Ed.). We cannot say that we need another 10,000 doctors tomorrow. A doctor has been in training for 10 years. And we need to effectively approach the formation of our system. I'm talking about training, training, management, bringing all resources together. Today it is happening. Our civilian system now takes the majority of servicemen who need treatment. Therefore, we need to find effective ways of interaction between different health care systems. This is the system of the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the SBU, the civilian system, the Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Health. — How do civilian and military healthcare systems interact at this stage? Are you satisfied with the outcome of this interaction? What have you been able to improve in the interaction? What else are you going to do? - The civilian system has opened up for military personnel - and that's a very good thing. Because without the support of the civilian system, military medicine would not survive. If we're talking about what we need to improve, it's the patient pathway and updating approaches to treatment. I have in mind clear patient routes for all military personnel - they must understand what happens to them next. Has he been treated? So, next he has to have rehabilitation - he has to know where it has to take place, how he can get to that rehabilitation, what steps he has to take, what the doctors have to do to get him there. This interaction exists where there are active managers, there it is more or less fixed. In some places, not so much. And it needs to be improved. I would really like to see military medicine be able to use civilian tools like e-referrals, e-prescriptions for service members who have chronic conditions. Why can't a military serviceman, as a citizen of Ukraine, get an electronic prescription from his doctor at a medical company or a medical center and go take blood pressure pills or insulin if he has diabetes? I would very much like to see our hospitals participate in a centralized procurement program, to have a medical information system implemented everywhere, to have integration with the electronic health system so that medical information for the serviceman is stored at all stages of his life, regardless of his status, that is, whether he is a civilian or a military serviceman. Plus, it would allow to reduce the number of papers for the heads of medical services. Many reports could be generated automatically. — Simplified officer rank system for doctors and pharmacists. Previously, it was noticed the dissatisfaction of the mobilized doctors, who, conditionally, had to dig trenches instead of treating people. Has this problem been solved? - He can dig trenches if he wants to. But the point is correct: doctors should treat people. Previously, those mobilized who qualified as doctors, but did not pass the military department, received the initial rank of -soldier- and, after passing the BZVP, received the specialty of -shooter-. Now a mobilized doctor can take officer courses at the Ukrainian Military Medical Academy of the Medical Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and receive the rank of -junior lieutenant of the medical service-, which will allow him to multiply his efficiency in the army and save many lives of other people. Of course, doctors who have already served for a certain time can also take officer courses. As of today, 250 people have received the primary officer rank, 33 are undergoing training. Work is ongoing. — In May, the Government of Ukraine allocated 750 million hryvnias for free dentures. Tell me, how many have already used the service of free dentures at this time? And what is needed to use this service? — At the moment, more than 1,800 people have used it. I consider it our great success that today three of our military hospitals are also participating in this project. These are our dental polyclinic, Kharkiv Hospital, Odesa Hospital, which have signed agreements with the NHSHU. Next, we're going to talk about the unified medical space, and that's great. The service can be used by: military personnel who have not yet received the status of UBD, but continue to perform combat tasks; participants in hostilities who took part in ATO/OOS or in the period of repelling and deterring the armed aggression of the Russian Federation; persons with disabilities as a result of the war, received during direct participation in the ATO / OOS or during the repulsion and containment of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation. To use the service, you need to have a referral from a dentist and contact a medical facility that is on the list of pilot project participants. In the institution, it will be necessary to fill out an application and provide a package of copies of documents with the presentation of their originals. — Regarding the recent order of the MoU 598 on -regulation of the scope of medical care at the pre-hospital stage in the defense forces and security forces-. Please explain in more detail what this order is about, how important it is, and what problems it solves. - This order defines at what stage a service member who is a patient is provided with a service to preserve his life and functionality. There, everything is divided into four levels: role 1, role 2, role 3, role 4. This is the NATO standard, which our military doctors have reached through practice. But until now, all this has not been normalized: before the issuance of this order, it was not clear what amount of assistance is provided for -role one-, I mean stabilization points. In what volume, by what doctors, equipment is the assistance provided? What happens next with the military? Where should he go next? So, we are talking about the organization of medical assistance in the area of ​​hostilities. In fact, this is the first document that describes these processes. It's quite a multi-tiered system. And this first order is the key, as the entrance to this system. Then it will only unfold. - Have the volumes been coordinated with the active military medics, nachmeds and others who are affected by this order? We have a working group of 18 people. These are people from the Command of the Medical Forces, from military hospitals, from the military ranks of nachmeds and doctors practicing in the field. In addition, my colleagues regularly go to the headquarters and advanced surgical units of Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk region, and Kharkiv region and discuss these issues with practicing doctors and chief medics who are in this area of ​​the front. Such field work and consultations will continue. We don't make orders to tick a box. It is important for us to solve the problems that are on the front line. Unfortunately, there are a lot of them. There are those that we can solve, and to do that we need to identify them correctly. So it's worth talking to people who are directly in the area of ​​execution. We constantly go to them, constantly communicate with them. We probably didn't have a month when one of us didn't go there. If the problem is not talked about, then it does not exist. The problem must be talked about, and the military must talk. And that's why it's so important to us that people talk openly. I am motivated by the fact that there is a normal trusting relationship with the military, when people talk about what worries them, what they do not understand, what they would like to change. And it's actually a great experience, especially when you get feedback afterwards. I had such a first meeting at one time in the Donetsk direction. We gathered the nachmeds, and I introduced myself as the director of the Department of Health of the MOU. We sat and talked for several hours. And I always leave my phone number, ask to call me, write. Later, after some time, it was very nice to receive feedback from those people. — How do partner countries help you in your work? — Today, our partners are closing down tactical medicine, they have updated equipment in our hospitals and military units. Germany should supply us with eight mobile hospitals. We are negotiating the further supply of armored vehicles. — What are the plans in the department until the end of 2024? What are you planning to implement, launch? What are you planning for 2025? - We will emphasize training and training of military personnel in providing first aid. There are also training standards that are currently in the works. We are expanding opportunities for training military psychologists, expanding the course. We are currently negotiating with the Ministry of Health to conduct more such courses on the basis of disaster medicine centers - they have very good capabilities. As part of the implementation of the unified medical space, we are working on the implementation of medical information systems in the Armed Forces. We are working on improving reintegration measures. An order is being developed for a modular structure of medical support for Roles 1 and 2. We are conducting research with American colleagues on the problem of multidrug-resistant and nosocomial infections. I think this problem is also known to everyone. Based on the results of this study, it will be necessary to develop an action plan and further implement it. We are working on settling the issue of removing the bodies of the dead. Behind every word is a huge amount of work.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/19/pro-takmed-onovlennya-gospitaliv-ta-pervynne-vijskove-zvannya-dlya-likariv-intervyu-z-ochilnyczeyu-departamentu-ohorony-zdorovya-mou/	2024-10-18T21:09:43-07:00
95 people were returned from Russian captivity, among them defenders -Azovstali-	On October 19, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy informs about this. -Every time Ukraine rescues its people from Russian captivity, we are getting closer to the day when freedom will be returned to all who are in Russian captivity,- he noted. The head of state thanked the team engaged in the search and release of prisoners. -We are doing everything to get all our people who are detained by Russia out. Thanks to the soldiers who replenish the exchange fund and to all the partners who help,- he said. The Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War announced that among those released from captivity today are national guardsmen , military sailors, soldiers of the Armed Forces, border guards and representatives of other units of the Security and Defense Forces. -Among those released are 69 soldiers and sergeants and 26 officers. -Many of our freed boys have serious illnesses and the consequences of serious injuries, as well as severe weight loss due to torture and malnutrition,- the statement said. It is noted that this is the 58th exchange organized by the Coordination Headquarters. As a result of our work, 3,767 people have already been freed from enemy captivity.

-Bronicles- become multi-purpose: protection with replaceable plates is purchased for French special...	As informs portal of the French Ministry of the Armed Forces, the development of the G3P project is part of CIEC's desire to anticipate the needs of combatants to ensure the quality and effectiveness of their support and personal protection, ArmyInform reports. As state experts of the defense portal Army Recognition, with the rapid development of military technologies and increasingly complex threats, the protection of combatants must constantly adapt without sacrificing maneuverability on the field. To overcome these challenges, the armed forces of various countries are investing in innovative materials that are both lightweight and highly resistant. Among the latest developments, the French Integrated Equipment Support Center (CIEC) introduced the new G3P modular bulletproof vest. According to Opex360, this new personal body armor will soon be equipped with French special forces units. G3P stands out for its modularity and integration of real-time monitoring technologies, providing effective protection and increasing the mobility of fighters. The development of lightweight and durable materials has become a priority for the military. Recent research has focused on solutions such as spider silk, mother-of-pearl and architectural materials that offer much higher levels of resilience than current technologies such as Kevlar. The new G3P body armor aims to provide modular protection adapted to different threats on the battlefield. This allows operators to adjust their protection according to the risk, using lighter ballistic plates for increased mobility or adding Class 4 plates to protect against armor-piercing rounds such as sniper bullets. G3P is made of several types of ceramics, including boron carbide, silicon carbide, and titanium. In addition to these advanced materials, the armor incorporates a plate integrity monitoring system called GMOS-TherMOS developed by CIEC in collaboration with an industrial partner. This system constantly monitors the condition of the plates with the help of integrated sensors, immediately notifying the soldier of damage or exposure to temperatures that could impair their effectiveness. This system offers two main advantages: it allows combatants to independently inspect and replace their plates when necessary, and it eliminates the need for expensive and time-consuming radiographic inspections. The leadership of the French army expects that by 2025, more than 60,000 GMOS-TherMOS chips will be manufactured for such control measurements to equip 15,000 tablets, including for special forces. This new generation of body armor could be a turning point in soldier protection, combining lightness, efficiency and technological innovation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/19/broniky-stayut-bagatoczilovymy-dlya-franczuzkyh-speczpryznachencziv-zakupovuyut-zahyst-zi-zminnymy-plastynamy/	2024-10-18T20:33:36-07:00
It was possible to find out who is behind the wave of fake mines in Ukraine	The National Police has been dealing with this kind of messages for more than a year, and a corresponding algorithm for responding to them has been developed. Letters about landmines are usually received by e-mail from anonymous addresses. The text of the messages also often coincides. Senders use multiple services that allow you to create temporary mailboxes within a single account. These services are popular, in particular, among hackers and various network fraudsters. This time, the letter was signed by a person who identified himself as a representative of the Fire Cells Group, a group that calls for attacks on the Ukrainian military and TCC employees through telegrams, promising rewards from $100 to $1,000 for crimes. Investigators from -Scheme- (Radio Svoboda) established that the sender of the letters lives in occupied Crimea and has a passport of the Russian Federation. The enemy regularly tries to destabilize the situation in our state through fake mining For example, one of these -waves- was in mid-January 2022. The SBU considers these actions to be part of a Russian information and psychological operation aimed at increasing panic among the population and undermining trust in government institutions and the military.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/19/vdalos-zyasuvaty-hto-stoyit-za-hvyleyu-fejkovyh-zaminuvan-v-ukrayini/	2024-10-18T20:24:34-07:00
In Dnipro, he received a lifetime -mole-, who drained the FSB of the movement of military equipment ...	This is reported by the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with the confiscation of all his property. Prosecutors proved in court that an employee of a railway station in the city of Dnipro, having pro-Russian views, voluntarily agreed to cooperate with Russian special services. In order to fulfill the tasks of an employee of the FSB of the Russian Federation, the man sent via messenger information about the number, type and movement of military equipment of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation by rail.

In Toretsk, the Defense Forces successfully counterattack, but it is extremely difficult to gain a f...	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — The situation in Toretsk is difficult, it has been so for several weeks, but it remains under control. We manage to contain the enemy despite the Russians pushing, she said. The tactics of enemy assaults remain unchanged. — They use assaults in small groups under the cover of artillery, mortars and drones. They are completely destroying the city without leaving a single house or shelter there, and thus trying to break through our defenses in the city of Toretsk, the spokeswoman said. At the same time, units of the Defense Forces not only repel the enemy and restrain his offensive actions, but also counterattack the Russians, pushing them back from those parts of the city that they managed to enter. This is possible due to the fact that the enemy cannot gain a foothold on the ruins - he does not have any shelters. — We are trying to push the enemy out of those areas where they are supposedly entrenched, because they are trying to occupy areas where there is nothing left. Absolutely nothing, no houses, no shelters. Accordingly, we are trying to drive them out of these already destroyed areas. We manage it very well, they suffer heavy losses and, accordingly, retreat, - said the military woman. However, it is extremely difficult for the fighters of the Defense Forces to gain a foothold in the areas of the city captured from the enemy for the same reason - it is difficult to find and arrange shelter there. - This is extremely difficult, as most of the shelters have been destroyed and there is almost nothing left. You yourself have seen these footage from Toretsk. But this is possible because there is an appropriate set of measures followed by our servicemen and it allows them to fight effectively in the city without resorting to such -meat- assaults as are used by the Russians, the spokeswoman explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that on the Toretsk direction, the enemy is using outdated armored vehicles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/u-toreczku-syly-oborony-uspishno-kontratakuyut-odnak-zakripytysya-na-ruyinah-ukraj-vazhko/	2024-10-18T10:21:50-07:00

Wired UAVs, weather conditions and accumulation of enemy troops: what's new in the north of Kharkiv ...	About this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon told the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU Lt. Col. Yevgeny Romanov. — Compared to what is happening in Donetsk region, the situation here is a little easier, but it remains difficult. Defense forces continue to hold back the onslaught of the Russian occupation forces. Since the beginning of the week, there have been 24 combat clashes in the direction of Staritsa, Vovchansk, he said. Also, since the beginning of the week, the occupiers have carried out more than 1,500 attacks on the positions of the defenders of Ukraine, including almost 150 attacks by kamikaze drones. The onset of natural autumn has already begun to have a certain effect on hostilities. — If we talk about the current week, then the weather makes a little difference. Now it's raining, fog. This complicates the work of both reconnaissance unmanned aerial systems and strike drones, the officer explained. The occupiers are trying to adapt to the weather conditions and take into account countermeasures from the Defense Forces of Ukraine. A noticeable innovation on the part of the enemy was the use of UAVs with wire communication. — They constantly change the technical component. Now there are kamikaze drones that are controlled by an operator with the help of wires. Therefore, countermeasures from EW units do not affect them, this is a protected communication channel. There are already such cases, the military officer said. He also noted that the enemy is constantly improving the means of electronic warfare. At the same time, the occupiers lack armored vehicles. It is few and its application on the battlefield is not often resorted to, mainly resorting to the tactics of assaults by small infantry groups. - Statistics show that among the destroyed equipment of the occupiers, automotive equipment prevails. They use the tactics of small groups, try to find some places where they can enter, using the topography of the area or the difficult weather conditions that have developed in Kharkiv Oblast. They actively use unmanned aerial vehicles, drop ammunition, and also fire at Ukrainian servicemen with the help of kamikaze drones, the spokesman said. The officer also reported that Ukrainian intelligence records a certain accumulation of enemy forces on the other side of the border. — There is a certain accumulation of the enemy on the other side of the state border. -Intelligence is monitoring this, the places of accumulation are being identified, and fire damage is being inflicted on them,- Yevgeny Romanov said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Kharkiv direction, the use of North Korean artillery shells was recorded and the quality of these ammunition was assessed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/drotovi-bpla-pogodni-umovy-ta-nakopychennya-vorozhyh-vijsk-shho-novogo-na-pivnochi-harkivshhyny/	2024-10-18T09:40:18-07:00

The first in Rivne region and the 44th in Ukraine: the recruiting center of the Ukrainian army opene...	About this informs the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. From now on, you can get information about joining the Defense Forces and recruit in the selected unit for the selected position at the following address: Kostopil, str. Nezalezhnosti, 7. Civilian recruiters who have undergone professional training also provide consultation by phone: +38 (098) 934 1899, +38 (066) 865 2830. Currently, more than 10,000 vacancies in the Defense Forces are available in the recruiting centers of the Ukrainian Army: in ZSU, NSU, DPSU, SBU and other formations and bodies. -We started a joint initiative with the Ministry of Defense and local authorities to attract motivated citizens to the ranks of the Armed Forces. This is not our first experience - we previously recruited for the National Guard and the Border Service through the Rivne Central Military Academy. Now we are expanding this practice, actively looking for potential military personnel for various units,- said Serhiy Podolin, the first deputy head of Rivne OVA. The recruiting center of the Ukrainian army does not issue summonses. At most, you can be recruited into the selected part even after receiving a summons to clarify data. -Local self-government should actively help the state resist Russian aggression. Therefore, we are glad to join this initiative of the Ministry of Defense. This is a new approach, where people can calmly come, get information and consider their choice,- emphasized the acting secretary of the city council. Davyd Didukh, Mayor of Kostopol. To date, more than 21,000 people have applied to the network of recruiting centers of the Ukrainian army. Recruiters control the process of recruiting volunteers to the defense forces, and in case of misunderstandings, the support service resolves them. -This is really a unique opportunity. During the war, the state together with the community gives a choice: to choose where to serve, with whom to serve and in what position. You can go to the Internet, read about the units, and find out about current vacancies in the recruiting center and get in touch with the unit,- said Oleksiy Bezhevets, the authorized representative of the Ministry of Defense on recruiting issues. He also added that recruiting primarily involves concluding a contract. However, it is currently possible to choose a specific military unit even through the mobilization procedure. Citizens can directly contact the selected part, go through registration and start the service.

Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, explained the reasons on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni-. — They still use this tactic, which, unfortunately, has proven to be effective for them. We are trying to contain the enemy. At the same time, they use little equipment, unlike other areas [in the area of ​​responsibility] of the Luhansk OTU, she said. The officer explained why the enemy had few armored vehicles in the Toretsk direction. - Motorized rifle brigades are standing opposite us, as the Russians themselves stated in their telegram channels. Accordingly, the motorized rifle brigades are not as well equipped with equipment as, for example, the airborne troops of the Russians, the military woman said. Because of this, all the little equipment the enemy uses here is also obsolete. - This is due to the fact that they do not use much equipment, and also to the fact that they use very old equipment, such as MTLB or old combat armored vehicles, the spokeswoman explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Forces defense told about the Russian losses in Toretsk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/drevni-behy-ta-motolygy-chomu-na-toreczkomu-napryamku-vorog-zastosovuye-zastarilu-bronetehniku/	2024-10-18T08:37:28-07:00

Thus, in the control bodies of the air commands, they began to actively implement automation complexes, which will significantly increase the effectiveness of destroying the air enemy. The Air Force continues to be saturated with modern EW systems. This will increase the reliability of the protection of objects that are covered from air strikes. -A separate topic &#8211; the use of interceptor drones as a substitute for anti-aircraft missiles in the fight against UAVs. We are definitely a leader in this direction and continue to improve this air defense subsystem. Sincere thanks to everyone who implements relevant solutions, helps, trains and produces drones that intercept enemy UAVs. Thank you to the Ukrainian soldiers who guard our airspace around the clock! Also, one of the key tasks is to ensure anti-aircraft cover of critical infrastructure facilities,- said Oleksandr Syrskyi.

There are North Korean projectiles: the quality of ammunition from the DPRK was assessed at the OTU ...	What are the results of their use on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon? told the spokesman of the -Kharkiv- OTU, Lt. Col. Evgeny Romanov. — There was information that the Russians had received ammunition from North Korea. But it is quite difficult to determine exactly which ammunition is old Soviet or old Korean [used by the enemy], because these are the standard calibers of Soviet artillery systems - 122 and 152 mm, he said. The officer noted that the quality of ammunition from North Korea is low. — North Korean projectiles, due to long-term storage or the characteristics of a low culture of production, they do not hit the target so well. Therefore, inaccurate shooting is observed, the spokesman explained. ArmyInform previously reported that ->North Korea has become the second country that openly supports Russia in the war, and the head of the GUR told where Russia will send the first batch of North Korean infantry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/pivnichnokorejski-snaryady-ye-v-otu-harkiv-oczinyly-yakist-boyeprypasiv-z-kndr/	2024-10-18T07:31:21-07:00

A Mix of Noobs and Gurus: What the Defense Forces Are Finding About Enemy Captured	This was reported by the spokesman of the National Guard on the live broadcast of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- Ruslan Muzychuk of Ukraine. -We must understand and we see from such cases, when it is possible to capture infantrymen or representatives of other branches of the enemy's forces, that their equipment and general preparation depend on the direction where the battle is taking place,- he said. In areas more important to them, the occupiers use trained and better equipped military. — In areas where the enemy sets himself the task of concentrating his main efforts, highly trained units of marines and game are used, — said the spokesman of NSU. On the other hand, there are also less important areas for the enemy, where the less trained military armies of the Russian Federation are outnumbered. — We also see that there are areas where low-intensity hostilities are taking place. There, the enemy can engage units that are not always sufficiently prepared. These may be, in particular, those who have recently been mobilized, the guard explained. As an example, he cited the case of the capture of ten occupiers during the clearing of a forest massif in the north of the Kharkiv region. — During the task of clearing the north of Kharkiv Oblast, servicemen of the 13th Brigade captured 10 occupiers. These are mostly motorized rifle units. These captives now add to our exchange pool. As for the time of their stay in the military formations of the aggressor country, sometimes it is from three months. This, of course, if we talk about the infantry. But it happens that there are officers, certain commanders who have combat experience and have performed tasks before that in other directions, who lead less trained personnel, Ruslan Muzychuk said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, that the GUR and -Charter- captured several dozen invaders in the north of Kharkiv Oblast - it was a motley contingent of servicemen of the Russian army.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/miks-nubiv-ta-guru-yakyh-vysnovkiv-dijshly-u-sylah-oborony-shhodo-zahoplenyh-u-polon-vorogiv/	2024-10-18T06:57:25-07:00
The ground forces revealed who the universal anti-tank missile fighters are	This is notified by the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ATGMs are an important component of modern warfare, especially for combating armored vehicles, tanks, and other armored targets. These fighters undergo special training for the effective use of missile systems such as -Stugna-P-, -Javelin- or -Corsair-, which are currently actively used on the front lines by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Fagot anti-tank missile complex, which was developed back in the 1960s, also remains in service. -Bagot- requires the fighter to have accurate targeting and an excellent understanding of combat tactics, since the complex uses a semi-automatic targeting system, and the missile flies to the target by wire control. Versatile fighters who have mastered the Bassoon are able to effectively deal with tank threats on the battlefield. Despite the age of the system, the Fagot ATGM continues to be an important element of anti-tank defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, especially in conditions of active hostilities. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that The defense forces told the story of the defense of the South Donbas mine near Ugledar.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/suhoputni-vijska-rozpovily-hto-taki-universalni-bijczi-ptrk/	2024-10-18T06:44:01-07:00

Earlier ArmyInform reported that the paratroopers repelled another assault by the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/syly-oborony-rozpovily-istoriyu-oborony-pivdennodonbaskoyi-shahty-bilya-vugledaru/	2024-10-18T06:26:26-07:00
Permanent line of defense and the fight against drones: the Defense Forces spoke about the situation...	The spokesperson of the National Guards of Ukraine Ruslan Muzychuk. — In the south, in the areas where our units are performing tasks, the enemy is conducting combat operations of relatively low intensity. It must be understood that the nature of the terrain there is a steppe area, where a fortified line of defense was well built on both sides. Even recalling last year and the fighting that took place in those areas, we are talking about open terrain, well-fortified, mined approaches to the area and so on, he said. In view of this, the Russian occupiers have currently focused on conducting aerial reconnaissance and preparing for assaults and attacks in certain areas, in particular in the area of ​​islands on the Dnieper. — In some places, the enemy is accumulating certain units, active aerial reconnaissance is being conducted. The enemy is trying to use, first of all now, his units to try to storm and capture certain island areas along the Dnieper. There are also official reports about this in the areas, in particular in the Kherson region, the spokesman said. Defense forces have shown high effectiveness in countering Russian long-range reconnaissance UAVs, and it is in the South that this fight using FPV drones has been particularly intense. — We also see that the activity of reconnaissance drones of the -Orlan- and -Zala- type is traditionally quite high in the southern directions. Countering this, our military personnel, in particular UAV units, destroy and shoot down such drones. This is quite important work, because it does not allow the enemy to find out the location of our forces and means both in the previous edge and in depth in the depth of the defense. Such enemy drones are effectively destroyed with our FPV drones. However, in general, I can note that there are quite a large number of them both in the southern directions and in other areas where active hostilities are currently taking place, Ruslan Muzychuk said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that velykogo-nastupu/->in the South, the occupiers are forming assault groups: the Armed Forces said whether there is a threat of a major offensive.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/stala-liniya-oborony-ta-borotba-z-rozviddronamy-u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-pro-sytuacziyu-na-pivdni/	2024-10-18T06:11:35-07:00

Sold to Russia -for a dose-: SBU detained arsonists in two regions of Ukraine	The Security Service of Ukraine informs about this. The occupiers promised the participants money for the performance of enemy tasks. However, instead of a financial reward, the enemy henchmen received suspicion from Ukrainian law enforcement officers.

Capture Selidove: what is the purpose of the enemy hitting the city and its surroundings with aircra...	The spokesman of the National Guard of Ukraine, Ruslan Muzychuk, told about this on the live broadcast of the national telethon -Yedini Novyny- . — The enemy continues heavy shelling with artillery both on the settlement of Selidove and on the flanks. Our servicemen note that aviation is quite actively and densely used. During the periods when airstrikes continue on certain areas, on certain areas of defense, up to 8-10 air defense systems can fly in an hour or two hours, he said. The spokesman explained the purpose of the enemy's artillery and air strikes. — The enemy uses them to destroy our fortified positions. These are also strikes on the outskirts of Selidovoy and other settlements in the Pokrovsky and Kurakhiv directions. The enemy is trying both to destroy the city itself and to make certain areas unsuitable [for defense], as well as to identify our positions on the outskirts of the city itself in order to strike them, the officer said. The spokesman told where the enemy is trying to attack. — A large concentration of the enemy's forces, his efforts to advance, takes place precisely on the flanks from the direction of Marynivka. The enemy is also trying to actively press on the southern flanks of the city itself. As for attempts to enter the city, we see that the enemy in particular uses assaults in some places. This concerns the eastern flanks from the Mykhailivka direction, Ruslan Muzychuk said. Despite the powerful pressure of the occupiers, the Defense Forces are firmly holding their positions. — Last day, our servicemen repelled mechanized assaults with the involvement of several units of armored vehicles on the eastern outskirts of Selidovoy. Currently, our servicemen do not allow the enemy to enter the city. First of all, of course, this is possible thanks to the effective work of adjacent units, as well as the detection of assault attempts in advance, he explained. The officer said that during the past day, the guardsmen had held all their positions. — Over the last day, our fighters did not lose positions, despite the high intensity of the assaults. The very intensity of the assaults is evidenced by the fact that more than 113 enemy infantrymen were destroyed by irreversible and sanitary losses during that day, said Ruslan Muzychuk.

NATO Secretary General: Military aid to Ukraine exceeded 20 billion dollars this year	About this informs the Office of the President of Ukraine. In particular, they discussed steps that will give Ukrainians more protection and security. This is Volodymyr Zelenskyi's third meeting with Mark Rutte since he took the post of NATO Secretary General. According to the President, this testifies to the high level of relations between Ukraine and the Alliance. -Ukraine really deserves to become the 33rd member of NATO one day, and therefore we will do everything to make it happen. Therefore, the first point of the Victory Plan is an invitation to NATO. Ukrainians have demonstrated that we are capable of protecting common values,- the head of state said. According to him, the very invitation of Ukraine to the Alliance will strengthen the country diplomatically and bring it closer to a real and just peace. -It would be wrong to politically leave Ukraine outside the Alliance, when in practice Ukraine is already a part of NATO,- the President noted. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also thanked the partners - members of the Alliance, who help develop Ukrainian defense production, rebuild critical infrastructure facilities and provide military assistance. -We are counting on the readiness of NATO members to provide the already announced financial assistance to Ukraine in the total amount of 40 billion euros before the next NATO summit in The Hague,- added the head of state. Mark Rutte noted that NATO member countries provided Ukraine with $20.9 billion in the first half of this year. military aid -For the past three weeks, I have spoken with all allies. There is absolute unity. We will make every effort to ensure that Ukraine receives everything it needs to protect itself from Russia. We will continue to do it,- said the NATO Secretary General. According to him, this war showed that instability in Europe can have far-reaching consequences for the whole world. -China has become a decisive factor contributing to Russia's war against Ukraine. And he cannot continue to fuel Europe's biggest conflict since World War II without it affecting his interests and reputation. Iran and North Korea fuel the Russian war machine with missiles and drones in exchange for supporting their military industries. That is why we must clearly assess the challenges before us,- Mark Rutte emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, Volodymyr Zelensky visited Ukrainian soldiers being treated in one of the military hospitals.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/gensek-nato-vijskova-dopomoga-ukrayini-czogo-roku-perevyshhyla-20-milyardiv-dolariv/	2024-10-17T21:23:57-07:00

About the generation -hutin- and the chances of propaganda to repeat the fate of -Radio thousand hil...	— So, Mr. Roman, we haven't seen each other for a year and a half, a lot has changed in the life of Ukraine, at the front, and in the world. Our current meeting is taking place at the Information Agency, so I would like to know your opinion about the course of information battles during this period. Your view on these transformations. - A lot has changed in a year and a half, but a lot has remained absolutely constant. The main position is that Ukraine was, is and will be. And during the war, I think this is a fundamentally important thing. Especially when you consider that we are fighting one of the largest armies on this planet. There is a nuclear bomb and all sorts of other things. Therefore, it should be recorded. Of course, there are losses, but we have come a long way, and it concerns both the Armed Forces and society in general. As for information wars, there is an opinion, and I also adhere to it, that the modern information society is like that river, it is such an unstoppable flow. And accordingly, we have to participate in this process so that, relatively speaking, it is from our river that people draw information. And to say that something has radically changed, no. the Russians both lied and continue to lie. We explain the main thesis that this is our state, and we will fight and fight for it. And I do not see fundamental changes in these processes. There are, of course, some accents that they make, if we talk about enemies, on certain events, but, in my opinion, everything has become too much here. And the Russians, that is, the Russian monsters, broadcast the thesis that -just a little bit more and they will come to the walls of Kyiv-, and they continue to broadcast, even though the battles are being fought in the Kursk region, for example. And they continue to tell their viewers that everything is fine with them and everything is going -according to Putin's plan-. the war If you compare the issue of Crimea against their mobilization, of course they will say: -We don't need Crimea either. And Suzha, take the fuck away too. Nothing is needed! Stop the war!- - Still, what do you think Ukraine looks like on the field of information confrontation? - Here we need to decide what we are talking about. The base is unchanged. We are a state that is fighting back against an aggressive Russian invasion, everyone is helping us, but not the Russians. And this is probably the main point. No matter what anyone says, first of all, my personal belief is that as soon as someone in our country says that he is tired, it is usually people who are very far from the front. But if under some circumstances they get closer to the front, you see, they also have more energy, because energy is survival. Regardless of any nuances, we continue the fight, mobilization measures are taking place, help is provided to us . And it is not only about three or four types of aircraft that our partners transfer to us. And this is to the point that no one is tired of Ukraine in the West. And this is the base for me. And the Russians, well, they were ugly, and they remain so. These are people who profess such pure Nazism, adapted Moscow Hitlerism. Putin's birthday was recently. And this personality cult, in my opinion, surpassed what existed before that in the former USSR. When every school thinks that it must write something about how they love Putin, how they love this tsar, or rather, the under-tsar, that is complete nonsense. And when they teach the word -hutin- to five-year-old children, the children stand on their knees, and this is seen not only by Ukrainians, but also in the West. In the West, in America, elections. Left or right come to power there. And Russian propagandists pedal these topics. But if we apply a little, speaking in the language of television, a kind of zoom and enlarge this picture that we are looking at, then these conversations of the Russians that there, in that overseas state, they will vote this way or that way, will vote badly and will not help us, they will leave us to our own devices. All these conversations have been coming from them for the last two and a half years. But what is happening all this time: the policy of our allies does not change in matters of principle. If we are talking specifically about information during the war, everything is very simple. If the state continues to fight, it means that the information war is definitely not lost. If we take some polls, then, of course, we have many such -bedside- and -bed-sofa warriors- who, knowingly or not, disperse a verbal blizzard. But still, the people support their state, their army. There is, of course, the category we mentioned, who are tired of living in Ukraine. If someone there says that somewhere in Odessa some fool climbed a monument with a Russian flag, then these are people for whom a psychiatrist is just crying. And there is one more point. And for us here is a very good assistant. As soon as someone has stupid thoughts in their head, the Russian KAB flies to this place. And it immediately enlightens the brain, it seems to me, to everyone. - Since the beginning of the large-scale Russian aggression in Ukraine, access to enemy TV channels and websites has been restricted. Of course, there are technical possibilities to bypass these blocks, but, frankly, I am personally disgusted to see these campaigns based on the motives of -old songs about the main thing-. As for you, according to your profession, you have to review that propagandist delusion in order to debunk it. Are you strong enough for this? — Well, listen, I would still like to treat this as a kind of information doctor, a surgeon with a saw, who deals with amputation. I treat it calmly, only as a job, I don't have any hatred or anything else. Well, in such an aspect that when I look at and hear this delusion, it does not force me to change my cold view of it. That is, the enemy in general must be studied: what they emphasize, how they praise Putin is already being praised for some reason in order to understand what is happening in the Russian information space. Yes, of course, he is totally Nazi, but the trend itself is such that any of their sources, which issue a minimal alternative opinion from the official one, as they wage war against us, they immediately shut up their own. These are just the criteria for the fact that they are not all right there either. And the Russian Federation, it is fighting in full force. And it is clear that these hours of hatred in the zombie box can affect only those people, and there is such a category of people in Ukraine as well, who simply, as I said, nothing can fix them except a psychiatrist and the SBU. By and large, it works on Russian territory exclusively on the principle of permanent exposure of the population. That is, for many years, at least since 2014, there were many TV channels there, and they have remained so. Some faces on the screen may change there, and not always. And they broadcast this Nazi thesis that Russia is -above everyone-, that they can do whatever they want with other people. So I actually really like that, on the one hand, they , talking about how everything is cool with them, they will beat us in a little while, on the other hand, recently, they began to secretly say that -there is no need to relax, the West will always help the Ukrainians, they are still mobilizing there (in Ukraine) there will be a sufficient number of men and women who will defend Ukraine with weapons in their hands.- They are constantly counting our planes, offering to nuke Paris. And fighting at full strength, they still cannot defeat us. That is, we may have certain territorial losses, that is understandable. But fundamentally, Putin has already lost. I recently heard this thesis from them on TV channels that, despite all the losses of our Ukrainian people, Ukraine will remain. Because they came here in order to destroy it. - During the period of work in Moscow, you got to know personally most of the Russian media people, who are now spewing this propaganda scum on the air. Have you noticed any changes in these Putin heralds? - These people will not follow Putin into the trenches. I do not think that we should worry about the fate of the conditional -Oli Skabeeva-, and by this name we mean all the top Russian propagandists. Most of them understand everything perfectly. I would probably only single out Masha Sakharova (the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation — Ed.), among such ardent believers, but she is such a real Putinist. With such, in principle, there is no need to negotiate. Otherwise, everything is very simple. To finally draw parallels with Nazi Germany, we need to win the war. Now it is very far from that. First of all, I'm not sure that most of them, if everything goes the way we've talked about before and we bomb Moscow, I'm not sure that these people in principle will live to see The Hague (International Criminal Court, the first legal a permanent institution whose competence includes the prosecution of persons responsible for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. — Ed.), to court and so on. And we will decide as these questions are raised. But I will emphasize once again: they know perfectly well what they are doing, they know perfectly well what game they are playing. They know perfectly well what happened to those who created the radio station -Radio a thousand hills- (a Rwandan radio station that broadcasted from July 8, 1993 to July 31, 1994 and played a significant role in the genocide in Rwanda. — Ed.). These are the generals of the information forces of the Russian Federation, this is one of such powerful units of the Russian army. Putin never saves money on them, they have a complete limit, and even the latest reports indicate that these budgets are increasing. Therefore, we should not think about what will happen to them, we should think about what will happen to us. Next will be…	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/pro-pokolinnya-hutina-ta-shansy-rospropagandy-povtoryty-dolyu-radio-tysyachi-pagorbiv-intervyu-z-romanom-czymbalyukom/	2024-10-17T21:00:54-07:00
Ukraine's victory plan: when to expect a turning point in the war with Russia. Expert opinion	Military expert Petro Chernyk specially commented on the positions of the Victory Plan for ArmyInform: -The Victory Plan, declared by the President of Ukraine, is nothing more than the framework of our state's activities in the strategy of entering the final phase of this war potentially next year. The overarching message is collective security. We are sending a signal to the whole world that we must fight against evil together. Potentially, this is an entry into NATO, although there is no hope that this will happen very soon. Unfortunately, everything rests on the position of the United States of America. Everything depends on them. Plus, let's not forget that we have antagonists in Europe, let's say people like Hungary. There is a full and adequate awareness on the part of our state-building that our eternal eastern enemy, Russia, understands only force. And the position on strategic non-nuclear deterrence is nothing more than the so-called large missile shield. First of all, these are long-range missiles with a range of 500 to 700 km. We have operational-tactical missile complex -Grim-2-. It is an analogue of the Russian Iskander. It is necessary to increase the launchers of this complex, about 50-60 units. And each installation should have 200-300 missiles in its arsenal. This, indeed, will be a very serious argument. And the most important point is to reach such a power parity that after the end of this phase of the war, the Russians no longer dare to use a military instrument against us. It is necessary to decipher what is called the -Donbas- issue. Indeed, at the moment, without showering Donbas with tens of thousands of bombs, it is almost impossible to repel it with conventional weapons, if the enemy maintains the stability of its defenses. But it must be emphasized: if we have a large combat parity built up, then even such an intermediate defeat of the Russian Federation can lead to a change of regime. That's when, during the regime change in the Kremlin, it is quite possible to return these territories back out of good will on their part. And the most important nuance. Somewhere in society there is an exaggerated expectation that there should be something in this document that spells out, step by step, down to the last millimeter how we will win this war. This does not happen. The document is primarily a cementing of our position, which sounds very simple. We will not give up our (temporarily occupied - ed.) territories. And no matter how long it takes us in the historical sense, sooner or later we will reach the borders of 1991.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/plan-peremogy-ukrayiny-koly-chekaty-perelomu-u-vijni-z-rosiyeyu-dumka-eksperta/	2024-10-17T20:43:49-07:00
On the threshold of the Third World: what is happening in the Asia-Pacific region and how it will af...	Tensions between China and Taiwan arise sporadically over China's claims to Taiwan as a -breakaway province- and Taiwan's desire to maintain its self-governing status. As a reminder, Taiwan (officially the Republic of China) is an island state with limited international recognition. The Republic of China had been on the mainland since 1912, but after losing the civil war to the Communists in 1949, the country's government evacuated to the island. China regularly conducts military exercises around Taiwan, underscoring its readiness to use force for so-called -reunification-. — The United States, although it officially recognizes Beijing, remains a key ally of Taiwan and provides it with defensive weapons. Tensions between the US and China are escalating over Washington's increased support for Taiwan. Over the past few years, China has repeatedly allegedly shown readiness to attack Taiwan, but no direct confrontation has yet taken place. The Chinese constantly resort to intimidation. For example, on October 15, Taiwan reported that it had been surrounded by 153 Chinese warplanes during a large-scale exercise. China's military maneuvers, dubbed -Joint Sword-2024B,- involved fighter jets, drones, warships and coast guards stationed around Taiwan. 90 aircraft entered the air defense identification zone, to which Taiwan responded by deploying its forces and increasing combat readiness. China has traditionally justified the drills as a warning against -separatist actions- or in response to statements by Taiwanese politicians. Tensions around the island remain high. The Chinese clearly observe the situation surrounding the Russian-Ukrainian war in the context of the West's readiness to respond to the actions of the occupier. If the US and its allies continue to act hesitantly, Beijing will believe that the consequences of an attack on Taiwan will be negligible. On October 14, Volodymyr Zelenskyi said that North Korea had actually joined the war against Ukraine. It is not only about the supply of weapons that are used against Ukraine, but also about the transfer of people to the Russian troops. On June 19 this year, Russian leader Vladimir Putin arrived in North Korea for the first time in 24 years. During the visit, an agreement on -comprehensive strategic partnership- was signed. The parties have agreed to provide each other with -military and other- assistance if one of them suffers an -armed attack.- North Korea recently announced a review of its maritime borders, which, of course, now for some reason have to go further south. It then said that South Korean drones allegedly violated airspace and dropped leaflets, and that another such incident would lead to catastrophic consequences. And then they brought their artillery to the demilitarized zone, blew up roads and mobilized 1.4 million citizens in just one week. And Kim Jong-un held a -security and defense meeting- with the entire military chain of command, including the heads of the general staff departments. On the evening of October 14, the head of the Kremlin submitted a project on the ratification of the -comprehensive strategic partnership- agreement to the Russian State Duma for consideration. Meanwhile, the GUR reported that the Russian Federation is already forming a -special Buryat battalion- from citizens of the DPRK. — The tension on the Korean Peninsula has already become a reason for politicians around the world to talk about the beginning of the Third World War. These events are especially interesting in the context of the actual involvement of the DPRK in the Russian-Ukrainian war as a supplier not only of weapons, but also of manpower for Russia. On October 15, North Korea blew up parts of two major highways and railways, the Kyonggi and Tonghae lines, that connected it to South Korea. The move, although symbolic as the roads have not been used for several years, underscores the growing tension between the two countries. The reason for these actions was accusations from Pyongyang that South Korea had allegedly launched drones carrying propaganda materials over the North Korean capital, as well as an official statement rejecting peaceful reunification. The deterioration of relations has been accompanied by mutual threats: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has threatened a nuclear strike in response to any provocations, while South Korea has said there will be severe consequences if nuclear weapons are used. South Korea says this is just a tactic by Pyongyang to create excuses for further provocations. At the same time, Seoul is actively developing its defense system against drones after an incident in 2022, when five North Korean drones entered its airspace and flew over the capital for several hours. The broken roads have been a symbol of rapprochement between the countries, particularly after the 2018 summit, when the leaders of the North and South announced a new era of peace and an end to war. However, North Korea has resumed the presence of heavy weapons in the demilitarized zone, effectively nullifying a 2018 military de-escalation agreement. Although tensions have indeed increased, the likelihood of a direct collision is currently low. It will be especially interesting to watch the events in the event of the election of Donald Trump as the president of the United States. He had a warm relationship with Kim Jong Un, and may even try to arrange his second meeting with him. Pyongyang's rapprochement with Washington is likely to have an impact on the North's participation in the Russian-Ukrainian war. On October 14, Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov arrived in the People's Republic of China on an official visit against the backdrop of bilateral naval exercises in the Northwest Pacific Ocean. This unequivocally indicates the intensification of cooperation between the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China in the field of defense. — For many years, Russia has been, if not a bargaining chip, then at most a junior partner of China in negotiations with the United States. In the context of the Russian-Ukrainian war, Beijing can be considered the main factor in Moscow's nuclear deterrence, because Xi Jinping would not like to destroy the current world order through a nuclear war. On October 13, Joe Biden reiterated the importance of continuing to work on reducing the nuclear threat and his willingness to negotiate with Russia, China and North Korea to reduce the risk of nuclear weapons use. Earlier, on September 25, Vladimir Putin announced the renewal of the country's nuclear doctrine, which now provides for the possibility of using nuclear weapons even in the event of aggression with the use of conventional weapons, if this creates a -critical threat.- Also, the new doctrine allows the use of nuclear weapons in the event of aggression against Belarus. This can be interpreted as an attempt at nuclear blackmail and an attempt by Russia to cause panic among Western politicians. Unfortunately, today we can say that the USA no longer has the authority with which it managed to oppose the USSR during the Reagan era. The Kremlin now pays more attention not to a possible armed response by Washington and NATO, but to the word of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China. Given the recent events, which primarily include the US disaster in Afghanistan and the failure to arm Ukraine, Biden can no longer speak from a position of strength. An example of disrespect for Washington is also the involvement of the DPRK in the Russian-Ukrainian war; -permission- for such actions could only be given by Beijing. An important event in the context of the US-China-Russia negotiations will be the G20 summit, which will be held in Brazil on November 18-19. By that time, the results of the American elections will be known and the meeting will take place in the Rammstein format. It is important for the Americans to start gaining success in the international arena, which will strengthen their position in the negotiation process. And the first such success should be providing Ukraine with all the necessary weapons to stop the Russian offensive.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/na-porozi-tretoyi-svitovoyi-shho-vidbuvayetsya-v-azijsko-tyhookeanskomu-regioni-i-yak-cze-vplyne-na-vijnu-v-ukrayini/	2024-10-17T20:33:00-07:00
Artificial intelligence helps the enemy stamp fakes	Such posts contain appeals to congratulate with the likes, either on a birthday, or on a wedding, or to pray, because now it is difficult in a certain area of ​​the front. There are also similar posts about animals rescued after shelling, children or elderly people, about mothers whose sons are taken to war, etc. Why do Ukrainians mass distribute such content? Because he puts good pressure on emotions. The emotion is the deceptive feeling that by sharing the picture, we will help someone with something. The purpose of such posts is to encourage people to respond. In this way, these images receive thousands of interactions from real users, which contributes to the rapid promotion of the pages on which they are placed. And the enemy gets a platform to promote narratives that are dangerous for Ukraine. After all, it is very beneficial for him if Ukrainians fall into the role of victims. To spread panic. To perceive their own army as victims. After all, victims do not fight. The threat of such posts also lies in the fact that they can be used for fraud, because they often contain malicious links disguised as, for example, a petition that needs to be signed. In addition, fictional, painted soldiers or wounded children level real servicemen or wounded children, and give the enemy a reason to accuse our country of lying. Now the OpenAI company, the developer of ChatGPT, warns that fake political content created by AI tools is spreading online. And it concerns not only the Russian-Ukrainian war, but also the elections in the USA, events surrounding Israel, Taiwan, North and South Korea. In particular, an Iranian propaganda operation with fake English-language news sites purporting to reflect various American political positions was disrupted. Therefore, one should constantly observe information hygiene in the network and in no case be subject to emotional manipulation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/shtuchnyj-intelekt-dopomagaye-vorogu-shtampuvaty-fejky/	2024-10-17T20:22:04-07:00

As a result of the special operation in Donetsk region and Odesa, three Russian agents were detained. They turned out to be a resident of Kramatorsk and two Odessans who supported racism. According to the instructions of the FSB, they went around their cities, where they secretly fixed the nodal railway stations involved in the transportation of heavy weapons and ammunition to the front. An additional task for the agent from Donetsk was to identify the positions of the Ukrainian troops who are holding the defense in the Kramatorsk direction. To do this, the woman visited the settlements near the front line and asked local residents for intelligence information during everyday conversations.

EUMAM UA trains service dogs and dog handlers for work in Ukraine	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Mine detection dogs are trained to recognize mines and other explosive objects in the ground. In Ukraine's war zones, where Russian landmines are a constant threat, this capability is invaluable. Ukrainian military personnel from various branches of the military are trained as part of the EUMAM UA mission. In addition, they also train dogs for the Guard Service, Special Operations Forces, Airborne Assault Dogs, and explosive detection dogs. While a mine detection dog has to keep its nose very low to find the smallest particles in the soil layer, a mine detection dog has to detect odors in the air. And the guard dog, in addition to searching for explosives, also performs the task of protecting objects. EUMAM UA training mission of the EU for military assistance to Ukraine is part of the support package for Ukraine in its fight against the aggressor &#8211; Russia In total, 24 European countries are participating in this mission. Its task is to train the Ukrainian military in order to strengthen the country's defense capability and stability.

The right choice of position, accurate coordinates and timely command are what can change the course of the battle. A gun commander is a leader who leads his team to accomplish the mission with maximum efficiency and precision. He is a person who is able to remain calm under pressure and act quickly and decisively, because he knows that every shot is another step towards victory.

They may have a third or fourth prison term. They are promised a pardon if they last even a year. They receive minimal training and are then simply sent with or without guides to our units, he said. The task of such soldiers is simple - to become expendable. - Somewhere they will perform demining, somewhere they will call fire on themselves and this will give the enemy an opportunity to understand where our firing positions are. This is really expendable material, which, unfortunately, the enemy has a lot of, said the soldier. Among the stories of several dozen prisoners, he recalled the story of a -Wagnerian- who managed to fight in Bakhmut, take part in Yevgeny Prigozhin's campaign to Moscow, and then sign a contract with the Russian Ministry of Defense and take part in an attempted Russian offensive in the north of the Kharkiv region. — The most interesting story was probably that of one prisoner who signed a contract with the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation for the second time.

The head of the planning department of the 13th brigade told about this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon operational assignment -Charter- of the National Guard of Ukraine, Lt. Col. Anton Baev. — These are slightly different positions, they are different from what we saw both in the Luhansk direction and in Liman. Of the relief conditions we have now, these are big relief differences, ravines and gullies, he said. This terrain allowed the enemy to prepare a complex system of positions and shelters for an assault. — Classic systems of trenches, as we are used to seeing the book written, we do not have here. These are single burrows, usually very deep, which also have different shapes inside, the military said. Such holes are not simple direct depressions in the ground, but have depressions that protect against a direct shot or throwing a grenade from the outside. The officer described the Russian shelter system as well-thought-out and meticulously arranged. - There were a lot of them. From what we see when we go to the positions that have been retaken, it is one hole per man, which is usually very deep and can reach four meters deep. They are very difficult to pass and clean. There are a lot of such burrows, they stand opposite each other. They are arranged in overlapping sectors to avoid blind spots. The frequency of such burrows can be a burrow every 5-6 meters, the guardsman said. The military officer also said that it was necessary to knock out the enemy from their positions in thick forest thickets, the line of sight within which was often only 2-3 meters. Under such conditions, intense close combat took place.

The suspects are charged with embezzlement of property and obstructing the lawful activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations (Part 5 of Article 191, Part 2 of Article 114-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). The investigation established that during martial law, the accused organized the purchase of low-quality body armor with funds allocated from the state budget. In 2022, contracts for the purchase of personal protective equipment were concluded between the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and non-resident companies in violation of the prescribed procedure. Ammunition was purchased at inflated prices with 100% payment. Exhibitors took personal protective equipment without inspection and handed over low-quality products to military warehouses of the Armed Forces. According to the conclusions of the experts, the ammunition does not meet the state and military standards of Ukraine, the technical requirements for the purchase of different types of body armor and cannot adequately protect Ukrainian servicemen. In total, as a result of the illegal actions of the accused, individual units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were not properly equipped with personal protective equipment in the amount of almost UAH 2 billion.

They are burning the streets and ignoring the evacuation: in Kurshchyna, the Russian military is act...	This was reported on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon by the spokesman of the -Siversk- OTU, Vadym Mysnyk. — The humanitarian situation there is very difficult. In those settlements that suffer from Russian shelling, entire streets are already burning, he said. The defense forces, adhering to the norms of international humanitarian law, are trying to provide local civilians with all the basic necessities - water, food, basic necessities, fuel. — The local population is provided with everything necessary in accordance with all norms of international humanitarian law. But it is in the zone of active hostilities that the population suffers, because the enemy follows the same tactics as in Ukraine. They do not make any difference, and in the same way they prey on everything that is available, prey on their own Russian settlements, on their Russians. These settlements are being demolished from the face of the earth, said the soldier. It is not easy to provide local residents with everything they need, because active hostilities continue in the region. — Logistics routes are also under fire, but the Defense Forces deliver the necessary water, food, and medicine. Our military doctors are providing assistance because there are dead and wounded among the civilian population, the spokesman said. Instead, the Russian side is indifferent to its own citizens and ignores the possibility of organizing the coordinated evacuation of local residents to the territory controlled by the Russian military. — From the first days of conducting operations through various international organizations, we gave a signal, appealed for the organization of the evacuation of the local population from the zone of active hostilities in any direction - either towards Russia or towards Ukraine, so that international organizations could join this process. But, unfortunately, the Kremlin does not react to this at all, as if there is no one there. They do not provide either a green corridor or a ceasefire. They don't care about their population, they probably don't consider the locals to be their people, Vadym Mysnyk explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Russians would They use cabs in Kurshchyna three times more intensively.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/17/vypalyuyut-vulyczi-j-ignoruyut-evakuacziyu-na-kurshhyni-rosijski-vijskovi-diyut-yak-v-ukrayini/	2024-10-17T06:24:10-07:00

Traitor lawyers should be deprived of the right to operate in Ukraine	ArmyInform was informed about this by the Main Department of Military Justice of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Personal sanctions were applied to 19 persons who are entered in the Unified Register of Advocates of Ukraine and have the right to practice advocacy, namely the independent professional activity of a lawyer in the field of defense, representation and provision of other types of legal assistance to the client. We are talking about Ukrainian lawyers who cooperate with the occupation administration and in fact justify Russian aggression against Ukraine. And at the same time, due to the fact that they are in the Unified Register of Lawyers of Ukraine, these lawyers still have the opportunity to represent citizens and legal entities in Ukrainian courts. Now they should be deprived of such an opportunity. -The Main Directorate of Military Justice conducted data collection work on lawyers who violated the oath of a lawyer of Ukraine and contributed to the activities of the occupying state. All information was transferred to the Security Service of Ukraine, which, in its turn, made relevant proposals for consideration by the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine. We thank the President of Ukraine for the introduction of sanctions against traitors in the Ukrainian bar,- noted Deputy Chief of the Main Department of Military Justice, Senior Lieutenant of Justice Ruslan Kvitin. Ruslan Kvitin also expressed his expectation that the National Bar Association of Ukraine will timely fulfill its obligations regarding the cancellation of access to the Unified Register of Lawyers of Ukraine for those lawyers who have been sanctioned, as these sanctions include the cancellation of licenses that give the right to carry out certain types of activities.

The corresponding video was made public by the Airborne Assault Troops of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The commander of the mortar unit with the call sign -Vasylok- says that he first joined the army back in 2016, and that's when he mastered the mortar business. After the end of the first three years of the contract, he decided to return to civilian life. After starting large-scale invasion immediately returned to the ranks of the Armed Forces. Later, -Vasylok- was transferred to the 82nd ODSHBr and immediately went with his comrades to defend our land from the invaders in the Zaporizhzhia direction. -Then we worked quite accurately against the enemy. It is worth understanding that the mortar work is not easy, and you need to have a lot of strength and health to carry mines, mortar and many other things. After the Zaporozhye direction, we were transferred to Vovchanskyi. We also worked well there. Already from there we went to Kurshchyna,- Vasylyok shares. According to him, many people mistakenly believe that the mortars are at a distance of 10-15 kilometers from the battle line, but this is not so. The commander of the mortar unit says that their positions are 2-3 kilometers away, and sometimes on the same level as the infantry, because they constantly have to cover their comrades from the enemy.

The head of the planning department of the 13th brigade told about this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon operational assignment -Charter- of the National Guard of Ukraine, Lt. Col. Anton Baev. — In terms of prisoners, if you can call this whole action one big operation, then for this whole operation, I can no longer give an exact figure for the number of prisoners we took during all this time. There were a lot of them, I think there were more than twenty in total, maybe thirty, he said. The officer described the composition of the captured Russian servicemen. — These are fighters of a very different class. These are just some mobilized, usually without any strong training, just thrown into plugging holes. These were also guys who already had a lot of experience and who were situationally, for example, abandoned to solve some situational issues. We caught those -Wagnerians- who were still in Bahmut. That is, a very diverse contingent that entered, said the military man. Anton Baev said that the operation in the north of the Kharkiv region on the territory of the Lipetsk community was difficult and it is ongoing. — The operation was quite difficult and, in principle, it continues, because we understand that the area that we have now taken under our control has been recaptured, it needs to be established, it needs to be prepared, and further conditions must be created so that it is possible to was to improve the tactical position in the future.

The President explained why Western partners should support the Victory Plan	This said President Volodymyr Zelenskyi at a press conference following his participation in the meeting of the European advice -The victory plan is primarily a document that strengthens Ukraine, gives Ukraine the opportunity to be strong. This is not only a battlefield, it is a geopolitical strengthening, determination of Ukraine. It is not only about weapons, but also about certainty for the people - what will happen to them tomorrow, what will happen to their country, in which country they will live after the war,- said the President. Volodymyr Zelenskyi emphasized that the plan also includes weapons, invites Ukraine to NATO, and economic strengthening. -It is a certainty that there will be investments here, that our resources will be protected. And if they don't give (what Ukraine is asking for. — Ed.), it will be very difficult for us, and it will play into the hands of Russia. The weakness of Ukraine is a strength for Russia. And this will be a big mistake,- he said. The head of state explained that items such as an invitation to NATO, as well as a package of long-range weapons, are rather preventive measures. -This does not mean NATO membership right now. This is a sign that we will be there, that Ukraine is not alone. The same goes for weapons. Before deploying a weapon package, there is always an opportunity to give a signal to stop the war. And if you don't want to, we have the power to stop you,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy -samiti-yes/->presented the Victory Plan at the European Council meeting held on October 17 in Brussels.

Water area, base, meaning: the Navy assessed the prospects of strengthening the Black Sea Fleet of t...	The reasons on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- the spokesman of the Naval Forces told Ukrainian Armed Forces captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. - It should be understood that they are actually in a closed water area. The Russians have no sense to somehow strengthen it, to replenish it with some units. The reason is the impossibility of using these units in the Azov-Black Sea region and the insufficient material and technical base, that is, the infrastructure facilities at the base point were not designed for such a number of ships and they are forced to stay at the Novorossiy base point, he said. Therefore, the Black Sea area is closed, the base in Novorossiya is unable to receive a larger number of ships, and the Russian occupiers are unable to effectively use their Black Sea fleet. This makes attempts to strengthen it meaningless. -Therefore, there is no question of any strengthening, strengthening, -deepening and expansion- as of now and there are no prospects for it and there are no reasons,- the spokesman emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform explained why Russians rarely launch missiles from the Black Sea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/17/akvatoriya-baza-sens-u-vms-oczinyly-perspektyvy-posylennya-chornomorskogo-flotu-rf/	2024-10-17T04:17:15-07:00

The suspicion was reported to the Russian general, who did not take Kyiv in 3 days	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on October 17. At the beginning of the full-scale war, the official commanded the operation to capture Kyiv from the north-western direction. According to the plan of the Russian General Staff, on February 24, 2022, Selivyorstov's airborne units were to take control of the airfield in Gostomel, followed by the occupation of the entire village. Another group of troops from the figure's division received an order to capture Vyshnevoi, another settlement on the outskirts of the capital of Ukraine. If the tasks were successfully completed, the occupiers planned to gain a foothold in the occupied areas, creating a bridgehead for a further offensive on Kyiv. After the approach of the main forces of the occupation groups of the Russian Federation, the Rashists were to storm the capital of Ukraine and hoped to capture it. However, the Defense Forces foiled the enemy's intentions. Initially, Ukrainian soldiers surrounded and destroyed a significant part of Selivyorstov's group during the battles for Gostomel. Then the defenders of Ukraine destroyed the headquarters of the occupiers in the Buchansk district, where the Russian general was located along with the entire command staff of his division. Then Selivyorstov and his deputies were seriously wounded, after which the order was given to -evacuate- the enemy group. On the basis of the received evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed Selivyorstov in absentia about the suspicion under Part 2 of Art. 28, Part 2 of Art. 437 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (waging an aggressive war committed by a group of persons based on a prior conspiracy). Comprehensive measures are underway to find and punish the war criminal of the aggressor country.

Medical vacations in the occupied Luhansk region: there are payments, but there are no takers	This was reported by Artem Lysogor, head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. It is noted that during the program's year of operation, it was possible to attract only 18 doctors - at first 10 people, and recently eight more.

The effectiveness of individual -Calibers-: why the Russians launch missiles less often from the Bla...	The reasons on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- the spokesman of the Naval Forces told Ukrainian Armed Forces captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. — As practice shows, when there are one or two submarines in the sea, especially if only one of them, missile carriers do not perform tasks related to the use of missiles. They are performing the task of protecting the base point, he said. The officer spoke about the reason for the Russians' refusal to launch independent missile launches from the Black Sea. — Even if they decide to carry out launches not as part of a combined attack, but independently, as practice has shown, these launches are not effective. Therefore, the enemy no longer uses them individually. Even if the ships go to sea in the number of, for example, several units of cruise missile carriers, this does not mean that there will necessarily be shelling, the military officer noted. He noted that the reason for the rejection of independent missile launches from the ships of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation was the low efficiency of this type of weapon. — The low effectiveness of these weapon systems as of now has forced the enemy to use them more to distract air defense during massive missile attacks. Therefore, I can say that the situation is stable as of now, he said. At the same time, the spokesman noted that the threat of a Russian missile attack from the Black Sea is always present, because it takes only a few hours for the Russians to go out to sea and launch missiles. - It should always be assumed that danger is present. Because we observe one cruise missile carrier in the sea. In addition, in order to deploy, go out to sea and shoot back, they also need a little time - we are talking about hours, - said Dmytro Pletenchuk.

- Bribes from dodgers-: propagandists -attack- the TCC and SP	However, as found of Vox Ukraine analysts, this is not true. The news came from an unreliable source, and the post showed a photo from another search. The post appeared on an anonymous channel with a small number of subscribers, but when the post was picked up by one of the popular z-channels the next day, it gained more than 130 thousand views and went viral. After a reverse search on Google, it turned out that the fakers showed a photo from a search by the Security Intelligence Service in Zakarpattia Oblast, and not in Lviv. And it took place on September 20, 2024 in one of the military units, not in the TCC and SP. Russian propaganda uses every informational opportunity to deepen enmity in Ukrainian society and disrupt mobilization. If there is no information drive, it is invented. Today, TCC and SP are the main target, because it is the easiest to cause outrage. For example, information was recently denied that men who did not update their data in the TCC will have their certificates and diplomas revoked. And the alleged video evidence of fakers, in which a TCC employee threatened a woman over the phone to take her with a -man-evader-, actually turned out to be staged. As reported by ArmyInform , Russian propaganda stepped up efforts to disrupt the mobilization in Ukraine immediately after the checks carried out by TCC employees last Friday, in particular after the concert of the band -Ocean Elsa- in Kyiv.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/17/habari-vid-uhylyantiv-propagandysty-atakuyut-na-tczk-ta-sp/	2024-10-16T21:22:31-07:00

The apocalypse will not happen: an expert on possible Russian strikes on Ukrainian nuclear power pla...	-Indeed, our nuclear power plants are in constant danger from Russian air attacks. Of course, you can expect anything from crazy people. Are the Russians capable of hitting the nuclear power plant itself? In my opinion, they are capable, but there are several nuances. First of all, you need to find out what the water-water power reactor VVER-1000 is. These are, in fact, the main reactors at our nuclear power plants. There is an incredibly thick casing. They were developed specifically taking into account potential strikes by small-kiloton missiles in a nuclear configuration. In order to break through the casing, and a serious explosion occurred at the nuclear power plant, thousands of tons of explosives must be placed inside. And if you hit from above, on the reactor casing, then, for example, the Kalibr missile with a warhead of 250-400 kg, or the Kh-101, or the Kh-55, or even the Kh-47M2 -Dagger- (the warheads of these missiles vary from 300 up to 500 kg - ed.), unable to penetrate it. rockets can hit distribution devices of nuclear plants and transmission substations, which are critical for the safe operation of Ukraine's nuclear power industry. But again, the VVER-1000 reactor was built with such scenarios in mind. That is, if this happens, it (the reactor - ed.) will be shut down. Moreover, it is built in such a way that there are special containers under it. In the event of an accident, the reactor will melt and be hidden in these containers. And it will happen faster than the explosion and the release of radiation. Everything is thought out. After all, there is the experience of the first nuclear disaster in Great Britain, then the accident at the Three Mile Island NPP in the USA, our Chernobyl and the Japanese Fukushima. It is very important to inform allies and international institutions about the plans of the Russian Federation to damage Ukrainian nuclear energy facilities. the Russians have the ability to deliver a tactical nuclear strike. The same Iskander complex can be equipped with a nuclear warhead of up to 500 kt. And the Kh-102 and Kh-101 cruise missiles in nuclear configuration can have one megaton. If the Kremlin goes to such madness, we must understand, it will already be a nuclear precedent. Then surely the reaction of the Allies will be as it should be. What it will be, I cannot predict. God forbid that this (tactical nuclear strike — ed.) never happens. But for the moment, it is necessary to lower the degree that this could lead to some kind of global catastrophe. It can be very unpleasant and painful, but, in my opinion, there will be no disaster. I emphasize once again. The highlighted problems should be raised, the level of the threat should be outlined, but it should also be weighed against the scale of the apocalypse.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/17/apokalipsysu-ne-stanetsya-ekspert-pro-mozhlyvi-udary-rosiyan-po-ukrayinskym-aes/	2024-10-16T20:57:55-07:00
We need replenishment, we don't have enough strength: rock musician, defender Serhiy Vasylyuk appeal...	— I am a musician, and currently an active military serviceman, performing combat tasks in the Bakhmut direction. The war is far from Kyiv and Lviv, a little closer to Kharkiv and the Dnipro. In order for it to remain so, and ideally for us to still win, certain rotations, certain replacements must take place in our knightly family, because people get exhausted, burn out, get tired, get injured, die. An infantryman, mortar and aerial scout: the story of the leader of the band -Shadow of the Sun- Sergey Vasylyuk They need a replacement so that the war will continue to be far from your native homes. Therefore, take responsibility and help us, those who have been fighting for more than two years. We need replenishment, there are not enough forces. Please note that recruitment is currently possible. Use it. After all, highly intellectual areas of work in the Armed Forces are now in high demand, and you can, with a moderate risk to your life, perform combat tasks no less effectively than a traditional infantryman-warrior in the trenches. Therefore, join the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This is the only way we will surely win. Earlier in an interview ArmyInform Serhiy Vasylyuk shared his own experience of mobilization: — I was motivated by two reasons. First, in the repertoire of -Shadow of the Sun- the main theme is Ukrainian heroics. Starting with the album -Stormy Land- we sang about current events, before that we sang about the heroic past, which we projected into the present. Therefore, it was not even convenient for me not to join the army. And the second reason is that I probably would not have written such music, would not have sung such a song, if I had not had the spirit of a warrior in me, if I had not been fond of military games as a child. Just with a guitar in this age-old time, I would feel inferior. I believe that it is necessary to help my brothers on the front lines. Don't be afraid of mobilization. If I were not serving now, I would again go to the Military Commissariat to sign up as a volunteer. After all, we all have a noble chance to return from the war victorious. We remind you that the list of vacancies in the Defense Forces of Ukraine can be found on the ArmyInform website.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/17/nam-potribne-popovnennya-syl-ne-vystachaye-rok-muzykant-zahysnyk-sergij-vasylyuk-zvernuvsya-do-tyh-hto-shhe-vagayetsya/	2024-10-16T20:44:16-07:00
-In one breath-. How Celentano from the ZSU captured a Tajik under Robotyn	He joined the ranks of the ZSU in July 2023. Has the rank of junior sergeant. And twice with his brothers he captured ethnic Tajiks near Robotyn in Zaporizhzhia. For the second time, he led a small group that captured the second prisoner with a fight. Celentano serves in the 454th separate infantry battalion of the 141st separate infantry brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. After the training center, joined the unit as a machine gunner, now another position. In the spring of 2024, a story happened with a captured Tajik. -They told me to storm: because either ours entered there, or the enemies. It turns out that enemies. Went to the KSP, took a smoke grenade&#8230; You see, this was my first such assault, everything happened quickly and on adrenaline. In one breath, you can say (laughs - ed.). There was another occupant, but he did not survive. The situation was such that we threw a grenade, he suffered a severe shrapnel wound. And then he blew himself up with a grenade,- Celentano recalls a fragment of that day. The story of the capture of a Tajik is not the only one. He says that he often had to go to Robotyne. Such or similar forays happen often. Sometimes, he recalls, they came to work for two weeks. -We control the territory, monitor and stop the advance of the enemy, enemy assaults,- the serviceman succinctly recounts the specifics of his work. I ask what a military man would answer to all civilians who have not yet decided to join the ranks of the Defense Forces. Currently, the serviceman performs combat tasks together with the unit in the Zaporizhzhia region.

-He crossed himself, turned to Fortuna and ran on-: Guardsman Pooh about the fighting in the Pokrovs...	This story told in the National Guard of Ukraine. At the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the guardsman and his brother went on guard duty like a teroboron. On February 28, the first column of enemy vehicles entered Makarivka in the amount of more than 300 units, 111 of which were tanks. Pooh and his brother were not confused and immediately ran, sat quietly and counted the equipment, and later, through the headman, they transmitted data about the number. On March 18, 2022, Pooh was already in the army. After seeing with his own eyes, he couldn't help but come. Currently, he is a member of the 2nd Halych brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, performing tasks in the Pokrovsky direction. He is not only an infantryman, but also a medic in his unit. He must not only repel assaults, but also provide medical assistance to his comrades. Several times during the movement between positions, the enemy worked on it with various weapons. -We were asked by the company commander to go through the position where our guys were poisoned with gases when we were going to be replaced. You understand that your guys are sitting there, and especially since you are a medic, they need help, and you just do it because it's your job. They were covered very much, very much. Arta, mortars, drones, there was horror in that position. The cat, calling his friend, brought a pack of water. We gave the boys a drink of water and told them. While they were waiting for evacuation, drones flew in. Come on, give us nightmares. They asked to look at the sky. And this is where the contact begins. My brother and I run out, begin to cover the boys bit by bit. The boys left, thank God. Little by little, we began to move to another position,- the defender recalls. Pooh says that if the enemy notices a position, he destroys it in two or three days. Then everything goes into action: gases, fpv, artillery, resets. He was pulled out of one of these positions by a comrade from the Armed Forces. -If your guys get caught, there aren't many options. You have to run and help. And just like that, Lyoshka (my brother from the ZSU - author) came back for me. This happens very often. If we take this entire war as a matter of fact, then it probably rests on this. Good luck, brotherhood. There is a task, whatever it is, we try to fulfill it. Especially since there are our brothers, our boys. That is, if not you, then who? Crossed, what is it called. I once again believed in fortune and ran,- adds Pooh. Previously, ArmyInform told the story of the artilleryman -Bena-, who traded Denmark for Caesar.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/16/perehrestyvsya-zvernuvsya-do-fortuny-i-pobig-dali-gvardiyecz-puh-pro-bojovi-diyi-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2024-10-16T11:48:38-07:00

The collaborator, who managed a gymnasium under occupation and tried to Russify the educational proc...	This is reported by the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office. The woman was sentenced to 1 year and 6 months of imprisonment with deprivation of the right to hold positions in state bodies, in local self-government bodies, in state communal institutions, organizations and enterprises related to the field of education for a period of 10 years. Prosecutors proved that in July 2022, the accused, while in the territory of Kupyan Oblast, occupied by the Russian invaders at the time, voluntarily went to cooperate with the enemy. The woman agreed to the occupiers' offer to head the so-called -Velikohutor Gymnasium of the VGA of the Kupyan District-, created on the material and technical base of the Ukrainian educational institution. Newly baked -y. at. director- informed gymnasium teachers and students' parents about the establishment and implementation of Russian education standards. The collaborator collected lists of teachers willing to work under such conditions and recruited technical personnel. The accused carefully prepared for the new academic year - she conducted an inventory of property, received from a representative of the occupation authorities sample documents in accordance with the standards of the Russian Federation, including certificates of secondary education. In order to finally Russify the educational process, the -director- made a description of Ukrainian textbooks and books for their subsequent removal as -Nazi- literature. While preparing the premises of the gymnasium for the new academic year, the collaborator drew up a -list of office supplies for first-graders- and a -list of students- under her personal signature. The accused managed to organize and hold the First Bell holiday, but she failed to finally implement the plans for the Russification of the educational process due to the de-occupation. The collaborator was waiting for the trial while in custody. During the trial, she fully admitted her guilt. The guilty verdict was handed down by the Ordzhonikidze District Court of Kharkiv. There is currently an appeal period. Earlier ArmyInform reported , that a -hunter- was detained in Kharkiv under our anti-aircraft defense.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/16/kolaborantka-yaka-keruvala-gimnaziyeyu-pid-okupacziyeyu-ta-namagalasya-rusyfikuvaty-navchalnyj-proczes-otrymala-vyrok/	2024-10-16T11:03:46-07:00

How a secret unit of the GUR attacked military facilities on the territory of the Russian Federation...	About isin the material of the American TV channel CNN. Only two fighters with the callsigns -Serge- and -Vektor- were allowed to speak under the recording. According to the military, their target is an ammunition depot, namely train cars inside the depot loaded with recently delivered Iranian missiles. -There will be about 12 drones,- Serge tells Vector, holding a map in front of him detailing the target and range of Russia's air defense and electronic warfare systems. They then agree on the time to approach the target and the launch interval of the drones. Outside on the street, Vector climbs into his car. At dusk, the convoy pulls into the warehouse. Men dressed in black with balaclavas over their faces wait to hear their orders. Vector is brief, adding that there will be other units involved in this mission as well. He orders his men to begin preparing routes and relays information for the upcoming mission. -Planning is maybe 60% of success, it's all about planning,- he says. Each drone will be programmed for over 1,000 different waypoints to avoid Russia's complex air defense systems. -It seems that we are playing with them, but this is not a game. This is war,- Vector notes. In the warehouse, the Lyuty drone, manufactured mainly in Ukraine, currently wingless, stands surrounded by boxes painted in green camouflage with several Rubaka kamikaze drones. Vector explains that these smaller drones are critical to the success of any mission. The goal is simple: to overcome air defenses and divert Russian fire from the Furious, which often carries a payload of up to 250 kilograms. Opening one of the drawers, he takes out one of the decoy machines. Strips of metal foil were added to the wings to fool Russian radar. -We're trying to mix them up, and we're trying to send them from different distances, different launch sites&#8230; they try to destroy them. They send helicopters, missiles, turn on electronic warfare,- explains Vector. According to him, their goals are exclusively military. One of the many trucks backed up to load. In other parts of Ukraine, approximately 80 other GUR employees are preparing 90 other drones for flight, not all -Lyuty-. About 30 percent of all drones launched will be decoy missions, according to Serge. Men carefully load warheads into drone bodies. Each compartment then closes with the screech of a drill. Serge and Vector watch the final preparations. -Maybe (Russian people) do not understand what is happening in Ukraine, but when these UAVs arrive, they clearly understand what we have been living with for the past 10 years,- Vektor emphasizes. In total darkness, the drones move into position. A car with pilots moves behind. Once in the air, the fully autonomous drone begins to mark numerous waypoints. Back at the planning base, the hours tick by as Vector, Serge and the others track the drones with the help of trackers. According to the military, the success of the mission is monitored in three ways: with the help of human intelligence on the ground, messages in Russian Telegram groups and, later, analysis with the help of satellite technology. Only after evaluating all three can a mission be considered successful or not. Serge starts reading the messages he sees from Telegram channels all over Russia. The prevalence of this attack is becoming increasingly clear. Various cities in southern Russia — Voronezh, Yeisk, Rostov and Volgograd — are beginning to report drones flying into their airspace. According to intelligence officers, the mission to destroy missiles supplied by Iran was successful.

Survived a mine strike, and now hunts drones: the story of a fighter with the call sign -Kum-	His story told in the State Border Service of Ukraine. The beginning of the summer of 2023 is an important moment for the defenders of the city of Kherson. It was then that the Antoniv bridge became the scene of fierce battles. Vadim's group was given the task of controlling the approaches to the bridge, which became vital for the deterrence of Russian troops. The DPSU noted that thanks to their efforts, Ukrainian forces were able to maintain control over this key facility. -I remember when, after another artillery barrage, we had to constantly control the flanks and not let the invaders in. At one point there was an explosion, a mine fell under my feet, and at the same time the world seemed to slow down. I only remember that I managed to take a step back when the shock wave swept past,- Vadim said. According to the boy, the mine miraculously did not touch him. -The explosion itself took the breath away not only from Vadim, but also from all the brothers who were nearby. -Each of the fighters knew that such moments could prove fatal, but this time everything worked out,- noted the DPSU. New challenges awaited the boy during the hunt for -shaheeds-. The enemy began to use kamikaze drones to attack military and civilian targets. Vadim did not hesitate - he decided that his new task would be hunting -shaheeds-, and began to actively study the technologies of detecting and destroying drones. -It so happened that one moonlit night we were given information about several enemy UAVs moving in our direction. After discovering them, I took the machine gun and began firing in bursts. And then I saw a glow and realized that the target was hit,- recalled the Kum border guard. Vadim emphasized that every day is a new challenge. He understands that in modern warfare, every detail counts. His experience under the Antonovsky Bridge helps him today, because the ability to quickly adapt and make decisions is what saves lives.

DOT stopped working with one of the food suppliers in Donetsk region. What is known?	About DOT reported on October 16. According to the DOT, the period of application of sanctions may be revised if the supplier takes measures confirming his integrity and ability to properly fulfill contractual obligations. The reason was the use of the annulled test protocol for canned stewed pork during the supply to the military in the Donetsk direction. -According to the results of a detailed study of the detected violation, it was established that the supplier shipped products with invalid quality documents several times. This calls into question the quality of the products themselves. As of today, the samples of this batch have been sent for repeated laboratory testing,- the DOT said in a statement. The incident occurred in military units in the Donetsk direction. From October 28, servicemen will be supplied by suppliers from neighboring regions. If necessary, another supplier will be involved through the framework agreement mechanism . -Integrity is one of the main requirements for suppliers of the Armed Forces. If we receive information about possible dishonesty of the supplier, we react immediately. This is what happened with the supply of stew with canceled quality documents. We conducted an analysis, as a result of which we found that Trade Granit Invest improperly used the test protocol for a larger volume of products than was approved by it. Such actions cannot remain without consequences, so we applied sanctions to the company. Also, we are now increasing fines for all suppliers for similar violations from 20% to 100% of the product value. I hope this will be a lesson for them and a safeguard against committing such unscrupulous actions,- said Dmytro Bigunets, Director of Risk Management and Compliance of the DOT. Currently, the process of controlling the compliance of batch volumes with those declared during selections for qualitative research and specified in the test protocols is not automated. Relevant documents are provided to military units when the goods are shipped. In order to strengthen control over the circulation of products, the quality of which requires additional attention, the State Operator of the Rear, at the request of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, plans to digitalize the process of compliance of the volumes actually shipped with those declared in the test protocols. Namely — to implement a system solution in the IT system of the management of the provision of the Armed Forces — DOT Chain. It is planned that without indicating the number of the test report or when the declared volume has already been exhausted according to it, the supplier will not be able to form a package of documents and ship the goods. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is investigating possible falsification of documents of the supplier of products for the Armed Forces. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/16/dot-prypynyv-robotu-z-odnym-z-postachalnykiv-harchiv-na-donechchyni-shho-vidomo/	2024-10-16T06:24:54-07:00

Nazarii Polovoy's graduation from the internship coincided with the beginning of the large-scale invasion of Russia. He joined the ranks of the border guards and immediately got to Donetsk region, where he provided medical aid to the wounded. Working in extraordinary conditions, when there were not enough medical personnel and tools, Nazarii was repeatedly the only traumatologist in medical centers. He treated fractures, bruises, dislocations, and also assisted in complex operations. During one of the busy working days, Nazarii became a donor for a wounded man, when there were not enough blood supplies. After the direct transfusion, he continued to work without having time to rest. Despite the award, Nazarii remains modest and does not consider himself a hero: -I did what I had to do. Each of the doctors is a hero in these conditions.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/16/stav-geroyem-bez-zbroyi-likar-viddav-svoyu-krov-shhob-vryatuvaty-poranenogo-voyina/	2024-10-16T05:40:23-07:00

-Combat- payments to the military: what they charge for and why they may not pay	Depending on the place of service and tasks performed, the Ukrainian military can additionally receive 30, 50, and 100 thousand hryvnias. In addition, there is an additional payment of 70 thousand hryvnias for those who are on the front line. But there are also reasons when the additional reward may not be charged. ArmyInform reminds whom and how much they should pay extra. An additional reward for the military has been introduced for the period of martial law. So that people who risk their lives every day can support themselves and their families. It is defined by the Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 168 and Order of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine No. 260. 100,000 is given to servicemen who are directly participating in hostilities at forward positions, in occupied territory, or between the positions of the Defense Forces and the enemy. This reward is also given to those who carry out fire damage tasks - these are rocket launchers, gunners and anti-aircraft units. Of course, they are not directly on the conflict line. But their time working against the enemy is also counted towards the payment of the 100 thousand reward. In addition, this amount is paid to those who is being treated after being wounded, and to military personnel, who were captured. 50 thousand are paid to those who perform combat (special) tasks as part of military administration bodies, headquarters and command, which carry out operational management of units. Including outside the areas of hostilities. 30 thousand are received by servicemen who perform combat (special) tasks in accordance with combat orders. In particular: Also, 30,000 gratuities should be paid to those who are engaged in demining (outside the areas of hostilities) and anti-aircraft cover and ground defense of critical infrastructure facilities. However, it should be understood that such a reward is paid proportionately to the time spent on the front line, or the performance of combat missions. On average, a little more than 3 thousand hryvnias per day. For example, if you spent 10 days on the front line, the payment will be a little more than 30 thousand hryvnias. This is an additional payment introduced from April 2024. It is intended specifically for those who directly perform combat or special tasks on the front line with the enemy or in his rear. This payment does not replace -combatants-, but is in addition to them. But it works on a storage system. That is, this money should be paid out only after a total of 30 days on the front line have passed. It can be for several months. It is important to ensure that these days are not lost in case of transfer or secondment to another unit. Read more about it here a>. Also, additional remuneration is received by instructors in the Defense Forces. How much they should be paid, read here. In practice, there are cases when -combat- servicemen are not paid. The reasons may be different. And you can defend your right to such a payment in court. But there are reasons when the additional remuneration may not be calculated on legal grounds: In all other cases, if you are entitled to the payment of additional remuneration, but do not receive it, you should resolve these issues with the command, or contact the hotline of the Ministry of Defense . We remind you that an additional reward is a payment that is in addition to a monetary security. How is the financial support calculated and whether it is possible to find out for yourself what amounts you should receive, hread in our other material.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/16/bojovi-vyplaty-vijskovym-za-shho-narahovuyut-ta-chomu-mozhut-ne-zaplatyty/	2024-10-15T21:00:09-07:00
They will see everything from the sky: Britain is mastering modified early warning aircraft	How claims the official portal of the famous American aircraft manufacturer, the currently unpainted aircraft is one of three of 737 NG aircraft on British soil, which are being modified by a highly skilled team of more than 100 people at STS Aviation Services, ArmyInform reports. 7: -This functional test flight, carried out safely and methodically, marks significant progress for Boeing and the Royal Air Force, demonstrating the rigor of our testing and the meticulousness of its evaluation.- In turn, team leader Richard Osselton, Wedgetail Program Director of the Royal British Air Force, emphasized the importance of this milestone: -This is a critical moment that reflects the extraordinary commitment of our program team. Together with our partners, DE&amp;S, Boeing and STS Aviation, we will continue this momentum and look forward to the next stages of testing and evaluation.- 7 are to completely replace the famous airplanes with -pancake- fuselages known as AWACS. How note analysts from the Army Recognition defense portal, the E-7 Wedgetail is designed for advanced detection and surveillance missions, capable of simultaneously tracking multiple air and sea threats thanks to its MESA radar, which provides 360-degree coverage. This aircraft is essential for situational awareness, which greatly improves command and control capabilities for decision-making. According to Maria Lane, president of Boeing UK, Ireland, and Nordics, the creation of the E-7 modification line in the Great Britain is a source of pride: -We are committed to providing this vital capability to support UK national security and promote regional stability.- The future Air Force E-7 squadron will be based at Lossiemouth Air Force Base in Scotland, where for now that the necessary infrastructure is being built. In addition, the Royal Air Force is part of a trilateral agreement with the Australian and US air forces aimed at increasing interoperability and joint development of capabilities. The E-7 program is also gaining importance on the international stage. In addition to the Royal British Air Force, the Royal Australian Air Force, the Republic of Korea Air Force and the Turkish Air Force already use this advanced system. In 2023, NATO also selected the Wedgetail for its Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) mission, further cementing the aircraft's role as a key element of collective defense. Following a series of flight tests scheduled for this fall , the aircraft will be sent to receive the official livery of the British Royal Air Force, which will be another step towards its full integration into the British armed forces. The MESA E-7 Wedgetail radar, developed by Northrop Grumman, is a significant improvement over the E-3 Sentry rotary radar. The MESA radar uses electronic scanning technology that allows it to track targets simultaneously 360 degrees with no moving parts, increasing reliability and reducing maintenance. It also offers superior detection range and enhanced ability to track high-speed targets, providing more complete and accurate situational awareness. How announced analysts of the IKK Defense Express portal, a radar with a phased array antenna and electronic scanning MESA - Multi-Role Electronically Scanned Array, has the dimensions are 10.8 by 3.4 meters, and the antenna arrays measuring 7.2 by 2.7 meters are also in the support. This allows you to get a simultaneous 360-degree view. Unlike old radar systems, operators can redirect power from -unused- sensors (for example, oriented to friendly lines) to strengthen the power supply of other similar devices. This increases their range and identification capabilities. The E-7 is equipped with upgraded communications systems that improve interoperability with other military forces, including ground, naval and air units. These systems provide secure, interference-resistant data transmission channels, enabling reliable transmission of critical information even in conflict environments. In contrast, the E-3 Sentry's older communications systems are less resilient to modern cyber threats. The E-7 is based on the Boeing 737-700 platform, offering better fuel efficiency and longer range than the E-3 Sentry, based on the Boeing 707 platform. This allows the E-7 to cover larger areas without frequent refueling, increasing mission endurance and operational flexibility. With ten mission consoles, the E-7 allows the crew to process and analyze data in real time , optimizing the management of the combat space. These consoles are connected by a high-speed internal network, which facilitates the processing of complex information and the coordination of operations. In contrast, the E-3 Sentry has older, less integrated mission systems with fewer real-time processing capabilities. The E-7 benefits from integrated logistics support and an expanded maintenance infrastructure, including software and hardware upgrades provision with the help of ground support systems. This optimizes the operational readiness of the aircraft. The older E-3 Sentry requires more maintenance and its systems are not as easy to upgrade. E-7 Wedgetail early warning aircraft in detail.

ArmiyaInform correspondents spoke with recruiters and instructors of the 46th Brigade of the DSHV about how recruitment in the DSHV takes place, what volunteers are offered and how people learn about the units. Recruiters emphasize that everyone can independently choose a profession in the army. - It is important that the choice is voluntary and takes into account the person's skills, abilities and civilian experience. We select the appropriate role in the Armed Forces, which also meets the needs of a specific military unit, so that a person can be useful, says Lieutenant Oleksandra Gerasimenko, head of the brigade's freelance recruiting group. Brigade instructors emphasize that everyone has their own strengths. — Someone shoots skillfully, and someone is not good at it. Maybe your forte is piloting. Young people who grew up playing computer games easily master UAV control, says the recruiter. Despite the fear of many that the army is associated exclusively with combat operations, the ZSU is a large structure that requires specialists of various professions. — For example, repairmen perform their tasks far from the front line. And there are civilian specialties that are not at all related to military service, such as florist. However, even they want to be useful, and that is why the intensive was created, so that a person could try himself in different roles in the army, Oleksandra Gerasimenko continues. Recently, the 46th FSV Brigade organized a two-day intensive for civilians. It is also part of the unit's recruiting campaign. The participants received all the necessary equipment. Among them were volunteers, wives of the dead and missing, as well as ordinary civilians who understand that war affects everyone. More you can read about this intensive in the ArmiyaInform report. One of the participants of the intensive, private entrepreneur Sashko, learned about the event from a billboard in Zhytomyr. — I was interested to see the army from the inside, to understand what discipline is. I came and found something useful for myself. I am thinking of mobilizing for a certain specialty, he shares his impressions and plans for the future. Another participant, Olena, saw the announcement in the Telegram channel and registered through the form. -It was important for me to feel at least a little what our military is going through, and now I'm considering joining the 46th Brigade,- she says. Recruiters add that there is a lot of information about the possibility of recruiting. — Information is available on the Work.ua, Robota.ua and LobbyX sites, as well as through outdoor advertising. People pay attention, call and join. Recommendations from brothers who understand that sooner or later the war will affect everyone and are looking for their own way also work, - adds Oleksandra Gerasimenko.

This is an approximate figure based on information from open sources and average prices for weapons and military equipment (AMT) on the world market. Thus, enemy self-propelled guns, howitzers and guns destroyed or disabled beyond recovery are perhaps the most expensive scrap in the world. Russia's spending on war, the seizure of foreign land, and the killing of Ukrainians could be directed to solving internal social issues. For $8 billion, for example, an aggressor could build 13 modern sports arenas or 18 healthcare facilities equipped with the best medical and diagnostic equipment. As reported by ArmyInform, the Cabinet of Ministers allowed the disposal of ammunition right on the ground demining.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/15/zbytky-rf-na-8-mlrd-ukrayinska-armiya-likviduvala-144-artbrygady-okupantiv/	2024-10-15T05:38:08-07:00

Will the occupiers be able to seize the entire Donetsk region in the winter: an expert's opinion	ArmyInform asked military expert Petro Chernyk about this: -Why are the Russians pressing so incredibly hard within their 2024 offensive campaign. The occupiers suffered a strategic defeat in terms of the liquidation of Ukrainian statehood. But from the point of view of geopolitics and, most importantly, saving the face of their Fuhrer, they need to complete the task at a minimum. This is access to the administrative borders of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. For Putin, this is fundamental. His order to enter the administrative borders of Donetsk was issued on October 7 last year. But since then, the Defense Forces have foiled the dictator's plans at least 4 times. This is actually very good news for us. Will the opponent press? As much as possible. Will he succeed in this cycle of dry weather to realize this idea? In my opinion, it won't work. At the moment, the Donetsk region is occupied by Russians for about 52-53%. Another 47-46% of the territory remains under the control of Ukraine. And in order to talk about such a phenomenon as the collapse of the front, they need to successfully conduct at least one military operation at the level of an army corps or division. But break through our battle formations somewhere 15-20 km deep within a day. This is what operational regulations show. There is no such thing. This is a very important detail. Of course, the fall of Ugledar is painful, but not catastrophic. We remember one of the laws of war, which says that battles can be lost, but the war must be won. One of the favorite historical examples, in the First World War, Romania lost absolutely all battles to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. But in the end she won the war. Plus, despite the fact that the Rashists took Vugledar, I have the impression that it will be the same as with Bakhmut. That is, they took Bakhmut, but they cannot advance further. Literally in a month or a half, the rains will come, the ground will be wet. And the Russians will not have the opportunity to carry out full-fledged offensive actions. Why? The equipment will not be able to move. This has already happened during the two previous winters. Let me remind you, heavy equipment: tanks are from 36 to 46 tons, depending on the equipment. Armored equipment: infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers are 12-13 tons, and armored vehicles - 5-8. Even a Russian infantryman, having seen it with his own eyes, cannot move through the field when the soil is very wet. The emphasis of the war will shift to a counter-battery artillery duel. In terms of counter-battery duels since last year, the Defense Forces have been significantly ahead of the Russian army. In just 90 days of summer, our gunners destroyed (damaged) more than 4,500 units of enemy artillery. This is a very serious indicator. If you divide this indicator by 72 (for example, the regular artillery brigade of the enemy is 72 artillery pieces. — Ed.), then more than 60 enemy artillery brigades have been destroyed (damaged). The average daily loss of Russians in manpower is more than 1,200 people. So far, the Rashists do not dare to raise the level of monthly mobilization higher than 40 thousand. They keep the bar at 36-38 thousand and do not go further. That is, we have, in truth, a simple and clear task. Wait for a month and a half. I think we can do it. And there will be winter weather. Next, in my opinion, there will be a so-called balance of fire. I believe that the Americans will eventually allow the Armed Forces to use longer-range weapons for strikes deep in the Russian Federation. Long-range weapons and the ability to use them are important for Ukraine, since the enemy uses its facilities in the rear to attack Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure. warehouses, logistics centers and command posts. Currently, the Defense Forces of Ukraine only use drones to attack enemy targets on the territory of Russia itself.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/15/chy-zmozhut-okupanty-zahopyty-vzymku-usyu-donechchynu-dumka-eksperta/	2024-10-14T21:02:50-07:00
Instead of a heart – an intelligent algorithm: Polish engineers have created a barrage UAV that can ...	As note the authors of the defense portal Army Recognition, barrage ammunition KRUK (raven in Ukrainian) is designed to increase the effectiveness and accuracy of strikes on the field combat, offering modern armies a cost-effective solution for asymmetric warfare and tactical operations, ArmiyaInform reports. The combat drone can operate at a height of up to 5 km. The KRUK payload includes a 500 gram warhead capable of carrying 180mm armor-piercing munitions or anti-personnel explosive devices. It has a cruising speed of 120 km/h and accelerates to 160 km/h when diving to a target, operating at an altitude of 250 meters above ground level for a maximum of 10 minutes after takeoff. The range of the UAV depends on the mode of operation: with a range of up to 10 km during direct line-of-sight control and up to 20 km in surveillance mode. The total weight of the system is only 1.5 kg, which ensures its lightness and portability. The launcher, made of lightweight materials, increases the total weight to 3.5 kg, which remains extremely low for unmanned systems of this type. One of the key features of the system is its ease of operation – it can be fully controlled by a single operator. The launcher is reusable and can be prepared for use in less than two minutes, which significantly reduces the logistical and time costs of deployment. KRUK is equipped with advanced target tracking and management systems, using intelligent algorithms to analyze the situation in real time. Electro-optical cameras enable accurate tracking of moving targets while minimizing collateral damage, which is especially important in modern combat operations. In addition, the drone easily integrates with various land, sea and air platforms, providing scalability and flexibility of use. The new drone has secure communications protocols to prevent data interception and can be operated remotely or autonomously for beyond-line-of-sight operations. And the modular design of the system enables its further modernization and adaptation to the changing needs of the army. Depending on the mission, the munition can hover in the air for observation or hit targets at high speed. KRUK is designed to meet the need for economical, precisely controlled and mobile weapons that can be quickly deployed on the battlefield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/15/zamist-serczya-intelektualnyj-algorytm-polski-inzhenery-stvoryly-barazhuyuchyj-bpla-shho-mozhe-atakuvaty-z-5-km/	2024-10-14T20:53:43-07:00

As it turned out, the detainee was a participant of the Odesa anti-Maidan, she was seen in a pro-Russian tent camp on Kulykovo Field, later she came under the attention of the law enforcement officers for theft, petty hooliganism and drinking alcoholic beverages in a public place. The other day, Russian propagandists began dispelling a fake about her death in the Odesa pre-trial detention center. Margarita Simonyan even compared the -deceased martyr- with Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, a saboteur of the Komsomol during World War II. In fact, the pro-Russian activist is alive and under house arrest. This was reported in the National Police of Odesa region. And the fake was specifically launched to counterbalance the story of the death in Russian captivity of Ukrainian journalist Victoria Roschyna. She was detained in August 2023 in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. On October 10, Victoria's father received a letter from the Russian mini-murder saying that she had died on September 19. The causes and circumstances of death are still unknown.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/15/yakyj-fejk-vygadala-rf-na-protyvagu-istoriyi-iz-zagybellyu-u-rosijskomu-poloni-ukrayinskoyi-zhurnalistky-viktoriyi-roshhynoyi/	2024-10-14T20:42:34-07:00
F-16 shot down a Russian -dryer- -Chlopavka-: how the Kremlin -stumbled- in the Turkish direction	The AIM-120 AMRAAM belongs to the main armament of a number of F-series fighters, including the famous F-16 Fighting Falcon. Intended for hitting aerial targets beyond direct line of sight, depending on the modification, it is capable of hitting at a distance of half a hundred to over fifteen hundred kilometers. It was with the AIM-120 missile that the Turkish Air Force F-16 fighter jet shot down a Russian Su-24M bomber that violated Turkish airspace on November 24, 2015. Then the Russian pilots, returning from a combat sortie to the Khmeim air base, decided to -shorten the path- over the territory of the Turkish province of Hatay, which is -wedged- into the territory of Syria. The Russians deliberately violated the sovereign airspace of the Republic of Turkey, because they were warned 10 times about approaching the border and the need to change course. In view of this, the actions of the Turkish pilot, who had orders to shoot down any aircraft that flew into Turkey without authorization, were fully justified. The time during which the Russian intruder was in Turkish airspace over Hatay province was extremely small - about 17 seconds. Obviously, the Russian pilots counted on the fact that they would not have time to react to their actions. However, this time was enough for one of a pair of patrolling Turkish F-16s to capture the trespasser in its crosshairs and hit it with an AIM-120 AMRAAM medium-range radar-guided missile. The enemy target was destroyed at a relatively small distance, which was about 14-19 km. In the video published by Anadolu Agency and the Turkish television company Haberturk TV, it can be seen how the Russian -Sushka- catches fire in the air during the fall and crashes into the ground. After hitting the ground, a dull explosion is heard, after which an oblong mushroom of thick smoke rises over the hills. The Su-24M fell on the territory of Syria in the area known to the Turks as -Turkmen Mountain-. This enabled the Russians to falsely claim that the Turkish Air Force shot down a Russian bomber over Syrian territory. In fact, the missile was fired at the violator while it was over the Turkish province of Hatay, entering Turkish airspace to a depth of 4 km. Two Su-24M pilots managed to eject, but only one of them was lucky enough to survive — the second was shot from machine guns by Syrian rebels at the moment when he was descending by parachute. During the organized rescue operation, Russian forces also lost at least one marine and an Mi-8 helicopter. In any case, we can thank both the Turkish Air Force and the Syrian anti-government forces, which contributed to the weakening of the armed forces of the Russian Federation by one military aircraft, one military helicopter and at least two military personnel - a professional pilot and a contract marine. It was after this incident that Russian dictator Vladimir Putin uttered the phrase -stab in the back-, which spawned the -stab in the dog- joke and became the basis for numerous memes. The higher military and political leadership tried to frighten Turkey by aggravating relations, but it was not possible to go beyond loud but empty statements like -tomatoes will not be sold-. As it turned out, it is much more difficult to scare the Turkish autocrat Recep Tayyip Erdogan than the leaders of more democratic countries - Vladimir Putin ran into a tough and ready-to-escalate opponent in his person, and he was forced to -give back.- Turkey turned out to be almost the only NATO country ready to immediately shoot down Russian aircraft as soon as they violate its airspace. This is how Russia, according to the apt expression of network scumbags, -washed itself with tomatoes- and -rubbed- in the direction of Turkey. The downing of the Russian Su-24M military aircraft showed that Putin only understands the language of force, and all talk of the danger of escalation and unwillingness to resolutely strike in response is understood only as weakness and becomes even more arrogant. Unfortunately, NATO countries have not learned this historical lesson well enough. However, we also have certain reasons for optimism - Ukraine can receive the latest modifications of the AIM-120 AMRAAM 120 missile from the USA. This will allow shooting down Russian Su-34s — carriers of KABs, with which Russian aggressors terrorize peaceful Ukrainian cities and villages.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/15/f-16-zbyv-rosijsku-sushku-hlopavkoyu-yak-kreml-utersya-na-tureczkomu-napryamku/	2024-10-14T20:30:18-07:00

Despite the fact that they could transfer some units across internal waters, they will not do this, because they cannot help even the units they have left in the Black Sea, in the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, which is practically paralyzed in the Azov Sea. Black Sea region, he said. The Russians cannot send ships to the Black Sea from the Mediterranean Sea, and they do not want to from the Caspian Sea, because they will not be able to use them effectively anyway. — As for other water areas, such as, for example, the Mediterranean, they cannot get here from there. As for the Caspian Sea, with which the Russians have a channel, but you can see that they do not actually use it for this connection, the spokesman noted. The officer noted that the power of the Russian fleet should be assessed on the basis of its real actions, and that the Russians are very sad. — Of course, they can hold various events and they consider themselves a powerful maritime state. But, in any case, technologically they lag behind NATO countries. We saw their level of combat readiness in our Black Sea. Accordingly, the level of tactics and strategy too. Therefore, you can play with your muscles, of course, but real combat actions, as you can see, put everything in its place and the picture turns out to be a little different, Dmytro Pletenchuk emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the water area of ​​the Dnieper-Buzka estuary is extremely polluted with explosives and what the Russians are doing there.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/nespromozhni-daty-radu-v-azovsko-chornomorskomu-regioni-flot-rosiyan-paralizovanyj/	2024-10-14T11:37:39-07:00

There are not whole houses left in Toretsk. Nowadays, the city is more like a deserted planet. There are no shelters for both civilians and military personnel there. Unfortunately, this allows the enemy to occupy new areas, but already scorched earth, she said. To capture the ruins of the city, the Russian military does not count on any losses. — the Russians suffer huge losses in Turkey. However, the leadership of the Russian army promises them mountains of gold. They increase payouts by -200s- there.

Werewolf saboteurs: Russians resort to subterfuge in urban development	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — Such disguises allow them to infiltrate behind our positions in the guise of sabotage and reconnaissance groups. In addition, every Ukrainian soldier, our defender, needs to think twice about who is in front of him: a civilian or an enemy in disguise, who is simply preparing to attack him with a weapon, but hides it under civilian clothes, she said. Voiskova reported that such insidious tactics are characteristic of the enemy's actions, primarily in urban development. In addition to Toretsk, Russians resort to it in other cities as well. — It is characteristic of cities. Such Russian tactics are present, including in the Chasovoy Yar region. This is not a unique phenomenon. It is especially effective in urban development, the military woman explained.

The Ministry of Digital Economy saved ₴4.5 billion thanks to transparent procurement of drones	This was announced on October 14 by the Deputy Prime Minister for Innovation, Development of Education, Science and of Technologies, Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov. According to him, from the first contracts for drones within the Drone Army, they built a strict procurement control system. In order to sum up the results of joint work for the year and to formulate plans for the next one, drone manufacturers who have contracts with the State Special Communications, representatives of the BEB and NABU were gathered. Manufacturers voiced their concerns, discussed issues related to drone contracting, and formed a unified vision for the track. -In 2023, we opened the drone market - killed all the bureaucracy, created the best conditions for the development and scaling of companies, increased the margin from 1% to 25%. This is the highest indicator in the world,- noted Mykhailo Fedorov. Also, the state began to purchase drones through the closed functionality of Prozorro, in order to conclude contracts at the most favorable prices. -The market is developing, the number of manufacturers and contracts is growing, already 150 companies are selling drones to the state. The procurement process is as transparent as possible. NABU and BEB have access to the CRM system with all information about contracts and drones. Every UAV undergoes a mandatory price review,- he assured. The supply chain works separately - a team of experts, NABU and journalists who monitor the prices of drones. If an overestimated cost is found, the price is immediately adjusted at the stage of concluding contracts. -It is important for us that drone manufacturers do not overestimate the margin of 25%, because all cases will be recorded by NABU and BEB detectives. We have already passed 30+ resolutions to liberalize the market, and we are not stopping there,- said Mykhailo Fedorov. In his opinion, if Ukraine wants to win the war thanks to technologies, it is necessary to support the manufacturers of these technologies. -And we're doing everything we can to do that. At the same time, we demand an honest position from manufacturers as well. Only transparent cooperation between the state and manufacturers will make it possible to gain a technological advantage at the front,- he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, the government launched creation of certified private schools to train drone operators.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/minczyfra-zekonomyla-%e2%82%b445-mlrd-zavdyaky-prozorym-zakupivlyam-droniv/	2024-10-14T09:58:26-07:00

The water area of ​​the Dnieper-Buzka estuary is extremely polluted with explosives: what are the Ru...	About this spoke the spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. — The water area of ​​the Dnieper-Buzka estuary remains a combat zone, it is under both enemy and our fire control. The degree of mining of this water area should also be sufficiently high. At the moment, it is difficult to say, because it is practically impossible to investigate this question on a practical level. But, taking into account the fact that virtually everything that was washed away by the high water after the destruction of the Kakhovskaya HPP by the Russians got into this water area, there must be a lot of mine-explosive devices there, the spokesman said. In view of this, control over the water area of ​​the Dnieper-Buzka estuary is problematic. Also, its restoration is prevented by the Russian occupiers who are on the Kinburn spit. The officer commented on the information about the Russians' attempts to transfer boats to the Dnipro-Buzka estuary. — There is nothing unexpected in this. It should be understood that such units can be pulled by land on carriages. These are not such large units that require a mandatory passage by sea, the military explained. At the same time, the Defense Forces are actively countering the enemy, thwarting his intentions and disrupting his plans. — They are also repulsed, they are in the damage zone, don't forget that. That is why hostilities continue there, Dmytro Pletenchuk emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported thatin the Forces defense explained the reasons for the activation of the Russian occupiers on the Kinburn spit.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/akvatoriya-dniprovsko-buzkogo-lymanu-nadzvychajno-zabrudnena-vybuhovymy-predmetamy-shho-tam-roblyat-rosiyany/	2024-10-14T08:37:01-07:00

Why are they doing this and what measures are they resorting to on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- spoken the spokesperson of the Military -Marine Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. — They are making maximum efforts for this and this object continues to be a priority object to which they direct all their resources. We can even observe that such objects as, for example, an oil depot, turned out to be not as protected as the same so-called -Crimean bridge-, he said. The spokesman explained why the Kerch Bridge is such a valuable pastime for the Russian occupiers. — It is quite simple to understand, it is actually the only such still quite serious artery that connects the temporarily occupied Crimea with the so-called Russian Federation. And, of course, the propagandistic weight of this object is also not diminishing in any way, - emphasized the military man. The officer told how exactly the Russian invaders are trying to protect the Kerch bridge. — That is why the enemy is making every effort to preserve it, even without having the ability to do it from the sea, as it once was. Now they mostly use aviation, boom barriers, barge barriers for this purpose, that is, they use all possible available means, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform explained, why are Russian ships constantly -running back and forth- between the base in Novorossiya and the open sea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/najczinnisha-zabavka-okupantiv-u-vms-zsu-rozpovily-yakyj-obyekt-najpylnishe-zahyshhayut-rosiyany/	2024-10-14T08:01:25-07:00

For the fifth day, the Russians have been trying to break through our defenses in Kurshchyna,- he said. According to him, the Ukrainian guys are holding on and counterattacking. -There was an in-depth analysis by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the SSR about who exactly is helping Russia to wage its war of aggression against Ukraine - militarily, economically, politically, openly and covertly - and what steps we, our partners, need to take to weaken these criminal alliances,- - the President noted. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also listened to the report of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine regarding contracting for the current and next periods, in particular with the use of partner assistance, regarding the investments of our key partners in the Ukrainian defense industry.

Weather will affect FPV drones, but the enemy is attacking with infantry: what will be the solution	told about the impact of the change of natural season and weather conditions on the course of hostilities on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon spokeswoman of OTU -Luhansk- Major Anastasia Bobovnikova. - First of all, the daylight hours are decreasing. So the Russians are trying to actively use the daylight hours, launching the maximum number of FPVs, trying to storm our positions as much as possible, because it's much more difficult at night, she said. The spokeswoman explained that changing weather conditions will also significantly complicate the use of FPV drones. -In addition, the rains, wind, and fog are beginning - this also complicates the operation of FPV both from the enemy's side and from ours, unfortunately,- the military woman explained. Instead, the enemy will continue to attack in small infantry groups with minimal use of equipment. — The tactic of using small groups has proven to be effective. They have a lot of manpower, no one counts it. The command of the Russian army does not care at all. Therefore, they can throw them just endlessly, said the officer. It is because of this that the occupiers practically do not use equipment in the area of ​​responsibility of OTU -Luhansk-. — Their lives do not cost anything, the equipment costs a little more. Therefore, we are not observing the technique now, she explained. At the same time, in the opinion of the spokeswoman, it is worth waiting for the exhaustion of the enemy. — We inflict significant losses on them. Over the past day, they lost 200 killed and wounded. But that's still not enough, they still climb, she said. In view of this, the main bet should be placed on the equipment of the fortifications. - We just recently spoke with the head of the Toretsk city military administration. He shared information about how fortifications near Toretsk were prepared. Everything happened in interaction with the military. They prepared them well, because both the city military administration and the military understood how important it is both in deterring the enemy and in saving the life of each serviceman, said the spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, where in the East the heaviest battles continue.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/pogoda-vplyne-na-fpv-drony-ale-vorog-shturmuye-pihotoyu-yakym-bude-rishennya/	2024-10-14T07:16:20-07:00

According to the instructions of the Russian special service, the agent collected information about the base points, traffic routes and available weapons of the Defense Forces, which are involved in the protection of the region. -The occupiers were most interested in the locations of the fortified areas and the estimated number of personnel of the Ukrainian troops on the defensive lines,- the report says. Counter-intelligence officers of the SBU timely detained the traitor in June of this year and established the identity of his Russian supervisor. -He turned out to be FSB staff member Oleksiy Dobrytskyi, who is stationed in temporarily occupied Luhansk. The court sentenced the -mole- to 15 years in prison with confiscation of property and deprivation of military rank,- the SBU said. As the investigation established, the border guard came to the attention of the FSB when he was serving in eastern Ukraine. Subsequently, he was sent to the Volyn region, where he began to carry out enemy missions. In exchange for cooperation with the occupiers, the attacker was counting on -evacuation- to Russia and a -position- in the military formations of the Russian Federation. Based on the evidence collected by the investigators of the Security Service, the agent was found guilty under Part 2 of Article 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law).

The horror of the occupation: 6 Russians who tortured, stuck a knife in the leg and mocked civilians...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informed about this on October 14. The accused are servicemen of the 3rd rifle platoon of the 4th rifle company of the 1st rifle battalion of the 202nd motorized rifle regiment of the LPR and the chief of staff of the 126th battalion of the National Guard of the Federal Service of the National Guard of the Russian Federation. Since March 2, 2022, the Russian military, including the six defendants, occupied the village of Savyntsi and the village of Dovgalivka in the Izyum district. According to the investigation, during the occupation of these settlements, the perpetrators kept pro-Ukrainian citizens in torture chambers and abused them. In order to obtain from the detainees information about the Ukrainian military and local residents who help the Armed Forces, the occupiers used physical, psychological violence and torture. -Victims' hands were tied behind their backs, their vital organs were hit, automatic weapons were fired next to them, some were taken to the forest and an execution was simulated. -People were kept in inhumane conditions, without access to food, water and in unsanitary conditions,- the statement said. It is noted that one of the illegally detained men was stabbed by the Russian military several times in the leg and drilled into the wound in order to cause as much pain as possible. One of the victims is a deputy of the village council of the Savinsk OTG. His interrogation was personally conducted by the chief of staff of the battalion of the 126th regiment of the National Guard of the Federal Service of the National Guard of the Russian Federation. He threatened the deputy with physical mutilation, namely cutting off the genitals. -At that time, another accused was beating the victim. After the abuse, the occupiers left the torture chamber. Later, the deputy heard how the door opened and the occupiers threw a smoke bomb inside the premises, which caused him to suffocate,- the law enforcement officers said. The extras pulled the man out into the yard, put a rope around his neck and began to squeeze him, gradually limiting the access of air. At the same time, the occupiers asked the victim questions about local partisans. The man fainted from lack of air, they brought him back to consciousness and began to kick his body while he was lying on the ground. This execution was carried out several times. -One of the victims, a man who was 59 years old at the time, received serious injuries incompatible with life as a result of torture by the occupiers.

They don't shout to me - go, fight! - a military TCC about how he continues to serve with a prosthes...	About the fighter on October 14 Poltavsky TCC and SP. By civilian profession, an electrician, in 2020 he signed a contract for military service for a period of three years. He chose the 72nd mechanized brigade named after the Black Zaporozhets, where his father was doing military service at that time. He gained his first combat experience in the OOS at the Avdiivska -promka-, took part in combat operations in Volnovas. Anton met a full-scale Russian invasion as part of his unit in the Kyiv region. He says that they knew about the upcoming offensive of the Russian troops and were on full alert for a week. They arrived in the capital on the night of February 24, an hour before the first enemy rockets flew. Then there was fear, the soldier admits: they did not understand how the Russian offensive would develop. And resisting rocket attacks is not a task for the infantry. In the evening, units of the 72nd brigade took up positions in the Irpen area. Near the bridge over the Irpin river, which was blown up to prevent the advance of Russian troops on Kyiv. -When it started, there was fear. And the first fight was already on adrenaline. I was the driver of an MTLB equipped with a memory stick. But we did not use it for its intended purpose, but to deter enemy assaults. In the two years of my participation in the OOS, I have never seen such a thing: there was an assault once every two or three days, or even a week, and in Irpen there was simply an onslaught, Russians marched by the thousands - on armored vehicles, on tanks. There were much more of them than us. But we were no longer afraid. There was an understanding that we have a job and it must be done. As they say, do what you have to and let it be, what will be,- recalls the military man. After the Defense Forces of Ukraine with titanic efforts managed to repel the occupying army outside Kyiv Region, the 1st Battalion of the 72nd Brigade, in whose ranks soldier Barantsov served, was redeployed to Kharkiv Region at the end of April. The battalion was to become the striking force of the Ukrainian counteroffensive on the occupied Kozacha Lopan. But he came under the target fire of the enemy, suffered significant losses of personnel and was redeployed. Anton received a concussion, and while the personnel replenishment and combat coordination were taking place, he had time to undergo treatment in the medical unit. Luhansk region became the next place of combat missions. -Black Zaporizhzhya- arrived in Siverskodonetsk district in June. Various units took up positions between Lysychansk and Siverskodonetsk. Barantsov's crew was performing tasks at the Lysychansk Refinery, so that the enemy did not enter and gain a foothold on its territory. Then, as part of the unit, they were redeployed to the Bakhmut direction, where they held their positions until September. In October, Ugledar became the new place of task performance. -My crew mainly had the task of stopping enemy assaults. Our large-caliber weapons are capable of firing 250 rounds in 30 seconds. They worked to suppress. They held positions in this direction for several months. And they repelled several assaults every day. Vodiane was still ours then. I remembered the day of February 23, 2023 forever. We went out to suppress the assaults three times from 9 in the morning until noon, every hour then the Russians stormed, wave after wave. At 1:00 p.m., we were intercepted by the Orlan. And the dugout where we were was directly hit,- the soldier said. At that time, the equipment was camouflaged in a forest strip, and six servicemen were in an underground hiding place a few tens of meters away from it. A powerful targeted explosion killed two soldiers, others were injured in varying degrees of severity. Two soldiers lost their upper limbs as a result of the explosion. One of them is Anton Barantsov. -He received a concussion of moderate severity, his left arm was torn off at the shoulder, a severe shrapnel wound on his leg, and another shrapnel stopped below the collarbone. He gave first aid to himself. He put two tourniquets on his arm and leg. He lay waiting for evacuation for two hours. To be honest, I already thought that the woman would have to cook cabbage and bake pies. Because we were lying wounded, and we continued to be -covered-. I did not expect that someone would pull us out. Thank God, our brothers were able to break through and evacuate us,- the soldier recalls. It was possible to deliver Anton and his wounded comrades from the unit to the evacuation point in time. Ahead was a checkpoint, hospitals, hospitals, many months of treatment and prosthetics in Poland. In the end, the soldier passed the VLK and was recognized as suitable for service in the rear units. In January 2024, he was transferred to the Third Department of the Kremenchug District TCC and SP in the village of Semenivka. His duties include dressing up and making announcements. -The people we talk to see that I'm wearing a prosthesis. They don't shout -go fight!- to me, but the guys with me do. Although they were all transferred after combat injuries. I understand that every woman, every mother is afraid to let her husband, son, father go to war. However, we now have a great war going on, which we did not start, but we had to finish it. Therefore, every man must stand up for the defense of the Motherland — there is no other way to defeat the occupiers. I saw what the Russians were doing near Kyiv, in the Kharkiv region - they must be stopped once and for all,- emphasizes soldier Anton Barantsov. As reported by ArmyInform, the Dnipropetrovsk TCC reacted to the shameful behavior of a businessman who publicly insulted military personnel.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/meni-ne-krychat-idy-voyuj-vijskovyj-tczk-pro-te-yak-dali-sluzhyt-z-protezom/	2024-10-14T02:27:00-07:00

Spies--filmmakers-- The SBU detained men who were filming for the Russian Federation	reported this on October 14 Security Service of Ukraine The cameras allowed the occupiers to monitor the effects of -arrivals- online, as well as to adjust repeated or plan new attacks. The main targets of the Rashists were military airfields of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, thermal power plants, and energy-generating enterprises. According to the case materials, first the agents found the -necessary- objects, and then they installed and disguised mobile phones that carried out online broadcasting in front of them. For uninterrupted operation of gadgets for a long time, external batteries were connected to them. Counterintelligence of the SBU gradually documented the subversive activities of the agents and caught them red-handed when they installed an espionage device near a military facility. According to the investigation, both persons involved were recruited by the occupiers in the summer of this year, when they were looking for quick earnings on Telegram channels. However, instead of the promised funds from the Russian Federation, the detainees received suspicion from the investigators of the Security Service under Part 2 of Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The perpetrators are in custody. They face life imprisonment with confiscation of property. As reported by ArmyInform, counterintelligence exposed a serviceman , who unauthorizedly disseminated information about the location of units of the Defense Forces in the Sumy region. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/shpyguny-kinoshnyky-sbu-zatrymalo-cholovikiv-yaki-vely-filmuvannya-dlya-rf/	2024-10-14T01:24:16-07:00
The Vezha battlefield video analysis platform is now available in DELTA — Kateryna Chernogorenko	About this reported on October 14 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. This will improve operational efficiency and accuracy through better interaction and data sharing between drone crews, artillery and command posts. Vezha gives the Ukrainian military a technological advantage and eliminates dependence on other services. Instead, the enemy still uses third-party video platforms, which are often blocked by their developers or the Russian authorities. -Thanks to Vezha, the military analyzes video from hundreds of UAVs, detects and classifies more than 4,000 intelligence objects every day. Voice communication, joint decoding of video materials and monitoring of the effectiveness of drone units allow our fighters to act quickly and inflict significant losses on the enemy,- commented Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Digitalization, on the integration. The Vezha module has added to the ecosystem of DELTA products. Authentication through the combat system guarantees secure data exchange and protection against unauthorized access to broadcasts. The new version of the Vezha mobile application is integrated with the BpAK application planning module Mission Control and allows you to avoid the frequency conflict of FPV drones. This application is distributed exclusively through MDM (Mobile Device Management) - the military equivalent of the App Store or Play Market. Vezha became part of DELTA thanks to the cooperation of several teams. Initially, the 411th Battalion -Hawks- as part of the Territorial Defense Forces created a platform for its own needs. Subsequently, the Innovation Center of the Ministry of Defense joined the creation of a unified video analysis platform based on DELTA, and the teams of streaming platforms Tube and Raven provided their experience and work. The Center for Scaling Technology Solutions created the streaming core, adapting it to field conditions. This significantly accelerated the development and implementation of Vezha in DELTA. Currently, the combined team continues to expand the streaming capabilities to support thousands of simultaneous streams from various types of drones and cameras. Also, the artificial intelligence of the Avengers platform is being improved for automated video detection of the enemy in difficult conditions, such as camouflage or dense forest. As reported by ArmyInform, DELTA entered three of the most popular combat systems among the Ukrainian military. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/platforma-videoanalizu-polya-boyu-vezha-teper-dostupna-v-delta-kateryna-chernogorenko/	2024-10-14T01:06:14-07:00

Decades of Showcase Renovation: How Occupiers Neglect People's Needs	This was announced by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. In particular, in Aidar (formerly Novopskov), the occupiers announced the repair of the local hospital. However, according to the plan, it is promised to be completed only in 2030. The problem is that there is almost no one to work in the hospital - most doctors have either left in the last two and a half years, or the remaining specialists are of retirement age. Local residents are forced to wait weeks for an appointment with specialists, and those who have the opportunity are treated in neighboring communities. Artem Lysohor also emphasized the critical situation with heating in the so-called LNR. Although the heating season should begin in the coming days, the situation in the old districts of Siversko-Donetsk remains almost unchanged from last year. Communal services demonstratively started earthworks in the middle of the streets back in the fall, but the work on the laying of heating lines has not yet been completed.

The second issue of -Chaplain-: what will be taught to the -unfit- at Interflex in Britain	On top of that, you need to be in good enough health to withstand the rigors of combat. It is impossible to turn someone unfit for military service into a special agent, no matter how motivated he is. However, the decision of the VLK on -unsuitability- is not always the final verdict. The correspondent of ArmyInform tells about what can be taught to the -unfit- during the BZVP as part of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. Today, in our training duo, both are -unsuitable-, which after all their /->misgivings with passing the VLK purely by chance - almost two hundred brothers and sisters from the training company will not be allowed to lie - ended up at Interflex in Britain. In terms of age, my partner is approaching 30, I'm 45. Both of us had several opportunities not to go to the army - it was allowed to do so by being abroad already during a large-scale invasion, appropriate education and positions, and, after all, neither of us was in perfect health. 'I. The last one worries the most, but not because we are worried about ourselves - we are afraid of letting down our brothers who will count on us during a combat mission. The current task, however, is not so physically difficult - we should choose and quickly arrange the simplest individual shelter on the edge of the forest. This should be a hidden observation position, which should immediately become fireable at the first need. In pairs, we work to watch each other, spot mistakes, and suggest solutions. While you choose and prepare a position, your partner observes and notes your actions, paying attention to both successful decisions and mistakes. This effective methodological technique allows you to capture the attention of dozens of cadets at the same time. While the first two explain and justify their decisions to the instructors, the others continue to complete the task and prepare for the test. I choose shelter first. From the very beginning, a low-hanging branch of a coniferous tree, densely covered with old spruce, attracted attention. This is not the spruce or pine we are used to - something purely British. A paw branch creeps above the ground and literally grows in a thicket of fleshy, juicy green ferns after a heavy rain. At first glance, this is an ideal shelter - in the weeds under a branch, you will be hidden from all sides and even covered from above. Without hesitation, I crawl under the branch and break the fern stalks that obscure the view. In just a few minutes, I let you know that I am ready for inspection. The shelter seems close to ideal to me, so I'm waiting for a high rating. In the end, however, my disappointment knew no bounds—as I crept in, the bramble shook from the branch and the broken fern stalks exposed the position from the front. The enemy can easily see not only the bright yellow muzzle on my machine gun, but also me. My partner with the call sign -Chaplain- confidently lists all the shortcomings of my position to the instructor. Conspicuity for the enemy, lack of cover from enemy fire and insufficient, despite the exterminated fern stalks, visibility within the range of direct fire. The dense thickets of ferns on both sides do not allow me to effectively and inconspicuously maintain contact with my comrades, instead, my helmet, which is not carefully camouflaged by ferns, contrasts against the background of the open air behind me. Mission failed - the enemy discovered me and opened fire. At best, I managed to crawl behind a tree trunk from which a pawed branch was hanging and return fire. There is no question of any observation anymore - because of my carelessness, the fight started. Wet, dirty and dissatisfied, I crawl out of the fern into God's light. It was I who exposed my brothers to enemy fire and put them in danger when it could have been avoided. Once again I listen to the list of miscalculations - now not from the -Chaplain-, but from the instructor. He shows me all the shortcomings of the chosen position, walks me around and pays attention to all the details. All I can do is sniff and remember. I go around my shelter from all sides. Now it no longer seems as perfect as it seemed at the time of selection. The sun's rays sparkle brightly in the drops of water on the young gorse, from which I shook the old needles, the crushed fern shows through a torn hole. Now it's Kapelanova's turn to choose a position. We move to another edge of the forest, where he settles in just as quickly as I did before. His choice at first glance seems wrong, but trained by previous analysis, I do not rush to conclusions. His chosen position is open from the rear and flanks, which allows him to communicate easily. Instead, from the front, he is camouflaged and protected by a tree trunk and a small hill, behind which his fern-masked helmet peeks out less than a quarter. The advantages of the position chosen by the -Chaplain- far outweigh the disadvantages, which I will inform the instructor about. He nods his head approvingly as the translator relays my words to him. -You chose correctly and you explained correctly. Now you've both made it,- says the instructor and orders you to continue. He goes to the next couple, and we move to the neighboring area of ​​the forest. Now it's up to me to choose a position again. Trained from previous examples, I do it much better than the first time. This position provides good cover, camouflage and protection, and visibility for direct fire is generally perfect. -Chaplain- approvingly lists the advantages, notes certain unavoidable disadvantages. The instructor agrees with everything. Now, he says, you've taken the first step toward becoming number two in a sniper pair. For a modest level of achievement, this assessment of our efforts is too high, but we are pleased. We understand that, despite all the shortcomings, thanks to training, we acquire the ability to perform combat tasks with high quality within the limits of our sphere of activity. A -Chaplain- prepares to become an assistant to a military chaplain, assisting and protecting him while serving on the front lines. I am preparing to go to the war zone as part of a mobile group of military journalists. It is unlikely that, with all the existing limitations, we will reach the level of becoming a real number two in a sniper pair. However, in order to become a well-trained military second-in-command alongside a military chaplain or a military journalist, we are more than suitable. Basic combined military training within the borders of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain is quite capable of ensuring this.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/drugyj-nomer-kapelana-chogo-navchat-neprydatnyh-na-interflex-u-brytaniyi/	2024-10-13T21:00:28-07:00
Mine protection is understood in Africa: armored personnel carriers with a high level of ballistic p...	As emphasize the authors of the defense portal Army Recognition, who examined the African armored personnel carrier at the exhibition site, this versatile machine, developed in accordance with modern operational requirements, combines mobility, ballistic protection and adaptability to different weapon systems, ArmiyaInform reports. It should be noted that since 2010 Paramount Group has been producing highly mobile, mine-protected and ambush-protected ( MRAP) MBOMBE vehicle in both four- and six-wheel versions (MBOMBE 6). From these developments was born the 8-wheeled model known as the -Mbombe 8-. It stands out for its ability to be configured for various missions, such as troop transport, logistical support and reconnaissance operations in hostile terrain. MBOMBE 8 is designed to accommodate a crew of two, plus a commander and eight additional paratroopers.

It is possible to install a wide range of turrets and combat modules, for example, the AU-220M turret armed with a 57 mm cannon and a 7.62 mm machine gun. This allows the military to adapt the vehicle to specific mission scenarios. Additional options include communications systems, battlefield management systems, 8-ton winches, and engine, compartment, and wheel arch fire suppression systems. The vehicle's dimensions of 8,000 mm in length, approximately 3,279 mm in width and 2,400 mm in height make it suitable for a variety of operating conditions. Its modular design and various weapon configurations maximize the use of this BBM in missions such as troop transport, logistics support, reconnaissance and special operations. In terms of deployment, MBOMBE 8 is already in operation in several countries. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the armored vehicle from the South African company Paramount is used by the armed forces of such countries as Kazakhstan, the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan. Its presence in these armies confirms its reputation for reliability, protection and versatility, which makes the APC suitable for various types of military operations, including peacekeeping missions and intervention in conflict zones.

Enemy propagandists forge inscriptions on crosses	-And how many of them are there all over the country- - the propagandists comment on the image of the alleged burial of an unknown Ukrainian soldier who died during the hostilities with the number 214 350. Pro-Russian sources also draw attention to the homemade wooden cross and the absence of flowers at the funeral - it seems to show disrespect to ordinary soldiers who give their lives in battle. However, this photo is a fake. First of all, any native speaker of Ukrainian immediately notices that the words on the plaque do not agree with each other — -Here rest the unidentified remains of the defender of Ukraine.- Secondly, in real burials of unknown soldiers, it is customary to use the phrase -temporarily unidentified- to emphasize that the identification of the soldier and the search for his relatives are ongoing. In such cases, the body is kept in the morgue for a certain time, DNA material is collected from it to continue the identification of the soldier and the search for his relatives, and then buried with military honors. When the deceased can be identified, his relatives have the right to rebury the body. In addition, the humanitarian mission -Black Tulip- ensures that fallen Ukrainian soldiers are given a dignified burial. The search team brings home the bodies of soldiers who cannot be immediately retrieved from the battlefield due to intense combat or landmines. So, the propaganda narrative about the negligent burial of Ukrainian soldiers does not correspond to reality. With the help of photo editors and artificial intelligence, you can draw a lot nowadays, so you should not take all the so-called -photo evidence- of any -betrayal- on faith. . Remember that the enemy works every day to destabilize the internal situation in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/vorozhi-propagandysty-pidroblyayut-napysy-na-hrestah/	2024-10-13T20:26:08-07:00

Star Wars: the US space force announced another orbital mission of the top-secret X-37B spacecraft	According to placed on the official portal of the US Space Force, the device will change its orbit around the Earth and safely dispose of the components of its service module in accordance with recognized standards for reducing space debris, ArmyInform reports. The X-37B is an unmanned spacecraft created by Boeing to test future space technologies. The device has a fuselage length of 8.28 m with a wingspan of 4.6 m. The maximum take-off weight, according to open sources, is 4990 kg. The device can launch a payload weighing up to 900 kg into space. The maximum speed provided by the Rocketdyne Ar2-3 engine is 28,200 km/h. As reported, this is the first attempt by the US Space Force and the X-37B spacecraft as part of the OTV-7 (Orbital Test Vehicle, Ukrainian) mission to perform a dynamic braking maneuver, building on the experience of six previous successful missions in the safe operation of the space plane. as well as a decade of general lessons learned by the scientific community during missions to the Moon and Mars. The U.S. Space Force says that using an aero-capture maneuver — a series of passes using the gravity of Earth's atmosphere — allows the spacecraft to change orbits while using minimal fuel. After the braking maneuver is completed, the X-37B will return to its test and experimental missions, after which the vehicle will de-orbit and make a safe return, as it has done on six previous missions. -This new and effective series of maneuvers demonstrates the Space Force's commitment to breakthrough innovations in national security missions in space,- said US Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall. The US Air Force Rapid Capability Office (AFRCO) has managed the X-37B program since 2010. It is aimed at developing the next generation of reusable space vehicles for the US Space Force. Starting December 28, 2023, the US Space Force, with the support of the Air Force Rapid Capability Office, is conducting radiation exposure experiments and testing space exploration technologies in a highly elliptical orbit. -This first-of-its-kind X-37B maneuver is an extremely important milestone for the US Space Force as we seek to expand our capabilities and capability to operate in this challenging domain,- said Pentagon Space Operations Chief Gen. Chance Salzman. -This success is a testament to the commitment and perseverance of the team.- The OTV unmanned vehicle, based on NASA's X-37 project, is designed for vertical launch into low-Earth orbit, where it can perform long-duration experiments and space technology tests. Controlled from the ground, the OTV autonomously enters the atmosphere, descends and lands horizontally on the runway, reports The Aviationist website. Development of the X-37 began in 1999. The US Air Force has started a test project with NASA. However, in 2004, the project was transferred to DARPA. The agency completed the ALTV portion of the X-37 program in 2006 and conducted a series of manned and free-flight tests. Orbital test spacecraft X-37B.

Defended Mariupol, was captured and survived the death penalty: the story of a legionnaire of the HU...	In the material from the training camp of the International Legion of the Armed Forces of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Kyiv Post journalists showed exclusive training footage and stories of foreign volunteers. -The scariest moment in my life was probably when I surrendered to the Russians, because I knew what was waiting for me. This is a feeling I never want to experience again,- said the legionnaire with the nickname -Cossack-. The so-called -court- of the occupiers sentenced Aiden to death, but after 5 months of imprisonment, torture and propaganda, he was able to be released in an exchange. Subsequently, -Coszak- returned to military service - in the International Legion of the GUR MOU. -After six years of living in Ukraine, although I am not Ukrainian by blood, I can say that I am Ukrainian by heart, because now Ukraine is my home. I dream of seeing the day when the invasion ends and Russian troops are expelled from Ukraine,- Aiden said. Also, another fighter with the call sign -Lira- said that he and his crew were invited to join the medical crew. That's how he ended up in the International Legion of GUR MOU. -Cities are the most memorable. You come on rotation to the same cities, and there are fewer and fewer of them. Physically less. You cannot return to this city, because it is already occupied,- he said. In Liar's opinion, there are not enough people with a medical education in the ZSU. -Therefore, if you are a doctor or have a medical education, then join the International Legion of GUR MOU. Fill out the application form on the website,- he urged. More stories of GUR legionnaires and details of their service are in the video. We remind you, Rustem Umyerov positively evaluated the law, which allows foreigners to become officers of the Defense Forces of Ukraine.

About this on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyvi- said the spokesman of the operational-tactical group of troops -Siversk-, Colonel Vadym Mysnyk of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to the officer, the enemy is throwing new units into the region, so the concentration of enemy forces is quite high. The Russians actively use both combat aircraft that drop UAVs, as well as FPV drones and reconnaissance drones. Artillery shelling is also constant. At the same time, enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups operating in the Kursk region are also showing considerable activity. -The DRG not only opposes our troops, but also terrorizes and &#8220;nightmares&#8221; local population. Although we do not see anything new and strange in this. After all, the Russian occupiers operate in the same way in the captured Ukrainian territories. In their turn, Ukrainian soldiers demonstrate a dignified attitude towards the locals and tell what their compatriots, the invaders, did in Ukraine. In particular, from the first days of the operation of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region, Russian civilian residents thought that their authorities were evacuating them. But then they learned that the same authorities already treat those who have not left the territories of the Russian Federation currently under the control of Ukrainian troops as traitors who take food from Ukrainian soldiers. So the locals already feel the difference in the attitude of Ukrainians and their military towards them.- stated Colonel Mysnyk. According to the spokesman of OTU -Siversk-, the Russian troops, which could not dislodge Ukrainian forces from Kurshchyna and did not meet the so-called -deadline-, will continue to destroy their own settlements in the future. -Just like in Ukraine, they will destroy and demolish Russian settlements here simply ``under zero,'' Colonel Mysnyk said.

The most terrible thing was hearing the screams of comrades when they were beaten: combat medic Gali...	After leaving Azovstal, the Ukrainian marines were sent to the infamous Olenivka. Halyna stayed here for more than four months, Mykola - one and a half. The rest of the time, almost until the exchange itself, he was in a medical facility in Donetsk&#8230; We were placed in the building of the former DIZO. There was no possibility to get medical help here, there were no medicines and hygiene products - only what we took with us from Azovstal. They fed porridges and soups, where only worms could be found as meat. Water — potable and technical — was brought, the doctor recalls. The girl says that after hygienic procedures, the water was poured into a bucket to the last drop in order to be used in the future to maintain cleanliness in the cell: washing the floor and what could be called a toilet with a stretch. Due to clogged pipes, waste products often flowed out of the sewers - there were stinking puddles in the places where Ukrainian prisoners of war were held and in the corridors. Not the only opportunity to wash completely, albeit with cold water, was involvement in field work, because the bath was at best once every ten days. Mykola lived with his brothers in a barrack designed for 150 people. However, about seven hundred Ukrainian servicemen were kept here. -In the early days, there weren't even enough beds - we just slept on the floor,- the man recalls. But, you know, it was much easier morally there than in Russia. We were in Ukraine&#8230; Several times Ukrainian radio made its way to us - once for a moment we heard the national anthem, then songs by Ukrainian artists. In the summer, Halyna learned that the Russians had taken her fiance to the Donetsk Detention Center. From what was known from those who were interrogated there, it was clear that one could not expect good news&#8230; Unfortunately, the girl's fears came true - after being bullied by Russian inhumans, the man ended up in the hospital with broken ribs and internal bleeding. Interrogations were conducted by FSB officers - they forced me to sign a -confession- that I had shot several civilian cars. All the -black work- - beatings and torture - was already done by our former compatriots&#8230; the Russians -didn't get their hands dirty- in Donetsk, says Mykola. After those tortures, the man was taken to Olenivka, where a fellow doctor diagnosed that his blood pressure had dropped to a critical level. He persuaded the Russians to take Mykola to the hospital, where he was urgently operated on. He spent another ten days in intensive care, then several months in a hospital inpatient. Then he was returned to Olenivsk DIZO. On the day of the exchange, we were called by our names and ordered to take our things with us. -We thought it was another stage - somewhere to Siberia, so we tried to take everything we had,- the man recalls. Before the trucks arrived for the Russian captives, their hands were tied and their eyes were taped. And then there were several hours of travel - to the airport, most likely in Taganrog, then a plane flight. Even in the last hours of captivity, the Russians did not miss a chance to humiliate or beat us, Mykola says, the boys on the second floor wanted to go to the toilet, but they were not allowed. Therefore, it all fell on us&#8230; When Halyna found out that her fiancé was involved in another exchange of prisoners of war, she felt great relief. The day before, the girls from -Azov- who worked at the bakery were taken away in stages, so I went there for two shifts. I just come to the bakery, and there are guys from the barracks. I learned from them that Mykola is already at large. And I knew that sooner or later I would definitely get out of there - I believed that women had more chances to be free. In the fall, Halyna was transferred to one of the boot factories in Russia. The conditions of detention became worse every month - from more or less tolerable food to stale bread, which caused many people to burst their stomachs, and then could not eat normally for several weeks. In addition, we did not have the easiest thing - due to the lack of feminine hygiene products, we used rags. The head was constantly itching and the skin was peeling due to the lack of vitamins and the ability to simply wash normally, the girl says. Due to constant malnutrition, in September 2023, Galina had a critical weight loss. Then they put me on additional rations - they gave me an extra portion of porridge that just didn't fit in my throat, and they stood over me until I stuffed it into myself. That is, you even had a choice - to eat it or not, - recalls the girl. In addition, constant interrogations continued - the Muscovites forced, through beatings and moral pressure and sexual humiliation, forced confessions from the combat medic in those crimes that the Ukrainian defenders did not commit: torture and murder of the local population, etc.&#8230; The funniest thing in that situation was that we saved even those civilians in Mariupol who openly supported the Russians, but at the same time suffered from their aggression! Because human life is the greatest value in this world! - recalls Galina. And between the beatings and abuse, the orcs forced the prisoners of war to memorize -fastidious- songs such as -Katyusha- and -Victory Day-, Russian poems, and the rules for staying in the boot camp. For a long time it was forbidden to sit in the cells, which was constantly monitored through the observation window in the door. Violators were severely punished - by beating or standing for hours -on the twine-. The most terrible thing in that period was hearing the screams of the brothers when they were beaten. There was more pressure on us mentally, and the boys had a hard time physically. These screams could really drive you crazy, says the combat medic. And complete isolation in relation to news about Ukraine was also morally damaging. The only thing that was learned during the entire stay behind Russian bars was that the invaders were occupying Bakhmut. But, in contrast to the expectations of the Orkish pack, this information only pleased the captives - for two years of full-scale aggression, the Russians never entered the borders of Donetsk region. At the beginning of January, Halyna and several other men were taken out of the cells, given their clothes instead of the slave clothes they were in, and put in a car. The girl was sure that they were being taken by stage to Donetsk or Taganrog. One of the Vertukhians told me that we were going home, but the Russians were not a nation to be trusted. Therefore, of course, I was sure of something else until the very end. Especially since one of the guys who was with me in the car park said that he had already gone to such an -exchange- three times, the girl recalls. Hope came when she heard the phrase -woman first- during another stop. It's not obscene, but a woman. Because in general, the word -woman- and -girl- are very rare words that were used against us - because you are in the captivity of anyone, but not a person. The prisoners had their data checked and were put on buses. That moment was almost the only one when Galina felt a normal attitude towards her from the Russian side - the accompanying woman herself offered her to go to the toilet, gave her water. &#8230; After the flight by plane, again in buses, the Ukrainian captives were allowed to remove the tape from their faces and their hands were relaxed. And then followed the cherished phrase - -Glory to Ukraine!- The representative of the Ukrainian special service, who met us, got out of the bus, and we all sit and look at each other. When I saw the boys, I was shocked by their appearance: there were many of them with medical masks on their faces - they had been diagnosed with tuberculosis. And I think they had the same impression about me, - Galina recalls. Already in Ukraine, Halyna was able to contact her mother. And then she congratulated Mykola on another anniversary - a few years ago, on January 3, the couple started dating&#8230; Already during such a long-awaited meeting, the man proposed to his beloved - the footage with the certificate then flew around the world! Behind the combat medic is complex rehabilitation after capture, several operations. Now she is waging a personal fight for every Ukrainian prisoner, telling the world about the torture that Ukrainian defenders are going through in Moscow. I cannot be happy in the full sense of the word until the last Ukrainian prisoner of war leaves the territory of Russia! R.S. Galina and Mykola got married two weeks ago. And they also raise a wonderful labrador named Dora. The man had a lover while the beloved was in captivity - this was a shared dream of the newlyweds. The dog became a real salvation for a serviceman from abysmal depression&#8230; Photo by the author and from the archive of heroes	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/13/najstrashnishe-bulo-chuty-kryky-pobratymiv-koly-yih-byly-bojova-medykynya-galyna-fedyshyn-pro-peklo-rosijskogo-polonu/	2024-10-12T20:43:56-07:00
The enemy invents nonsense about the recruiting center of the Ukrainian Legion in Poland	In the Polish city of Lublin on the Day of Defenders on October 1, 2024, the recruiting center of the Ukrainian Legion really started working. However, neither on its website nor on the official pages of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine there is no information about the -Apple tablet- raffle or any other raffles. Presumably, the propagandists simply made up this news in response to the opening of the Ukrainian Legion's first recruiting center abroad. Previously, the Russians already tried to discredit the creation of recruiting centers. They spread information, allegedly by opening them in Ukraine, they are expanding the network of military commissariats, where people will be forcibly mobilized. In fact, Recruiting Centers help to find out information about vacancies in the army and to choose a specific place of service, according to professional skills. Recruiters are prohibited from transferring data to TCCs and SPs to speed up mobilization. But Russian propaganda constantly produces fakes to discredit and disrupt the mobilization campaign in Ukraine. But they will not succeed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/13/vorog-vygaduye-nisenitnyczi-pro-rekrutyngovyj-czentr-ukrayinskogo-legionu-v-polshhi/	2024-10-12T20:30:27-07:00
In Kurshchyna, Ukrainian paratroopers destroyed stormtroopers - a very rotten brigade -	The Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported this in their telegram channel. -These were bastards from the 155th brigade of marines of the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Federation, who especially like to show off their -feats-. Namely: the abuse of prisoners, as well as the shootings of those Ukrainian servicemen who, finding themselves in a hopeless situation, surrendered themselves, -said the DSHV of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As you know, prisoners of war are protected all over the world by the Geneva Conventions. But the Russians don't really care about international humanitarian law, so they rudely and cynically violate it. -But here it was not possible to hypothesize these monstrosities in military uniform: having met in battle with Ukrainian paratroopers, they were all destroyed. The same fate will await other soldiers from this brigade,- the paratroopers emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the 155th Separate Guards Marine Brigade of the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Federation is known for its war crimes, it was even characterized as -very rotten brigade-.

Everything depends on our stability,- the President emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, servicemen of the Russian Federation are systematically shelling populated areas of the district of the Kursk region under the control of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, effectively erasing them from the face of the earth.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/12/prezydent-trymayemo-rubezhi-na-kurshhyni-popry-namagannya-rosiyi-vidtysnuty-nashi-pozycziyi/	2024-10-12T10:41:38-07:00

He added that last week the enemy carried out logistical support for these assault groups, carried out a rotation and will now build up forces and increase the number of attacks. As reported by ArmyInform, Russian troops are trying increase the number of weapons on the Kinbourn Spit, this may mean preparing for an assault.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/12/vorog-proviv-rotacziyu-na-livoberezhzhi-hersonshhyny-namagayetsya-zagostryty-sytuacziyu/	2024-10-12T10:22:41-07:00

Treason in Toretsk: Russian soldiers change into civilian clothes	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. The presence of local residents in the city who did not have time to evacuate makes it very difficult to conduct battles in the urban development. After all, the Ukrainian military is forced to take care of the safety of civilians and help them leave the dangerous zone. Instead, the Russian occupiers do not pay attention to the casualties both among their own military and among local civilians. — This actually makes fighting in the city very difficult. Because the Russians don't care if they kill civilians or military. Life means little to them. And for us, the life of every civilian is a value. It is a tragedy when those we protect we have to bury, said the spokeswoman. The military also reported that the Russian occupiers in Toretsk resort to treachery and commit a war crime — they take off their military uniforms and change into civilian clothes. - I must note that the enemy uses insidious tactics, he disguises himself in civilian clothes. Therefore, our defenders need to think twice - is it an enemy before us or is it a peaceful resident in front of us, - said Anastasia Bobovnikova. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that for example Toretska in the Armed Forces of Ukraine explained why civilians should evacuate in time from a possible war zone.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/12/virolomstvo-u-toreczku-rosijski-soldaty-perevdyagayutsya-u-czyvilnyj-odyag/	2024-10-12T09:48:33-07:00
The occupiers became more active on the Kinburn Spit, the Defense Forces explained the reasons	This was said by the spokesman of the Defense Forces of the South, Vladyslav Voloshin, on the TV channel Freedom. The spokesman noted that Russian troops continue to increase their presence on the Kinburn spit to carry out assaults and possibly force the territory in the area where the Dnipro flows into the Black Sea. -Now we have a rather tense situation there,- said Vladyslav Voloshyn. He added that last week the occupying forces transferred a division of boats from Sevastopol, which will be used to control this territory. As reported by ArmyInform, as a result of active hostilities on the territory of the Kinburnska Kosa Reserve fires raged. The occupiers set up their positions there and periodically fire from there.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/12/okupanty-aktyvizuvalysya-na-kinburnskij-kosi-u-sylah-oborony-poyasnyly-prychyny/	2024-10-12T09:24:58-07:00
The Armed Forces calculated the losses of the occupiers in the Toretsk area for a month	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. She reported that, despite the heavy losses, the occupiers are significantly outnumbered in terms of manpower, regularly drop reinforcements into forward positions and continue to storm. — The situation in Toretsk is very difficult. Today, the enemy made 15 attacks in this direction. The vast majority was in Toretsk itself. City battles are difficult and unstable. Our troops are holding back the offensive at the moment, but the enemy is pressing in with larger forces. I will also note that the enemy is constantly adding manpower to the forward positions, she said. It is difficult to estimate what part of the city is currently controlled by the enemy. — The situation is unstable and it is extremely incorrect to talk about any specific percentages. The battles are going on, the battles are very dynamic, very difficult. We are trying to contain the enemy. During the last days, the enemy did not advance within the [direction] where the fighting took place. The spokeswoman described the street fights in Toretsk. — In the middle of the city it is very easy to mask mines, mining positions is very simple. In the city, on the one hand, it is more difficult, on the other hand, it is easier to hide, because there are basements. But when artillery works, it destroys houses, for example, completely erases them, and it is already more difficult to hide in these ruins in cities. Plus, the enemy can infiltrate the city. That is, a complex of measures is taking place that complicate the fighting in the city, the military woman explained. The officer reported the number of enemy casualties over the past day. — The enemy will suffer huge losses. Only in the past day, they lost 200 people killed and wounded. They just need to replenish the -meat stock- in their advanced positions, so they are recruiting new personnel. These are mostly contract workers, personnel units of the Russian army are against us, the officer said. She calculated the approximate number of Russian casualties per month only in the Toretska region. — In the past day alone, they lost 200 people wounded and killed. Imagine that in a month it is about 6 thousand people killed and injured. This is the size of an average Russian brigade. And this is only near one small town, the military woman emphasized. However, despite the heavy losses, the occupiers have a significant numerical advantage in manpower, weapons and military equipment. — The enemy outnumbers us many times. It also has a larger amount of equipment, artillery, b/c. They push with more force. They are now actively recruiting contract workers, they are being promised crazy money and that is why they are going for it. Thus, there is a constant transfer of personnel to advanced positions, - Anastasiya Bobovnikova said.

Hostile media present this situation as -lawlessness- and try to magnify this event, give it more importance than it really is.

TCC employees act within their powers.

-Not your war?-: How the network reacts to checks by the TCC and the police after the concert -Ocean...	It was stated that the documents of the men were checked, and some of them were allegedly detained. In addition, as is known from open sources, similar raids took place in Kharkiv, Dnipro, and Khmelnytskyi. ArmyInform gathered the opinions of military personnel, veterans, and government officials regarding the current situation. Yes, the head of the Humanitarian Committee of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Mykyta Poturaev stated that he does not consider the verification of documents after the -Oceanu Elsa- concert to be a threat to Ukrainian culture. -Just like after any public or mass event. Just as I do not consider document checks in bars or clubs a threat to the Ukrainian economy. Moreover, I welcome such checks, and I believe that they should be thorough and permanent. And everyone should know about it,- Nikita Poturaev wrote. Historian and journalist serving in the National Guard of Ukraine, Vakhtang Kipiani, also said about the situation that has developed. -If conscripted men went to the TCC or to specific military units themselves after every report in the press about the injury or death of a serviceman, then there would be no need to check any documents on the streets. Then there would be, if not enough, people in the defense forces, but definitely more than now. In place of the one who is eliminated, another must come. This is the main thing. If someone who has been waiting for his moment for more than two and a half years needs a special invitation to dance with a tambourine, then the uniform of the police and TCC is just that. If millions of men do not go to protect their families themselves, then the state exists to remind not only about rights, but also about responsibilities,- Vakhtang Kipiani believes. Military serviceman of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, public figure, human rights defender, founder of NGO -Princip- Masi Nayyem says: -There is a problem. We need to recognize this and look for a solution to preserve the state. It is extremely dangerous when there is an enemy at the border, and the mobilization takes place in such a way that the media only cover the problems of civilians with the TCC and the police. It is clear that there is a strong tension in the civilian population as well as in the military. And the negative buzz around the mobilization process can create tension between two large groups in our society.- Military serviceman Dmytro Ivanov is also reacted to the events in the capital on the evening of October 11. Yes, first of all, according to him, document checks during martial law are the norm. Secondly, the event gained resonance due to the fact that it happened in the capital. He also explained how he sees the answer to the question -why does a person go to war?-. -A person is faced with a choice: either a great chance to die, or to receive something that is worse than death for him. That is, the choice between -bad- and -absolutely bad-. A patriotic person, or simply a responsible citizen, goes to war, because living under the rule of the occupiers for such people is worse than death, that's all. But we have about 20-25% of such categories. And there is the remaining 75-80%, they have a different perception&#8230; And this category does not consider occupation more terrible than death, and therefore does not want to fight and will not go voluntarily. What does this category have to offer? Nothing but the choice between -risk of death- and -worse than death,- says the army man. Council member of the Public Council of Integrity Andrii Kulibaba emphasizes that for him the question of service and defense of the country is a question of justice and the distribution of duty. -I am very saddened by this video&#8230; Because these are the same people who at the beginning of the full-scale protest thanked the police and the military, when they pushed the Russians away from Kyiv, listened and sang along to songs about the dog Patron, Bayraktar and Vanka Vstanka, and wear a T-shirt with the inscription -Good evening, we are from Ukraine -. And now they are shouting shame, because personal comfort is sacred,- he said. Public figure Oksana Bailo draws attention more and to the fact that, according to her, in the third year of a large-scale war and martial law in the country, the concerts should be mostly people who are not subject to mobilization and military (on leave, on hospital leave, rotation, etc.). -And because of the fact that in our third (almost fourth!) year of the war of destruction, concerts and gyms are mostly attended by the same people who, for some reason, decided that they should not go to replace those who have concerts and gyms three years in a row look completely different, so forgive me, but sooner or later the second ones will begin to end, and then the raids begin&#8230; And yes, we need more raids&#8230; across all gyms, restaurants, business success conferences, etc. And a long time ago,- Oksana Bailo summed up on her Facebook page. And volunteer Oleksandr Karpyuk (known in social networks as Serg Marco) so reflectedthe events in Kyiv at the concert of a famous Ukrainian band: -In the list of things demotivating those on the front lines, citizens who were forbidden by criminal TCCs to use their civic duty to go to Elsa's ocean. Well, do you even understand what kind of eyes those on the front lines look at this? What will be their attitude to those who have already decided that it is -not your war-?- he asks rhetorically. ArmyInform also requested a comment from the Kyiv Police regarding yesterday's events, but has not yet received an official response. We remind you that during martial law, law enforcement officers have the right to demand from conscripts a military registration document and an identity document. Police officers can also check whether the conscript has updated his details in accordance with the mobilization law. If the law enforcement officers find out that the conscript is wanted by the TCC, they are authorized to detain and deliver the violator to the Military Commissariat. We also remind you of the opportunity to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces on our website and choose your unit without waiting for a summons or inspections. In addition, recently there was an opportunity to volunteer to mobilize directly by agreement with the military unit, bypassing the TCC. The introduced changes simplify the procedure for enlisting volunteers for mobilization as much as possible. From now on, if a conscript joins the army by mobilization, a reference (recommendation letter) from the unit is not required.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/12/ne-tvoya-vijna-yak-v-merezhi-reaguyut-na-perevirky-tczk-i-policziyi-pislya-konczertu-okeanu-elzy/	2024-10-12T05:51:41-07:00

-Our group was the first to go into battle in Zaporozhye-: the war of the company commander -Anod-	The paratroopers have repeatedly repelled large-scale Russian assaults with dozens of armored vehicles and continue to confidently destroy the enemy. He spoke about his military journey from a private rifleman to the commander of the -Anod- company in a conversation with an ArmyInform correspondent. — Why -Anode-? This is the first question they ask, are you a welder? No, I'm a chemist. He is from Kharkiv. Before the war, he worked in electroplating, metal structures, jewelry, souvenirs, etc. He worked at a company that produced pneumatic weapons. This is coating, anodizing or oxidizing aluminum or oxidizing steel. You can see that the barrel is black on the machine, this is steel oxidation, for example. The officer says that he had a desire to join the Defense Forces at the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, but due to family circumstances, it was not possible. Eventually went to the ZSU in late 2022. — On the way, I came across representatives of the TCC and the joint venture, they asked for documents, I say, they say, and that's how I'm coming to you. I was offered to serve in the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and I went to the training center. Physical exertion did not frighten me, I have been involved in sports all my life, 12 years in judo, candidate for master of sports. -Anode- points out that BZVP is just the beginning of the journey, in war you need to constantly learn and improve your skills, you need to learn new things that the enemy uses. — Now there are a lot of drops, drones, a large variety of ammunition. It must be studied all over. We share information with our brothers, and then, like word of mouth, it spreads throughout the Armed Forces. War changes so quickly: what was wrong yesterday may work as it should tomorrow, and vice versa. At the educational center, the paratrooper obtained the military registration specialty of a sniper and went to the Bakhmut direction, where he got his first combat experience. After some time, the unit was taken out for recovery, and -Anode- went to the platoon commanders' course. — The beginning of the counteroffensive on Zaporizhzhia in 2023 I met precisely in the position of platoon commander, and in the fall I was promoted to deputy company commander. After some time, he accepted the position of company commander. With the new appointment, absolutely everything has changed. Because when you're just a soldier, you're primarily responsible for yourself and for your brother next to you. But you don't think about how your brothers are in the area of ​​preparation for defensive actions, how the wounded guys are, how their relatives are there. Rather, maybe you think, but it is not your duty. The officer explains that the commander has to take care of all movement, EW cover, weapons, food supply, etc. In addition, it is necessary to establish cooperation with other departments. -Anode- immediately recalls the first important moment in his experience as a combat officer. — This is a trip to Zaporozhye. Our group was probably the first from the brigade to go into battle. It was very difficult, in some time they evacuated three wounded, and one could not get out. Bullets are whistling overhead, and I don't know what to do, I'm in a daze. This was probably the most difficult. Then somehow I came to my senses, the responsibility for my brothers came into play. I realized that I needed to act. The second such moment was promotion to deputy company commander, and this is a completely different level of responsibility. At this point, the officer is already directing the unit's actions remotely via UAV video. — You understand that you had to go with them, you had to lead them, maybe something would have gone wrong there, it was very difficult. I understand that there can be no loss in war, but I remember everyone, I know where each of my brothers is now. -Anode- reflects on the importance of a responsible attitude to the service and says that he does not understand people who allow themselves to escape to the SZH. - Siblings are always nearby, they can support and advise. If you join the army, please walk at least halfway, take one exit. Our battalion has not lost a single position in six months. It's not as scary as it's made out to be. In his opinion, the good result of the unit in Zaporozhye was achieved in particular because it was possible to rotate and undergo coordination. — We spent five months in recovery, we were given people, we studied, we adjusted. When you know that this is your brother, you know his wife, children, what he lives, what he did, then this is a very big influence. At the same time, -Anode- says that the enemy's moral and psychological level is at a very low level. They are very afraid of persecution, that they will be put in a pit, beaten. They do not surrender and often choose suicide on the battlefield. — They are very bad specialists in their majority. A person can sit under a stove for 4 months, they are given a Snickers bar and half a bottle of water once a day, and they tolerate it all. They see that a pit has been dug in them, into which they throw all the violators of discipline, beat them, etc. And they are afraid of it, they are afraid to roll back, they run without weapons. The officer says that he sometimes wonders if he will continue his military career after the war is over. He has not made a decision yet, but he is sure that he will no longer be able to be an employee. — If there are any business ideas, maybe yes. And if not, then, most likely, I will stay in the army. Financial support will be an important factor. My parents, wife and son are waiting for me at home. Everyone sees victory in their own way. For me, victory is when our people stop dying. But I know for sure that after the victory, it will be necessary to work a lot, to continue building fortifications. — In civilian life, I was never an organizer, I was used to having everything done for me, roasting meat, buying food. I will just come, lie down on a deck chair and rest. This was my lifestyle. But here all this has to be returned as a debt.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/12/nasha-grupa-pishla-pershoyu-v-bij-na-zaporizhzhi-vijna-komandyra-roty-anoda/	2024-10-11T20:44:55-07:00
-Sky Ranger- changes the -horse-: in Germany, the tower of the air defense system was installed on t...	How note experts of the defense portal Army Recognition conducted at the Oxenboden test center in Studen, Switzerland, fire tests are an important milestone in the development of Rheinmetall's new cost-effective self-propelled anti-aircraft installation (SPAAG), ArmyInform reports. The Skyranger 35 is seen as a modern alternative to the Flakpanzer Gepard anti-aircraft system introduced in 1976. As reported our editorial office, Flakpanzer Gepard used by Ukraine to protect against Russian cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. However, the new air defense system uses advanced technologies such as programmable munitions. As says Polish information resource zbiam.pl, the integration of the Skyranger 35 with the Leopard 1 chassis is a response to the growing interest from various countries. This configuration provides flexibility as the system can be adapted to different chassis, including other tank platforms and armored vehicles. In turn, the weapons market researchers from IKK Defense Express told that the chassis was used to create this demonstrator from the Leopard 1A5BE tank, the tower itself is made -unmanned-, two crew members (commander and gunner) are placed in the bow part of the hull. Ammunition for 252 shots is placed in the tower itself, the effective firing range is 4 thousand meters. By the way, it is worth reminding that the Skyranger 35 system is equipped with a 35 mm turret gun Oerlikon Revolver, which can fire at a nominal rate of fire of 1000 rounds per minute, and in rapid single fire mode at 200 rounds per minute. Its effective range reaches 4,000 meters, and it is capable of hitting small unmanned aerial targets with high precision, especially in hovering or diving conditions. What sets the Skyranger 35 apart is its integration with advanced targeting systems, including a 360-degree AESA search radar and a Ku-band tracking radar. These sensors work together with a fully stabilized electro-optical sensor unit, providing seamless detection and tracking of highly moving targets. The system's turret is adapted for vehicles, with a lower profile and enhanced functionality compared to previous versions. Combined with Oerlikon Ahead air-burst munitions, the system is said to be able to effectively engage even the smallest aerial targets, making it particularly suitable for combating swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles. In this regard, as noted by Rheinmetall, with 252 ready-to-fire cartridges, the Skyranger 35 provides constant firepower and quick response in dynamic combat situations. This combination of high mobility, targeting accuracy and rate of fire makes the Skyranger 35 a quality tool for modern air defense, especially against new threats from unmanned aerial vehicles, which are becoming more common on today's battlefields. Rheinmetall's use of existing platforms reflects its desire to create cost-effective solutions without compromising productivity. This approach reduces production and maintenance costs, and provides the military with scalable capabilities to increase its defense capabilities. The use of the Skyranger 35 on the Leopard 1 chassis is expected to accelerate the full combat deployment of this new mobile air defense system. According to the company Rheinmetall , potential customers of the new system can be countries that seek to modernize their air defense systems efficiently and economically. As aerial threats become increasingly sophisticated, the development of versatile and responsive air defense solutions such as the Skyranger 35 is set to be critical to enhancing global defense readiness. According to the conclusions of Western military experts, Rheinmetall AG, which has more than a century of experience, continues to innovate in response to modern challenges in the defense industry. Specializing in automotive and defense technologies, the company has played an important role in the development of the latest military equipment, including armored vehicles, weapons systems and ammunition. Its latest achievement with the Skyranger 35 system expands Rheinmetall's product range and contributes to the provision of comprehensive solutions that meet the diverse needs of armed forces around the world. How ArmyInform reported, the German company Rheinmetall received an order from the Ukrainian government for the construction of a plant for the production of ammunition in Ukraine. It is also known that the Armed Forces have a number of names of military equipment from Rheinmetall: Marder BMPs, Wiesel vehicles, Puma and Lynx BMPs, Skynex anti-aircraft systems, Leopard tanks of various modifications.

The enemy spreads fakes about the disappearance of military personnel	Circulated reports claim that Ukrainian military personnel seem to be disappearing en masse, and their relatives cannot get any information about the fate of their loved ones. After verifying the information at the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Center for Countering Disinformation announced that the 152nd Brigade continues to perform combat tasks, and claims about her alleged disappearance are groundless.

According to him, the enemy does not limit itself in ammunition, but in terms of equipment, it uses one unit at a time to break through the positions of the Defense Forces. -They use everything from -loaves- and motorcycles to BMPs and tanks. This entire park of equipment is trying to bring at least a few infantrymen directly to our firing positions,- the officer said. He also noted that the enemy uses anti-aircraft missiles mainly in the rear areas, in populated areas, but rarely on the front line. -However, with them, he is trying to make it difficult for us to move both during the day and at night, randomly dropping aerial bombs for this purpose,- added Oleksiy Tarasenko.

The Medical Forces told how they are evacuating our defenders in Kurshchyna	reported this Commander of the Medical Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Anatoly Kazmirchuk.

Currently, only 2% of evacuations are by air, while more than 50% are by land. This experience gained during the war prompts international partners to think about alternatives to air evacuation. -As for the evacuation of the wounded from the area of ​​operations, in particular in the northern directions, such as the Kursk region, it takes place according to the same principles as in other areas of the front,- said the major general. According to the commander, Kurshchyna medical facilities do not provide assistance to Ukrainian wounded. -Medical assistance is provided at stabilization points deployed by the Medical Forces and medical services of the Armed Forces units.

Two residents of Kharkiv paid the man 10,000 hryvnias for escorting him to the border, bypassing checkpoints and patrols. Later, another woman from Kharkiv volunteered to drive compatriots to the state border in her own car for the same amount. After that, the -tourists- intended to cross the mountains to get to Romania along the route they bought from the main organizer of the scheme for $4,000. However, the movement of violators was constantly monitored by a joint interdepartmental group consisting of border guards, employees of the SBU and the National Police. Also, these persons were detained near the border. The man and woman who acted as guides face criminal liability under Article 332 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. Regarding their -clients-, administrative offense protocols have been drawn up. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces or recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/11/molodyky-kupyly-marshrut-cherez-gory-do-rumuniyi-ale-prykordonnyky-vyyavylys-na-krok-poperedu/	2024-10-11T08:12:28-07:00
Oleksandr Syrsky talked about the most difficult moment of the beginning of a large-scale war	This was spoke by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksandr Syrskyi. -This is the moment when Moschun was actually already partially occupied by units of Russian paratroopers-marines, and on the left bank of the Desna at that time there were about 200 units of enemy equipment ready to cross,- said Oleksandr Syrskyi. He added that the Ukrainian defenders saw that the enemy's equipment began to move towards Gostomel. -This moment was probably the most difficult that I remember,- said the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to him, at that time decisions were made on how to keep the capital. -And the understanding that we can win came a little later. When the battles took place on the Boryspil highway, when we defeated the column of the 6th tank regiment of the Russian Federation. Then the enemy lost about 30 pieces of equipment,- said the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/11/oleksandr-syrskyj-rozpoviv-pro-najvazhchyj-moment-pochatku-shyrokomasshtabnoyi-vijny/	2024-10-11T07:57:13-07:00
More rubles and propaganda: how Russia is replacing the huge losses of its army in Ukraine	reports this by the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the IOM. According to our intelligence, Moscow fears that the decision on general mobilization will exacerbate social tension and may lead to unwanted protests in large cities. In the summer and early fall of 2024, Kremlin technologists spread rumors that after the so-called -municipal elections- held on September 8, Russia would immediately announce a general mobilization. In this way, Putin's regime once again tested the mood of the Russian population and, obviously, their dynamics are not too satisfying for the leaders of the aggressor state. Therefore, the main factor that currently allows Russia to delay the decision on general mobilization will continue to be money. At the same time, the constant increase in initial payments for signing a contract, which in some regions of the Russian Federation already reaches several million rubles, shows that there are fewer and fewer people willing to die in the ranks of the occupying army. Another problem of the occupiers is the lack of so-called -ideological- soldiers among the masses. Therefore, special propaganda manuals are issued to recruits of the Russian army at recruitment points. In these papers for ideological processing, traditional stamps about -the vile West and the NATO bloc-, -denazification-, -one nation- and other propaganda delusions about -protecting Russia- during the war in Ukraine are given. According to Muscovites, the available financial resources will allow them to replace losses without general mobilization at least until the end of 2024.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/11/bilshe-rubliv-i-propagandy-yak-rosiya-zamishhuye-velychezni-vtraty-svoyeyi-armiyi-v-ukrayini/	2024-10-11T07:34:21-07:00

Digitization of medical services in the Armed Forces: how many soldiers undergo the VLK remotely	reported this commander of the Medical Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Anatoly Kazmirchuk. Thanks to the created medical information system, almost 70% of military personnel undergo a military medical examination (MMC) or a routine examination with a remote appointment to see a doctor.

-As long as I can hold a weapon, I will serve-: Sergeant Volodymyr on the destruction of 8 occupiers...	The story published operational command -North-. -They asked over the radio whether we have grenades. I answered that there is,- Sergeant Volodymyr recalls the battle. Together with their brother, they were at the observation post for the sixth day, when they heard from air reconnaissance that only a few tens of meters behind them, eight occupiers had already crowded into the grave. The usual tactic of the Russians, which they also use in their attempts to capture Toretsk, is to infiltrate in small groups, gather in one place, wait and attack the defenders' positions. -With the first grenade, I just knocked out the door to the cellar, then threw there. Then he climbed up and threw the control -efka- into the ventilation pipe. The bastards didn't scream, they just started randomly shooting from below - they probably wanted to hit me through the ceiling. But I was on such an adrenaline rush, I calmly jumped down, went to the entrance again and threw seven grenades at them again,- Volodymyr says. -They quickly hid in a small cellar. There was no greenery around to hide from the enemy's -eyes-, only charred tree trunks. There is no way to dig in. My shoulder blade was cut almost immediately. The hilt was broken by a fragment that passed through his hand,- Volodymyr rubs his scarred palm. — -I have penetrating wounds in my pelvis, shrapnel wounds in my hands, shoulders, and face. I relayed on the walkie-talkie that I would no longer be able to be on duty. They promised to change us at the first opportunity.- Volodymyr is currently undergoing rehabilitation in Chernihiv. It was from this city that he joined the army in May 2022. He worked at the enterprise -Sivertex-. In 2014-2015, Volodymyr already went through the trenches near Liman and Mariupol. He received the rank of sergeant during his military service. With the beginning of a full-scale invasion, he was in operational reserve. The company promised armor, but he decided to go to serve. He says that he has acquaintances who continue to hide from mobilization. and does not understand such a humiliating way of life in constant fear of people in uniform. After the expulsion of the occupiers from Chernihiv Oblast, he defended his native city from the -shaheeds- as a unit commander in mobile air defense groups. At the beginning of the summer of this year, their unit was seconded to the 32nd separate mechanized brigade fighting for Toretsk. — In Toretsk, the only thing that constantly flies are UAVs and FPVs. You won't chase them with a machine gun,' he smiles. — Even now, many people ask me why I am not demobilized due to injury. Can't wait. As long as I can hold a weapon, I will serve. Especially after Toretsk, I felt that this war is for a long time, because the enemy is not going to give us peace. And while there is at least some chance to stop it, it must be done. Sooner or later everyone will have to join. My main motivation is my family. While it is only a wife. And she's my best friend - she supports me in everything. We want children, but we must win first. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers are conducting assault actions in Toretsk, advanced and took hold on two neighboring streets to Tsentralnaya Street. The enemy also does not stop trying to break through our defenses in the area of ​​Chasovoy Yar	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/11/poky-mozhu-trymaty-zbroyu-budu-sluzhyty-serzhant-volodymyr-pro-znyshhennya-8-okupantiv-u-toreczku/	2024-10-11T04:22:08-07:00

A traitor who helped the Russians capture Bakhmut received life imprisonment	This was reported by the Prosecutor General's Office. Prosecutors proved that in May 2022, a resident of the city of Bakhmut voluntarily cooperated with a representative of the aggressor state.

The provided information contained the coordinates of the deployment locations of the personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the concentration of military equipment on the territory of the settlement. In addition, in accordance with the instructions of the Russian security officer, the agent sent him data on the location of objects of civil infrastructure, the communal sphere and the industrial sector. For his loyalty to the occupiers, the man hoped to receive the pseudo-position of -mayor of Sloviansk- from them in the future, about which he recorded a corresponding video on his phone.

Pavlo is from Transcarpathia, in the past he worked in the National Police, and after the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, he immediately came to the local military committee to defend the country. Although he participated in the Joint Forces Operation (JOF), he was refused mobilization several times due to lack of military service and military experience. However, Pavel's persistence prevailed, and he was mobilized to the Chopsky border detachment. After training, Pavlo joined the fighting in Chernihiv Oblast, and later — in Donetsk Oblast, where his unit defended near Bakhmut. The first time he was wounded during an assault, but quickly returned to the front. During the second trip to Donetsk region, the situation was even more difficult: the enemy constantly attacked, but the border guards firmly held their positions. Leaving the environment, Paul and his brothers walked through the burning forest, wetting their balaclavas with water to protect themselves from the fire and smoke. Later, Pavlo received the rank of officer during the defense in Vovchansk, but on the same day, he was blown up by a mine, wounding his arms and legs. He managed to warn his brothers about the danger, which saved their lives. After long-term treatment and rehabilitation, Pavlo plans to return to the front to continue the fight for Ukraine's independence. -We will fight until the end. For me, the war will end only when it ends on Ukraine's terms,- ​​Kardinal emphasizes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/11/palayuchyj-lis-i-bojovi-shramy-istoriya-dvichi-poranenogo-prykordonnyka-kardynala/	2024-10-11T03:44:20-07:00
Swedish -Drakars- for GUR soldiers: how scouts use SV-90 boats	told about their use in the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the MOU. The SV-90 boat is 14.9 meters long and 3.8 meters wide and can reach speeds of up to 43 knots. The capabilities of the boat allow you to transport four and a half tons of cargo or 21 landing fighters in full combat gear. The boat is equipped with firing points for machine guns and grenade launchers. If necessary, the boat can be armed with light anti-ship missiles, transport sea mines and depth charges. -Fighters-, named after Viking ships, are designed for amphibious operations, surveillance of the water area, patrolling and evacuation. They can also perform the role of fire support vessels. Ukrainian boat crews have undergone training in Sweden. -The advantages of this technique are that it is very fast, very maneuverable, very functional. With its help, you can perform various assigned tasks: both logistical - transportation of ammunition, people, various types of cargo, and patrolling. With a qualified crew, the boat can perform any given task,- said Serhiy, the commander of the amphibious assault boat -Drakar- of the -Viking- maritime center of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. He added that the -Drakar- armor is able to protect against bullets and debris. Also, an important advantage of the boat is a serious range of 300 nautical miles. Military ships handed over to Ukrainian scouts continue to perform tasks at sea.

More than 70% of wounded soldiers return to duty after treatment	This is reported by the Major General of the Medical Service told in his interview. This figure is a statistical average, but may vary depending on the direction of the front. Anatoly Kazmirchuk noted that these servicemen are the backbone of the Ukrainian defense forces. He also noted that, despite the active training of doctors, the need for them remains high. -The main reason is that combat medics are constantly on the front lines, performing the duties of both medics and ordinary combatants with weapons. Kazmirchuk emphasized that, although the Medical Forces are responsible for the training of medics, their subordination belongs to separate units of the Armed Forces, which deal with their equipment,- said Major General. As reported by ArmyInform, only about 10% of combat medics have a medical education, so priority in the combat zone is to save life, not treatment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/11/ponad-70-poranenyh-vijskovyh-povertayutsya-na-sluzhbu-pislya-likuvannya/	2024-10-11T03:21:47-07:00

The FSB agent tried to gather intelligence about the Armed Forces near the area of ​​the Kursk opera...	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. In order to carry out an enemy mission, the person involved went around the area, where with the help of a mobile phone, he secretly filmed the locations of military objects. The agent forwarded the received video files with location reference to his curator, whose identity was already established by the Security Service. Employees of the SBU identified the person involved in time, documented his criminal actions and detained him, preventing the transfer of intelligence to the enemy. At the same time, the SBU conducted comprehensive measures to secure the locations of the Defense Forces. As the investigation established, the young man was remotely recruited by the FSB in August of this year, when he was looking for quick money in Telegram channels. Instead of money from the FSB, he received suspicion from the investigators of the Security Service under Part 2 of Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The perpetrator is in custody. He faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property. The special operation was carried out by SBU employees in the Sumy region under the procedural guidance of the regional prosecutor's office.

the Russians mercilessly hit their own: the Armed Forces recorded destruction in Kurshchyna	Oleksiy Dmytrashkivskyi, the spokesman of the commandant's office of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Suzhi, informed the correspondent of ArmiyaInform about this. The spokesman said that the Russians are hitting residential buildings and civilian infrastructure where Ukrainian military personnel are not stationed at all. — The Russians are bombing regularly. If not in FPV, then artillery or anti-aircraft guns - all the time. Moreover, populated areas suffer. Suja suffers constantly, as a result of shelling and bombing, the area of ​​the industrial zone there has been completely destroyed. The day before yesterday we went there - in fact, there is not a single surviving house there, - said the soldier. The Russians are not only bombing Suja. Other settlements of the Kursk region are also under fire. — Everywhere, almost everywhere — regular shelling. At the same time, they do not spare their infrastructure and their citizens, and they have no pity for anyone. Moreover, they declare on all TV channels that the Kursk region should be demolished by carpet bombing. Both Russian bloggers and Russian politicians all say: -We will have to say goodbye to villages, fields, and forests. We will have to destroy them,- said Oleksiy Dmytrashkivskyi. Instead, representatives of the Defense Forces regularly help local civilians. — We definitely help, all kinds of help is provided. Yesterday, for example, our information group transported two people from Kozacha Lokna, whose houses were destroyed, and they were transferred to a boarding school. She is an elderly woman and a citizen of Moldova, the officer said. The military noted that representatives of the Defense Forces carefully record the crimes of Russian servicemen against the civilian population. Instead, local residents behave very strangely - they perceive the war as some kind of natural disaster and do not pay attention to the losses - they claim that everything is fine with them. — We film all these Russian crimes, the destruction caused by the Russian military. And the locals are worried, lamenting, but the strange thing is that the locals, as many as we interview, are doing well. There is no house, but they believe that they are all right. Very strange people, he said. He also noted that local residents are completely passive, do not have any civic position and are not ready to show social activity. — We surveyed approximately 500 respondents, and out of 500, only one person voted for Putin in the election, the rest did not vote at all. Everyone calls war -politics-, which in itself is very strange. And they seem to complain to the authorities that they are wronged there, that they have no salaries, nothing, no pension. But at the same time, they do not take any social activity in the life of their own country, - said Oleksiy Dmytrashkivskyi. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that inhabitants of Kurshchyna are provided with water, food and prepared for cold weather.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/11/rosiyany-bezzhalno-byut-po-svoyih-zsu-zafiksuvaly-rujnuvannya-na-kurshhyni/	2024-10-11T00:52:08-07:00
The new administration of the Ministry of Defense renewed the rights of more than 850 servicemen in ...	About this informs the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. In total, 965 appeals and requests were processed regarding non-payment of financial support and one-time benefits, issues of release from military service, providing information on documents for receiving benefits, etc. Specialists sent more than 500 requests and letters to various authorities, carried out 9 official inspections and 2 investigations. In some cases, signs of crimes were detected, which were reported to the relevant authorities. As Volodymyr Laguta, head of the Central Department for the Protection of the Rights of Servicemen of the Ministry of Defense, said, the team works with the main causes of rights violations, such as illegal actions of officials and commanders, gaps in legislation and legal ignorance of servicemen. The work is divided into three areas - the rights of servicemen, the rights of family members of servicemen and the issue of gender equality. Special attention is paid to problems of a systemic and mass nature or concerning discrimination based on gender. They may be subject to official inspections or official investigations. If necessary, management specialists prepare the necessary changes to legislation or conduct training events. In particular, a new procedure for submitting and considering reports was developed, which simplifies this procedure for military personnel, including through the Army+ application. In addition, the Internet space is constantly monitored in order to quickly detect violations that have not been reported to state authorities. -We understand that servicemen do not always contact the authorities directly, but information about the violation of their rights may appear on social networks from relatives or public organizations. Thanks to the monitoring of the Internet space in one of the brigades, we managed to detect a system violation and restore the rights of about 50 defenders,- said Volodymyr Laguta. Most management specialists have both combat experience and legal education, and a third have valid bar certificates. In fact, the Ministry of Defense has created an expertise center for the protection of the rights of servicemen and their families, which allows us to quickly respond to systemic violations and prevent their recurrence in the future.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/11/nove-upravlinnya-minoborony-ponovylo-prava-ponad-850-vijskovyh-za-pershi-chotyry-misyaczi-roboty/	2024-10-11T00:35:59-07:00

Closer to the stars and the goal: the manufacturer -Bayraktariv- diligently tests its unmanned fight...	As stated this well-known Turkish manufacturer of unmanned aerial platforms in Ukraine on his page on the X social network, during the first test of the third prototype in Kızılelma PT-3, the chassis was checked. The unmanned fighter aircraft successfully took off and landed, ArmyInform reports. - The take-off and landing tests were successful, - the message emphasizes. At the same time, Baykar did not reveal additional details about the progress of work on the Bayraktar Kizilelma PT-3 project. In turn, experts from IKK Defense Express reminded that work on this UAV as part of the MIUS program started back in the 2010s, while in 2021, data on the characteristics of this unmanned fighter was first made public. — In November 2022, Baykar's Kızılelma unmanned fighter jet began -runs- before its first flight, and in December of the same year, ahead of schedule, it took off from the ground for the first time. Since then, the first prototype has undergone a series of tests, and in April 2023, at the TEKNOFEST festival, it flew together with the F-16C fighter, defense market researchers from DE informed. As our editors reported at one time, Kızılelma is intended for operation, in particular, from the Turkish light aircraft carrier TCG Anadolu (L-400). This drone can use a wide range of weapons – air-to-air missiles, air-to-surface missiles, a number of different bombs, and more. So it can effectively be classified as an unmanned fighter, which can eventually act as a so-called -faithful follower- for manned aircraft. Its ability to carry a wide range of weapons makes this UAV a versatile combat platform for air and ground missions. As noted Baykar technical director Selcuk Bayraktar, the key advantage of the Kızılelma fighter is that it is unmanned Not having a pilot on board allows for high-risk missions where human losses would be unacceptable. — Losing a pilot is a defeat, so it is not always possible to take risks. But this does not apply to unmanned platforms. Since it is a robot plane, its loss is not that significant, explained the director. At the same time, the technical director of -Baykar Makine- on his page in the social network stated that the company the manufacturer will launch the serial production of Bayraktar Kızılelma, as those wishing to purchase these machines in the country have already applied for supply. One of the important advantages of Kızılelma is its ability to take off and land on ships with short runways, which greatly expands its operational capabilities. Moreover, it will be able to effectively counter air targets, which makes it an indispensable element in the defense system and offensive operations. Features of Bayraktar Kızılelma drone: Testing the prototype-3 of the Kızılelma unmanned fighter.

Fictional stories about the injured in social networks: what is important to know in order not to be...	You will immediately recognize one of these fakes: -three wounded soldiers lying unconscious in the hospital: Oleksii Dyomin, Viktor Glushko and Mykola Milekhin. Who knows their relatives, etc.- This -duck- may differ in names, the location of the hospital, and contain a request to -pass on groups, chats or personal contacts.- What do fakers do every time? Nothing fancy - they repackage the old candy in a new wrapper and again collect tens of thousands of distributions from sympathetic Ukrainians. All kinds of people spread these fakes. From students to retirees. That is, the level of education obviously does not play a role. Why do people continue to act on a fake that has been repeatedly debunked? First: the level of trust in the military and volunteers in society is quite high. Second, people want to help someone in need, even a stranger. Therefore, when they read that someone is in trouble, their minds are clouded - first they respond to the call, and then they check the information. Moreover, making a repost does not cost anything. What is important to know in order not to fall for such fakes? First, if the full names and surnames of servicemen are clearly indicated in the post, then their identities are established. In this case, their relatives are searched through registers and documents, not through Facebook. Secondly, in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, servicemen fill out several questionnaires, where the data of their relatives are indicated. Therefore, do not help the propagandists with your thoughtless sharing. Better to have someone think you are -unsympathetic- and -callous- than to be accused of working for the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/11/vygadani-istoriyi-pro-poranenyh-u-soczmerezhah-shho-vazhlyvo-znaty-aby-ne-vestysya/	2024-10-10T20:52:30-07:00
-Russians are afraid of my -Tyson--: how the Mechvod of the Armed Forces of Ukraine evacuated about ...	23-year-old Vladislav with the call sign -Tyson- is the driver of the M88 A1 tractor unit of the -Hercules- armored repair and evacuation vehicle. — Behind my shoulders are already about a thousand units of equipment evacuated from the battlefield. Sometimes we drive under fire in both directions. Then it is difficult&#8230; And when you return, you are glad that you left and got the car out, says the soldier. Has the rank of senior soldier. He has been serving in his military unit for three years - it is the evacuation group of the 145th repair and recovery regiment with the honorary name -Mykolaivskyi-. Its crew is included in the grouping of forces and means of logistical support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the basis of a combat order and is involved in an offensive operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in a separate direction. Vladyslav studied to be a turner. Then he went into conscript service, and in 2022, a large-scale war began. Signed a contract with the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Behind the back of the 23-year-old senior soldier are also battles in the Zaporozhye direction in 2023, including nine months of defense of Robotyny. — It was difficult in this direction. Swamp - in the belt. Many shells are flying, drop them&#8230; It was hard there. They evacuated all the equipment that was there: Bradley, BMP, tanks, Marder. Everything: both new and old, says the driver-mechanic. Tyson has been working on this machine for two months. The crew is a calculation of three full-time officials: the machine commander, the rigger, the driver-mechanic. The car, by the way, has the same call sign - -Tyson-, because the equipment is called by the same name as its driver. Vladyslav assesses its capabilities: it is heavier, has a more powerful engine, and larger armor. And this is important, since I have experienced the attack of enemy drones more than once. He says there was no direct hit, only from the side. — The Russians are afraid of my Tyson. They do not like foreign equipment at all&#8230; When I was driving the previous tractor, we had interceptions: when I was driving, the Russians said: -Everyone, hide in the trenches, BREM is coming,- Vladyslav recalls. While talking to journalists, the crew was just -rebooting- the goose after one of the combat missions, they were taking away the damaged equipment: Marder and Vincent. — Marder exploded on mine. It took 5 hours to evacuate two pieces of equipment, he says succinctly. To the question whether it was a complex logistical operation, the answer is not very much. - First - technical intelligence, then - the guys from REB lead us. The work is important, because the equipment must be retrieved, repaired, and then returned to the unit, returned to service. Vladyslav speaks succinctly about his role in the logistical support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: -It is necessary - it means it is necessary.- And that's it. I know the guys are waiting and I need to get them out of there. In the service, the main thing for me is the task to be done. If there is no work for us, then we are not needed here at all, says the soldier. And he adds: - Strength is in the team (people. - Ed.) and technology. The equipment must be serviced every time after departure: we check the undercarriage, oil, clean the filters, blow out dust, make sure that the gooseneck is not torn, etc. Sometimes, says Vladyslav, he dreams of combat operations, technology, war. At home in Kramatorsk, parents, sister, brother are waiting for the soldier. During the preparation of the ArmiyaInform material, it became known that the crew of the -Tyson- was damaged while performing another combat mission. Despite the concussion, the servicemen returned to the evacuation site, keeping the equipment, and are currently undergoing treatment. So we wish the crew a speedy recovery and return to duty.

As the French like to remind, it was their Mirage that became the only plane in the world that was confirmed to have shot down the invincible F-16 in air combat. ArmyInform has already written about this unique historical fight. Back in June 2024, the transfer of Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters to Ukraine brygady-ukrayinskoyi-armiyi/->announced French President Emmanuel Macron. French Minister of Defense Sebastien Lecornu, announcing the time of the transfer of fighters - as early as the first quarter of 2025. The head of the French defense ministry did not specify the number and modification of the aircraft, but noted that the transferred fighters will be equipped with new technical means for air-to-ground combat and electronic warfare protection. However, in the short post of the Minister of Defense of France, there is still information that allows us to reasonably assume what tasks the French Mirage 2000 will perform when repelling the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. The phrase -combat air-sol- used by the head of the French Ministry of Defense suggests that the main task of the Mirage 2000 multi-purpose fighters will be the task of striking ground targets. From a review of the noted mention of new technical equipment specifically for launching strikes from the air on the earth's surface, it can also be assumed which modification of the fighter-bomber will be transferred to Ukraine. Previously, the media, based on the statement of the President of France Emmanuel Macron, talked about the Mirage 2000-5 - a modernized export version of the aircraft. It is also possible that, in addition to it, Ukraine will receive an attack fighter-bomber of the Mirage 2000D modification, for which the task of striking ground targets is the main purpose. Taking into account these assumptions, it is worth taking a closer look at what kind of ammunition and in what way the -Frenchman- in the Ukrainian sky will be able to beat the Russian invaders on Ukrainian and Russian land. The use of the Mirage 2000 as a close air support aircraft, that is, as an attack aircraft directly above the battlefield, should be immediately rejected due to the high saturation of the theater of operations with enemy air defense (APD), including man-portable anti-aircraft missile systems (MANPADS). For the same reasons, the possibility of using the Mirage 2000 to drop aerial bombs in free fall should be ruled out. After all, in the event of an aircraft appearing directly above the line of battle or, even more so, in the enemy's rear at any depth, it will be a priority target for damage, which will be very difficult to avoid. Therefore, air-to-surface missiles and guided (corrected) gliding aerial bombs remain suitable for active use. The same goes for the F-16 Fighting Falcon, so all the considerations made for the Fighting Falcons are quite valid for the Mirages as well. However, with an important amendment on what kind of ammunition the Mirage 2000 will be able to use to strike ground targets. For the F-16, as of today, it may be primarily about the AGM-154 JSOW high-precision gliding guided bombs of medium range. In the case of the Mirage 2000, it is not known for sure what -standard- ammunition Ukraine will be able to get for it, or what air-to-ground missiles or aviation bombs the aircraft can be equipped with. Most likely, the plane can be -armed- with SCALP-EG cruise missiles and Hammer cruise bombs, which are already used by the Ukrainian military aviation. However, given the high compatibility of weapons, military equipment and ammunition of NATO member states, there may be other interesting options.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/11/mirazhi-letyat-shho-budut-robyt-pro-zavdannya-mirage-2000-v-ukrayini/	2024-10-10T20:30:15-07:00

In Toretsk, the occupiers captured the neighborhood of Central Street: the enemy is hitting civilian...	About the situation in Toretsk on the air of the -Edyny Novyny- marathon the spokeswoman of OTU told Luhansk- Major Anastasia Bobovnikova. — The enemy managed to seize the neighboring streets with Tsentralnaya Street, where they were advancing before. They succeeded in this by burning and destroying literally all the houses and shelters on these streets. Including for the enemy - they will have nowhere to hide either. But the command of the Russians with the loss of personnel does not count in any way. They simply fire into the city and then storm in small groups, she said. The spokeswoman spoke about the state of the city, the tactics and personnel of the occupier units that are conducting assault operations. — There is not a single surviving house left in Toretsk. At the moment, our defenders are holding back the offensive, but the enemy is pressing in with larger forces. They are also adding manpower to their forward positions and are constantly storming our defenders. First of all, against us are the personnel troops of the Russian army, they are staffed by contract workers. These are people who voluntarily signed the contract in one way, they deliberately came to destroy Ukraine, but I will say that they will not find anything good here, the spokeswoman said. Voyskova reported that evacuation from the city is extremely difficult, as the Russian military is targeting civilian vehicles. - Staying in the city is extremely dangerous. The Russians are wiping out the streets and evacuation is extremely difficult. The enemy uses artillery, and also uses FPV drones, with which they hit not only military, but also civilian vehicles. They are trying to destroy all the cars, so it is very difficult to escape from the city, the officer said. The spokeswoman also reported that fighting continues near New York and Chasovoy Yar, and in the area of ​​the latter, the dynamics of enemy assaults has somewhat decreased. — The situation has stabilized a little, although it still remains difficult. However, we believe that this is the calm before the storm and the enemy will not stop trying to break through our defenses in this direction, Anastasia Bobovnikova said. Earlier ArmyInform reported that in Toretsk, the enemy is pressing in mass: the Armed Forces spoke about the peculiarity of the tactics of the Russian command, and explained why civilians need to evacuate on time.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/10/u-toreczku-okupanty-zahopyly-susidni-z-czentralnoyu-vulyczi-vorog-bye-fpv-dronamy-po-czyvilnyh-avtivkah/	2024-10-10T11:52:32-07:00

Toretsk's experience: the Armed Forces explained why civilians need to evacuate on time	About the situation in Toretsk on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon the spokeswoman of OTU told Luhansk- Major Anastasia Bobovnikova. — The enemy does not care about the lives of civilians, does not care about the lives of the military, they do not care, they randomly fire at Toretsk, destroy it from the map. It is clear that civilians also die in such a struggle, she said. Instead, the Ukrainian military tries first of all to save civilians in any situation at the earliest opportunity and with the slightest consent. — We have to protect civilians and every civilian life is very important for the Ukrainian army, every death is a great tragedy. Therefore, the presence of the civilian population makes it difficult, first of all, to conduct hostilities, even morally, because you constantly have to look around to see if there are civilians in the house or not, the officer explained. She said that first of all the evacuation is done by the police of the special unit, but the military is always ready to come to their aid and do it at the earliest need. — Of course we help. Despite the fact that this is a police matter. First of all, evacuation is done, in particular, the -White Angel- unit, they also have the opportunity to go to places where heavy fighting is going on and evacuate the local population. However, if we have such an opportunity to help evacuate from such areas where there is no way to approach, of course we help, said the spokeswoman. Earlier ArmyInform reported that in Toretsk, the enemy is pressing in mass: the Armed Forces spoke about the peculiarity of the tactics of the Russian command.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/10/dosvid-toreczka-u-zsu-poyasnyly-chomu-czyvilnym-neobhidno-evakuyuvatysya-vchasno/	2024-10-10T11:21:29-07:00

About the situation in Toretsk on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon the spokeswoman of OTU told Luhansk- Major Anastasia Bobovnikova. — They suffer heavy losses, but are constantly replenishing manpower at the front. Unfortunately, the enemy is very strong against us. We are actively destroying the enemy's manpower. For example, an assault group of 5 people enters. Three of them don't survive anyway. One will be the three hundredth, one will run away somewhere. But there are a lot of them, that is, they are constantly storming and we are trying to fight them off, she said. The situation in the city is extremely complex and dynamic, on the eastern outskirts there are practically no buildings left in which to hold positions. — The situation is extremely dynamic. It's hard to say any specific numbers, because today it's one percent, tomorrow it's another. Today we conditionally defend one street, tomorrow we will recapture another street there, and therefore, in terms of interest, it is not worth focusing on this. However, the fighting is very dynamic on the eastern outskirts of the city, and there are almost no houses left to hold on to, the officer said. The spokeswoman explained what the Defense Forces needed to deter, stop and repulse the occupiers. - We need personnel, weapons, and ammunition for these weapons. We need everything. Give us all your weapons and we will win, because we have enough motivation and willpower, she said. The enemy strikes the city, including from a heavy TOS flamethrower system. Presumably, it is about TOS-1A -Solntsepok-. — They resort to this kind of weaponry, and I want to say that it is a very terrible weapon, it is prohibited by the Geneva Convention, because especially the use of this weapon on urban development, because it is not selective and the civilian population also suffers from it, in fact, very a terrible weapon, said the military. However, the Ukrainian military is conducting an effective counter-battery fight. The spokeswoman promised the enemy a decent retribution for the strikes on Toretsk with the TOS. -In addition, the counter-battery fight is working, we are hunting their artillery and very successfully, they lose artillery almost every day,- said Anastasia Bobovnikova.

Civilians as in a shooting range: in Kherson Oblast, Russians hit buses and shops with FPV drones	In detail about the terrorist actions of the invaders on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon told the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, Colonel Vladyslav Voloshin - Every day, the enemy fires virtually all settlements that are not far from the line of combat and, in particular, on the right bank of the Dnieper. All available weapons are used. There are FPV drone strikes, missile strikes, and multiple rocket launchers are used. Of course there is artillery, he said. The officer also reported on such an insidious type of ammunition as anti-personnel mines. Occupants can install them remotely and camouflage them to the elements of the terrain. - This is a rather insidious weapon, like mining these territories with PFM-1 mines - insidious anti-personnel mines with a plastic casing. They disguise them as stone elements, terrain elements, grass elements. These mines are very difficult to detect by means of demining and they do not have self-destructors. These mines cause significant damage to the local population, the military officer emphasized. The military officer also emphasized that the Russian military acts like typical terrorists, firing not only at the military, but also systematically terrorizing local civilians. — How the adversary conducts terror against the local population in the shooting range, using FPV drones on civilians, on shuttle buses, on civilian cars, on civilian buildings, even on shops - wherever he sees a crowd of people, he uses his own armament. This is typical terror, these are typical actions of a terrorist state that wants to destroy all Ukrainians and conducts its combat operations not against the Defense Forces of Ukraine, but against the civilian population, Vladyslav Voloshyn explained. The occupiers resort to the same insidious tactics not only in the Kherson region, but also along the entire line of combat. — The entire Right Bank and the Dnipropetrovsk region, in particular, the Nikopol, Marganets, Myriv territorial communities are also suffering from enemy shelling. In addition, the enemy uses more than 300 different kamikaze drones, guided munitions -Lancet- and others - about three dozen -Shaheed- drones every day in our operational zone, the spokesman added. The officer noted that such terror against the local population is terror against the local population, because the military is trying to counter such types of weapons. And civilians cannot do this, that is why the enemy simply attacks them, bringing trouble and death, - said the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kherson region Russia terrorizes local residents, there are dead and injured, and also informed about insidious Russian mining tactics using sticky dirty mines.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/10/po-czyvilnyh-yak-u-tyri-na-hersonshhyni-rosiyany-byut-fpv-dronamy-po-rejsovyh-avtobusah-ta-magazynah/	2024-10-10T08:27:55-07:00

The officer explained that this is part of the enemy's complex tactics, when he first wipes the city off the face of the earth and then goes on the offensive in small assault groups. — They approach comprehensively, they use artillery on the front line very actively, they try to destroy even our relatively rear cities with aviation, for example, Kostyantynivka constantly suffers from airstrikes. When they completely wipe out the city, they start small stormtroopers who already start storming and trying to break through our defenses. That is, there is a comprehensive approach here, she explained. Anastasia Bobovnikova emphasized that the occupiers do not count on their own losses or on the casualties among the civilian population. — The enemy does not count with the lives of civilians, does not count with the lives of the military. They don't care, they randomly shell Toretsk, destroy it from the map. It is clear that civilians also die in such a struggle, she said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the enemy is trying capture Toretsk, occupiers advanced along Tsentralnaya Street, there at times there are more than a thousand residents in the city: the enemy does not care about civilian casualties.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/10/vczililyh-budynkiv-na-shodi-toreczka-ne-lyshylos-vorog-vdaryv-z-vazhkoyi-vognemetnoyi-systemy/	2024-10-10T07:54:24-07:00

About this announced on October 10 the Chief of Communications of the Air Force Command Armed Forces Colonel Yuriy Ignat. -The enemy only damaged a few pieces of equipment, but did not destroy them. This is a war, in a war not only people are injured, but also equipment. Not only that, the same Patriot unit continues to perform tasks in the region,- said Yuriy Ignat. According to him, yesterday the Patriot air defense system conducted an anti-aircraft battle against a group of Russian ballistic missiles and managed to intercept some of them. -The Patriot system is one of the enemy's highest priority targets! Why? Because it is only thanks to this American air defense system that we keep Russian aircraft at a certain distance. Technologies in war are developing rapidly... The enemy is changing its tactics of application, using all available methods of conducting intelligence — from satellites and reconnaissance UAVs to ground agents, the enemy does not spare Iskanders, having information about the potential presence of the Patriot in one or another area, -said Yuriy Ignat. He reminded about the collection of mock-ups and declared their importance and necessity in these conditions of warfare. -The enemy often aims at mock-ups, but sometimes, unfortunately, it's real equipment,- Yuriy Ignat said. He reminded that Patriot is a stationary complex and structurally not intended for war in dynamics. -Only Ukrainians - soldiers of the anti-aircraft missile forces of the Air Force have tested and use this system in such conditions. When the situation on the battlefield changes rapidly, when the enemy uses dozens of reconnaissance systems, EW and air attack means - missiles and attack UAVs of various types. Patriot must survive in these conditions. Quickly change position, effectively camouflage, use a limited amount of equipment in the front-line zone, and at the same time, try to shoot down the Russian aircraft at a long distance. Or at least actively work on him, which will not allow him to get closer. These are the realities!-, Yuriy Ignat said. He criticized People's Deputy Maryana Bezugla, who spoke about the Russian attack on the Patriot air defense system. -Those who want to help, join! The army lacks experienced people of various professions, material and technical assistance. And those who pursue certain goals, want to promote themselves and get rich on the dirty hate of the military — don't forget about the boomerang effect!-, concluded Yuriy Ignat.

The military characterized the forces and resources accumulated by the Russian occupiers in this direction. — There is, of course, no large naval armored vehicles, but they have enough boats and various watercraft, there are enough light vehicles, such as motorcycles, buggies, ATVs, on which such assaults are carried out. Because these assaults quickly and easily overcome the distance between one and two trenches, between our front edge and the enemy's. They allow the personnel of these assault groups to be delivered as quickly as possible. Therefore, the main attention is paid to the provision of such vehicles and such equipment, Vladyslav Voloshyn said. He reported that during the last three days there were 5-7 enemy assaults in the Dnipro direction. — These are their efforts, but all these assaults for three days — there were already 5 to 7 assaults every day — they are trying to feel our defenses, where they could gain a foothold on which islands, create a bridgehead there, and from there already conduct their assault or coercive actions, - clarified the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV.

Almost 120 clashes at the front: Defense forces prevent the enemy from advancing deep into our terri...	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The invaders launched one missile attack on the territory of Ukraine, using three missiles, 58 airstrikes (dropped 104 anti-aircraft missiles), and also used 694 kamikaze drones. At the same time, the enemy fired 3,324 shots at the positions of our troops and settlements. On the Kharkiv direction, the occupiers attacked four times in the Vovchansk and Tykh regions. The settlements of Tsupivka, Liptsi and Slatine were bombed. Seventeen times the enemy stormed the positions of the Ukrainian military in the Kupyansk direction near Kucherivka, Petropavlivka, Stepova Novoselivka, Vyshnevo, Novoosynovo, Zeleny Gay and Kruglyakivka. Five clashes are still ongoing. The districts of Grekivka, Andriivka, Makiivka, Nevske, Katerynivka and Torske in the Lyman direction were attacked 18 times by Russian invaders. Defenders of Ukraine repelled 16 enemy attacks. Fighting continues near Druzhelyubivka and Novosadovo. The occupiers carried out seven assaults in the area of ​​Minkivka, Chasovoy Yar, Aleksandro-Shultyny, Bila Hora and Stupochki in the Kramatorsk direction. The situation is under the control of units of the Defense Forces. Toretsk direction: here, the aggressors attacked 11 times near Toretsk, Nelipivka, Shcherbinivka and Dilyivka with the support of aviation. The high intensity of hostilities continues in the Pokrovsky direction. The number of clashes has increased to 25. The invaders continue to attack our positions near Sukhoi Balka, Novotoretskyi, Myrolyubivka, Krutoy Yar, Promeny, Lysivka, Sukhoi Yar and Selidovoy. Our soldiers have stopped 23 attacks so far. The main effort is 13 assaults, the enemy has concentrated near Selidovoy, where two skirmishes are ongoing. In the Kurakhiv direction, the most combat clashes of varying intensity took place, as of this time, a total of 31 attempts to capture our positions were recorded, three of which are still ongoing. The occupiers most actively tried to advance in the districts of Hirnyka, Novoselidivka, Kurakhivka, Tsukuryny, Gostroy, Georgiivka, Kostyantynivka, Katerynivka, and Antonivka. Six times, the aggressor stormed the front edge of our defense in the Bogoyavlenka districts in the Vremivsk direction. Ukrainian soldiers stopped all attempts to dislodge them from their positions, in addition, the occupiers involved assault aircraft - they hit the settlement of Rozdolne with anti-aircraft guns. In the Dnieper direction four encroachments on the positions of our soldiers failed. The defense forces continue the operation in the Kursk region.

Third missile attack on a civilian vessel in four days: Russia claims six lives	This was reported by Oleg Kiper, the head of Odesa OVA. The enemy hit a civilian container ship under the flag of Panama. As a result of the enemy attack, unfortunately, six people died, 11 were injured, seven of them are in serious condition. All victims are citizens of Ukraine. They are currently being given all the help they need. This is the third attack on a civilian ship in the last four days. -The insidious enemy is trying to disrupt the work of the Ukrainian Grain Corridor, killing civilians and destroying infrastructure. Law enforcement agencies are documenting yet another crime committed by Russians,- Oleg Kiper noted. As reported by ArmiyaInform, russia attacked a second civilian ship that was in the ports of Odesa. Palau-flagged ship -OPTIMA- was damaged by a ballistic missile.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/10/tretya-raketna-ataka-na-czyvilne-sudno-za-chotyry-dni-rosiya-zabrala-zhyttya-shesty-lyudej/	2024-10-09T21:01:16-07:00
-Ramstein-: what to expect from the Defense Forces of Ukraine	The meeting was scheduled for October 12, but it was postponed due to a change in the plans of US President Joe Biden. A new meeting schedule of the Contact Group on the Defense of Ukraine should be prepared in the near future. What can the Defense Forces of Ukraine expect in the context of providing military-technical assistance and strengthening our capabilities in the war against Russia? Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmiyaInform about this: -The main goal of Ramstein is to discuss, synchronize and accelerate the provision of military aid, weapons and equipment to Ukraine.- In general, the Rammstein site, which includes more than 50 countries from all continents, is a unique phenomenon since the Second World War. Let me remind you that the anti-Hitler coalition was documented on January 1, 1942, and at the start it included only 26 countries. And in -Ramstein- from the very beginning there are more than 50. So, this site is actually an anti-Russian, anti-Putin coalition. As for funding, I can say that it will come from both NATO and the European Union. The needs of the Defense Forces have not changed strategically and will not change in the near future. Most likely, Ukraine will be offered everything that was already provided before. According to him, we are a unique country in terms of the range of weapons, because we have been provided with a whole range of the most diverse weapons. Nowhere is there such a number of the most diverse armored vehicles that are available in Ukraine. Take at least tanks: the Armed Forces of Ukraine use American Abrams, German Leopard 2, and British Challenger 2 tanks in battles. Plus a huge line of small arms, artillery systems, and air defense equipment. In addition, ATACMS and Storm Shadow long-range missiles. We already have F-16 planes. It is quite likely that there will be an increase in the number of weapons from partner countries. Petro Chernyk says that perhaps we will be provided with AGM-158 JASSM air-to-surface missiles, specifically for the F-16. There are already modifications of these missiles with a range of 900 km. These missiles can be used to destroy Russian military airfields and everything based there. The real breakthrough will be the transfer of American AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air guided missiles. The missiles can shoot down Russian Su-34s, carriers of guided aerial bombs, at a distance of up to 180 km. Army aviation helicopters may also appear. For example, the AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, which can carry up to 16 AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. These missiles are very effective, able to destroy any unit of enemy equipment at a distance of up to 12 km. Plus, we may have A-10 Thunderbolt attack aircraft. Aircraft have a wide array of weapons to destroy ground targets. Equipped with a 30 mm GAU-8 Avenger gun, ammunition - 1350 rounds. Quite effective weaponry, hits virtually any unit of military equipment: tanks, BMP, artillery installations. There is a nuance. The A-10 Thunderbolt attack aircraft operates at a distance of 3-4 km and can fall into the zone of damage of the enemy's short-range anti-aircraft systems. At Ramstein, our partners can agree on raising the level of production of artillery ammunition for the needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. Petro Chernyk says that at the beginning of the Great War, the Americans produced 14,000 shells of 155 caliber per month. And now it has been confirmed that by the fall, they reached the figure of 50,000 shells. Next year, they plan to reach 80,000 per month. A few numbers. The total stock of artillery ammunition of all calibers of the Russians at the beginning of the great war was 15 to 20 million, while the United States had only 2.5 million. In addition, at the beginning of the invasion, the Russians produced 125,000 artillery shells per month. Now the enemy managed to increase production by about 30%. It is about 170-180 thousand, no more. Because there are problems with gunpowder, aluminum powder, other explosive substances. If in 2022 the Russians had 5,400 regular artillery guns, the Americans had 1,000. One remark: the American military-industrial complex is almost 100% in private hands, not in state ownership. If they build a plant in the USA, they count on a decade ahead. How it should work, production facilities, staff training, technology, machine calibration, social security: pension, health care and the like. there will be more Russian mass strikes in the winter on critical objects of Ukraine. This is a possible scenario. Instead, the state should strengthen its air defense capabilities. It has already been announced that Ukraine will receive an additional Patriot air defense battery and missiles for these air defense systems from the United States. Romania also handed over the Patriot air defense system to us. The Patriot battery consists of 4-6 machines. Let's take at least 4 launchers, each launcher has 4 containers. We have 16 missiles at our disposal, which are guaranteed to shoot down Russian air targets. Plus, Germany will transfer 17 new IRIS-T systems to strengthen Ukraine's air defense. The IRIS-T complex has an impressive accuracy rate of almost 100 percent. There are many discussions in society and among experts about the advisability of using expensive Patriot missiles costing up to 3 million dollars on cheap -shaheeds-. I do not share this opinion. How to evaluate the life of a dead child? How many millions of dollars is it worth? And is it even worth it? Of course, no one has questions: when a Patriot shoots down an enemy Kh-47M2 -Kinzhal- missile worth more than $10 million, or, for example, an Kh-101 missile, the price of which is $13 million, - adds Petro Chernyk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/10/ramshtajn-chogo-ochikuvaty-sylam-oborony-ukrayiny/	2024-10-09T20:57:35-07:00
They were land-based, now they are sea-based: the expert told how the IRIS-T air defense systems kno...	The ArmiyaInform reporter asked a well-known weapons researcher about the details of innovations from the Diehl Defense company from Germany , doctor of historical sciences, professor of the department of humanitarian sciences of the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny Andriy Kharuk: — I will immediately note that the basis for expanding the areas of application of the IRIS-T air defense system is quite sufficient. The complex shows phenomenal performance: according to the information of the manufacturing company -Diel Defense-, from October 2022 to June 2024, in the sky of Ukraine, the IRIS-T air defense system hit more than 240 targets with 100% efficiency. That is, every missile fired hit the target! It is not surprising that the German firm is trying to take full advantage of this success to expand its presence in the global defense market. — So where did German engineers and designers from Diehl Defense direct their eyes? — Among the latest proposals is a -marinized- version of the IRIS-T SLM complex. I would like to note that this version of the rocket is different from the basic IRIS-T SLS. - And what exactly? - At least because the marine version has a transmission line for trajectory correction in the initial and middle sections of the flight, as well as an inertial navigation system with GPS signal correction. In addition, the diameter of the starting accelerator has been increased from 127 to 152 mm, and its length has also increased. Thanks to this, the maximum launch range has increased from 12 to 40 km, and the height of hitting targets has increased from 6-8 to 20 km. -Most of the world's leading arms manufacturers are not limited to the production of defense equipment only by enterprises, but most importantly - by the achievements of engineers within the territories of their own states. It seems that in the process, as you mentioned, -marinization- of IRIS&#8211;T was not without a kind of -internationalization- of this project? - -Diel Defense- company proposes to use IRIS-T SLM from Mk 41 vertical launch installations - American production. They are very widespread in the fleets of many countries, including the German one. Here it will have to compete with medium-range missiles already integrated with the Mk 41 - the American ESSM and the British CAMM-ER. -And having such serious rivals, the Germans were not afraid to enter the market with their offer? You can see it in the comparison table. - However, each of these missiles has its own winning points and, perhaps, certain caveats&#8230; - I said about the -dimensional- points of the German complex. But there is one -but-: the currently existing variants of the IRIS-T (including the SLM) have fixed wings and tail feathers. This means that the German rocket, unlike the American and British competitors, will not be able to be placed in -quadpacks- - that is, four rockets in one launch cell. Given the relatively small (compared to American ships) number of Mk 41 modules on European frigates, this shortcoming could become critical. —That is, the further prospects of the marine variant ofIRIS&#8211;T look ghostly? — I would not say so unambiguously. And here's why. -Deal Defense- is trying to beat it with its trump card: the infrared homing head of its missile, which may come in handy under conditions of active use of EW means by the enemy. However, in the future, IRIS-T developers will have to think about creating variants of the missile with a folding wing and a tail. — Regardless of the above-mentioned -internationalization- of the world market of defense equipment, the armed forces of each country still first of all follow the rule of -to each other to their own!-. — In the Bundesmarine, IRIS-T SLM missiles can enter the arsenal of frigates equipped with Mk 41 launchers - existing (project F124) and prospective (projects F126 and F127). They would complement the ESSM and SM-2MR missiles. The new frigates of the F125 project should be the first to receive the IRIS-T SLM. The German Navy received four such ships in 2019-2022. Their characteristic feature is underarmament: large ships (displacement 7,200 tons, length almost 150 m) carry only two short-range RAM air defense systems (in addition to artillery and anti-ship missiles). However, on these frigates, the project provided for a place to install the Mk 41 modules in the future (in front of the bow launcher of the RAM module). — But, it seems that there was an almost funny situation during the design?... And how did they get out of it? — It was really a mess! That space ended up being occupied by something far more desirable: a gym! So an alternative was proposed: a container version, where an eight-charge IRIS-T SLM launcher is located in a standard container. At the same time, in the starting position, the package of transport-launch containers is located horizontally, and in the combat position, it rises vertically. Two such containers can be installed on the F125. The integration of the IRIS-T SLM with this type of frigate is also simplified by the fact that the main sensor of the F125 is a Hensoldt TRS-4D radar, the same as in the land-based IRIS-T SLM complex (only the ship uses four fixed antennas, and in ground version - one rotary). The same containerized option was offered to Greece in the modernization package for MEKO 200HN frigates, but this project was not approved. — But plans are plans, but what is happening in practice? — True, at the moment the prospects for the maritime version of the IRIS-T SLM seem rather vague. Time will tell if it will be able to break into the market, pushing the competition. Still, I think Deal Defense has a good chance, given that the company is developing new IRIS-T options: IRIS-T SLХ with a range of 80 km and a range of 30 km and IRIS-T HYDEF (respectively , 100 and 50 km), aimed at combating hypersonic targets. -Marinization- of these options will allow Deal Defense to offer potential buyers a comprehensive solution - a multi-level sea-based air defense system.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/10/buly-suhoputnymy-staly-morskymy-ekspert-rozpoviv-yak-projshla-marynizacziya-vidomyh-u-zsu-zrk-iris-t/	2024-10-09T20:43:28-07:00
An old fake about -blocking accounts of dodgers-: who and why plays along with the Russian dezi	Such information recently began to spread again on dubious sites, Telegram channels and on TikTok. In fact, the hoax about blocking bank accounts and card dodgers has been around for a year. For the first time, he started -walking- on the Internet back in October of last year. Fake messages spread the word that if you don't show up on a summons, your bank account and card will be blocked instantly. There is a lot of discussion around the potential blocking of cards for men for not showing up at the Territorial Recruitment and Social Support Centers. In fact, this is just a lie that you want to click on and that plays along with the Russian desire to disrupt mobilization and show the collapse of Ukraine in general. How can it really be? After two disregards of the need to appear at the TCC, information is entered about the person that he is wanted. For further neglect of the duty against such a person, a report on an administrative offense will be drawn up and a fine will be imposed in the future. The decision on the imposition of a fine is transferred to the executive service for enforcement of the fine. In the framework of enforcement proceedings, if the violator does not pay the fine voluntarily, the enforcement service seizes bank accounts until the violator (if he does not appeal the decision to the court) pays the fine. The procedure is no different from the theoretical consequences of non-payment of other fines - for example, for traffic violations. Lawyers point out that there is no such term as -blocking cards of evaders- in Ukrainian legislation. Therefore, if you see a headline like -banks have started blocking card dodgers-, know that it's a fake. You can ignore or complain about this message.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/10/staryj-fejk-pro-blokuvannya-rahunkiv-uhylyantiv-hto-i-chomu-pidigraye-rosijskij-dezi/	2024-10-09T20:29:09-07:00

It became known how many military cars were detained	reported this on October 9 SBU spokesman Artem Dekhtyarenko. -Russian special services are behind all cases of arson. It is either the FSB or the GRU. Arson attacks, which are actually carried out with Russian money, with the money of the Russian special services, are actually carried out by ordinary Ukrainians. They call them simply disposable,- said Artem Dekhtyarenko. According to him, the Paliam should not hope for the money promised by the Russian curators. Often, when the arsonist sends the curator a video confirming the arson, the curator says that it was done poorly and asks to set fire to another car, saying that after that he will definitely pay. But they don't pay anyway. Then the pals risk receiving a long prison term for nothing. As reported by ArmyInform, up to 6 years of imprisonment a woman who set fire to a National Guardsman's car in Kirovohrad Oblast was sentenced.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/09/stalo-vidomo-skilky-paliyiv-avto-vijskovyh-vdalosya-zatrymaty/	2024-10-09T12:05:14-07:00

They chose between two dangers: why do Russian ships run between the base and the open sea	Why the enemy is forced to constantly take the ships out to the open sea and bring them back on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- explained Spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Captain 3rd Rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. — In principle, this is not the first time we have observed a similar situation. They are now at the base point, there were two submarine carriers left in the sea in the morning. Most likely, they are performing the task of guarding the base, there are no signs of preparations for a massive strike yet, he said. The spokesman explained why Russian ships must constantly move from the base to the sea and back. — As for the case of going out to sea, you see again that it is not the first time it has happened recently.

The military reported on a new insidious mine-disguising tactic used by the Russian occupiers. - In addition, the enemy began to resort to vile and insidious tactics. He just takes this plastic mine, this plastic case, applies glue and drops it in some dirt, in some dust, in some small stones. The mine takes on the appearance of a rock, the officer said. The Russians also wrap these mines in pieces of cloth or camouflage netting, making the mine look like a pile of trash or a dirty rag. The spokesman also said that the mines installed by the Russians are insidious also because they do not have a mandatory self-destruction mechanism. That is, they can wait for their victim for years and even decades. Such mines are scattered, including remotely, by means of artillery and aviation. Also, the Russians began to develop and practice demining by dropping from UAVs.

Revenge and propaganda: why the Russian military is hitting civilians with KABs	This was explained on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- the spokesman of OTU Kharkiv, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. — If we compare with the previous period, a few weeks ago, we are now observing an increase in the activity of the enemy's tactical aviation. He began to carry out airstrikes more often and increased the use of air defense systems. If not long ago we recorded 1-2 airstrikes using up to 5 air defense systems, now this number has increased. The enemy is already launching 5 or more airstrikes and 10 anti-aircraft missiles, the highest figure was 17, he said. The military explained what caused the Russian occupiers to intensify their use of guided aerial bombs. — We associate this with the fact that, firstly, the enemy suffered a tangible defeat by losing the Aggregate Plant in Vovchansk. Therefore, he tries to divert attention a little in this way by striking civilian objects, civilian infrastructure and passing it off as his small tactical victories in destroying the logistics facilities of the Defense Forces or striking the duty headquarters, according to him, with mercenaries or by NATO instructors, the spokesman said. It is obvious that such statements of the occupiers do not correspond to reality, because we all see that, in fact, Russian aerial bombs are exploding in high-rise residential buildings, educational institutions and hospitals. -We, of course, feel where these airstrikes are aimed, and we all know that the civilian infrastructure and civilians suffer from this,- Vitaliy Sarantsev stressed. He also said that among the tasks of using anti-aircraft guns by the Russians are po-harkivshhyni/->demonstration actions with the purpose of boasting the capabilities of Russian weapons and testing the technological innovations that the occupiers introduce into their newly manufactured aviation ammunition. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the occupiers are hitting the settlements of the Kharkiv region and the regional center with guided aerial bombs manufactured in September 2024.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/09/pomsta-ta-propaganda-navishho-rosijski-vijskovi-byut-kabamy-po-czyvilnyh/	2024-10-09T00:52:21-07:00

Tracked and struck: our soldiers showed how the -Hurricane- enemy became scrap	This is reported by the Defense Forces of Southern Ukraine. It is known that the 220-mm -Hurricane- rocket salvo fire system occupies a conditional intermediate position between the 122-mm -Hail- and the 300-mm -Smerch-. It was developed in the 1960s and 1970s and adopted for armament in 1975 with the aim of increasing the range of the USSR's rocket artillery. Compared to the Hail, which has an average firing range of about 20 km, the Uragan fires at 30-35 km and uses more powerful rockets with powerful warheads. As reported by ArmyInform, our aerial reconnaissance was able to track down a Russian automated military anti-aircraft missile complex -Osa-AKM-, which was later hit.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/09/uragan/	2024-10-08T23:24:39-07:00
Under the soil cover: the Russians are discussing the creation of specialized units of diggers	Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — This tactic is really used and it is not new for the enemy, he used it earlier in other areas. In particular, this was done in Avdiivka, he said. Enemy propagandists, who provide information support for the attack of the Russian Federation on the Ukrainian people and the state of Ukraine, even seriously discussed the need to create special engineering units. -In their publications, the enemy discussed that it is necessary to introduce engineering units into the assault units, which will be engaged in the construction of underground communications, the construction of underground communication passages,- said the soldier. At the same time, it is difficult to judge how massive the installation of underground communications by the enemy is in the urban development of Vovchansk. — At the same time, regarding Vovchansk, one cannot say about the mass of this phenomenon. But, nevertheless, there are locations where the enemy tries to move between buildings, creating small underground tunnels from basement to basement. In addition, those underground communications are used, which were used earlier simply as some kind of sewage corridors or corridors for ordinary signalmen, or heating lines. They also try to use them, the spokesman explained. At the same time, in case of detection of hidden actions of the enemy in the arrangement of underground communication routes, the engineering groups of the enemy are immediately inflicted with fire damage. — I cannot say now about the mass of the phenomenon, because it is quite difficult to monitor such actions of the enemy. In any case, if we manage to detect all of this, then a strike will be made at this location to stop the enemy's actions regarding covert movement and movement, Vitaliy Sarantsev said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the occupiers in the north of Kharkiv Oblast take into account the features of the relief and lay underground routes, however fighters of the Defense Forces dig out the enemy even from underground, destroying dozens of enemy shelters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/09/pid-pokrovom-gruntu-rosiyany-obgovoryuyut-stvorennya-speczializovanyh-pidrozdiliv-kopachiv/	2024-10-08T23:12:38-07:00

Not only kangaroos and koalas: ATLAS CCV ground combat drone was presented in Australia	The first assessments of the new BMP from the Australians can cause a smile: serious experts looking at the ATLAS CCV (an abbreviation for -autonomous tactical light armored system for joint combat-) say that both this and a number of other modern armored vehicles look as if they were copied from video games. However, this is where the jokes end, and defense market experts state: BAE Systems Australia has presented a new technological achievement in the field of unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) - autonomous tactical light armored vehicle (ATLAS) Collaborative Combat Variant (CCV), ArmyInform reports. The ATLAS Collaborative Combat Variant (CCV) was first unveiled at the Land Forces 2024 exhibition in Melbourne and is expected to be a key step forward in the integration of unmanned systems into modern military operations. This cabless light armored vehicle with an 8×8 wheelbase has been specially designed to operate both on-road and off-road, providing a high degree of autonomy in both cases. BMPs were created to complement manned vehicles, both combat vehicles and main battle tanks. At a much lower cost, it also offers high modularity and adaptability, meaning there is future-proof potential. The autonomous ATLAS Collaborative Combat Variant steering system allows the vehicle to overcome obstacles, plan routes and make tactical decisions in real-time, which significantly reduces the need for direct human intervention. This capability, integrated into a broader battle strategy, is expected to make the ATLAS CCV a potential key element in future wars in which autonomous, semi-autonomous and remotely manned systems work together to achieve traditional combat objectives. However, the main role of this machine is to perform mundane, inconvenient or dangerous tasks, such as reconnaissance in a hostile environment or transporting supplies through dangerous areas. In addition to its autonomous capabilities, the ATLAS CCV, which can fit in an ordinary 20-foot ISO container, is equipped with advanced weapons. The vehicle received the Vantage Automated System (ATS), a lightweight and highly automated medium-caliber turret system with a fully stabilized 25mm Bushmaster cannon. The latter is equipped with a double ammunition supply system, has access to 260 rounds and allows accurate and effective fire at a distance of up to 2.5 thousand m. It is equipped with a human-in-the-loop guidance system, which allows to carry out controlled interaction in combat situations. The turret is mounted in a turret that has a low profile to reduce the chance of being hit. But the gun will never fire itself automatically, because each shot requires the consent of the person remotely controlling it. It is equipped with a 360-degree multi-spectral automatic target detection, tracking and classification system, which includes day cameras, IR surveillance devices, acoustic sensors, passive EW, stereo vision and LIDAR. The chassis of the HMT armored car from Supacat served as the basis for the platform. The ATLAS CCV is equipped with a 6-cylinder 6.7-liter Cummins ISB diesel engine and an Allison 3000 automatic transmission. According to official information, BAE Systems worked closely with many industrial partners to create the ATLAS Collaborative Combat Variant. Namely: Supacat in UK/Australia, Valhalla Turrets in Slovenia and Australian engineering solutions developer Marand . This not only allowed for the integration of proven technologies, but also ensured that the ATLAS CCV would be specifically tailored to the needs of key users, including the Australian Army.

Wounded, 20 hours under rubble and a day in the field alone with drones: the story of serviceman And...	In 2015, the husband and his wife left their native Luhansk - he did not want to stay in the territory where lawlessness and chaos reigned, which embodies the -Russian peace-. Later, the family settled in Kyiv, where Andriy founded his own souvenir manufacturing business. However, in 2022, the war overtook the man in the capital as well... As soon as he received the summons for mobilization, he immediately arrived at the district TCC and SP: - I already ran away from the war once , having paid a high price — I have everything left in Luhansk! So this time I decided to join the ranks of the Armed Forces! - the man recalls. He went through training at the center, received his first officer rank, later he arrived in his unit, which was defending the front against the Russian horde in the Luhansk region, near Beilohorivka. On March 10, his first combat exit. Andriy mentions that the invaders then increased the number of attacks and the use of weapons against Ukrainian positions, and he connects this with the holding of illegal elections for the president of Moscow. — The military leadership of Russia needed to demonstrate at least some result of the so-called svo on the eve of the elections, that is why they pelted us with infantry meat, poisoned us with gas, burned -phosphorus-, used everything they had at their disposal... The officer says that it was about 150 meters from the espeshka, where he was with his comrades, to the enemy positions - the Russian orcs crawled relentlessly, and the Ukrainian machine gun did not stop even when it flew into the dugout at the position and buried one of Andrii's siblings. — I dug up my comrade, he was wounded and in a state of shock. Our ammunition remained under the rubble, as well as the body of another comrade. There was nothing left for us, except to -quench- the assault of the Russians, fire at them four machine-gun belts and all the ammunition for automatic weapons that we had available - which is more than twenty stores, and withdraw from the position. ... The first enemy fire killed the wounded man when his comrades tried to drag him to the evacuation point. The officer's upper limbs were cut off with rolling pins. While he was looking for a safe city where he could bandage his wounds, the second enemy shell, dropped from a drone, cut off Andrii's leg... — I understood that with such wounds I would hardly be able to reach the rear, but I he was saved by guys who were leaving from a nearby position: they tightened the turnstiles and dragged him to the evacuation point, Andrii recalls. In the dugout, medics helped the officer, tamped the wounds and bandaged them. The forces were given some food and water, chemical heaters that were placed in the hands of the wounded helped to improve blood circulation and warm up. ... The powerful impact of another Russian projectile almost destroyed the hiding place where the wounded soldier was waiting to be evacuated. Andriy found himself covered with earth at eye level, standing, because at the very moment of -arrival- he wanted to leave the shelter, as he understood that it might be destroyed. In the cold soil, the man had to spend about 20 hours... - I understood that it was necessary to do everything possible to breathe normally, since the clay around compressed the sternum, and this could lead to death In addition, there was a lot of earth in his mouth. I spat as much as possible, dug a kind of -crater- with my chin, began to move my body to free up some space around me. And all the time I thought about how terrible my death would be, whether my body would ever be found and what would be said to my family about my death... Andrii recalls that at some point due to pain from injuries, fatigue, hypothermia and the hopelessness of the situation, he decided to die simply by holding his breath. However, it was not so easy to do this - the man's body continued to fight for life... And these irresistible instincts gave the soldier strength. He started calling for help! The officer's brothers, having heard that there was someone alive under the rubble, freed him from the earthen -homeland- - it took about 6 hours. However, they could not evacuate to a safer place for a long time - enemy -birds- were constantly -hanging- over the position. On the third day after the injury, at 7 o'clock in the morning, Andrii was sent to the rear. Due to blood loss, hypothermia, and stress, the man's health deteriorated rapidly. But even here fate was not on the side of the military. - Due to the powerful shelling directed at us by the orcs, the comrades who tried to take me to the rear were forced to leave me in the field. I was once again alone with the earth and the sky. However, I understood that I needed to hold out until dark and they would come after me. All I could do then was lay on the stretcher and wait. At that moment, the strength left my body. And I really wanted to drink - I was ready to give my life for a sip of water. In the afternoon, when the morning spring sun rose, it became a little easier - the wounded man warmed up. But the sun on the battlefield immediately became an enemy - lying in the open area in the light of day, the Ukrainian military became a target for Russian drones. Fortunately, no one was -interested- in them&#8230; - Apparently, the orcs thought that I had no chance of life. Or they wanted to use it as bait for the evacuation group, - Andrii shares his thoughts. With the onset of darkness, the Ukrainian officer's comrades returned. It was an extremely difficult way back from the front - the wounded man had to be carried for several kilometers while several enemy -birds- chased the group. And then, in the morning, in a battered car with punctured wheels, they rushed at crazy speed under shelling along a road completely destroyed. — When they carried me in their arms, I fainted from the pain, and the boys only encouraged: -you're only alive, you've endured so much, now it will be a shame to die-... ... Andrei has several operations and long-term rehabilitation behind him. Unfortunately, due to a long stay underground and nerve damage, partial paralysis of the limbs developed. However, he is still grateful to fate that he survived. — After what I have experienced, I am grateful to higher forces for every day of my life. I am grateful that I met fellow citizens for whom human life is the highest value and for which they are ready to fight, despite shelling, drones and other difficult circumstances! And I am grateful to each of them, although I do not remember their names...	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/09/poranennya-20-godyn-pid-zavalamy-i-den-u-poli-naodynczi-z-dronamy-istoriya-vijskovosluzhbovczya-andriya/	2024-10-08T20:38:10-07:00
Fakes about evaders: fake -lawyers- disperse -treason-, real ones - refute	For example, one fake -lawyer- assures that subpoenas will allegedly not be sent to evaders and those who have fled across the border. That the mobilization will apparently concern only those who updated their data on time and remained in Ukraine. It is clear that this is delusional. After all, for violating the rules of military registration, regardless of the place of stay of a conscript, administrative responsibility is provided. And for evading mobilization, criminal charges are also possible. Therefore, it is not necessary to tempt fate - it is necessary to obey the Law. Other so-called -human rights defenders- argue that an unborn third child already gives the right to a postponement and travel abroad, because, they say, it is a -living embryo-, -living soul-, etc. In fact, the law clearly states: -Conscript women and men who have three or more children under the age of 18 are not eligible for military service during mobilization.- So, for the postponement and successful departure abroad in this case, two mandatory conditions are required: There are no exceptions. Therefore, you should not believe the fakes that if you have a third child in November 2022, it -does not count.- That is, if a woman became pregnant after February 24, 2022, then this is allegedly done on purpose to avoid mobilization. Such messages, which also abound on the Internet, are insidious manipulations that have nothing to do with the law. It is not necessary to believe everything that is published in messengers. It is better to always think critically and look at the text of the law one more time, lawyers advise.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/09/fejky-pro-uhylyantiv-falshyvi-advokaty-rozganyayut-zradu-spravzhni-sprostovuyut/	2024-10-08T20:30:47-07:00
Make it to the swamp: in the East, the enemy has intensified the use of armored vehicles	The spokesman of the National Guard of Ukraine, Ruslan Muzychuk, told about this on the live broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- telethon. — As noted even by our servicemen who perform tasks in different directions, now the enemy is trying to use armored vehicles more often. This, first of all, is also facilitated by weather conditions. Of course, the situation may change in a few weeks. The condition of the soils may not allow the use of heavy machinery that cannot essentially advance, he said. So far, the weather favors the use of armored vehicles, because the roads have not yet had time to get wet. - Currently, the main obstacle to the use of enemy armored vehicles is the work of our drones, which destroy this equipment in advance. She does not even get to the point of opening fire on the positions. And the second is the actions that our servicemen perform with the aim of demining the terrain and possible approaches, possible enemy advance routes, the spokesman said. Thanks to these actions, it is possible to effectively stop the attempts of enemy mechanized assaults. — This was the case, for example, a few weeks ago in Kharkiv Oblast. A similar situation took place in the Pokrovsky direction, where last week our guardsmen also destroyed advancing tanks, as well as armored personnel carriers and BMPs, the guardsman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Sylah defense told about the attempts of enemy troops to capture Toretsk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/vstygnuty-do-bagnyshha-na-shodi-vorog-aktyvizuvav-zastosuvannya-bronetehniky/	2024-10-08T12:07:17-07:00
Britain announced sanctions against the Russian Federation for the use of chemical weapons against U...	This is stated in a statement at British government website. It is about the use on the battlefield of chloropicrin, a substance that the International Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) qualifies as a chemical weapon. The list of sanctions includes the radiological, chemical and biological defense forces of the Russian armed forces and their commander Igor Kirilov, who is directly accused of involvement in the use of chemical weapons and the dissemination of disinformation. Also included in the list are the 27th and 33rd research centers of the Ministry of Defense of Russia. The British government claims that these centers are involved in the development of chemical and biological weapons. -We will not allow such flagrant violations of the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the international order to go unpunished. The UK is aggressively prosecuting those responsible for these horrific chemical attacks in Ukraine. Our support for Ukraine is unwavering and will continue for as long as it takes,- said Defense Minister John Geely.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/brytaniya-ogolosyla-sankcziyi-proty-rf-za-zastosuvannya-himichnoyi-zbroyi-proty-ukrayiny/	2024-10-08T11:57:58-07:00
Hand-to-hand! Our fighter had to fight a Russian attack aircraft in an invisibility cloak	The video of this amazing duel was released on October 8. the Russian was walking towards our positions in full height and thanks to the poncho, he was noticed by our aerial scouts only at the last moment. Meanwhile, the occupier went into the trench for some reason and moved forward. I met our soldier on the way. A fight broke out between him. At some point, our soldier was able to jump away from the invader and shoot him with a machine gun. What exactly prompted the Russian to such a desperate attack is unknown. According to one of the versions, the occupier was under the influence of substances, which is why he went without hiding. Anyway, it's good that this duel ended in our favor. (careful, profanity!) As reported by ArmyInform, our drone created the occupant stuck in the window, jet thrust.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/v-rukopashnu-nashomu-bijczyu-dovelosya-bytysya-z-rosijskym-shturmovykom-u-plashhi-nevydymczi/	2024-10-08T11:42:45-07:00

Soldiers who voluntarily left their units for the first time began to return to the front instead of...	About the news about the fighters in the SZCH -chastini-zamist-uvyaznennya-pochali-povertatis-na-front-video->reported on October 8 State Bureau of Investigation. According to his data, at the end of September 2024, the Novomoskovsk City District Court of the Dnipropetrovsk Region decided not to imprison a serviceman who, in December 2023, left the location of a military unit stationed in the Dnipropetrovsk Region without appropriate orders. In the course of the pre-trial investigation of the criminal proceedings, the SBI investigators established the location of the military man and detained him. The man was informed of suspicion for voluntarily leaving a military unit under martial law (Part 5 of Article 407 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). During the trial, the serviceman filed a motion to release him from responsibility due to his desire to continue his military service in one of the units, the commander of which gave his consent to enlistment. On the basis of Part 5 of Art. 401 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, the court decided to release the military man from criminal liability. In addition, on October 2, 2024, the Bilyaevsky District Court of Odesa Region and the Naval District Court of Mykolaiv acquitted two servicemen of one of the mechanized brigades from criminal liability. One of them left the place of service in November 2022, the other in January 2024, during the deployment of their unit in the Vinnytsia region. On October 7, the Saratsky District Court of the Odesa Region passed a similar verdict against the deputy company commander of another military unit, who left his post in December 2024, also during deployment in Vinnytsia Region. The law enforcement officers detained the soldiers. Since the military left the place of service for the first time and voluntarily decided to continue serving, they, on the basis of part 5 of Art. 401 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine was released from custody. The leadership of one of the military brigades agreed to take these people into service, so they will continue to protect the country as part of this military unit. The DBR emphasizes that voluntarily leaving a military unit or a place of service, without valid reasons, committed in a combat environment, is punishable by imprisonment for up to 10 years. Therefore, those who first got into such a situation have a chance to return to the ranks, help their brothers defend the country and continue to live without remorse and conflicts with the Law. ArmyInform explained about SZH and desertion: how to return to the service and not sit behind bars.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/odyn-raz-ne-szch-vijskovi-yaki-vpershe-samovilno-zalyshyly-svoyi-chastyny-zamist-uvyaznennya-pochaly-povertatys-na-front/	2024-10-08T11:09:47-07:00
Becoming a military chaplain: how long must the mandate last before entering into a contract	This is reported by the correspondent of ArmiyaInform. The mandate for the right to carry out military chaplaincy activities is issued by the State Service of Ukraine for Ethnopolitics and Freedom of Conscience (DESS). The right to carry out military chaplaincy activities is terminated by revocation of the mandate of the DESS. Currently, one of the grounds for revocation of the mandate is the failure to conclude a contract for military service at the positions of the Military Chaplaincy Service within three months from the date of issuance of the mandate. However, there are not rare cases when persons who have received a mandate, for objective reasons, do not have time to conclude a contract for military service in the positions of the Military Chaplaincy Service. In view of this, the Interfaith Council on Military Chaplaincy Issues under the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine proposed to extend the term of the mandate before concluding a contract to six months. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that at the Interconfessional Council under the Ministry of Defense discussed the need to standardize and differentiate the terminological definitions of -military chaplain-, -chaplain- and -volunteer chaplain-, and that the council decided submit a proposal on charging additional payments to chaplains who are in the war zone.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/staty-vijskovym-kapelanom-skilky-maye-tryvaty-diya-mandata-do-ukladannya-kontraktu/	2024-10-08T10:52:04-07:00
Blatant sloppiness and a bit of luck: the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported the details o...	Captain 3 rank Dmytro Pletenchuk, spokesman for the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, reported the details of the destruction of -Moscow- on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni-. - It was one of those operations that actually took place in a fairly short time. I can't say that we didn't prepare for it, so it's such a synergy - a little bit of luck, a lot of preparation and, accordingly, calculation. This is how virtually the entire vertical of our Naval Forces worked, he said. The military informed about the duration and details of the operation. — The operation itself lasted a little more than an hour. It should be noted here that in fact both target detection and destruction took place at the expense of the Coastal Missile Artillery Forces of the Naval Forces with the approval of the next vertical headquarters. Having received the appropriate permission, we inflicted the appropriate fire damage, the spokesman said. Separately, the officer emphasized that it was Ukrainian weapons that managed to destroy the enemy cruiser. — What is important is the case that all this was done due to the use of Ukrainian weapons systems. This became a landmark event, because this complex was developed precisely for this purpose. This was not the first successful use of it - even before that, one of the frigates, carriers of cruise missiles and Kalibr, had the opportunity to meet the Ukrainian Neptune in the Black Sea, after which it went for repairs, Dmytro Pletenchuk emphasized. He said that for the enemy, the attack of Ukrainian missiles was a surprise for which he was not prepared. — Among the interesting details, I can note that, in fact, to some extent, it became unexpected for the enemy. It can be noted that when I talk about character, it can be attributed to Russian sloppiness, arrogance. For which, as a result, they paid quite dearly, said the spokesman of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Dmytro Pletenchuk said that the cruiser -Moscow- had three echelons of air defense, but due to Russian carelessness and self-confidence, this did not help. — The cruiser actually had three echelons of air defense. One gets the impression that two of them were simply empty, i.e. there were no corresponding servicemen at the posts. Nevertheless, the fact is that the standard weapons on this ship are more than enough to repel air attacks. Let me remind you, there are 3 types of these long-range weapons, it is an analogue of C- 300, the medium one is the -wasp- and the close one - there are also suitable installations that can cut down targets moving quite quickly in the air with dense machine gun fire, they did not work, the military said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported what the Kremlin is afraid of .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/krychushhe-nehlyujstvo-ta-dribka-udachi-u-vms-zsu-povidomyly-podrobyczi-znyshhennya-moskvy/	2024-10-08T10:44:13-07:00
The Defense Forces spoke about the attempts of enemy troops to capture Toretsk	The spokesman of the National Guard of Ukraine, Ruslan Muzychuk, told about this on the live broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- telethon. — In the Toretsk direction, the enemy is trying to carry out assault actions, trying to increase the -gray zone- around the city of Toretsk itself and settlements. In particular, these are attempts to take under fire control logistical routes and those areas through which the enemy is trying to advance, in particular near the settlement of New York and is trying to advance near the settlement of Nelipivka, he said. In addition, the occupiers are trying to take under fire control logistical routes near Toretsk itself, thus expanding the so-called -gray zone-. Attempts of enemy offensive actions are stopped by units of the Defense Forces, in particular, the 12th Azov Special Purpose Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine. During the assaults, the occupiers try both to act in small infantry groups and to use armored vehicles. Those infantry groups that the enemy sends for assaults are destroyed. Now we can see that in some places the enemy is also trying to attract armored vehicles to support these assaults. In particular, last week, both in the Pokrovsky and Toretsk directions, the National Guard soldiers destroyed more than 10 units of various armored vehicles, which the enemy tried to use to strengthen their assaults. These are, in particular, tanks. The T-72 tank was destroyed. It is also an armored personnel carrier that the enemy uses both for fire support and for transporting personnel, said the spokesman of the National Guard of Ukraine. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Russians have entered the eastern outskirts of Toretsk, there are battles in the city for every entrance.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-pro-sproby-vorozhyh-vijsk-ohopyty-toreczk/	2024-10-08T10:33:37-07:00
Two dead and five wounded: the consequences of the Russian air raids on Kharkiv and its suburbs	This was reported by the Prosecutor General's Office.

The President: Drones, EW and the missile program are priority areas for the Defense Forces	President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said about this in his evening address. According to him, today the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, General Oleksandr Syrsky, reported on the needs of the army, and the government officials on those opportunities that have already been implemented and that can be provided during this year. This applies both to our current needs and to the planned supply for the next year. The priority is the maximum development of the domestic sector, domestic production, and therefore all private initiatives, all forces of Ukrainian entrepreneurship, which is already working and can work even more for the sake of defense. Among the identified key areas are drones for our military, and this must be such a supply that not only constantly increases in volume, but also evolves, develops according to the needs of war. Production must quickly adapt to the needs of the front and to the new possibilities of using the weapons available to us. Another fundamental direction is EW, and here the private sector, Ukrainian entrepreneurs are already significantly helping Ukraine. -And it can be much more. We will also attract additional investments from partners, and this week, in particular, there will be work on this,- the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized that special emphasis is placed on the development of the state missile program. -And in all its elements, in all missile achievements of Ukraine, there should be much more combat implementation both on the front and on the territory of Russia. The result is needed faster. All relevant tasks are now being implemented,- he said.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/prezydent-drony-reb-i-raketna-programa-priorytetni-napryamky-dlya-syl-oborony/	2024-10-08T10:08:53-07:00

Anti-aircraft guns -from wheels-: when were the aerial bombs used by the Russians to hit the Kharkiv...	What this indicates and what the enemy is trying to achieve through the massive use of anti-aircraft missiles, told spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. — The trend of using CABs has increased. If last weeks we tracked up to five airstrikes with the use of three to four, or sometimes seven anti-aircraft missiles, now this number has increased. The enemy began to carry out more airstrikes, began to use a larger number of anti-aircraft missiles. This shows that he has not abandoned the use of tactical aviation, he said. The officer noted that the intensity of the use of this aviation ammunition is such that the enemy is forced to use newly manufactured bombs. — The intensity of use of this type of weapons is such that its production actually works -from wheels-. We have information that he is using against us the ammunition that was produced at his factories just a few days ago. Literally in September they were made and already now they got to the front, already now he started using them, the spokesman said. The military explained what this indicates. - This indicates that he has exhausted his old stocks and his logistics are starting to work, his production is simply -from wheels- supplying all this ammunition to the front, - remarked Vitaly Sarantsev. He reminded what purpose and objective the enemy is using this munition. - One of the options is demonstration actions. The opponent is trying to show that he has it in his arsenal, that he can use it. The second task is to demoralize personnel who simply see this application. In this way, the enemy is trying to psychologically influence units of the Defense Forces, he explained. In addition, perhaps the most despicable task of using anti-aircraft guns is testing ammunition in combat conditions by bombing Ukrainian cities and at the cost of Ukrainian lives. -It's also an element of the test,- said the soldier. — The adversary does not stand still, he tests his ammunition, tries to monitor all the effects of their use, taking into account all factors - that is, weather conditions, times of the day, seasons, humidity, and so on. He has turned the entire front line into a testing ground where he tries to use his designs on us, both the military and the civilian population. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the enemy hit KAB for a residential building in Kharkiv. There are deads.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/kaby-z-kolis-koly-vygotovleni-aviabomby-yakymy-rosiyany-byut-po-harkivshhyni/	2024-10-08T09:58:20-07:00

When we found out we hit it, it was euphoric! — the operator of the Patriot air defense system Vikto...	The conversation with Viktor took place on October 8 at the Yedyni Novyni telethon. According to Victor, his unit showed great results in the destruction of various targets even on the S-300. -These are Su-34, Su-35, K-52 and Mi-8 helicopters, as well as Kalibr cruise missiles. Later, Shahed UAVs were added to the list. Due to the fact that our unit was so effective, the command chose us for training on the latest technology of a foreign model. This was the Patriot air defense system. At that time, we did not have a choice between different foreign air defense systems, but I am very pleased that the choice fell on us and it was the Patriot system, because we have been dreaming about this system for a long time, - said Viktor. The training lasted 3 months, although the program itself was designed for 9 months in America. -But due to the fact that we had experience working with such systems, although not so perfect, plus combat experience and our motivation - all this gave its result. That's why we learned in three months. We could have done it faster if our partners had allowed us to do it, but we had to work it all out for at least 3 months,- Viktor recalled. According to him, the first downing of the Russian -dagger- took place on May 4, 2023. -I did not take part in this operation, but my colleagues who took part in this operation were shocked at how quickly it happened. They did not even understand how quickly it happened, because we did not expect it. Then the analysis began and we didn't know what we hit at the time. When we found out what we hit, it was euphoric. We knew we were already in history. Because no one has done this before us. Of course it was cool. The second operation was on May 16, when there was a massive combined attack, very difficult. We also did not expect it, but during the attack we shot down six -Kinzhal- aeroballistic missiles and ten -Iskander-M-. That's how we showed the results then,- Viktor said. He recalls that his team had no room for error. -We could not do otherwise, because we did not know where these rockets were flying. Because Kyiv is the decision-making center, it is various state institutions and critical infrastructure. Therefore, we had no right to make a mistake. Adrenaline probably lasted another day. It was all running through my head, whether we did everything right or whether it was all done correctly,- Viktor is still worried. He also warned against overly victorious moods. -The enemy is constantly learning, constantly improving his means of air attack, he is constantly analyzing, he takes all these mistakes into account in new attacks. He also analyzes our social networks a lot. That is, what our statesmen, the media, various public organizations that have some information say, they analyze it all and then take it into account in the next attacks. Therefore, information hygiene is very important in this matter,- Viktor noted. According to him, it is important not to stop the work of air defense and not to give the enemy any information about it. -The enemy now, in addition to relatively expensive Shaheds, the price of which, of course, is not the same as that of the Dagger, began to use UAVs of barn production. But I, as an operator, see only targets on the indicator. Targets with parameters. For me, it makes no difference whether it is -shahed- or not. By parameters, they can be the same. Although one can be combat, and the other is generally just plywood with a motor,- Viktor said. According to him, the change of Patriot operators lasts 4 hours. But if there is combat work, the shift can be 6 hours or 8 hours. It all depends on the situation at hand. Victor lovingly talks about his air defense system. -This is a very highly intelligent machine. This is the first. Secondly, this complex was able to achieve what we could not achieve with the S-300, which is the shooting down of ballistic missiles. It is the dream of every air defenseman to grow to such heights. My dream has come true and I am very happy about it!-, Viktor assured. As reported by ArmyInform, the USA provides additional battery Patriot and winged aerial bombs.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/koly-my-diznalysya-shho-zbyly-cze-bula-ejforiya-operator-zrk-patriot-viktor-pro-zbyttya-rosijskogo-kyndzhala/	2024-10-08T09:42:13-07:00
Holes, cracks and communication passages: in the Kharkiv region, the enemy is dug out from under the...	About what the underground shelters and communication routes of the occupiers are and how the Ukrainian military destroys them on the broadcast of the marathon -Social News- said the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, Colonel Vitaliy Sarantsev. — This situation is really observed in those areas where the enemy is not conducting active assault actions, but has gone on the defensive. There, of course, he tries to dig in as much as possible - he digs holes, digs communication passages, makes closed gaps, and he does this in our direction as well, he said. However, the Defense Forces are actively and effectively countering the -worm tactics- of the Russian occupiers, destroying several enemy shelters at a time. -We report the destruction of shelters every day, that is, we destroy several dozen enemy dugouts, trenches, blocked gaps, sometimes together with the enemy, thanks to our artillery or thanks to FPV drones,- the spokesman assured. He explained that in different parts of the Kharkiv direction, the occupiers resort to the -mole method- in different ways and for different purposes - for shelter or for movement. — If we talk about advancement, then such a story takes place in Vovchansk, where the enemy finds houses located not far from each other. They simply break through the lines of communication between them for further safe and hidden movement. That is, from basement to basement, they can dig a tunnel and move in small groups to small sections of the terrain, the military explained. However, such actions of the enemy are possible only within the limits of dense urban development. It is almost impossible to resort to them in the territories of villages, moreover, such a method is completely unsuitable for the open space between forest plantations. - As for other destinations, where the territory is more open, it simply digs holes to hide from FPV drones. At the same time, in defensive actions, he can inflict damage on us from there, the spokesman said. At the same time, of course, the enemy arranges communication routes between such shelters, which can also be either completely underground or significantly buried. — He excavates side entrances, makes trenches, connections between these norms. That is, he works quite actively in this direction and is quite actively digging in, the spokesman said. However, the enemy can set up underground shelters and communications only if he is not detected by the Ukrainian military. - Of course, in those moments when he manages to do this, when he remains unnoticed by our intelligence tools. If it is placed, then in most cases the enemy is doomed, Vitaliy Sarantsev emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the occupiers in the north of Kharkiv Oblast take into account the features of the relief and lay underground routes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/nory-shhilyny-ta-hody-spoluchennya-na-harkivshhyni-voroga-vykolupuyut-z-pid-zemli/	2024-10-08T09:26:22-07:00

The suspects valued $8,000 for assistance in helping them to leave Ukraine without hindrance, and the volunteer certificate cost the evaders 500 euros.

Veteran's certificate in action instead of a paper one: the Council supported changes to the legisla...	Today the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted relevant changes to the current legislation. From now on, the status of the main document of a veteran is given to an electronic certificate instead of a paper one. Draft Law No. 11376 was developed by the Ministry of Veterans Affairs together with the specialized parliamentary committee. Today, the paper certificate itself has the status of the main document. And only after receiving it, at the request of the veteran, an electronic ID card can be created - the veteran's e-ID card in Action. -The transition to the e-Certificate as the main document will help speed up the provision of services, reduce the time for checking the status, which will improve the quality of service to veterans and their families. And you can get a paper certificate if you wish. Thank you to the parliament for the support!-, noted the Minister of Veterans Affairs of Ukraine Nataliya Kalmykova. Veteran's e-certificates will allow you to instantly check their authenticity in real time, which in turn eliminates the possibility of using fake or outdated documents. The transition to electronic IDs facilitates efficient documentation management for organizations and institutions and reduces costs for printing and storing paper documents. It will also contribute to the improvement of administrative procedures, faster and more efficient access to social guarantees. It is also important that in case of loss of a veteran's paper ID, a person will be able to use an electronic ID without any problems. It is worth noting that the Ministry of Veterans, together with the Ministry of Digital Affairs, implemented a project to introduce a veteran's e-Certificate in the Diya mobile application. To date, more than 300,000 veteran e-Certificates have already been generated in Diya. ArmyInform told how veterans can use the service of receiving cash assistance online a> and what needs to be done.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/posvidchennya-veterana-v-diyi-zamist-paperovogo-rada-pidtrymaly-zminy-do-zakonodavstva/	2024-10-08T08:23:11-07:00

We are building muscles: in the north of Kharkiv Oblast, the Defense Forces are strengthening their ...	Instead, the Defense Forces not only effectively repel enemy attacks, but also strengthen individual units and take other measures to disrupt the intentions and plans of the Russian occupiers. Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon. — The situation remains consistently difficult. The enemy continues to put pressure on the Defense Forces of Ukraine. It is not giving up its aggressive intentions and aims to move forward, he said. However, units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine give a decent rebuff to the enemy, disrupting his intentions and plans. — We are standing firmly in our positions, we are giving the enemy a decent rebuff, and the loss of our positions is currently not allowed. There were 6 combat encounters yesterday. The enemy tried to advance in Vovchansk and the nearby village of Staritsa, the spokesman said. On the other hand, in other areas of the invasion in the north of the Kharkiv region, the enemy has given up offensive actions for the time being. — At other locations, he regroups, takes measures to engineer positions, conducts aerial reconnaissance, remote mining of possible routes of movement of the Defense Forces, as he considers it. It is also building up the communication system, building up the management system, the military man said. The measures taken show that the enemy is preparing to resume offensive actions. -We understand that the enemy is preparing for active assault actions and sooner or later, when conditions are favorable for him, he may switch to attacking our positions,- Vitaliy Sarantsev explained. Instead, the Defense Force actively and effectively engages the enemy, and also reinforces individual units and improves positions by counterattacking under favorable conditions. — We are also preparing for any development, we are preparing a worthy meeting for the enemy. We are also strengthening our units, our artillery and mortar calculations. We are also taking certain actions so that the adversary, who intends to move forward, understands that it is not necessary to do this, but to return to oneself in Russia and develop one's own country, said the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU. Earlier, ArmyInform reported whether the occupiers in the north had increased Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/naroshhuyemo-myazy-na-pivnochi-harkivshhyny-syly-oborony-posylyuyut-pozycziyi/	2024-10-08T07:46:53-07:00

Not all chaplains are military: the need to standardize definitions was discussed at the Interdenomi...	This is reported by the correspondent of ArmiyaInform. Pastoral mentoring of servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is carried out by priests of various denominations, organizational subordination and legal status. Sometimes they are all collectively called military chaplains or they themselves position themselves as military chaplains. Whether this is correct was discussed during a meeting of the Interdenominational Council on Military Chaplaincy at the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The issue was raised by military chaplains, of whom there are already more than 300 in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Military chaplaincy in its current format has been in existence for the third year. During this time, a professional class of clerics who provide pastoral guidance while serving in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to crystallize. A military chaplain is primarily a contract military service member. Accordingly, only those chaplains serving in the Armed Forces of Ukraine should be called military chaplains. Accordingly, chaplains who meet the spiritual and religious needs of military personnel, without being in military service themselves, may be called chaplains or chaplains-volunteers, if they also support the military materially. At the meeting of the Interdenominational Council, this issue was discussed in detail and it was proposed to regulate it accordingly in such a way as to differentiate between military chaplains and civilian chaplains. In addition, there was a proposal that civil chaplains should belong to a certain Church and report this, and the Church, accordingly, should be responsible for the activities of a chaplain belonging to it. Representatives of the Interdenominational Council also drew attention to the problem of self-employed chaplaincy, when chaplaincy services are performed under the guise of public organizations by persons who do not belong to any Church. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that The interfaith council on issues of military chaplaincy under the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine at its meeting on October 8 decided to submit a proposal to charge additional payments to chaplains who are in the war zone.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/ne-vsi-kapelany-vijskovi-potrebu-unormuvannya-vyznachen-obgovoryly-na-mizhkonfesijnij-radi-pry-minoborony/	2024-10-08T07:34:11-07:00

The largest number of cyber attacks fell on the electronic systems of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Development of our country. As the investigation established, the goal of the hacker attacks was to gain access to the electronic document management system and servers with confidential data of the government structures of our state. -According to the investigation, the key organizers of subversive activities are two former employees of the SBU administration in Crimea, who betrayed their oath in 2014. Then they voluntarily joined the -branch- of the FSB on the temporarily occupied peninsula,- the report said. Based on the materials of Ukrainian law enforcement officers, the court sentenced both traitors to 15 years of imprisonment. They were found guilty under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: -The trial took place in a special trial in absentia (in the absence of the accused).

UAH 30,000 for combat chaplains: the Inter-confessional Council submitted proposals to the Ministry ...	This was reported by the correspondent of ArmiyaInform. The task -Satisfying the spiritual and religious needs of the personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine- is currently not included in the list of combat (special) tasks, for the performance of which an additional monthly additional reward in the amount of 30 thousand hryvnias is paid in the case of a serviceman's stay in active groups of troops (forces) state defense forces. The meeting participants noted that this oversight has a negative impact on the motivation of military chaplains during pastoral mentoring and performance of official duties. The lack of wording -satisfaction of spiritual and religious needs- in the relevant normative documents creates a conflict regarding the ability to pay chaplains additional remuneration. The interfaith council on issues of military chaplaincy decided to address the Minister of Defense of Ukraine and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with a proposal to normalize this issue. Appropriate wording should be provided in the list of combat (special) tasks. This will restore the right to a fair exercise by military chaplains of the law regarding their social protection as military personnel.

The only way out for them is to seek medical care in neighboring settlements, where they are forced to go and make arrangements. Artem Lysogor also noted that in Lysychansk the Russian invaders resorted to terrorizing the population. The occupiers use drones to drop munitions on civilians moving through the streets. At first, local residents, and now also Russian propagandists, recognized these stagings as attempts to intimidate the population. As reported by ArmyInform, the cities of Luhansk region are trapped by garbage: russia turns the occupied territories into a landfill.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/medychna-kryza-na-luganshhyni-likarni-praczyuyut-lyshe-dlya-rosijskyh-vijskovyh/	2024-10-08T00:27:17-07:00

The Russian army launched a ballistic missile attack on a civilian ship in the ports of Odesa: there...	In two days, Russia attacked a second civilian ship that was in the ports of Odesa. Palau-flagged ship -OPTIMA- was damaged by a ballistic missile. This was reported by the Deputy Prime Minister for the Reconstruction of Ukraine - the Minister of Community Development and territory of Ukraine Oleksiy Kuleba. One person is said to have died. Five more foreign citizens, crew members, were injured. They are currently receiving medical attention. Only today the ship came in for loading. However, within a few hours, the aggressor country became the target. In two days, the enemy damaged two ships that were supposed to take cargo from Ukraine. This is a targeted practice of intimidation and obstruction of the work of the Ukrainian Maritime Corridor. -In this way, the aggressor is again trying to destroy shipping in the Black Sea and undermine Ukrainian efforts to guarantee food security. The consequence of this can only be an increase in instability in sensitive regions of the world that depend on food imports, and unrest in international relations,- noted Oleksiy Kuleba. The minister emphasized that it is important that the port infrastructure is protected from terror and that free and safe navigation is guaranteed. -We must continue to strengthen our counter-intelligence defense and, with the force of arms and the force of diplomacy, bring the enemy to justice,- Oleksiy Kuleba summarized. As ArmiyaInform reported, Russian troops struck the Izmail district with the help of drones. The main target of the attack was the port and border infrastructure. As a result of the impact, two men, truck drivers, were injured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/armiya-rf-atakuvala-balistykoyu-czyvilne-sudno-v-portah-odeshhyny-ye-zagybli-ta-poraneni/	2024-10-07T21:12:53-07:00
- It is the most difficult thing to restore a person-. ArmiyaInform interview about the new system o...	—Ms. Valentina, a few hours ago you had a meeting with relatives of soldiers who returned from captivity. What challenges did you see for yourself after communicating with them? - I can't talk about it in detail. But now the first issue is the development of a complex service as soon as possible: medical care, rehabilitation and reintegration measures in one of the regions of central Ukraine. We need to train specialists who will work with those returned from captivity. This is a very sensitive topic and a very sensitive story. Practice shows that in working with our boys and girls, the attitude of the staff towards them and the professionalism of the work are of great importance. First of all, this concerns the emotional and psychological component. Therefore, it is very important: to create a quality service for military personnel. - Tell me about yourself and your previous professional experience. - I have a medical education, worked as a doctor. Then she worked for more than five years in the Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Therefore, the concept of -human rights- is not an empty word for me, and these very words have become a red line and a kind of vital pillar for me throughout my life. Then I went to reform the health care system, when these processes were just starting - from 2018. We launched and recorded fundamental changes in the approaches to the financing of the health care system, and patients felt their rights. She also worked in the non-governmental sector - in particular, there were international projects, including the development of rehabilitation in the field of health care. Then came the time when I was called to the reform team in the defense sector. And this is much more difficult and responsible work than all my previous experiences. Because I am responsible for the changes, and I have to calculate the risks that these changes may affect. For me, changes are made, first of all, for the person. If we talk about the system of the Ministry of Defense, then this is a military serviceman. It is for their sake that we are making these changes. If a serviceman is treated in a hospital, he is a patient. If he needs psychological help, then he is essentially a serviceman-client. Not so long ago, I joined the military service. My current service is to preserve the life and mental health of the serviceman, to preserve the human capital in the troops as much as possible. A person is the most difficult thing to restore. We can repair a drone or buy a new one, and a person can be rehabilitated and restored, including psychological restoration, which is much more difficult. Banal: it takes 18 years for a person to become competent. Therefore, we do not have the right to spend human capital thoughtlessly. On the contrary, it is necessary to do everything to solve mental health problems at the initial stage, when minimal efforts are sometimes enough for this, when it is necessary to provide the serviceman with psychological training for self and mutual help. For this, we need to build not only the psychological system as best as possible, but also all the systems in the complex: medical, psychological, social. — Psychological support in the Armed Forces. What coordinate system are we in now when talking about this topic? - We are currently conducting an audit to understand what kind of system this is, who is in it, who are these specialists, what is their education. We understand what knowledge and skills a psychologist must have to provide psychological assistance to military personnel, including after participating in combat operations. At the moment, I am not sure that a psychologist with a higher education is a quality psychologist. And this is a very complex component, in which there are many components - education, experience, readiness to perform one's duties well, motivation. So now our frame of reference is to determine where we are in general, what we need, what we need for educational institutions. We need to monitor the quality of education and training of psychologists. After all, it is not so much about the fact that such a specialist will not be able to help. Insufficient expertise in psychological help can do a lot of harm. - So we are at the foot of the mountain? - Roughly speaking. — In 10 years of war, what has not yet been implemented, but should have been implemented yesterday, in your opinion? What is desperately needed, given the challenges of a large-scale war? - These changes should have started to be implemented even when Ukraine became an independent state. For me, as a representative of the defense system, it is important that soldiers who have survived a traumatic event recover as quickly as possible - but recover well, and be able to return to the army and perform combat tasks. Because we now receive a lot of servicemen who are not ready for combat operations, but who, nevertheless, perform combat tasks. And because of this approach, irreversible psychological processes can occur for people. We have several stages for change. It is necessary to start from the very beginning. For example, when a person enters the military service, he passes a psychological test in the TCC and SP, which must be adapted to new realities. At most, its results should be used further in a non-formal way. Already at this stage, we need to understand what kind of person this is, where he can best prove himself, in which branches of the military, etc. —Within the boundaries of the BZVP, it is planned to introduce psychological training as well, according to you. Please tell us in more detail what it is about, how much time it takes? — There is such a training, you just need to control the quality of psychological training. First of all, the standard should be somewhat updated, slightly expanded, and the tools for preparation should be improved. Today we had a meeting with the Deputy Minister and everyone agreed that the psychological component during the BZVP is important, because it is preparation for combat, for service in conditions of constant stress. Our servicemen, who leave the BZVP, must have the strength, inspiration and ability to perform combat tasks. Motivation and willingness to face a reality that goes beyond the normal experience of a civilian is very important. Therefore, we need to get involved in basic military training, review the psychological component and control it. - And who will conduct such psychological training in educational centers? - Trained instructors. First of all, we have to conduct training for instructors. They also need to be selected, trained, and prepared&#8230; And foreign partners who have the appropriate methods and experience are ready to help us with this. We also have to monitor the psychological state of the instructors themselves. After all, these people also burn out, lose motivation, etc. —Tell us more about the pilot project for comprehensive recovery of military personnel that you announced the other day. Why is it right and useful - and what has happened so far? Now we are developing a mechanism so that the recovery service fully meets the needs of the serviceman who receives it and the implementation is controlled by the customer - the Ministry of Defense. It is primarily about standard, quality and availability. This is a program under which servicemen who participated in hostilities and need recovery are sent for 14 days to institutions outside the Ministry of Defense system, where specialists work with them, including necessarily military psychologists. If desired, it can be with or without families - this is already a more ethical and personal issue. We have neither the time nor the opportunity to build appropriate rehabilitation zones or to modernize existing sanatoriums. Therefore, we followed a system that has proven its effectiveness in the civilian health sector. We will purchase such a service from capable facilities that can meet the requirements for providing a psychological recovery service. Yes, we will test them, check them, standardize them. We will recruit and train civilian psychologists who will work alongside military professionals. An important point is that such a service will be provided at a single, calculated price. There are clear tariffs in the health care system, which are approved by the Cabinet of Ministers, there can be no other tariffs, and it is forbidden to demand any additional money from a military serviceman who is on recovery. Such an approach will make any corruption impossible. And in general, in an ideal world, I see it with an additional recreation area, where there are pools, there are elements of rehabilitation, where specialists with enormous experience work. We will try to create such an environment as much as possible. But for now, we have the task of getting the system up and running and providing psychological recovery first, but for this package to be effective, to help the Defenders and the Defenders get back on track. —It is known that this package of services for the psychological rehabilitation of military personnel should be operational in the fall. Can everyone get such services? Or just the wounded? — All who need psychological recovery. First of all, as I have already said, these are military personnel who suffered psychological injuries in hostilities. It does not depend on the injury. Those who are injured and are in hospitals should receive medical rehabilitation. A psychologist or clinical psychologist works in medical rehabilitation. This is also an important component, because all wounded (not only in rehabilitation) need to be accompanied by a psychologist. Because mental health and physical health are essentially inseparable. - Will such services from the military be paid for? - Free for military personnel. This will be done at the expense of the Ministry of Defense. - And who will determine the military's need for such recovery? - Psychologists after the unit leaves active hostilities. When the brigade goes out for recovery, a combat stress control team works with the soldiers. They, too, should direct this recovery. - When, according to your forecasts, will the first military serviceman be able to use such a package of services? The first few groups will work in several places at the community's own expense. And this, I think, will be sometime in October. It is important for us now to adjust the program, work out the -bottlenecks- and correct them, develop a base of specialists. — I will start with the fact that this year our team launched for the first time the project of the Ministry of Defense on the reintegration and provision of medical assistance to soldiers who returned from captivity at their own facilities. And now we are working on its expansion, building rehabilitation for this category of people. One of the main problems we have faced is the limited resource of specialists. We understand that many doctors have gone abroad. Do we have the ability to create several centers and recruit specialists there? I'm not sure right now. Currently, we are building one large center where we will gather specialists, train them and create a powerful base. It is not as simple as it seems - there are not so many specialists in rehabilitation and in the civilian world. We are currently working on the expansion of such a center in one of the regions in central Ukraine. We expect that such a center will be able to receive hundreds of people at once in the near future. At the same time, all of them will be provided with professional comprehensive assistance according to a single standard that will take into account all the nuances. Our Defenders and Defenders go through real hell in captivity. And there are many, many nuances. - The office you lead was created only in May. What is the biggest challenge you have faced in this position? Did you manage to overcome it? — Today we lack specialists who are ready to work and who understand state processes. We need not only psychologists, but also digital scientists, lawyers, managers of government processes, business analysts. We are working on it. - What would be a victory in the Russian-Ukrainian war for you? - I would very much like for us to win so that the enemy no longer gets up from his knees&#8230;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/lyudynu-vidnovyty-najskladnishe-intervyu-armiyainform-pro-novu-systemu-psyhologichnogo-vidnovlennya-vijskovyh/	2024-10-07T21:10:07-07:00
The most insulting thing is when you hear: -Why are you here and not there?- About the war since 201...	How many meters were there to enemy positions in Novomykhailivka? But which legendary military man was the commander in Ivan during the anti-terrorist operation? A military man told our correspondents about this: -Strokovu served in Kharkiv, in the Air Defense Forces. It was in 1993-1995. In 2014, an anti-terrorist operation began. The summons came. He ended up in the ZSU again. He served in the 81st Airborne Brigade. They performed tasks in Druzhkovka, Kramatorsk, Sloviansk, went to Mariupol. By the way, our commander at that time was already Lieutenant General Yevhen Moysiuk. In 2022, after the start of a large-scale invasion on February 26, he went to the TCC. The Kyiv 23rd separate battalion was formed there. By the way, volunteer Mykhailo Kholmatov helped our battalion a lot with supplies. We immediately came to the defense of Kyiv. And only later, when the Kyiv region was liberated, we were sent to Donetsk region in Novomykhailivka. We performed tasks there for about two months. I was wounded there. Almost all types of weapons were used by the enemy there. In most cases, these were -Tornadoes-, and phosphorus was often used by the enemy. Their aviation also worked, -Hradi-, tanks. The worst was when the tank was working. We counted his every shot. We knew that if he fired 21 shots, then he left one for retreat. Our positions were at a distance of 150 meters from the enemy in some places. The landing where we stood, the enemy in front of was completely destroyed by our rotation, there was nothing left of it. ...One of the awards from the Ministry of Defense was for the performance of combat missions in Novomykhailivka. After I recovered, I returned and I was put in the battalion as a driver for evacuating people from positions. We -from scratch- picked up and delivered to Shakhtarsk and Kurakhove. When it was announced on the walkie-talkie that there was a -300th- on the front, you got into the car without thinking. You just go to the point where the guys are standing. It is about 800 meters to the position itself. We tried to arrive as quickly as possible and evacuate the wounded to the right place. Drones were not bothering us much back then in 2022. Not what it is now. And I also brought people to the positions in my transport. Later, at that time, I was sent to serve at the capital's TCC as a person of limited fitness. Where I am serving now. ... When I went to war in 2014 and in 2022, my wife was against it. And I ask her: who will protect you? The most difficult thing in my current job at the TCC is when people come and say -why are you here and not there.- This is the hardest... I have a wife, two children, an eight-year-old grandson. I am a happy grandfather... But the most important thing is victory. And she will be behind us-. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/najobrazlyvishe-koly-chuyesh-chogo-ty-tut-a-ne-tam-pro-vijnu-z-2014-go-poranennya-ta-sluzhbu-u-tczk-istoriya-voyina-ivana/	2024-10-07T20:57:00-07:00
Russia is increasing the costs of the war: the expert named the consequences for Ukraine	Does this decision indicate that the Kremlin is betting on a strategy of exhausting and protracted war against our state? What are the consequences for Ukraine? ArmyInform asked military expert Petr Chernyk about this: -Up to $145 billion is quite a lot. 6.5% of their gross domestic product. Let me remind you that there was more only at the end of the 80s of the twentieth century, when the USSR calculated its military budget in the range of 10 to 15% of GDP. By the way, it was such a large military budget that became one of the prerequisites for the collapse of the Soviet Union. Why do the Russians resort to this? Yes, indeed, this is not very good news for us. This means that the enemy is showing readiness to continue a grueling full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming year. This is the third largest military budget of any country in the world. The largest budget in the USA is more than 800 billion dollars, the second in China is more than 200 billion dollars. In this context, a completely logical question arises: will Ukraine be able to withstand Russian aggression in 2025? It will last, I'm optimistic. The total resource for national security and defense in 2025 is 2 trillion 223 billion UAH. That's up to about $50 billion. This is a lot for Ukraine. Plus international aid. If you add up all the packages of projected financial aid from the European Union, the G7 countries and NATO, and add Ukraine's defense budget, the total is more than $130 billion. So, we collectively reach relative parity with the Russian Federation. In the competition for the quantity and quality of weapons and military equipment, Ukraine is clearly ahead of the Russian Federation in terms of the quality of weapons. We receive effective weapons from partner countries: small arms, armored vehicles, such as the M2 Bradley BMP, air defense systems, unmanned systems, etc. An important point. The increase in spending on the military budget of the Russian Federation exceeds the combined spending on education, health care, social policy and the national economy. This will lead to pressure on the Russian population in -social- issues. the Kremlin has nothing to pay for the war, so it will have to be done by -ordinary Russians-. I do not believe in a rebellion of the Russians from below. But it is obvious that such -approaches- to budget formation will complicate everything in Russia. Of course, discontent will grow. At some point, one of the -towers of the Kremlin- may take advantage of this dissatisfaction and replace Putin. The rivalry between us will continue until the Russian Federation finally disintegrates. And this large militarized budget is a sign that the Rashists are not going to give up on the destruction of our country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/rosiya-zbilshuye-vytraty-na-vijnu-ekspert-nazvav-naslidky-dlya-ukrayiny/	2024-10-07T20:50:49-07:00
Excrement, blood, barbed wire and… manicures. Army Inform photo report on psychological sur in the o...	The faces of people in uniform are concentrated, helmets and weapons are wrapped in plastic wrap, some have wrapped their shoes in plastic wrap. It can be seen that someone is nervous, and someone is afraid. But no one had any questions. To the right is an obstacle course. Unlike the usual army ones that appeared at the beginning of the last century, this one is psychological. While the instructors are igniting flat tires, checking the presence of empty cartridges and imitation grenades, conducting briefings, we talk to Lieutenant Serhiy Kashuba, an officer of the special psychological training group of the Department of Training of Specialists of the Russian Armed Forces: - This is a challenge for the personnel. Each cadet must overcome his fears, be at the limit of his physical and psychological capabilities, and in fact, the strip itself is not just a set of physical exercises. This is a slice of knowledge from tactical and fire training, as well as technical expertise. In addition, we see how an informal leader is formed in the collective, who can then become the commander of the department. The strip is a universal event that allows you to reveal the inner potential of military personnel and demonstrate what they are worth. Consists of 10 plus one obstacle. The first group of cadets begins to move through the blocked smoky gap. They light a smoke bomb, the caustic smoke starts to irritate the throat and gets into the eyes. Unexpectedly, an automatic burst sounds, cartridges fly right at the cadets' heads, but the chain confidently overcomes the first obstacle. The next stage is crawling under barbed wire, which also has its own characteristics - scattered organic waste from livestock, etc. I don't know what is written there to enhance the effect, but I understand that it is very difficult for the cadets. The instructors add to the horrors - real blood, though not human, pours on people's heads. But still, the impression is shocking. The smoke from the tires thickens, a light breeze blows it aside, and through the smoke the next obstacle is visible - the wall. She is slightly above average height, so they overcome her with the help of each other. And here, too, there are difficulties. The fact is that a paratrooper usually carries up to 40 kg of load on him - body armor, RPS, weapons, BC, water, etc. Therefore, jumping from a wall is primarily a blow to the spine. A few such jumps of an untrained person - and a protrusion is guaranteed. Therefore, it is very important not to jump from the wall, but to descend carefully on your hands. The instructors warned about this more than once, but one of the cadets shows audacity and jumps. Unable to resist, he falls to his knees and gets up only with the help of his colleague. I hear the instructor who was standing next to me say: -I warned you!- The next location is the -fallen forest-. Basically, this is a set of bars - both horizontal and at an angle. It is also overcome as a team. This obstacle does not cause difficulties and the department moves on, through tires hung on racks, which burn brightly with black smoke. The faces of the cadets are already steaming, the film is being unwound, but no one is paying attention to it. Cries of -I'm hiding!- are heard. This means that it is possible to move on, that the sectors are identified and taken under observation. The next stage is a destroyed bridgehead, and immediately after it is a destroyed column of enemy vehicles. She is real - burnt and battered, dragged here from the front. Among the equipment is a black and red tank with open hatches, burnt dozens of times. One of the exercises is tank neutralization. The instructor loudly reminds what to do, and grenades fly into the hatch, grenade explosions are loud from time to time, finally broken and the column of fire is behind. And ahead is a concrete pipe. And here the nerves of one of the cadets can't stand it. She is picked up and taken out of the lane. The instructor shrugs his shoulders, saying that it happens, we're all human. Other cadets stubbornly climb through the pipe. Someone is holding a machine gun incorrectly, instructors are correcting mistakes, and the group is already gathering in front of a concrete trench and quickly, covering each other, passes through it, through smoke and gunfire. The final location is house cleaning. The group gathers around him. The clothes are black, the face is covered in dirt, but the eyes are burning. I notice a manicure on the nails of one of the cadets and feel that there is something surreal about it, but at the same time beautiful and natural. Now are the times&#8230; To clean the house, you need to open the door and throw a grenade inside, jump into the house, clean it, go through it, jump out the other side and finally exhale. Passed&#8230; I approach Lieutenant Kashuba and ask what turned out to be the most difficult: - Overcoming your fears, probably, and yourself. No obstacle is insurmountable. But overcoming your aversion to blood, to excrement, to everything else is difficult. It is difficult not to feel sorry for yourself, sometimes to behave courageously and to show the qualities of a warrior. This is difficult. And when a person gets used to all this, as we say - -once a warrior, then a warrior forever-&#8230; Photo of the author and Natalia Kravchuk	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/ekskrementy-krov-kolyuchyj-drit-ta-manikyur-fotoreportazh-armiyainform-pro-psyhologichnyj-syur-na-smuzi-pereshkod/	2024-10-07T20:42:33-07:00
Willy Wonka was mobilized to the Armed Forces: the Russian military again -finds mined chocolates-	In particular, over the past few days, they have been talking about explosives in the guise of fast food and showing a photo of a chocolate bar with an explosive device that tears off the fingers of anyone who tries to open it. Such chocolates are -scattered- in the Zaporozhye region. Apparently, Willy Wonka was mobilized into the Armed Forces. At least such thoughts creep in when you imagine hungry Russian occupiers gathering chocolate in the fields. Actually, the fake about mined chocolates is not new. On enemy telegram channels, similar information -walked- back in January of this year. The goal of such fakes is obvious: against the background of mass looting of military stores by Russian soldiers, in particular, in Kurshchyna and the occupied Ukrainian territories, to force them to restrain themselves at least a little. And it is also traditional to accuse the Armed Forces of inhumanity. It is interesting that even in Soviet times, lies about blades in foreign chewing gum, mined children's toys, lighters, and packs of cigarettes were popular. As we can see, nothing has changed in propaganda methods over many decades, as well as in the marauding habits of the Russian army.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/villi-vonku-mobilizuvaly-do-zsu-rosijski-vijskovi-znovu-znahodyat-zaminovani-shokoladky/	2024-10-07T20:30:07-07:00
Exclusive for special forces: a new variant of the armored vehicle was offered in the USA	How informs the authors of the Army Recognition portal, this is the first public presentation of this specialized version of the Pandur Evolution, which demonstrates its advanced capabilities and potential applications, ArmyInform reports. The basis for the new -special purpose- version of the armored vehicle is a modified Pandur Evolution platform with a 6×6 wheel formula. One of its key features is a remote-controlled combat module equipped with a 30 mm automatic cannon that provides powerful fire cover. To increase protection against modern threats such as drones, the armored vehicle has a special protective net . Several containers are also installed on board for transporting and launching the Switchblade 300 Block 20 barrage ammunition, which our editors told in one of her materials. These UAVs provide additional capabilities for reconnaissance and strike operations. The new version of the Pandur Evolution, aimed at equipping special units, has three key modifications that distinguish it from the standard version. First, the chassis of the car was shortened in the rear part, which made it possible to reduce the total weight of the car to 15 tons (without additional equipment). This lightening of the structure improves the mobility of the machine and facilitates its transportation. Secondly, a ballistic driver's cab was installed, which increases the level of protection when driving in active combat conditions. The third modification concerns the engine cooling system, which has also undergone modernization, which increases the reliability of the machine in difficult operating conditions. The total weight of the machine is 19.5 tons, including the maximum payload of 3 tons. The Pandur Evolution is equipped with a Cummins ISLe 450 diesel engine with a capacity of 335 kW, which, in combination with a 6-speed ZF automatic transmission, provides high performance and maneuverability. An armored engine cooling system protects the driver, allowing the surface to be used for material transportation or equipment. Standard armor of the Pandur family provides the crew with protection against shrapnel, small arms rounds and mines. Although details on the armor protection of the new variant have not been released, it is believed to be reinforced with additional armor from Rheinmetall Protection Systems which complies with STANAG 4569 standards (probably level 3 or higher) providing enhanced protection in combat conditions. Design features and additional equipment indicate that the new version of the Pandur Evolution is ideal for special operations. A ballistic driver's cabin and a protected engine cooling system allow the machine to operate effectively in extreme conditions, ensuring the protection of the crew and resistance to external threats. These characteristics make the Pandur Evolution for special forces an important element in the arsenal of special operations forces. The dimensions of the base machine (2.6 m wide and 2.2 m high) allow it to be transported by a C-130 aircraft. The presented Pandur modification is only a basic platform for future AGMS vehicles, which provides for the possibility of further adaptation and modification of the armored vehicle for specific tasks and missions. In the final versions, additional equipment and reinforced armor are expected, which will make it even more versatile and effective in combat conditions.

A one and a half ton thermobaric aerial bomb was defused in the Pokrovsky district of Donetsk region	This was informed by the department. Rescuers were contacted by local residents who discovered an explosive object. Specialists of the State Emergency Service identified the dangerous find as an ODAB-1500 volume-detonating aerial bomb. Together with the employees of the National Police and local authorities, people's access to the danger zone was restricted. After a thorough survey of the area, pyrotechnicians neutralized the bomb. The State Emergency Service reminded that if a suspicious find is discovered, it should not be touched and it should be moved to a safe distance of at least 100 m, and then call 101. ODAB-1500 is a thermobaric projectile from the times of the USSR. 10 meters from the target, it releases a liquid in the form of an aerosol and ignites it. This is called a volumetric explosion. This airbomb is quite a rare item compared to others. It belongs to the old generation of two-stroke thermobaric ammunition. The enemy has already used her in Donetsk region. Earlier there were reports that the enemy was installing a UMPK kit on these aerial bombs, which turned it into a glider. UMPK allows the use of aerial bombs at significant distances - 50-70 km. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/u-pokrovskomu-rajoni-donechchyny-zneshkodyly-pivtoratonnu-termobarychnu-aviabombu/	2024-10-07T11:49:23-07:00
During the occupation of Kherson Oblast, people were deprived of liberty and tortured: 29 more trait...	This was notified by the SBU. According to the results of comprehensive measures, the identities of 29 more participants of the -Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation- created by the Rashists on the left bank of the Kherson region were established. Among them are former employees of law enforcement agencies of Ukraine. According to the case file, the occupying body is carrying out the Kremlin's task of carrying out mass repressions against the civilian population of the region. Being in the ranks of the so-called -department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Oleshkiv District-, the perpetrators kidnap local residents and imprison them in Russian torture camps. In the cells, the victims are subjected to numerous tortures, including with the use of electric current. Also, prisoners are left in cells without food and water for a long time. In addition, henchmen of the enemy, together with the occupiers, ransack the homes of kidnapped people under the guise of searches. During such raids, criminals steal all the private property of the victims, including cars, office equipment, furniture and household appliances. Another task of the occupying body was the protection of Russian -electoral committees- and armed escort of enemy agitators during the pseudo-referendum on the -joining- of the region to the Russian Federation. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed in absentia about the suspicion to all 29 collaborators who acted as part of the criminal organization. The extras are immediately suspected under eight articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. Since the collaborators are hiding on the temporarily occupied left bank of the Kherson region, comprehensive measures are being taken to find and punish them. The investigation was conducted under the procedural guidance of the Prosecutor General's Office.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/pid-chas-okupacziyi-hersonshhyny-pozbavlyaly-voli-ta-katuvaly-lyudej-zaochni-pidozry-otrymaly-shhe-29-zradnykiv/	2024-10-07T11:27:51-07:00

-Vanyok- no harm: the Russians are attacking in the area of ​​New York and Chasovoy Yar	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — To the northwest of New York is the village of Nelipivka. Now the fighting is going on for this village. The tactics of the Russians are similar to those they use in Toretsk. They level the city with artillery and then constantly storm in small groups of 3-4-5 people. There are constant assaults throughout the day, she said. The situation in Chasovoy Yar, which the enemy is trying to bypass from the flanks, is also difficult. — The situation near the Temporal Ravine is also difficult, but it is under control. Strong units are stationed there and they do not allow the enemy to advance, the spokeswoman assured. The situation is relatively calmer in the Seversky direction, but enemy offensive actions are taking place there as well. The spokeswoman reminded that recently the Defense Forces destroyed 5 armored fighting vehicles and about 20 units of enemy manpower in the direction. - The use of technology is atypical in our area. After all, apparently the enemy saves equipment, whatever it is, even the old Soviet one. -Vanyok- is not a pity, the equipment is a pity, the military woman explained. She said that yesterday the enemy tried to storm here on motorcycles. - They also use motorcycles in this direction. Just yesterday they also tried to storm us on motorcycles. Likewise, the enemy suffered losses - about 20 -200- people and motorcycles were also scrapped, the officer reported. Earlier ArmyInform informed that Russians have entered the eastern outskirts of Toretsk, fighting is going on in the city for everyone entrance.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/vanok-ne-shkoda-rosiyany-atakuyut-v-rajoni-nyu-jorka-ta-chasovogo-yaru/	2024-10-07T10:42:50-07:00

At the same time, he emphasized that this or that transport -is under the management's control.- Later, the suspect personally returned the documents to his -clients- for customs formalities. In this way, he managed to transport 26 men to the European Union, who are subject to mobilization during the war. The border guard is currently in custody. The involvement of other persons in the criminal scheme is checked.

Born to crawl: the Armed Forces explained the difficulty of controlling ground drones	The platoon commander of ground robotic systems Serhiy Kraynyak told about the functions that robotic platforms can perform and how to overcome difficulties in their operation on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyny-. — First of all, these are logistics missions, evacuation missions, as well as a large niche of combat drones, which are focused on the fire damage of the enemy. These are both kamikazes and combat platforms armed with turrets, machine guns, and grenade launchers, which are aimed at direct damage to the enemy, he said. At the same time, it is more difficult to use ground drones than aerial ones. — The main difficulty of using ground systems lies in the fact that they are used in completely different conditions. The conditions of their application are much more difficult than for aerial drones, in which the only field of application is airspace. It will be the same both in Kharkiv Oblast and Kherson Oblast. That is, we only need a radio horizon, good communication and we can work at affordable distances, the military said. On the other hand, with ground platforms, everything is more difficult, because the drone has to move on different surfaces with complex terrain. In view of this, he needs high traffic. - He must be able to overcome the obstacles that are on the front, because the roads on the front are extremely difficult, the terrain is beaten, everything is riddled with shells, there are ruins of houses, trees and the like. Therefore, he should be able to overcome all this, - emphasized the commander of ground drones. There are also problems with the operator's communication with the ground drone. — Difficulty, first of all, with communication. Because it moves on the ground, there are a lot of dead zones for communication and it is very difficult to precisely organize communication in such a way that it can move without losing control of a certain route, the officer explained. He emphasized that the field of application of ground drones is quite young, but extremely promising. — In my opinion, the platforms should develop to the point that we can sit tens and hundreds of kilometers away in a protected place and control the platforms during real combat, evacuation and deliver the necessary elements to the front line and minimize the participation of fighters in this to maximize their to protect the enemy from fire damage, explained Serhiy Kraynyak. The military is confident in the prospects of further work on the improvement of ground drones, in particular, in the plan to use artificial intelligence. — At the moment, we have to go through this evolutionary path so that we have platforms that can withstand difficult operating conditions, have high throughput and sufficient connectivity to work smoothly in difficult conditions. Currently, we have to go through an evolutionary path in order to technically reach the parameters so that the platform can perform combat missions. I think that in the future it will be possible to integrate a lot of interesting things, including artificial intelligence, programming platforms for autonomous movement and the like. At the moment, we are still in the early stages of development, ground platforms are still behind air platforms, one step ahead, he said. Earlier, ArmyInform explained what becomes of in the way of finicky ground drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/narodzhenyj-povzaty-u-zsu-poyasnyly-skladnist-keruvaty-nazemnymy-dronamy/	2024-10-07T10:12:23-07:00

Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyny- . — It is the hottest now in the Toretsk direction, the battles are being fought in Toretsk itself. The situation is unstable, battles are taking place literally at every entrance, she said. According to the spokeswoman, it is currently difficult to estimate what part of the city is controlled by the enemy, because during the fighting units of the Defense Forces counterattack and return lost positions. — the Russians entered the eastern outskirts of the city and advanced somewhat along Tsentralnaya street, in the direction of the Tsentralnaya mine. But the situation is constantly changing — sometimes we repulse their fire points, then they destroy ours somewhere. But we constantly restore their positions and try to return what the occupiers captured, we do not allow them to advance, - the military woman emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the East, the Russians are continuously storming, the situation in the region of Toretsk and New York is the most difficult.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/u-toreczku-tochatsya-boyi-za-kozhen-pidyizd-rosiyany-uvijshly-na-shidnu-okolyczyu-mista/	2024-10-07T09:23:36-07:00

They even dig with their nails: the occupiers take into account the peculiarities of the terrain in ...	The head of the planning department of the 13th brigade of operational assignment -Charter- told about this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon Lieutenant Colonel Anton Baev of the National Guard of Ukraine. — The most difficult thing for us is the conditions of our terrain, our area, where there are very deep ravines and very relief streams. The enemy does not use the traditional system of fortifications in the form of long trenches. They equip single burrows, which are very difficult in our realities and in the circumstances of our area to clean and pass through, he said. It is extremely difficult for the fighters of the Defense Forces of Ukraine to clear such shelters. — This is very painstaking work, every 5-10 meters is very difficult for our infantry. We can go through it for 3-4 hours. Therefore, it is difficult a little bit, but we will work, the officer assured. Enemy shelters are extremely varied and in some places very extensive. Clearing such shelters is not easy, even with the help of grenades. - It is like a single hole that just goes underground for two or three meters, has certain bends at different angles, which makes work difficult. Even throwing grenades into these holes does not always give a certain result, because there are also corners of these holes, said the guardsman. On the already liberated territories, the fighters of the Defense Forces saw entire underground mini-towns dug by the occupiers. - There is also information and we have already seen in those territories where we have already regained control that there are small underground towns that are connected to each other by some tunnels there. The enemy digs constantly, digs very efficiently, and this, of course, complicates the work, said the soldier. He said that the occupiers dig exclusively by hand with a chance tool, because the Defense Forces do not allow him to use any equipment. - Everything is done by hand. It is impossible to bring engineering equipment here, we do not give such an opportunity, he assured. However, by hand the Russian invaders dig regularly and continuously. — What makes a Russian soldier different is that he will dig even with his fingernails to dig. That is, they should be given credit for this, they dig constantly, with anything, any means at hand, said Anton Baev. In view of this, the situation with enemy shelters is constantly changing, because in a few hours the enemy is able to dig quite a lot. - That's why you look at the situation - today there is one, and tomorrow there will be twice as much as yesterday. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly keep it under control and watch, the officer explained. Every day in the Kharkiv direction, the Defense Forces discover and destroy dozens of enemy shelters, often managing to do this together with the occupiers who are hiding there. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Armed Forces revealed the secret of thermal ammunition for -dragon- drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/ryyut-navit-nigtyamy-okupanty-vrahovuyut-osoblyvosti-relyefu-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-10-07T08:32:20-07:00

He added that the joint production of engineering equipment with Slovak enterprises is currently in the plans. In particular, demining Bozena machines with localization of production in Ukraine. Slovakia is also ready to provide its own engineering equipment for demining, which will speed up the clearing of our territories. -We are working together to strengthen the security of our borders,- added the Minister of Defense.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/rustem-umyerov-ochikuyemo-na-novi-oboronni-kontrakty-zi-slovachchynoyu/	2024-10-07T08:14:31-07:00
28 assaults were repulsed by the Defense Forces in the Siversky, Kramatorsk and Toretsk directions	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. — The enemy uses artillery, aviation, drones. This is already typical in these areas. In total, over the past day, the enemy fired 1,500 shots at our positions, launched 4 missile strikes and conducted 28 assaults. However, more than 200 people were killed and wounded, she said. During the assaults, the Russians mostly use outdated Soviet equipment, which the enemy has in limited quantities. Its occupants use it as a means of delivery in order to get as close as possible to the positions of units of the Defense Forces. - Currently, the main tactics of the Russians are small group assaults. The vehicle is being used, but is limited to -taxi- functions to transport manpower for assaults, the spokeswoman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the East, the Russians are continuously storming with infantry and Soviet troops, the most difficult is the situation in the region of Toretsk and New York.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/28-shturmiv-vidbyly-syly-oborony-na-siverskomu-kramatorskomu-ta-toreczkomu-napryamkah/	2024-10-07T08:09:33-07:00
They got it from under the ground - our drones hit a buried enemy howitzer	The video of the defeat appeared on October 7 on the brigade's channel. The occupiers took care to protect their cannon: they kept it in a capon below ground level and lowered the muzzle after firing. This allowed the Russians not to be afraid of artillery fire, since only a direct hit could hit the -revenge-. This is exactly what our pilots ensured, who hit the muzzle of the howitzer twice, turning it from a formidable weapon into scrap. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the -Sharp Cartouche- UAV unit of the National Guard of Ukraine made a video guide of the road of death along which the Russians are trying to enter their positions near Hlyboky.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/z-pid-zemli-distaly-nashi-dronari-vrazyly-zakopanu-vorozhu-gaubyczyu/	2024-10-07T07:54:48-07:00
Window of Opportunity - Our drone created jet thrust on the occupant stuck in the window	The video of the hit appeared on the brigade's channel. The invader decided to climb into the abandoned high-rise building, for which he used not the door, like normal people, but the window. But the dimensions of the Russian were such that he got stuck in the window with his feet out. It was the waving of the legs that attracted the attention of our pilots. The FPV drone that hit the fifth point of the occupant helped him get into the house, but hardly in complete condition. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian captured with the help of two drones. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/vikno-mozhlyvostej-nash-dron-stvoryv-okupantu-yakyj-zastryag-u-vikni-reaktyvnu-tyagu/	2024-10-07T07:42:00-07:00

Will you be the third? — the Russian was captured with the help of two drones	The capture video was published on the brigade's channel. One of the occupiers who tried to storm the positions near Selidove made the right decision to surrender to our infantrymen. The delivery process was accompanied by two drones at once: FPV and reconnaissance. A Russian under the control of drones approached our soldiers and was accepted. -His choice was small. Either capture, or join the -colleagues- who remained forever in that forest strip,- the brigade commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the Privid Khortytsi unit of the 2nd battalion of the operational assignment of the 15th Kara-Dag brigade hit the Russian tank T-72B3 with the Javelin ATGM.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/tretim-budesh-rosiyanyna-uzyaly-v-polon-za-dopomogoyu-dvoh-droniv/	2024-10-07T07:16:55-07:00

The man prepared for the campaign for a long time and carefully. For half a year, I studied information on social networks, how and where to cross the border. In the end, he contacted an unknown person who promised to help him cross the border. -The men agreed on a payment of $5,000. Dniprovets transferred the money to the stranger's account in the manner indicated to him and waited for further instructions. Instead, the latter deleted the correspondence and blocked his number,- the report said. Then the man decided to act alone. He reached Uzhgorod and headed towards the border. He was stopped halfway by a border guard. Dniprovets was confused in the explanations, and then admitted the real purpose of being near the border. He was detained administratively and taken to the border unit. After establishing all the circumstances, the man will be held administratively liable under Article 204-1 of the Code of Administrative Offenses -Illegal crossing or attempted illegal crossing of the state border of Ukraine.- ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to violate the law, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces or recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/podorozh-ne-za-planom-viddav-neznajomczevi-usi-groshi-shhob-peretnuty-kordon-i-zalyshyvsya-ni-z-chym/	2024-10-07T05:19:31-07:00
The Ukrainian military will be able to mobilize directly to units without TCC	This was announced by the head of the Main Personnel Department of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Roman Horbach, at a briefing on certain issues of military service, mobilization and military accounting. Yes, conscripts and volunteer reservists can now choose a military unit for service without going to territorial recruitment and social support centers. In turn, commanders of military units are empowered to issue referrals to the VLK to determine suitability for service and to staff combat units with volunteers who wish to serve on the draft during mobilization without the participation of the TCC. The introduced changes simplify the procedure for enlisting volunteers for mobilization as much as possible. From now on, under the new rules, if a conscript joins the army on mobilization, a reference (recommendation letter) from the unit is not required. Then, through the recruiting mechanism, he responds to the selected vacancy and joins the unit directly, without the participation of the TCC. Also, the recruiting time is significantly reduced. These changes are a guarantee that each conscript will be able to enter the service in the military unit to which he actually wanted to enter. An important point.

Where does napalm for drones come from: the secret of thermal ammunition was revealed in the Armed F...	Features of the use of -dragon- drones on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- revealed by the commander of the BPAC shock battalion -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket captain Ivan Sirk, captain Yuriy Fedorenko. - -Drakarisy- is a type of ammunition that was developed back in the Soviet Union. Its remnants are now being actively used by the Defense Forces, he said. To a large extent, the effectiveness of the use of this thermal munition was facilitated by persistent hot and dry weather, which lasted until the beginning of October. -A fairly dry autumn and strong winds gave us the opportunity to gain a certain tactical advantage on the battlefield due to the burning of landings, which leads to the destruction of both enemy positions and various formations - both open with ammunition and certain observation and firing positions,- he explained Yury Fedorenko. He emphasized that -the creativity of the Ukrainian mind is limitless- and disclosed some details of the use of thermal ammunition. This became possible due to the fact that the peculiarities of the use of -dragon- drones by the Ukrainian military have already become known to the enemy. — The question is not in the drone itself, but in the type of ammunition. This type of ammunition can, after a certain modification, be put on an fpv-kamikaze drone of a certain size, the officer said. After she tried to apply it in one of the brigades of the Defense Forces, the idea was picked up and developed in other units. After long-term use by Ukrainian drones, the Russians also learned about the specifics of the ammunition. They also began to use similar weapons. However, the enemy does not have such successes as the Ukrainian military. This is primarily due to the fact that the occupiers have no need for the widespread use of -dragon- drones, as they have an advantage in MLRS and use prohibited phosphorous ammunition. — The enemy has rocket fire systems and there are phosphors, which one way or another the enemy continues to use on the battle line. Unfortunately, fire damage due to phosphors is very and very significant. Therefore, one way or another, the enemy has partially taken over the tactics of use, but at the moment, the Defense Forces, due to this type of ammunition in such a combination with FPV drones, manage to achieve more significant results on the battlefield than the enemy, he concluded. Also, the commander of the Ukrainian drones reported some tactical and technical characteristics of the thermal ammunition. - This is a disposable ammunition. As for the time of its burning - more than a few minutes, I will not specify specifically. As for the area it can cover, it depends on the density of planting, 50 meters and more, said the military. According to him, any experienced FPV drone operator can learn how to use incendiary ammunition. Earlier, ArmyInform showed how the drone -dragon- of the Third assault rifle fires at the occupiers in Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/zvidky-napalm-dlya-droniv-drakoniv-v-zsu-rozkryly-tayemnyczyu-termichnogo-boyeprypasu/	2024-10-07T02:41:21-07:00

Optimizing the arms race: the US introduced a family of autonomous cruise missiles	The Barracuda series includes three variants: Barracuda-100, Barracuda-250 and Barracuda-500, each compatible with different payloads and deployment mechanisms to support a wide range of missions. And as stated in the presentation release posted on the official portal of this company from California, which is engaged in defense technologies and specializes in autonomous systems, the Barracuda family is an autonomous vehicle (AAV) specially designed for ultra-scale production and mass use, ArmyInform reports. Designers from Anduril believe that they have succeeded in realizing the task in a new family of cruise missiles, when Barracuda missiles, combining advanced software and a simplified design, will provide a highly intelligent, inexpensive and flexible mission system. ​ Arms market specialists from IKK Defense Express (DE) emphasize that demonstrated by Anduril Industries the Barracuda family of cruise missiles takes a completely new approach to the cost and timelines of producing such long-range weapons. Thereby, it is proposed to break the paradigm that a cruise missile is an expensive product that requires high-cost equipment and components. -That's why the Barracuda is all about using low-cost materials: 50% fewer parts, 95% less tooling required for production, 50% less time per unit and 30% less cost than existing models.- - stressed in DE. These are the production design parameters that quotes edition Air &amp; Space Forces Magazine, announced at Anduril Industries during the presentation. On the other hand, Defense Express stated that the American company also announced these features and the need for such missiles in a concise and very original video: Presentation of the -Barracuda-M- cruise missile family. Video: Anduril Industries An interesting feature of this video presentation of the Barracuda-M project is that it states that -these missiles can be assembled with a screwdriver and a wrench.- And it was also added that these are the missiles the USA needs to confront China. -Another feature of these missiles is that they should be launched not only from specialized carriers, but also from pallets. That is, it is about the implementation of the decision Rapid Dragon, when a cruise missile is simply dropped from a cargo plane, any, even An-26,- noted experts from IKK DE. As for the missiles themselves, three types of these winged weapons are currently reported to be in development: the Barracuda-100, the Barracuda-250, and the Barracuda-500. The exact characteristics of each have not yet been named, but it is stated that the maximum range of the cruise missile from this family will be more than 500 nautical miles, i.e. more than 900 km, time in the air more than 120 minutes, maneuvers with overload in 5G and payload capacity from 100 pounds (45 kg ). Barracuda's modular, open systems architecture and common subsystems enable rapid integration and testing of new commercial sub-component technologies, allowing mission capabilities to be adjusted as needed. Designed as a software-defined and hardware-supported platform, Barracuda can be continuously upgraded to meet mission requirements. Barracuda-100, a compact modular variant designed for ground and air operational concepts. The missile is capable of both ground- and air-launched operations, with a range of over 157 kilometers when launched from the air and over 111 kilometers when launched from the ground. This model supports a payload of up to 16 kilograms, accommodating both kinetic and non-kinetic types. Barracuda-250 is intended for wider operational use in various armed forces with support for multiple payloads, platforms and operational concepts. It has a range of over 370 kilometers when launched from the air and over 278 kilometers when launched from the ground, with a payload of 16 kilograms. Barracuda-500 is designed for long-range missions and mass production. A flight range of more than 926 kilometers when launched from the air, it can carry a payload of more than 45 kilograms, including both kinetic and other types of payload. The Barracuda family is designed to be flexibly deployed on a variety of air, land and sea platforms, supporting multiple mission sets. The vehicles are compatible with fifth-generation aircraft internal weapons bays, fourth-generation aircraft and helicopter external guides, MFOM launchers, common launch tubes (CLTs), surface vessels, and can be placed on pallets for deployment from transfer aircraft.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/optymizacziya-peregoniv-ozbroyennya-u-ssha-predstavyly-simejstvo-avtonomnyh-krylatyh-raket/	2024-10-06T20:55:03-07:00

Enemy media actively distribute staged videos about the Armed Forces: what did they make up this tim...	Recently ArmyInform reported , that propagandists accused Ukraine of the fact that our military allegedly attacked the Kursk nuclear power plant with four HIMARS missiles, which were -heroically intercepted- by Russian air defense. Of course, this is a fake from the first word to the last. However, he is far from the only one. Enemy media began to more actively distribute staged videos about the alleged -atrocities of the Armed Forces- in the Kursk region. Yes, the Russians claim that they discovered a video of the killing of civilians in Kurshchyna, which was allegedly recorded by a GoPro camera on the helmet of a dead Ukrainian soldier. The propagandists show only a few seconds of a video taken in a dark room, from which no conclusions can be drawn either about the events themselves or about their participants. Enemy propagandists also recorded a whole series of videos with nonsense from an elderly man who introduced himself as an -evacuee resident of the Kursk region.- He did not restrain his imagination - he talked about a man hanged in a church, a raped woman whose head was also cut off, Polish and Georgian mercenaries who kidnapped people and kept them in the basement. In order to properly terrify the Russian public, you cannot invent anything better than unsubstantiated stories. In order to shock their audience even more and to emphasize that -nothing is sacred- for the Ukrainian military, enemy propagandists spread fakes about deliberately burning fields with unharvested crops and about a man who allegedly died in his garden while digging potatoes. In addition, the stories of women are spreading, who claim that there are apparently mass shootings of civilian cars and drone attacks on villages with incendiary munitions. It is characteristic that people who share such stories have not seen anything like this with their own eyes. They sincerely admit that these are rumors heard from acquaintances. There is no reason to be surprised - all Russian propaganda is built on gossip, lies and manipulation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/vorozhi-media-aktyvno-poshyryuyut-postanovochni-video-pro-zsu-shho-vygadaly-czogo-razu/	2024-10-06T20:37:52-07:00
How to hide in the woods: making the mobilized invisible in Britain on Interflex	An ArmyInform correspondent told about how they are taught how to choose and arrange shelter in the forest during the BZVP as part of the Interflex multinational training mission in Great Britain. The forest is big, and you won't find a tree to help you. This Ukrainian proverb pops up in my head again when the instructors give us the task of finding and equipping a good individual shelter on the edge of the forest. This must be done quickly and imperceptibly for a conditional enemy who is watching us from the side of the field. Given these conditions, we have only a few minutes to emerge from the depths of the forest, choose a good place and quickly arrange the simplest shelter. However, the Danes have many other sayings about the forest: -Skoven har ørre og marken har øjne- - -The forest has ears, and the field has eyes-, -Ringer du i skoven, får du sva- - -When you call in the forest, there is an answer you will get- and even -Æren er det fejreste træ i skoven- - -Honour is the most glorious tree in the forest-. So they talk about the forest, apparently, they know a lot not only about military science, but also about folk signs and observations. This is noticeable in the way they teach us, combining practice and theory - first they visually demonstrate the result we should achieve, and then explain how exactly it can be done. During one of the exercises, we have to discover in in the forest in front of us are two instructors who imperceptibly approached us during the line-up. We have already failed the first part of the test - while we were lining up, enemy scouts or saboteurs crept up to us at a distance of less than 50 meters, and none of us noticed them. Now we have to visually detect them in the forest during our daily activities camp According to the conditions of the task, we cannot go deeper into the forest and only move along it. We have at first 3, then 5, and finally 10 minutes to identify the conditional enemy, because none of us managed to do it in the first moments of time. The whole department looks into the forest thicket and, in the end, the first of us notices one of the instructors It succeeds only because he has moved. We look for the second one even longer, but in the end, the most vigilant among us manage to spot it too. I am ashamed to admit that I did not see either the first or the second, so I pretend that I did notice one. I randomly point out the likely location of the hypothetical enemy to the instructor and he nods approvingly - I was lucky enough to guess the outline of a hand in a slightly strange silhouette behind a hump near a tree trunk. Lesson learned - we made sure to get close to the enemy and take a position in shelters of natural origin can be completely imperceptible. Now they will explain to us how to do it, breaking down the whole process into the smallest details and visualizing each of them. In order not to reveal all the secrets, I will mention only the obvious things - individual camouflage, silent movement in the lowest profile, choosing a position with the guaranteed possibility of a direct shot and the desired presence of personal protection against enemy counterfire. Instructors explain and demonstrate several more important elements, emphasizing that combining them all at the same time is an incredible, almost impossible luck in real conditions. So they should be prioritized, sacrificing the less important ones. For example, clear visibility for a shot may be more important than individual safety, and movement in the lowest possible profile may be traded for movement speed if there is a high chance that the enemy will not detect you while moving. Or on the contrary, it is better to be slow, but silent and inconspicuous. Five instructors are lined up in front of us on the opposite side of the road. Dressed in the same uniform and having identical camouflage, they stand at a distance of 12-15 meters from each other. It would seem that they should be equally visible, but they are not. -Get the point?- - asks the chief instructor and explains in detail why we can see the far left instructor in the row best and in contrast, the far right one is practically invisible, and the three between them are also visually perceived in completely different ways. There is no magic in what was demonstrated - only knowledge, abilities, skills and experience. Anyone can achieve this with due diligence, careful practice and vigilance. We should use this knowledge when choosing and setting up personal positions on the edge of the forest. We advance towards the edge of the forest. Now we will apply the acquired knowledge in practice. Training as part of Interflex's multinational training mission in Great Britain. It's only nine in the morning, we've been working for about three hours, so we have more than 12 hours of theory and practical training before the end of a tiring day. >	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/yak-shovatysya-u-lisi-mobilizovanyh-roblyat-nevydymymy-u-brytaniyi-na-interflex/	2024-10-06T20:30:32-07:00
-The number of dead exceeded the number of wounded-: OTU -Kharkiv- explained the reason for the huge...	The tactical episode of the city battles in Vovchansk was told by the spokesman of the OTU -Kharkiv- on the telethon -Yedini Novyni- commented Colonel Vitaliy Sarantsev of the ZSU. — With regard to the use of armored vehicles, the largest such richest case was at the beginning of last week. Then the enemy used a large number of personnel and a significant amount of armored vehicles, which under the cover of two tanks tried to storm the positions of the Defense Forces in the Vovchansk region. They tried to advance to the Aggregate Plant, but were met by the fire of our artillery and the strikes of our FPV drones, he said. Enemy losses during this assault were colossal. — The enemy lost a lot of personnel in that direction. At least on my rotation it happened for the first time when the number of dead exceeded the number of wounded. This shows that the intensity of the battle was such that the enemy simply did not have time to withdraw their personnel or take the wounded — they all died simply during this assault, the spokesman explained. Today in Vovchansk, the enemy again tried to attack the positions of units of the Defense Forces, but did it on foot without using armored vehicles. Fire from the Ukrainian military forced the occupiers to abandon the task. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that during the described assault in Vovchansk irreversible losses of enemy manpower twice exceeded sanitary. On other days, the Russian occupiers lose their manpower in the same massive way - last day, the enemy's irreversible losses amounted to almost 40%, and the day before yesterday more than 37% of the total number of losses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/06/kilkist-zagyblyh-perevyshhyla-kilkist-poranenyh-v-otu-harkiv-poyasnyly-prychynu-velycheznyh-vtrat-voroga-u-vovchansku/	2024-10-06T11:06:31-07:00

Replenishment of enemy losses is carried out in a continuous flow mode. — We see staff replenishment in their positions. They need to do this, because they rush in small groups, we kill them, destroy them - and they constantly replenish this -meat fund- in order to continue to advance, the spokeswoman explained. Realizing that only death awaits them, some Russian occupiers try to surrender as prisoners, some of them succeed. — The enemy surrenders to captivity very gladly, in general they have a very low morale and we constantly record cases of desertion from their positions. They have no motivation, they came here for money. Their business here is either to die quickly and painlessly, or simply run away from the positions, the military said. According to her, now in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Luhansk- OTU, mainly units staffed by Russian contractors are fighting against the Defense Forces. They have undergone some training and have military training, but their only motivation is money. — These units are trained, they undergo some kind of training before going to Ukraine. However, we see that the morale was very low, they run away, throw down their weapons, throw away their equipment, said the spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU.

Siversk, Chasiv Yar, Toretsk, New York: where in the East the situation is the most difficult	About where the situation is the most difficult on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon spoke spokeswoman of the OTU -Luhansk- Anastasia Bobovnikova. — Our zone of responsibility includes Chasiv Yar, where the enemy storms in small groups without the use of equipment. The situation is relatively stable. In the Seversky direction, we see the statistics, it seems calmer there - fewer assaults, but in this direction the enemy is advancing with equipment - tanks, armored fighting vehicles. Despite the lower number of assaults, it is not easier for our defenders there, she said. The situation is more complicated on other parts of the battle line. — The most difficult situation near Toretsk and New York. The enemy is trying to break through our defenses, constantly pressing with manpower. The enemy uses artillery, aviation, and drones in all directions.

They do it from deep down, he said. Launching strikes from deep within Russian territory does not allow the Ukrainian military to pre-emptively engage enemy launchers to prevent the launch of enemy UAVs. -We can't always get to the exact source where they come from, so long-range weapons are very important to us,- the spokesman emphasized. In order to bypass the Ukrainian air defense, the Russians resort to tricks, but the Ukrainian military effectively counters the enemy's actions. — They change heights, routes, frequencies. We use electronic warfare and all our anti-aircraft weapons to destroy as much as possible, to prevent the enemy from entering. The fight continues and at the moment this is the strategic direction of the enemy's use of aircraft, Vadym Mysnyk emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported how many strikes occupiers of the Sumshchyna of the last day.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/06/marshruty-vysoty-chastoty-yak-shahedy-pronykayut-z-kurshhyny-na-terytoriyu-ukrayiny/	2024-10-06T03:22:08-07:00

The enemy is laying underground routes and forming a regiment of -prisoners-	Volodymyr Degtyarev, a representative of the press service of the -Chartiya- NSU brigade, told about this on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyny-. He said that one of the tactical actions of enemy units is the laying of underground logistics routes in the direction of Ukrainian positions. -This tactic of the enemy is not new. We have been observing it since the summer of the 23rd year, when in the Avdiiv direction they used trenches and made tunnels, both in urban buildings, so that there were logistical routes, and in order to make longer tunnels to blow up some of our defense structures.- Volodymyr Degtyarev said. He noted that the Russians use this tactic regularly. In most cases, for battles in the city or suburbs, than in forest belts. -Indeed, it should be determined what they know how to dig. We see from our offensive actions how difficult it is for us to -smoke out- the enemy from their holes that they dig. Such buildings are sometimes even multi-level,- said Volodymyr Degtyarev. The representative of the press service of the -Chartiya- NSU brigade spoke separately about the technical capabilities of the enemy units. -We know that the 7th regiment of the 11th corps is standing against our brigade from the enemy's side, which is mainly formed, or rather, continues to be formed, from the recently held convict colonies,- he said. According to him, although the -quality of their personnel- is very low, their technology is at a good level. The enemy is actively using EW means against Ukrainian aerial reconnaissance. -We constantly apply updated solutions for aerial reconnaissance. However, literally in a week or two, the enemy has an answer. But, I would like to emphasize, we have a very well-established surveillance system, including aerial surveillance, thanks to drones, which takes place 24/7, day and night,- emphasized Volodymyr Degtyarev. He emphasized that the fighters from his unit can see even in the rear of the enemy. -We can prepare in advance, prevent the approach and any active actions of even small groups. Not to mention some attempts to break through with the use of a large amount of equipment,- Volodymyr Degtyarev, a representative of the press service of the 13th brigade of the Charter State University, Volodymyr Degtyarev, said. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ukrainian military is actively ground robotic platforms of various types are used, performing tasks of various purposes. The occupiers are trying to ape the successful experience.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/06/vorog-prokladaye-pidzemni-marshruty-ta-formuye-polk-iz-zekiv/	2024-10-06T02:42:43-07:00
The Three Laws of Robotics: What's Getting in the Way of Picky Ground Drones	What prevents the enemy from effectively using ground drones on the air of a national telethon told an officer of the 2nd separate detachment of the Special Purpose Center - Omega- of the National Guard of Ukraine with the call sign -Stig-. — We saw ground complexes trying to deliver some keys, food items, ammunition. They are also trying to install some turrets with automatic machines, machine guns that drive autonomously and are controlled from a remote control by certain operators, he said. However, it is difficult for the Russians to effectively use ground-based drones for a number of reasons — the lack of robotic platforms with high-quality running gear, a lack of trained operators to operate ground-based drones, and even the terrain. — There are certain nuances in the application of ground complexes, because you are very limited in the terrain of application. If you have any construction debris, destruction, then you cannot apply these complexes. You can't use them in the forest either, explained the soldier. Difficult terrain can be overcome only by a skilled operator who controls a ground drone with high cross-country ability and appropriate technical characteristics of the chassis. Simpler platforms are very picky about the terrain - they need a straight road. -Plus we have to understand that mine-explosive barriers also affect the use of these ground complexes,- the officer noted. Ground-based robotic platforms, judging by their weight and technical characteristics, can indeed be blown up by both anti-vehicle and anti-personnel mines. After all, as soon as Ukrainian UAV operators detect enemy ground drones, they immediately attack them and destroy enemy equipment. -Despite all these nuances, if the operators of our strike drones detect such a complex, it will be destroyed almost immediately, as well as all the equipment they use,- assured the officer with the call sign -Stig-. Previously, ArmyInform showed how Ukrainian FPV -drone destroyed a Russian ground drone that went a little crazy as well as Ukrainian ground drones dropped a cache with ten Russians in the air, stormed enemy positions, hit the occupiers from an ambush, landed the invaders in the air with a charge of 200 kg of plastid and repeatedly successfully mined the area - left -surprises- and -split- Russians into atoms.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/06/try-zakony-robototehniky-shho-staye-na-zavadi-vybaglyvym-nazemnym-dronam/	2024-10-06T02:22:26-07:00

How civilians became military for two days: intensive from the legendary 46th. Photo report ArmyInfo...	On the chevrons there is a silver -Barbut- type helmet and golden wings. The 46th Airmobile Brigade conducts the -Start Your Journey- basic military training intensive for civilians. Several hundred applications were submitted. Specialists of the recruiting group selected a little more than fifty men and women. Different age. Different professions. Some had served and fought, but most were on the territory of a military unit for the first time and wore a uniform for the first time. From socks and uniforms to body armor, helmets, sleeping bags and combat weapons, the cadets were provided with all the essentials and equipment for living and training in the field. These days, they live according to the routine of military personnel. The course program was written in minutes. Classes were held at several educational locations using the carousel method. Tactical exercises and weapons handling techniques, fire training including combat shooting, tactical medicine, engineering and mine training, piloting, control and counter-UAV. As Colonel Andrii Khoruzhiy, deputy commander of the brigade, said, -I am the head of this course. I was authorized to create this plan with the Basic General Military Training Course in mind. This course is fundamentally different from the general BZVP course - it lasts 30 days, and in 2 days we gave civilians the opportunity to familiarize themselves with what the army is, and then decide whether they want to serve in our brigade. Our task is to motivate these people to choose our team. If they choose another DSHV brigade, we will not be offended by them, because DSHV is one big family. We support everyone and everyone supports us.- Lt. Col. Bohdan Krasko, head of the training department of the 46th separate airmobile brigade of the DSHV, gave details: — We chose the main key features of the BZVP — these are fire training, tactical training, tactical medicine, the procedure for countering UAVs, as well as UAV control itself, engineering training. In general, all servicemen who come to the DSHV brigades go to the training center. The training center provides basic general military training. For 30 days, they have classes on fire, tactical medicine, attention is paid to mine safety, direct mining, studying the operation and countermeasures of UAVs, throwing grenades and much more. In particular, they learn the basics of survival, the concept of field hygiene. So that, being in positions, I understand how to take care of myself, how to look after myself, to make sure that there are no frostbites, overheating and any other ailments, the names of which I may not even know. They even teach cadets how to cook their own food - that is, not only know how to open a dry ration and heat it up, but also understand what you can eat and what you can't. How to get water. Taking into account the experience of the DSHV teams, changes are constantly made to the training program. During the day, the cadets went through all the training locations. They were shown samples of weapons that are in the brigade - both of domestic production and of allied countries, and there were also trophy weapons. On the firing line, they tried to hit targets - many succeeded. Samples of mine-explosive devices - both ours and trophy ones - were presented at the engineering training site. From time to time, the drone of UAVs was heard from the sky - they were training future operators, on the tachmed - some sitting, some lying down, diligently turned the turnstiles, other cadets trained with automatic weapons. As one of the course participants answered: -Now I understand much better what my husband told me - even if the war doesn't touch you, you should be ready for it.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/06/yak-czyvilni-na-dva-dni-staly-vijskovymy-intensyv-vid-legendarnoyi-46-yi-fotoreportazh-armiyainform/	2024-10-05T21:00:46-07:00
During the defense of Kyiv, he finished the course reading to the students: the story of deputy comb...	The following story is about Major Vadym Prokopets, a deputy combatant in one of the units of the Security Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Before the large-scale invasion, the military man taught at Taras Shevchenko Kyiv National University. He is a candidate of physical and mathematical sciences, an associate professor. How is it — to hold lectures during the defense of Kyiv? But why did Vadim join the army, despite his armor? He told our correspondents about it. My decision to join the military was not spontaneous. In 2018, a terror defense battalion was formed in our area, and an acquaintance invited me there. I signed a reservist contract that same year. Attended schools and training that took place in the battalion. And when the full-scale invasion began, I already knew where I was going, what position I was in, and where my machine gun was. When the invasion began in 2022, I jumped right in from day one. I was deputy chief of staff of the mobrobot battalion — recruited people for our service... We didn't sleep at all for four days, forming the battalion. About the quarrel with the TCC, the parents of his students in the battalion and the collapse of the Russian Federation: the story of deputy combatant Oleksandr Panarin Since 2022, I have been serving in this unit all the time. He performed the duties of an operational on-duty command post, and simply a deputy chief of staff, performed the duties of a company commander. Now I have a new position — the deputy commander of the artillery battalion. Since July last year, our unit has been performing tasks in the Kharkiv region: these are Streleche, Krasne, Morokhovets, July There we covered the state border. I won't say that there were intense battles there, but the constant shelling was annoying. Then we were transferred to the Donetsk direction, with the 93rd brigade we were in Klishchivka, Andriivka. We fought there for two months. Then there was a rotation, then again — Klishchiivka. Then they transferred it to Lyman. And after that, with the 5th separate assault brigade, they performed combat missions near Bakhmut, then — Sumshchyna on the border with the Kursk region... Therefore, I can say that our battalion has very good combat experience. Before the beginning of the large-scale invasion, I worked at the physics faculty of Taras Shevchenko Kyiv National University. Position — Associate Professor of the Department of Optics. My workplace is saved... By the way, literally two days ago, while on vacation, I stopped by my native faculty. At the very beginning, on March 22, my native university helped with protective equipment — they gave me a bulletproof vest and a helmet, which was an invaluable help at the time. I am the author and co-author of textbooks and study guides for our students in the subjects I taught. He prepared another textbook, but did not have time to publish it. This is from analog electronics. The manuscript is already ready, it remains to -comb- it and submit it to the publishing house. I was supposed to hand it in for printing in the spring of the 22nd, but it's lying at home, my hands can't finish it. Waiting for the end of the war. My professional experience and knowledge of electronics came in handy during the service: our unmanned systems platoon received defective initiation boards of the detonation of the ammunition of an FPV drone. After investigating the board, I found the reason, and repaired these boards, which were then used during combat work. …By the way, my student, whom I taught, came to our battalion. It was in the early days, at the end of February 2022, when people were accepted into the unit. It was just that there was light masking then, it was dark... I have a stack of papers, I use my phone to shine the light so that I can write clearly. I am asking for the next name. He says: -Ananyivskyi-. I'm like: stop, something familiar. And he: -Well, I'm your student!...- What's more, this student came to our battalion with his father. Another moment came to mind. During the defense of Kyiv, my university asked me to complete the course -Introduction to Analog Electronics-. And what to do: I finished reading the course in the evenings, via Zoom. ...By the way, I had reservations as a teacher from the very beginning. It still works. But, you see, my motive is very simple. I know that if Russia comes here, there will be no Ukrainian universities, no Ukrainian education, no Ukrainian science, nothing. That's why I decided — to take up arms.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/06/pid-chas-oborony-kyyeva-dochytuvav-studentam-kurs-istoriya-zastupnyka-kombata-i-vykladacha-vyshu-vadyma-prokopczya/	2024-10-05T20:50:24-07:00

Strictly speaking, this agreement is only part of the agreement to re-equip the vehicle fleet of the special-purpose units of the Ministry of Defense of Belgium. Initially, this program was to be implemented by the Jankel Armoring Limited company, which undertook to re-equip 199 -Mercedes- for the Belgian commandos. However, Jankel went bankrupt and its assets were taken over by NP Aerospace. French edition of Solondais positions NP Aerospace as a leading British manufacturer and integrator of advanced armor systems. Such enterprises, in particular, specialize in the conversion of commercial vehicles, -hanging- protective -armor- on them. Regarding the implementation of the contract with BeMOD, in addition to the production of new LTTV vehicles for the Belgian military, this agreement also includes lifetime technical support for the LTTV vehicle fleet, which NP Aerospace will use its proven Vehicle Systems, Services and Parts business unit to deliver. In addition to the LTTV contract, NP Aerospace has also signed an operational support agreement with BeMoD for its Rapid Response Vehicle (RRV) fleet, the intellectual property of which is now owned by NP Aerospace. The LTTV vehicle is designed to provide a modular and configurable tactical support vehicle that benefits from the use of rotary units that allow you to quickly change the role of the machine for the versatility of the operating platform. With a payload of over 3 tonnes, depending on the final vehicle specification, the LTTV has 3 main variants to support special operations, including an ambulance variant. Along with a user-customizable, fully integrated set of military subsystems that includes a detachable ballistic protection package, a rollover protection system (ROPS), weapon mounts and communications equipment. BeMoD's Lt. Col. Jean-Francois Gennot said: -We are very pleased with the acquisition of the assets of Jankel Armoring Limited by NP Aerospace, which has enabled us to modify our current contracts and maintain our special equipment fleet. NP Aerospace's long track record in this sector is very promising and we look forward to a long and hopefully fruitful collaboration.- James Kempston, CEO of NP Aerospace, commented: -Following our recent announcement of the acquisition of the assets At Jankel Armouring Limited we are indeed very pleased to announce the award of this major contract which has been offered to us by the customer BeMoD. We are currently preparing everything so that the LTTV program will work and meet the expectations of customers.

Why is Russia lying about the Ukrainian presence in Syria	At first, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service claimed that the special services of NATO countries and Ukraine were allegedly preparing a -provocation with the use of chemical weapons- in Syria together with local -armed groups-. And now the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergey Lavrov, says that Ukrainian instructors are allegedly training international terrorists in Syria together with the United States. At the same time, the Russians traditionally do not provide any evidence. As explained by the head of the Center for countering disinformation of the NSDC, Lieutenant Andriy Kovalenko, the main focus of the narrative of this disinformation campaign is aimed at the Middle East, the countries of the Global South, as well as the American information field. — This is an attempt by the Russians to create an information background that Ukraine is, they say, a -terrorist state.- Now this is a key information threat at the international level, he noted. In fact, it is Russia that is one of the causes of instability in the Middle East and can carry out a provocation in Syria. Previously, Russian propaganda justified the use of chemical weapons in Syria by the forces of Bashar al-Assad, and Moscow also maintains relations with the Taliban, Hezbollah, Hamas, and ISIS. That is, Russia provides political support to authoritarian regimes that have killed thousands of civilians, further undermining global security. Against the backdrop of rising tensions in the Middle East, Kremlin propaganda is trying to use this situation to create a negative context around Ukraine. In this way, Russia continues to promote the narrative of alleged -Ukrainian terrorism- in order to discredit Ukraine in the eyes of the international community.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/06/navishho-rosiya-breshe-pro-ukrayinsku-prysutnist-v-syriyi/	2024-10-05T20:30:39-07:00
The military told what tactics the enemy is using in the South	This was reported by the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn in a national telethon -The only news-. The spokesman noted that the enemy rarely uses heavy armored vehicles and weapons in such assaults. He mainly uses small high-speed vehicles such as motorcycles, buggies, ATVs. -They are designed to quickly overcome the distance from one trench to another, so as not to blow up on the mine-explosive barricades that are installed in front of the defense line to stop heavy equipment,- added Vladyslav Voloshyn. According to the colonel, light equipment quickly overcomes them and does not blow up. So the assault team goes into the trench, followed by the entrenchment team. -Such tactics brought success to the enemy in other directions. Therefore, most likely, he will continue to use it in the Zaporozhye region as well,- the spokesman noted. As reported by ArmyInform, on The number of assaults in the Zaporozhye direction decreased, but the intensity of the attacks did not decrease.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/05/vijskovi-rozpovily-yaku-taktyku-vykorystovuye-vorog-na-pivdni/	2024-10-05T11:09:54-07:00

At the crash site, part of the wing can be seen, as well as the landing gear and many small parts. Fortunately, none of the local residents were injured. At first, there were several versions in the information space: the downing of the Su-34 or Su-25 by the Defense Forces of Ukraine, the -friendly fire- of a Russian aircraft on its own, or the crash of a Russian fighter jet. However, the version with the plane was not confirmed. Currently, the most likely version is that it is a Russian heavy combat unmanned aerial vehicle -Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik-B-. This is particularly indicated by the atypical gray pixel camouflage, which is not found on the Russian Su-25. Also, in the video of the device falling, you can see a silhouette similar to the Russian S-70 UAV. CONFIRMED: Russian -Hunter- Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik-B UCAV was shot down by Russian Su-57 fighter jet with AA missile. Why? No answer, for now. https://t.co/mpPpc0LvtG pic.twitter.com/foCGeO5igZ — Clash Report (@clashreport) October 5, 2024 Head of the Center for countering disinformation of the NSDC, Lieutenant Andriy Kovalenko reported , that the Russians have been developing the -hunter- for quite a long time, since 2009. So far they have produced three units and three more are under development. Russian media later reported that the UAV had lost control, so the Russians shot it down so that it would not be delivered to Ukrainian forces relatively intact for examination by experts. There is also eyewitness video showing that the UAV was shot down by an air-to-air missile fired by a Russian aircraft at close range. After the missile hit the target, the plane immediately turned around and flew towards the temporarily occupied territories. All this happened in the sky above the battle line. According to Russian developers, the Hunter UAV is designed not only for reconnaissance. It can deliver bomb strikes in a pair with the Su-57. The cost of such a UAV is estimated to be $15 million. It is stated that its speed is up to 900 km per hour, and its range is up to 3,000 kilometers. It can carry up to 7 tons of bomb load. It has a jet engine as a power plant. These drones are not officially adopted by the Russian army, it is likely that it was a test in combat conditions, which ended in disaster for the enemy. Currently, we are waiting for official information from the Defense Forces of Ukraine regarding the type of enemy aircraft and the circumstances of the event.

There is a change in the Strikers team: the American army will receive new armored vehicles	As note experts of the defense portal Army Recognition, such modernization is part of a large-scale program to update the mechanized units of the US Army with the aim of increasing their combat effectiveness in the conditions of modern armed conflicts, ArmyInform reports. The Dragoon Stryker, currently in service with the US Army and officially known as the Infantry Carrier Vehicle-D (ICVD) Dragoon (-Dragoon-), is a variant of the Stryker family of armored vehicles developed by General Dynamics Land Systems. It was created in response to the need for increased firepower in the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) of the US Army. Development of the Dragoon Stryker began in the mid-2010s, when the Army realized the need for better-equipped vehicles to counter potential adversaries with their own armored vehicles. The Dragoon Stryker entered service with the US Army in 2018, significantly increasing the firepower of SBCT units. It was quickly deployed in various brigades, becoming an integral part of the mechanized forces of the US Army. Despite its effectiveness, advances in technology and battlefield needs prompted the Army to seek further improvements, leading to the development of the ICVVA1-30mm, which will replace the Dragoon with more advanced systems and improved capabilities. The ICVVA1-30mm, which replaces the older Stryker Dragoon variant, is designed to provide enhanced capabilities, including increased firepower and increased engagement ranges. The integration of the 30mm Medium Caliber Weapon System (MCWS), a key upgrade from its predecessor, is at the heart of these improvements. This new system allows troops to engage targets from greater distances and with greater accuracy and lethality, offering a significant tactical advantage in combat. Such modernization has been going on for several years. In 2022, Oshkosh Defense, a subsidiary of Oshkosh Corporation, delivered the first upgraded Stryker Double-V Hull Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICVVA1) of the US Army. The delivery was part of a contract for 269 platforms that included 30 mm MCWS. The origins of this upgrade date back to June 2021, when the US Army selected Oshkosh Defense, along with partners Pratt Miller Defense and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, to integrate the 30mm MCWS on the Stryker ICVVA1 platform. In addition to armament, the ICVVA1-30mm has significant improvements in other critical areas. It is equipped with advanced -day/night- optics, which significantly improves the machine's ability to identify and hit targets in different lighting conditions. The upgraded platform also enhances situational awareness by providing troops with real-time, high-resolution data about their surroundings to improve decision-making in rapidly changing combat scenarios. The machine is built on the state-of-the-art DVHA1 base chassis, which provides numerous performance improvements, including increased power for better mobility and durability in challenging environments. In addition, the upgraded chassis has the large electrical power needed to support the machine's advanced electronics and systems. With 269 such platforms to be delivered under the contract, the ICVVA1-30mm will soon become a cornerstone of the US Army's armored vehicle fleet. The US Army is replacing ICVD Stryker Dragoon 8&#215;8 armored vehicles with more modern combat platforms ICVVA1-30mm.

Why are the occupiers scaring the residents of Kherson region with contaminated water	In particular, the so-called governor of the Kherson region, Volodymyr Saldo, in a comment to Russian propagandists, lied that the Ukrainian authorities were preparing to use chemical and bacteriological weapons to pollute the reservoirs of the Kherson region. At the same time, propagandists present Russia as a -savior-, thanks to which ru-propaganda seeks to strengthen the authority of the Kremlin in the occupied territories. This is not the first time Russians have spread fakes about water pollution in the Kherson region. For example, as early as August, enemy telegram channels were spreading reports about an alleged outbreak of a bacterial infection in Kherson, which threatened residents of Ukrainian-controlled areas. Propagandists claimed that the disease was caused by -pollution of the Dnieper by the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers- and the failure of sewage treatment plants. It was outright nonsense. With similar statements, collaborators and Kremlin proteges in the occupied territories are trying to discredit the Ukrainian government in the eyes of the civilian population. And by accusing Ukraine of preparing to use prohibited types of weapons, the Russians often cover up their own crimes or prepare an information cover for the preparation of provocations. Statements about the possible use of chemical, biological, or bacteriological weapons are intended to cause panic among the population and discredit the Armed Forces . Therefore, you should not believe them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/05/navishho-okupanty-lyakayut-meshkancziv-hersonshhyny-zarazhenoyu-vodoyu/	2024-10-04T20:41:47-07:00
Jackson, but not Michael: the tank commander told how his crew fired 280 rounds a day	As he says about himself: -I have two and a half years of combat experience, and it all started simply: I came to the military commission, said that I was a volunteer, I wanted a contract. Sent to the 1st tank division. I wanted to get into intelligence, but when they heard that I had a higher education - the Dnipro Metallurgical Academy, the battalion chief literally locked me in the tankers.- He talks sparingly about the beginning of the large-scale invasion: — We fought near Chernigov&#8230; I was a tank gunner. Then near Lysychansk. The most memorable thing was how we as a crew stood in closed positions. And it turned out that we -poured- all day (at the enemy. - Ed.), we had about 10 conveyors per day, which is 280 shots. And it turned out that our batteries died, and we were already working manually, and we could not even move ourselves. Then the crew stood in one position for a week - they fired from there, loaded there, slept there, ate there. In the end, the Russians calculated the landing where the tank was standing and began to -cover-. It was not possible to withdraw independently, so another tank came after Jackson's tank. He tried to pull the car out of the landing, but the cables broke, and the tank stopped right in the middle of a clear field. Jackson, smiling, recalls that situation: — We were ordered to leave the tank, and we ran to the second tank. It's funny to talk about it now, but we ran to that car and we don't know what to do next. And here the drone flies. At that time, we were used to the fact that only our drones flew. Well, we waved our hands at him, and literally in a minute or two after us, the 120-mm mortar started working. That's where it became ridiculous. Then the two crews simply jumped into the tower and drove away. They settled down miraculously - one gunner in his place, I climbed under his feet, into the conveyor of the loading mechanism, the tank commander was next to me, the mechanic sat in the commander's place, and the tank commander remained outside, and drove from above, because there was no other way. Arta is hiding, the tank is humming, we are going&#8230; So they ran away. That same evening we returned and collected our tank. After those battles, Jackson was offered a new position - a tank commander, and he went to training. When asked what has changed with the new position, he thinks a little, then calmly says: - Now there is more responsibility, I would say. Because, as a gunner, I was responsible for the cannon, for hitting the target. And now I have to completely lead the crew, know the duties of all members, when necessary, help them, give them hints. Currently, the responsibility is much higher. Currently, there are two young soldiers in his crew, and while there is time, they are undergoing adjustment. Everyone understands that there are new battles ahead, so they are studying hard.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/05/dzhekson-ale-ne-majkl-komandyr-tanka-rozpoviv-yak-jogo-ekipazh-robyv-po-280-postriliv-za-den/	2024-10-04T20:30:49-07:00

This was reported by the Minister of Defense Ruben Breckelmans of the Netherlands and /->US President Joe Biden. During Operation Allied Force in 1999, the combined forces of the NATO bloc used, among other things, such combat vehicles and aviation munitions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. At that time, NATO's goal was to stop the criminal actions of the Yugoslav dictator Slobodan Milosevic. Now they will -bring to justice- a new war criminal - Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. 20 Dutch F-16s took part in the NATO operation, and military facilities on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were hit, including with AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon glide bombs. ArmyInform reminds how the American AGM 154 JSOW and Dutch F-16 Fighting Falcon have already beaten dictators and terrorists in different parts of the world and explains how they will help defeat Russia -according to the Yugoslav scenario-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/04/vony-rozbombyly-slobodana-miloshevycha-na-shlyahu-do-ukrayiny-uchasnyky-operacziyi-soyuzna-syla/	2024-10-04T11:19:38-07:00
More than 400 -evaders- and 13 people on the -scheme -disabled--: a criminal group for avoiding mobi...	Details of the exposure and announcement of suspicion in the high-profile case of the organization of a scheme to evade mobilization in Kharkiv were reported in Kharkiv Oblast Prosecutor's Office and Security Service of Ukraine. The head of one of the inter-district medical and social expert commissions of the Kharkiv region is involved in the organization of a corruption scheme to evade mobilization. Together with his 12 accomplices, he organized a scheme to evade mobilization. Among the organizer's -assistants- were his subordinates, heads of various medical institutions in Kharkiv and the region, as well as other civilian mediators. One of the figures, in addition to holding the position of director of the primary health care center, is a deputy of the city council in Kharkiv Oblast. Group members used personal connections to find potential clients. For money, the dealers helped evaders avoid the draft on the basis of fake disability certificates. The impersonators made false documents about the alleged presence of diseases, which are the basis for registration of disability. To do this, they falsified all the medical documentation from the history of their client's -disease-, including his stay in inpatient treatment. Then the event organizer ensured the preparation of a fictitious decision of the medical and social expert commission on the appointment of a disability group. -Clients- did not even come to a medical institution, and all the necessary documentation about -disability- was received by mail or through intermediaries. This allowed men to deregister from the military register and go abroad. According to the preliminary estimates of the law enforcement officers, as a result of the illegal actions of the members of this criminal group, more than 400 people of draft age from different regions of Ukraine were able to illegally avoid mobilization. The cost of such -services- ranged from $2,000 to $5,000. The amount depended on the urgency of the -order-. Law enforcement officers conducted 89 searches at the places of work and residences of members of the criminal group and in their cars. During the investigation, a large number of conscript files, draft records, mobile phones, computer equipment with evidence of illegal activity, money in the amount of more than half a million US dollars, almost 80 thousand euros, more than 1 million UAH and even Russian rubles, which , probably obtained by criminal means. The law enforcement officers detained the dealers, they are in custody. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Khmelnytskyi, an official was detained who earned $6 million from swindlers. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to violate the law, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces or recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/04/ponad-400-uhylyancziv-i-13-osib-na-shemu-invalida-u-harkovi-vykryly-zlochynnu-grupu-z-unyknennya-mobilizacziyi/	2024-10-04T10:53:18-07:00

A military serviceman reported corruption: for the first time in the history of Ukraine, the whistle...	This was reported by at NAZK. The payment was made in accordance with the decision of the Appeals Chamber of the Higher Anti-Corruption Court dated November 9, 2023 in case No. 991/2197/22. In 2020-2021, the military serviceman held the position of director of the internal audit department of the Ministry of Defense. In 2021, he filed a statement with the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), in which he reported that he had been offered an illegal benefit of UAH 24 million for acting in the interests of a certain LLC. It was about attracting specialists to conduct an unscheduled internal audit of the execution of a state contract. The audit group had to draw up a positive report based on the audit results regarding the completeness, quality and compliance of the performed works with the terms of the contract. This would allow the company to receive full payment of more than UAH 400 million for the arrangement of the special facility and claim future contracts from the Ministry of Defense (Part 3 of Article 369 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). Based on this fact, NABU registered a criminal proceeding under Part 3 of Art. 369 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. The specialized anti-corruption prosecutor's office (SAP) carried out procedural management and maintenance of the prosecution in court. The Supreme Anti-Corruption Court (SCAC) issued a verdict in the case on March 24, 2023, appointing the defendant &#8211; the former deputy head of one of the departments of the Ministry of Defense was sentenced to 4.5 years in prison. At the same time, the court refused to pay the reward to the whistleblower, motivating the decision by the fact that he officially reported the discovered crime within the scope of the exercise of his official powers and therefore has no right to a reward. The whistleblower appealed the said decision and at the end of 2023, the Appeals Chamber of the VAKS satisfied his appeal and awarded the payment. According to Art. 53-7 of the Law of Ukraine -On the Prevention of Corruption-, the whistleblower can receive 10% of the amount of the monetary amount of the subject of the corruption crime or the amount of damages caused to the state from the crime after the court's conviction. However, the amount of the reward cannot exceed three thousand minimum wages established at the time of the crime. The possibility of rewarding corruption whistleblowers was introduced back in 2019. Until now, the courts have passed two positive decisions on payments, but due to the lack of regulated payment procedures, the actual execution of court decisions was impossible for a long time.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/04/vijskovosluzhbovecz-povidomyv-pro-korupcziyu-vpershe-v-istoriyi-ukrayiny-vykryvach-otrymav-vynagorodu/	2024-10-04T10:28:51-07:00

Not Moses - the law enforcement officer was detained while returning money to the evaders who did no...	The Special Prosecutor's Office of the Western Region reported this on October 4. The investigation established that the accused, together with his accomplices, tried three times to arrange an illegal trip to EU countries for two conscripts for $24,000. First, the shipper ordered the -clients- to arrive in Chernivtsi, a month later in Transcarpathia, and finally - in Odesa. It was there that his assistant met them, took them past the checkpoints, took them to the starting point and ordered to wait for another -colleague-. The latter was supposed to show them the further direction of movement through the marshland. However, the evaders were frightened and refused such a route, and demanded their money back.

The Ministry of Defense told how the introduction of standards allows producing weapons cheaper and ...	- How do the standards affect the production of OBT? - All the material values ​​of the modern world are made according to the standards. The more complex the technique, the more standards are applied to it. Thousands of standards are applied to the smartphone. A car consists of a million small parts and all of them are manufactured, tested and tested according to standards. Armaments and military equipment are no exception. The development of new technologies stimulates the change of standards and vice versa. This is an inextricable circle, that is, it is appropriate to recall Deming's PDCA cycle here - Plan (Plan), Do (Do), Check (Check), Influence (Act) - which is described in the international standards of the ISO 9000 series. By the way, these standards are the basis NATO quality standards AQAP series and European standards EN 9100 series. International standardization bodies consider standards to be the most effective method of innovation. - How do standards affect the quality of products or services? - Modern standards are the basis and guarantor of quality. Equipment manufactured and tested in accordance with standards is a priori of high quality. The development of technology stimulates the renewal of standards and vice versa. In the world, this process has acquired a frantic rhythm. Some standards are updated almost every year. Countries that invest resources in standardization are today leaders in world markets, including OBT. Because their products are of high quality and are in demand. — How do standards affect the scaling of production? — Standardization became an effective tool for introducing and scaling innovations as early as World War II. In preparation for the war, Nazi Germany rationalized its industry by completing five tasks: general typification, numbering, unification of products, improvement of technology, rational choice of enterprise size. This led to a 20-fold increase in aircraft production alone from 1933 to 1939. A key factor was the standardization of aircraft engines and airframes. Great Britain and the United States had similar approaches. At the beginning of World War II, more than 6,000 standards were in force in the USSR. Over 2,000 new standards have been implemented over 5 years and over 1,000 have undergone changes. This was due to wartime conditions, the need to save resources, the change of scarce materials to non-scarce ones, the introduction of new technologies and production methods. The best start to scaling any production is to develop a standard that manufacturers can implement. — What priorities does Ukraine have for the standardization of air defense systems? — The military standardization body is the Main Department of Technical Evaluation and Quality Control of Air Defense Forces. The activities of the General Directorate are aimed specifically at solving problems related to the quality of air defense systems, scaling their production, development standards, the introduction of NATO standards and standards in the field of defense of the member states of the Alliance. In 2023, we identified work priorities. This is the development of general technical requirements for OVT products and their components. Compliance with these requirements will ensure the unification, compatibility and interchangeability of OBT products, will create prerequisites for the rapid introduction of innovations and scaling of production. This will significantly strengthen the domestic defense industry and the defense capability of the country. On September 12, standardization specialists held a seminar on the problems of developing standards for a comprehensive system of general technical requirements for OMT. Representatives of 5 research institutions and more than 30 representative offices of the customer took part in it. Discussed problems, prepared proposals for interaction with developers and acceleration of standards development.

Shelling has increased, but saboteurs have decreased: why are Russian DRGs mining the border	What is the purpose of Russian saboteurs setting mines, the spokesman of the State Border Guard explained on the broadcast of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- Andriy Demchenko of the Service of Ukraine. — The threat of sabotage by the enemy is not only in the direction of Sumy region, we must be ready in other directions as well. This is a threat to both Chernihiv Oblast and Kharkiv Oblast. But, fortunately, we are recording a decrease in attempts by Russian sabotage and intelligence groups in general, he said. The nature of the actions of Russian DRGs has also changed. - If we take it earlier, they tried to track down the positions of Ukrainian soldiers and join the battle in order to destroy our guys or capture the position. On the other hand, the number of attempts to enter the territory of Ukraine has decreased significantly. But we also note that, despite the fact that Russian saboteurs do not try to engage in battle with Ukrainian soldiers, they still carry out their sabotage actions, the spokesman said. Now, instead of fighting, they focused on trying to mine the area. — They are trying to mine some direction somewhere, hoping that Ukrainian soldiers will blow up using those means. But the boys are well aware of the threat posed by such actions of the enemy. Therefore, all components of the Defense Forces, and units of the Armed Forces and the National Guard jointly act and monitor the situation, including using UAVs and technical means of monitoring the area in order to prevent such actions of the enemy, Andriy Demchenko assured. Earlier ArmyInform told, how soldiers of the Defense Forces took 28 prisoners in battle and destroyed the DRG.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/04/pobilshalo-obstriliv-ale-pomenshalo-dyversantiv-navishho-rosijski-drg-minuyut-prykordonnya/	2024-10-03T23:11:29-07:00

Guided air bombs of the Russian Federation: an expert told how to fight them	— The most vexing problem that currently exists on the battle line, despite the large artillery shafts, FPV drones, is the use of rocket-guided aerial bombs. Why are they so painful? Because the bomb itself cannot be shot down. So far, such technologies have not been invented. Is it possible in the future, yes, if a countermeasure is developed. the Russians use two main calibers of KABs: FAP-250, FAP-500. For example, FAP-500 are high-explosive aerial bombs weighing 500 kg. Explosives - up to 200 kg. That's a lot. The length is up to 4 meters. Bombs are equipped with universal planning and flight correction modules. The main carrier is the Su-34 fighter-bomber. Can take on board up to six such bombs. Su-34s can launch these bombs without entering the zone of action of Ukrainian air defense, that is, they can strike from a distance of 40-50 km from the contact line. Now there are already examples of launching KABs even from 70 km. Of course, we are not even talking about the accuracy of hitting targets. The lack of accuracy of the rifle is compensated by the high power of these ammunition. Let's model the situation conditionally. The carrier aircraft accelerates to 900 kilometers. Accordingly, the bomb has an even greater inertial velocity. And at this gigantic speed, a 500 kg aerial bomb reaches its target and causes colossal devastating losses. the Russians managed to improve the glider module itself, its aerodynamic qualities and improve aiming. There is even a version of the aerial bomb with GPS navigation. the Rashists are destroying Ukrainian -bulwarks- with KABs and destroying all buildings where defense can be maintained. Such tactics allow the so-called large infantry shafts of the Russian infantry to advance in Donbas. It is necessary to destroy the Russian military airfields where the Sukhoi Su-34 fighter-bombers are based, Petro Chernyk believes. Long-range cruise missiles such as the AGM-158 JASSM can do this. It is an American high-precision air-to-surface cruise missile. There are already modifications of these missiles with a range of 900 km. The second option is to hit the Su-34 and airfields of the Russian Federation with drones. — Again, the network of airfields in the Russian Federation is quite large. It is very difficult to destroy it all at once. Another very interesting option is how the Defense Forces counter the KABs. The F-16 can carry up to 6 AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles. It is an American air-to-air guided missile. Can destroy air targets at a distance of up to 180 km. Let's simulate the situation. The Su-34 of the Russian Federation must approach the point of the strike mission, the standard operating distance to the targets is approximately 40-50 km. F-16, accordingly, covers this distance with a missile, the operational range of which is up to 180 km. And then it's a matter of technique and skill of the pilot - our plane shoots down the KAB carrier - Su-34. — The Su-34 aircraft can still evade one or two missiles, because it is equipped with a number of technological devices: heat traps, including lasers and aerosols that -blind- the missile warhead. But if 2-3 missiles went in the direction of the Su-34, then it is doomed. So far, there is no confirmed information that this particular type of missile was provided to us by the Americans as part of the military-technical assistance. F-16s were already operating in Russian cruise missile interceptor mode. And it is likely that AIM-9 Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missiles are already in use. They were provided to us, but the range of these missiles is 20 km. Of course, they can be used to shoot down cruise missiles and -shahedis-. It must be understood that our F-16s will not enter the range of Russian S-300, S-400 air defense systems and enemy Su-30 and Su-35 fighters in order to get the KAB carriers. This is absurd. Do not forget, the Rashists have long-range R-37 air-to-air missiles. According to open data, it is considered to be an aircraft missile with one of the largest range characteristics. But there is a nuance. Its use requires targeting by an A-50 long-range radar detection and control aircraft. The Russians still have R-27 missiles, as well as R-73, R-74 short-range missiles. I emphasize that as soon as AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles appear, it will definitely be a powerful and serious weapon against Su-34 aircraft as carriers of air defense systems.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/04/kerovani-aviabomby-rf-ekspert-povidomyv-yak-z-nymy-borotysya/	2024-10-03T21:00:46-07:00
Hezbollah learns forgery in the Russian Federation: footage from the war in Ukraine was borrowed fro...	In particular, Middle Eastern propagandists, who learned forgery from Russian methods, are spreading a video of the destruction of an alleged Israeli tank by Hezbollah. In fact, this is a fragment of a video from a drone about how the Ukrainian anti-tank unit 66 OMBr destroyed the Russian T-90 Proryv battle tank, famous in enemy propaganda, near Liman in Donbas. This video was shared on Twitter by the information agency ArmiyaInform on October 8 last year. The fake was detected by French OSINT channel Random Debunk. OSINT (Open source intelligence) is open source intelligence that gathers military, political, economic and other information from the Internet. Often, OSINT analysts find operational information by conducting social media monitoring, radio monitoring, and using publicly available Earth remote sensing data (such as Google Earth). In particular, on the night of February 24, 2022, just before the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, OSINT researchers from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, using Google Maps, tracked a large traffic jam on a road in Russia leading to the Ukrainian border. An hour after this information was made public, Russian troops began an invasion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/04/hezbolla-vchytsya-u-rf-fejkorobstvu-kadry-z-vijny-v-ukrayini-zapozychyla-v-armiyainform/	2024-10-03T20:49:39-07:00
Armored car -Buran- ASV: the expert told about the enemy BBM, which was captured by the ZSU	According to the Ukrainian military, the -trophied- Russian car was relatively new and, as one of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said, -in the middle of the armored car there was a rather familiar smell, like in the Zhiguli-. Taking into account the fact that this BBM is quite rare, the ArmyInform reporter asked Andrii Haruk, a well-known weapons researcher, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny, about it. — I will note right away that -Buran- is not formally a military armored car. It was created as a private initiative and was supplied to a wide variety of consumers, from the Belgorod region's energy companies to the Moscow metro (why does the metro have its own armored car, don't ask, I don't understand). - So who was the creator of this car? - I will start with the fact that -Buran- was created by the RIDA company from Nizhny Novgorod. Previously, this firm was known as -Nizhny Novgorod Aviation Society-, but relations with aviation did not work out, so the company switched to more down-to-earth matters. - Did you manage to find out the specifics of the creation and functioning of this armored car? - The design of the -Burana- is based on two main principles - the use of a ready-made chassis and modularity. It was based on the GAZ-3308 -Sadko- truck, which was positioned as a replacement for the GAZ-66, but never gained much popularity. The armored car is equipped with a diesel engine of the YaMZ-534 series, one of which (with a power of 136 hp) is also installed on a truck. But on the -Buran- they used the YaMZ-53442 variant with a capacity of 210 hp. Gearbox - at the request of the customer, mechanical or automatic. The armoring is declared according to level 2 of STANAG 4569 - that is, it withstands the impact of a 7.62x39 mm armor-piercing bullet from a distance of 30 m. - And what, exactly, is the modularity of the -Burana- chosen by the Russians? - The basis is the -Buran- SS platform (Chassis Cab - -chassis and cab-) with a single-row two-door cab. One of the modules can be installed on this platform, which gives options: &nbsp; —One gets the impression that with this vehicle and its variants, the Russians once again tried to -catch up and overtake America-, because the modularity of combat armored vehicles has been used in the USA for more than a decade. By the way, how long has this BBM been produced in Russia? And is it only in the Russian Federation? - I would like to note that the first samples of -Burans- appeared in 2017. Since 2019, the car has been produced under license in Belarus under the name -Asilak- - with a less powerful (150 hp) YamZ-53444 engine, and since 2021 - in Armenia as -Lusan-. In both cases, the volume of production is probably small and hardly exceeds half a hundred copies. - At first glance at this car, it can be confused with other armored vehicles of the invaders, right? frame chassis In my opinion, the disadvantages of a frame structure for an armored car are an increase in the weight of the car and its height. In addition, -Tiger- is superior to -Buran- in terms of passability and security. Well, as a -civilian- machine, it doesn't even have turrets for armament. - How could this BBM attract the enemy army? - The Buran did not arouse interest in the Russian military. Instead, a certain number of such armored vehicles in the ARS6 variant (or perhaps a single copy at all) was purchased for the Kadyrov 141 special motorized regiment. In its composition, -Buran- -lit up- at the beginning of April 2022 in the battles for Mariupol, but after that it did not appear anywhere. In 2022, machines in the ASV variant were purchased for energy workers of the Belgorod region. Probably, it was one of them that became the Ukrainian trophy - especially since the camouflage is similar. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/04/broneavtomobil-buran-asv-ekspert-rozpoviv-pro-vorozhu-bbm-yaku-zahopyly-zsu/	2024-10-03T20:41:21-07:00
Only old men go to battle, or What do Dutch F-16s have in common, Sergey Zhadan and the Terminator	She also stirred up Russian propagandists, who ->already bombarding from the fact that the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will receive another batch of legendary aircraft. Speaking of the Dutch F-16s, the Russians are trying to manipulate official statistics, talking about the seemingly extraordinarily high number of accidents experienced by these aircraft in the Royal Netherlands Air Force. What is wrong with the Russians' fiction about the F-16, explains ArmyInform. , which the enemy propagandists are trying to promote, the F-16 Fighting Falcon is as if it is an outdated aircraft that cannot be effective in Ukraine when repelling Russian aggression. At the same time, attention is paid not only to the year of creation and adoption of fighters, but also to the time of production of specific machines. The history of the combat aircraft from the moment of its first flight really more than half a century. The -Fighting Falcons- were in service with the Royal Netherlands Air Force for as many as 45 years - the first fighter from the F-16s purchased by Holland arrived at the Leeuwarden air base on June 6, 1979. In total, during the operation of the aircraft, the Royal Netherlands Air Force received 213 F-16 fighters of various modifications (177 F-16A, 36 F-16B), which were manufactured by the Dutch company Fokker. Deliveries were made between 1979 and 1992, so the -latest- Dutch F-16s entered service in 1992. Does the long stay in the formation indicate the low quality of the aircraft? Not at all. Rather, it is proof of the high quality of tactical and technical characteristics of fighters capable of performing combat tasks equally effectively both in the early 1980s and in the early 2020s. The first combat missions of the Dutch F-16s date back to the 1990s. The Royal Netherlands Air Force then took part in NATO operations in the Balkans: During Operation No-Fly, 18 Dutch F-16 fighters were based at Villafranca Air Base in Italy. On 12 April 1993, they became the first NATO aircraft to enter Bosnian airspace for -combat air patrol-. In the future, the F-16s operated in -swing mode-, simultaneously providing air superiority and support for UN forces on the ground. In particular, on November 21, 1994, almost 40 NATO aircraft, including 4 Dutch F-16s, bombed Udbina Airport in Croatia. 20 Dutch F-16s were involved in combat operations over the territory of Yugoslavia during Operation Allied Force. In one of the air battles, it was the pilot of the Dutch F-16 who shot down the Yugoslav MiG-29 fighter with an AIM-120 missile. The Dutch Fighting Falcons then participated in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014, based first at Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan, and later in Kabul, Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif. In view of the absence of the enemy in the air, their main task became reconnaissance and strikes on ground targets. In 2011, Dutch F-16s participated in NATO's joint operation -Unified Protector- (Unified Protector) in Libya. And in 2014-2018, they participated in the Inherent Resolve operation against the Islamic State (ISIS) in Iraq and Syria. During all these operations - patrolling the airspace, conducting reconnaissance, conducting air battles, striking ground targets - the Dutch F-16s proved their high combat qualities, and the Dutch pilots demonstrated excellent combat training. Of course, during the long period of active operation of a large number of aircraft, moreover, in the conditions of hostilities, it was not without troubles. In total, Dutch F-16s suffered 44 crashes, in which the Royal Netherlands Air Force lost 15 pilots and 36 aircraft irretrievably lost. However, according to official figures from the Ministry of Defense of the Netherlands, since the retirement of the last problematic F-16 aircraft on September 21, 2006, things have been going well, and in 18 years the Dutch Fighting Falcons have had no casualties. At the same time, at least more than 60 combat vehicles were in service and in active use. In the Netherlands itself, pairs of F-16s patrolled the airspace of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg and monitored hydraulic structures, using special equipment to detect possible defects and weakening dams. A total of 61 F-16 fighters were in service with the Royal Netherlands Air Force as of 2021. All of them underwent regular technical inspections, repairs and modernization. Given the many decades of operating experience and the local production base, they are particularly high-quality. Obviously, today, the basic configuration of the Dutch F-16 can be considered Block 15OCU with updated navigation systems and ALQ-131 Block-2 EW modules, guidance of high-precision Lantirn weapons. They are quite capable of using the full range of major weapons, including AIM-120 and JDAAM missiles, as well as AGM-154 JSOW high-precision, medium-range guided bombs, etc. So, if the Dutch F-16s can be considered old in terms of age, they are by no means outdated or inferior. In their 50s, they are similar to 50-year-old Serhiy Zhadan, who joined the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine and can give a head start to fighters younger than him. The famous Terminator meme saying -Old, but not obsolete- fits perfectly with them. The model has been in service for many years, but has not lost its relevance and is able to effectively perform combat tasks. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the new US aid package to Ukraine includes Joint Standoff Weapon's cruise bombs.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/04/u-bij-idut-lyshe-staryky-abo-shho-spilnogo-v-niderlandskyh-f-16-sergiya-zhadana-ta-terminatora/	2024-10-03T20:30:25-07:00
And then the enemy blows up on this - the sapper paratroopers showed their work	The video about the fighters appeared on October 3 on the brigade's channel. Each task of a sapper is associated with a risk to life, since you have to work in close proximity to the enemy. The key in this field is maximum concentration and composure. It requires physical training and a high level of self-control. -Thanks to their work, the enemy stops and suffers huge losses on the battlefield. And our brigade can fulfill its main task — to win and protect the lands from the invaders!-, the brigade commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, in the 77th Airborne Dnieper Brigade of Airborne Assault Troops The Armed Forces of Ukraine told how equip their UAVs with ammunition. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/i-potim-protyvnyk-pidryvayetsya-na-czomu-desantnyky-sapery-pokazaly-svoyu-robotu/	2024-10-03T11:58:10-07:00
Switzerland will provide funds for demining Ukraine	About this during the meeting agreed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Reconstruction of Ukraine Oleksiy Kuleba and Ambassador of Switzerland to Ukraine Felix Baumann. Felix Baumann noted that while in the position of ambassador, he visited the regions several times, which gives him the opportunity to independently assess the needs of Ukraine. He also emphasized that Switzerland has been implementing support programs for our country for a long time. These are issues of decentralization and recovery programs, as well as joint projects with Ukrzaliznytsia and assistance in preparation for the heating season. Currently, the Swiss government offers additional aid programs to Ukraine. -Another important focus of our cooperation remains the Early Recovery projects, within the framework of which the Swiss government plans to allocate 1.5 billion Swiss francs for reconstruction projects in Ukraine for the next 4 years,- the ambassador said. Of these, 1 billion will be directed, as before, to the self-government, demining and humanitarian aid sectors. The rest of the amount will be directed to recovery programs with the involvement of the Swiss private sector. -To emphasize the seriousness of our intentions, our representative will work here, who will be responsible for the implementation of this project. Right now, a delegation of the private sector is working in Kyiv, which is familiar with the needs of Ukraine in the areas for which the ministry is responsible, in the medium and long term,- said Felix Baumann.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/shvejczariya-nadast-koshty-na-rozminuvannya-ukrayiny/	2024-10-03T11:44:02-07:00

After Ugledar: where did the enemy aim next as long as the weather is dry	This was suggested by the officer of the 4th separate detachment of the Omega Special Operations Center on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- of the National Guard of Ukraine with the call sign -Docent-. - Ugledar stopped the enemy, there was a huge number of enemy personnel, he was partially destroyed, but still the power of the enemy remained and now the next target of the enemy will be the city of Selidove itself and its surroundings close to Pokrovsk. These are their primary tasks, he said. The officer explained the tactics of the Russian occupiers and suggested how they would try to advance. — They are trying to bypass populated areas, go through landings, somehow wedge themselves into our defenses, where there is a certain weaker resistance. That is, they are trying to pass our positions from all sides. Most likely, they will act from the side of Selidovoy, because there is almost a direct road to Pokrovsk, - said the soldier. He reported that the enemy is pulling up previously accumulated reserves and concentrating most of its forces in the specified direction. -It is observed that the enemy has equipment, there is infantry capable of carrying out assaults on our positions in the future,- said the guardsman. The change of season prompts the occupiers to take more active actions, as natural autumn will soon come and dirt roads may become impassable after the rains. — While the intermediate roads, the roads in the fields between plantings, are still stable. There was no significant precipitation. The enemy is trying to move close to our positions with both wheeled and tracked vehicles. That is, he is taking advantage of this weather now and wants to go on roads with a harder surface in the future, - said the soldier. The officer reported that the occupiers have an advantage in artillery and they have enough ammunition. And although the accuracy of Russian artillerymen is not high, the density of enemy fire creates serious problems for Ukrainian soldiers. -Unfortunately, the enemy has an advantage in artillery, the enemy's projectiles, such an impression has not ended recently, it still inflicts fire damage. The enemy's shots, as a rule, do not hit the target, but the enemy's artillery still has an advantage, - reported -Docent-. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that ZSU left Vugledar due to the threat of the environment: the enemy has activated reserves, but the defenders of Ugledar are already burning the equipment of the occupiers in new positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/pislya-vugledaru-kudy-naczilyvsya-vorog-dali-doky-stoyatyme-suha-pogoda/	2024-10-03T10:42:01-07:00

And the main thing now is to really fill such a priority with solutions. -It is clear how important it is to fully implement each of our agreements with our defense support partners. Timeliness in support is stability at the front. The front must be strengthened. And long range must finally be provided exactly as it is needed to end this war. Everyone in the Alliance understands what the needs are,- said the President. Volodymyr Zelenskyy added that anti-aircraft defense for Ukraine is no less important before winter, and also real progress for the joint shooting down of Russian missiles and drones. -We see that one of the main reasons for the lack of security in the skies of Ukraine, and in particular near the borders of NATO — our neighbors — is the lack of decisions on joint work and joint defense. What works in the skies of the Middle East and helps the defense of Israel can also work in the skies of our part of Europe — in Ukraine, helping to save lives in the same way. There are special technical solutions, there are quite effective tactics. Today, we talked about this in particular with Mark Rutte, we will continue to convince all partners that we need to implement what is needed for effective protection of the sky,- said the President.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/prezydent-rozrahovuye-na-progres-z-partneramy-u-spilnomu-zbytti-rosijskyh-raket-i-droniv/	2024-10-03T10:24:37-07:00

Family-style espionage — a brother and sister from Kharkiv got 15 years	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on October 3. They turned out to be two local residents, a brother and a sister, who were remotely recruited in 2023 by a staff member of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces (better known as Gru). According to his instructions, the agents monitored the routes and schedule of the railway echelons of the Defense Forces. The perpetrators paid special attention to the places of temporary stops and unloading of military equipment and ammunition. The enemy planned to use the intelligence information to prepare airstrikes against the strategically important infrastructure of Ukrzaliznytsia, as well as to plan sabotage. SBU employees exposed both agents in advance and, after documenting their crimes, arrested them in March of this year. According to the investigation, the traitors came to the attention of the occupiers because of their anti-Ukrainian posts on pro-Kremlin channels. During the investigation, it was established that the perpetrators also collected information about the bases of Ukrainian troops in the Balaklia and Izyum districts. During the search, mobile phones and computer equipment with evidence of correspondence with the Russian special services were seized from the detainees. On the basis of the evidence collected by the investigators of the Security Service, the court found both perpetrators guilty under Part 2 of Art. 28, Part 2 of Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed by a group of persons under martial law according to a prior conspiracy). As reported by ArmyInform, the Security Service detained a 23-year-old contract worker of one of the military units of Ukraine, who in May of this year voluntarily left his place of service and corrected Russian airstrikes in the Vinnytsia and Sumy regions. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/shpygunstvo-po-simejnomu-brat-ta-sestra-z-harkova-otrymaly-15-rokiv/	2024-10-03T09:41:38-07:00
CPD: the Russians are spreading false claims about the attack on the Kursk NPP	reported this by the head of the Countering Disinformation Center, officer of the Defense Forces of Ukraine Andriy Kovalenko. According to him, the Russian claims about the alleged attack on the nuclear power plant by four HIMARS missiles, all of which were intercepted by the Russian air defense system, are an outright lie. -Of course, since no one attacked the NPP, there is no point in this. the Russians show some kind of fire in a chicken coop and on the video there is an explosion on the ground. What is the purpose of shelling the nuclear power plant? She is far away. There is nothing to do with the attack on the Kursk NPP,- said the head of the CPD. As ArmiyaInform reported, recently pro-Kremlin Telegram channels distributed a fake memo from the Embassy of Great Britain in Ukraine, in which Britons are advised to avoid contact with TCC and SP employees, not to maintain eye contact with them, not to respond to racist statements on their part and not to sign no documents.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/czpd-rosiyany-poshyryuyut-nepravdyvi-zayavy-pro-ataku-na-kursku-aes/	2024-10-03T09:36:20-07:00

Illegal tourism to the border for $7 thousand: two taxi drivers were exposed for transporting people...	About this informs October 3 State Border Service of Ukraine. -The transfer to the neighboring state was organized by a local resident of Odesa, involving accomplices - taxi drivers - in his scheme,- the message reads.

Wanted to escape to Poland, wandered through the forest for a day, drank dew from plants and ended u...	About this informs October 3 State Border Service of Ukraine. -The quest for illegally crossing the border for a resident of Kirovohrad Oblast has ended in Rivne Oblast,- the report says. Seeing the Ukrainian servicemen, the man started shouting at them in Polish. The border guard immediately detained the unknown person. The violator turned out to be a 53-year-old native of Kirovohrad Oblast. He tried to enter Poland illegally, but got lost and ended up near the Ukrainian-Belarusian border. He explained to the border guards that he was given advice on the route of movement in one of the messengers by an unknown person who allegedly volunteered to help in illegally crossing the border. Having set off, the man followed the route indicated by the stranger. -Since I planned to get to Poland quickly, I decided not to take extra things with me, I didn't even grab water. However, something went wrong during the illegal trip, he got lost and walked through forests and swamps for almost a day,- the DPSU reported. But instead of going to the border with Poland, he ended up near the border with Belarus. -I thought that the forest here was the same as ours in the Kirovohrad region, more pine, but it turned out that there is a swamp, a swamp, grass up to the chest, an impassable -jungle-. There are no people anywhere. I heard dogs barking, chickens clucking and realized that there must be people somewhere. I had no idea where I was. Then I decided that I had enough of these adventures, I would make my way to people. I came across a pond, from which I drank water, because before that I had to collect dew from plants,- said the detainee. An exhausted man ran into Ukrainian border guards. Seeing people in military uniform, he thought they were Polish border guards, so he addressed them in a foreign language. The man was brought to administrative responsibility under Art. 204-1 of the Criminal Procedure Code -Illegal crossing or attempted illegal crossing of the state border of Ukraine.- ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to violate the law, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces or recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/hotiv-vtekty-do-polshhi-dobu-blukav-lisom-pyv-rosu-z-roslyn-j-opynyvsya-bilya-kordonu-z-bilorussyu/	2024-10-03T08:11:27-07:00
Jump over mines: the task of the enemy's light vehicles was explained in the Armed Forces	Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesman of the -Khortytsia- military training center, drew attention to this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon. — The enemy received light buggies from the reserve base of motor transport in the southern district. Quad bikes, motorcycles, light cars are used by the enemy precisely in such assaults, when they are carried out by the forces of small groups of infantry up to a detachment of up to ten people. They use these vehicles to quickly move infantry on the battlefield. This infantry moves quickly from its point of departure to our fortifications, clings to our fortifications there, and continues such assaults in order to gain a foothold. And already after that, other groups approach and capture these trenches, these fortifications, the spokesman said. He explained exactly what the advantages of light high-speed maneuver vehicles are on the battlefield. — There are mine-explosive barriers on the battlefield, they are designed to prevent powerful and heavy equipment from passing through. Light vehicles such as buggies or motorcycles pass through anti-tank mines. That's why they use just such means to overcome this certain distance quickly, - explained the military man. The officer said that the enemy is currently storming in small infantry groups for the purpose of combat reconnaissance, and then move on to more active and massive assaults. - Basically, these are small infantry groups that engage in reconnaissance and search operations. That is, small groups of infantry try to start, to start a battle, to conduct reconnaissance, to identify our fire means, to identify the weak points of our defense, and only then they prepare to conduct assault actions continuously. And now we can say that this is already ongoing reconnaissance and reconnaissance, - said the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV. At the same time, the occupiers in the South have not decreased their means of attack, they do not feel any shortage of ammunition and are hitting in the direction of the positions of units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine with almost all the weapons available in the Russian army. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, are there signs of Russian preparations for a major offensive in the South.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/proskochyty-po-minah-zavdannya-legkyh-transportnyh-zasobiv-voroga-poyasnyly-u-zsu/	2024-10-03T08:01:15-07:00

The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces announced that the Ukrainian military successfully destroyed the rare and very valuable Nebo-M radar station with the help of ATACAMS ballistic missiles. This Russian radar is a very difficult object to defeat, because it works in stealth mode, scanning the horizon for aerial objects. According to available information, the enemy has only 10 working systems of this type left. The fighters of the 63rd and 60th brigades decided to compete against the Russians on motorcycles. In total, six suicide motorcyclists went to our positions. How many arrived - see in the stream. These and other topics are discussed by our presenters - junior lieutenant Serhii Lipko and lieutenant colonel Serhii Misyura. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/potuzhnyj-udar-po-rosijskyh-aerodromah-madyar-palyt-rosiyan-i-tehniku-strim-iz-pryfrontovogo-mista/	2024-10-03T07:32:41-07:00
Enemy KABs on Kharkiv: why are the Russians hitting the city and why are they succeeding in it	Why do the Russians manage to beat Kharkiv Oblast on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon? Vitaly Sarantsev. — The trend of using tactical aviation has grown significantly. Yesterday, 17 strikes were carried out on the border area and, in particular, on Kharkiv, 17 bombs were dropped on border settlements and on the city itself. As a result, more than half a hundred civilian buildings were destroyed, he said. The military officer explained that the enemy is trying to justify such terrorist tactics by deceptively and manipulatively shifting responsibility to the Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian authorities. -Such terrorist tactics of the enemy continue - he tries to justify it on his information resources, presents it as a self-attack, although we all know what and how and from whom it is flying at us and at the civilian population,- said the officer. The activation of the enemy's use of tactical aviation was caused by the loss of the Aggregate Plant in Vovchansk and other defeats widely known in the media. The occupiers are also trying to influence the mood in Ukrainian society in this way. — They actively use them in order to make a little excuse for the loss of the Aggregate Plant. In addition, they constantly try to keep the population in a negative tone, destabilize the situation. By striking KABs against the civilian population and civilian infrastructure, they fuel all this with information as well, that is, they drive a wedge between the army and society, try to discredit the military-political leadership, the spokesman explained. He told what is the main plan of the Russian invaders in this regard. — Their main message is that we are allegedly shelling our own infrastructure, our own cities, our own population in order to create informational noise and thereby cover up the discontent about the loss of Ugledar's defense forces. But here everyone can see it, it's all in plain text. It is written, we understand that it is simply an element of the information war that the enemy is waging against us. Of course, the use of KABs is his terrorist tactic, which he can't give up because he just doesn't know any other way, the officer said. The military also explained why it is so difficult to fight with this type of weapon. — First of all, this is due to the fact that the adversary has retrofitted this type of ammunition, added a universal planning and correction module to it, which allows you to drop these bombs outside the range of our anti-aircraft defenses. He drops them far from the contact line, far from the Russian-Ukrainian border. In fact, he makes these resets after several tens of kilometers, the spokesman said. In view of this, the means of Ukrainian air defense cannot stop these terrorist actions of the military army of the Russian Federation. The enemy takes advantage of this and drops bombs anywhere, as long as they fly in the direction of Ukrainian territory. - KAB is a fairly powerful ammunition, but at the same time it is not accurate, it flies where it wants. Its flight path depends on many factors - weather conditions, humidity and air temperature. That is, there are a lot of things that need to be taken into account so that he more or less accurately reaches his goal. But we understand that all this is not taken into account, that the enemy drops these bombs wherever he wants and hits the civilian population there, explained the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that last day, the Russians again hit the Kharkiv region with anti-aircraft missiles, as a result of which 20 people were injured, including a three-year-old child.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/vorozhi-kaby-po-harkovu-navishho-rosiyany-byut-po-mistu-i-chomu-yim-cze-vdayetsya/	2024-10-03T07:21:00-07:00

These drones have become a key part of Russian attacks. On the basis of the collected evidence, the SBU notified Zakharov of suspicion for assisting in waging an aggressive war based on a previous conspiracy by a group of individuals.

Away from shelling: local residents are being evacuated from the border of Sumy Oblast	Why this is necessary, on the air of the national marathon -Edyny Novyny- explained the spokesman of the OTU -Siversk- Vadym Mysnyk . — The regional military administration carries out additional emergency evacuation. Currently, we are trying as much as possible to evacuate people from those communities that suffer the most from terrorist shelling from Russia, because the Russians in most cases hit civilian infrastructure, civilian residential buildings, any enterprises, educational and medical institutions. With this tactic, Russia confirms its status as a terrorist state, he said. The spokesman noted that despite the fact that the evacuation has been going on for the second year, there are still local residents who categorically refuse to leave. Therefore, certain categories of the population are forcibly evacuated. — The evacuation process continues for the second year. Unfortunately, there are sections of the population that fundamentally refuse to leave. But we are trying to evacuate the vulnerable categories of children and people with disabilities immediately under mandatory evacuation in a forced manner so that they are not harmed, - the military officer explained. He emphasized that by refusing to evacuate, local civilians are primarily putting their own lives and health at risk, as well as preventing the Ukrainian military from effectively repelling the Russian invaders. — Unfortunately, people remain in some border settlements, and this is a zone of active hostilities. Of course, the civilian population is very vulnerable, first, neglecting their own safety. Secondly, it is not very convenient for the military to conduct hostilities when the civilian population is nearby, - concluded Vadym Mysnyk.

Capital repair program in -lnr-: two years to repair one or two houses per city	According to Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, the list includes 32 settlements. Of these, only five were occupied in 2022, and four settlements remained dilapidated. However, most of these towns and villages did not suffer significant destruction from the hostilities. The pace of recovery raises questions, as in an average of two years, each city will account for only one or two majorly renovated houses. However, the main problem is the lack of contractors willing to participate in the restoration work, which has already become an ongoing problem. As Artyom Lysogor noted, in Seversko-Donetsk contractors leave houses half-restored, replacing windows and doors, but avoiding repairs to important water supply, heat supply and sewage systems. Despite this, the cost of the work is calculated as per the fully executed order, which creates opportunities for corrupt practices. As reported by ArmyInform, from October 1 in the occupied territories of Luhansk region, the autumn conscription has started, which is actually another stage of legalized forced mobilization.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/programa-kapremontu-v-lnr-dva-roky-dlya-remontu-odnogo-dvoh-budynkiv-na-misto/	2024-10-03T00:21:09-07:00

Every leader knows exactly what to do. It is important to be decisive-, reacted to the attack President of Ukraine . In addition, two aviation munitions hit the suburbs of Kharkiv - on the territory of the Dergachyv community. Prosecutors and police investigators are working on the spot to record the war crimes of the Russian army. As reported by ArmyInform, yesterday the Russian troops once again shelled the city of Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region. , hits were recorded in several locations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/aviabomba-vluchyla-u-pyatypoverhivku-v-harkovi-postrazhdalo-10-lyudej-sered-nyh-tryrichna-dytyna/	2024-10-02T21:03:52-07:00
About the return of prisoners, the rights of conscripts and the soft power of Ukraine. ArmyInform in...	About the exchange of prisoners and cooperation with the UN, about the International Committee of the Red Cross and the rights of conscripts and much more, the ArmyInform correspondent asked the Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine for human rights, Dmytro Lubinets. Mr. Dmitry, the other day you stated that about 40% of those returned from captivity are persons who had the status of missing under special circumstances and were not confirmed by the ICRC. What is the difficulty of returning such people from captivity? How does this process take place from a legal point of view and what are its difficulties? - Legally, a person is considered to be in captivity after his confirmation by the ICRC through the National Information Bureau. Other sources of information that may testify to the fact that the missing person is in captivity are the testimony of servicemen released from captivity and the identification of a person based on the results of appropriate examinations. In addition, I exchange information with the Russian ombudsman regarding the missing defenders of Ukraine. In this way, it is also sometimes possible to find out the possible stay in captivity of a missing person. Difficulties may arise from the fact that the Russian Federation itself does not know where they are keeping this or that Ukrainian prisoner of war. However, relatives of missing persons should remember that the confirmed status of captivity does not affect the exchange procedure: both confirmed and presumed missing persons are returned. —You have more than once reported on cases when conscripts have conflict situations with the TCC. Does your team monitor these cases on social media themselves or do they contact you? Can you provide any statistics on such requests? Are there statistics on court appeals by conscripts? Whose side does Themis take? — About cases of conflict situations between the TCC and SP and conscripts, I learn from my team through appeals from citizens and from social networks and the media. We receive dozens of requests every week, and as I have already reported, in most cases we do not find violations. However, I would like to emphasize that there are violations in some of the appeals, and we are responding to them. Regarding court statistics, I do not have such statistics. But I note that in the last month there have been positive decisions about canceling the draft of the reserved ones. Also, many resolutions of the TCC on bringing conscripts to administrative responsibility are repealed. — Recently, videos with demonstrative executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war have appeared quite often on the Internet. You report that you will forward these materials to the appropriate authorities. How many such cases have been recorded since February 24, 2022? — In April, the Prosecutor General's Office reported that since March 2022, they had become aware of 54 cases of executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war at the hands of Russian occupiers during an attempt to surrender. We do not have more recent statistics, but more and more often Russian soldiers kill Ukrainian soldiers who surrender themselves as prisoners. This is recorded by both law enforcement agencies and international organizations. In September alone, I responded to executions twice. The Institute for the Study of War published a report on September 6 that also noted this. I believe that this is done, in particular, in order to demoralize Ukrainian society and reduce resistance. However, seeing such actions, we must become even more determined in the fight against the aggressor and bring the perpetrators to justice. - What chance does our country have that war criminals will be brought to justice for war crimes, violations of the Geneva Conventions? - On August 21 of this year, Ukraine finally ratified the Rome Statute, but the problem at the moment is that our criminal legislation not yet harmonized with the European one. Therefore, the process of bringing to responsibility will be quite long. In particular, because the Russians are committing tens of thousands of war crimes in Ukraine, and each crime must be thoroughly investigated. Steps are being taken for this. The Prosecutor General recently reported that Ukrainian law enforcement officers have a joint plan with the International Criminal Court to investigate Russian war crimes in Ukraine. National courts already regularly sentence Russian servicemen for crimes committed in Ukraine. —Are you comfortable working with the ICRC? What is the difficulty of working with this organization? I have repeatedly criticized the International Committee of the Red Cross for not fulfilling its mandate, especially because they do not visit Ukrainian prisoners of war. It is the only organization that has this right. Yes, the Russian Federation really deliberately and publicly violates any norms of international humanitarian law and does not allow the ICRC to the places of detention of Ukrainian prisoners of war. However, the ICRC has been silent all these years about Russia's violation of IHL. It got to the point that recently in Donetsk, Russia killed three full-time employees of the ICRC and wounded two more. These were citizens of Ukraine. Reacting to these cynical murders, the president of the ICRC did not mention Russia in a single word. Instead of condemning it, demanding an explanation from the Russian Federation, they remain silent. This is not neutrality, this is inaction. If the old methods do not work, then it is time to implement new ones, to find ways to fulfill your responsibilities. The ICRC's biggest donors should also understand this, so that the resources provided by them are used effectively. After my constructive criticism, ICRC representatives refuse to join meetings with families of prisoners of war. To our official invitation to the last meeting in Odesa, they replied that they -kindly- and -understandingly- ask to treat this. —What about the UN? Do you not think that the organization has -outlived itself- and is not effective? - It is worth considering that the UN is a very extensive organization with many projects and directions. We have good cooperation with some. For example, with the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. They record the crimes that the Russian Federation commits in Ukraine and call a spade a spade. So, in their recent report, they called Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure a war crime and potentially a crime against humanity. However, there is also the UN Security Council, where the Russian Federation is still one of its five permanent members. It is one of the main bodies of the UN, which is responsible for maintaining international peace and security. Only the Security Council has the right to make decisions binding on all UN members. The situation, when the Russian Federation is still a member of the Security Council, is absurd, because Russia itself has been brazenly violating international security for the past dozen years, not only in Ukraine, but also in other countries. — International humanitarian law during the war in Ukraine. Does it work? - International humanitarian law works unilaterally. Ukraine adheres to it, but the Russian Federation does not. Ukraine does not prevent, and even encourages international organizations to come and monitor the state of observance of the rights of civilians, Russian prisoners of war. In particular, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine officially appealed to the UN and the ICRC to join humanitarian response measures in the Kursk region. Such visits would also debunk Russian propaganda about Ukraine's alleged non-compliance with IHL. Russia absolutely does not comply with IHL: daily targeted attacks on residential buildings and civilian infrastructure, torture of prisoners of war, forced displacement of children. In the de-occupied territories, the National Police has registered more than 104,000 criminal proceedings for war crimes since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. —How does the new law on mobilization correlate with the rights of people in a state under martial law?—The Constitution of Ukraine clearly defines which rights and freedoms cannot be restricted during martial law. At the same time, all other rights may be limited by Presidential decree. Based on the existing restrictions in the Presidential decree on the introduction of martial law in Ukraine, during the preparation of the law on mobilization, the restrictions were taken into account and applied. Also, recently on my social media pages, I published a series of posts explaining the new legislation on mobilization, which talked about notification of conscription, deferment, verification of military records and liability for non-performance of duties. The procedure for each of these processes is clearly described there. And if your rights are violated, you can contact the Office of the Ombudsman. —How do the mobilization processes in Ukraine correlate with the global experience of mobilization processes?—The Russian-Ukrainian war is the largest war in the world between the regular armies of two states since World War II. Therefore, currently, in modern conditions, no country in the world has faced the same challenges in mobilization issues as Ukraine. We don't know how other countries would handle it. However, the key thing for me is that, in the conditions of martial law, the mobilization processes must take place with respect for the constitutional rights and freedoms of a person and a citizen in Ukraine. - Please name the three main issues veterans come to you with. Can it be resolved quickly? - Protecting the rights of veterans is a priority area of ​​work of the Office of the Ombudsman. Last week, together with our partners, we organized a forum in Vinnytsia, where we discussed issues of veteran policy. Veterans contact me mainly regarding the delay in the process of processing and reviewing documents, the issue of establishing the status of a participant in hostilities, the provision of appropriate medical services, or the violation of their right to receive benefits from loan payments. In some cases, it is possible to renew veterans' rights quickly - one letter from our institution is enough, but it also happens that the process can take a long time. —Name the three main problematic questions that the relatives of the dead and the missing turn to you with. What is the complexity of such appeals? — General problematic questions voiced by relatives of the dead and missing persons during meetings and personal receptions are: Responding to the violation of their rights, I direct relevant requests and letters to the relevant state bodies. We regularly hold meetings both in our institution and in the regions with the families of missing, prisoners of war and fallen servicemen, where we provide answers to their questions. —How do you manage to get children out of the hands of children? What is the most difficult thing about this mechanism? How do you interact with relatives? And if these are orphans, what is the difficulty? How does Qatar fit into this story? Are there other countries that help us in this as a third party? — Thanks to the work of the state bodies of Ukraine, in particular the Office of the Ombudsman, non-governmental organizations and intermediary countries, it has already been possible to return 948 Ukrainian children from the territory of the Russian Federation and the TOT of Ukraine (as on September 25, 2024). Separately, I am grateful to Qatar, because currently the dialogue with the Russian side takes place through the mediation of this country. There are countries that are ready to help privately, so I cannot name them. If the deported children have relatives in Ukraine who want to become their guardians, then of course we cooperate with them. If these are orphans or children deprived of parental care, then the situation is more difficult, even at the level of finding a child, because they are abducted en masse from children's homes in the temporarily occupied territories, after which they can be given for adoption to Russian families with a much higher chance, which, I emphasize, is illegal. Children can change their personal information, making it difficult to find information about their whereabouts. Every child return case is a great achievement. However, there are still nearly 20,000 children who need to be returned. One of the mechanisms for this is the International Coalition for the Return of Ukrainian Children, which has already been joined by 40 countries. Within the boundaries of the coalition, there are projects in which we invite participating countries to join. The main goal of the Coalition is to coordinate mutual efforts and intensify cooperation to solve the problem of illegal deportation and forced relocation of Ukrainian children by Russia. — A delegation of children liberated from the Russian Federation spoke at the UN, met with representatives of foreign countries. How can the results of these meetings be evaluated, did it help foreign partners to understand what challenge Ukraine faced? — Of a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the decisions of our international partners and the fact that they listened to the children's speech, we, of course, cannot install. However, when they see real people in front of them, hear their stories, they begin to understand that behind the numbers in the statistics of deported and forcibly displaced Russian children are real destinies. It is a soft power that I believe is making an impact. - What story related to the rights of native fallen soldiers struck you the most? - Every story of native fallen of our Heroes and Heroines is always a tragedy. Accordingly, every violation of the rights of family members of fallen soldiers affects. After all, support and protection of families who have lost a loved one is the minimum that the state is obliged to provide. We also monitor the right of family members of deceased (deceased) servicemen to receive one-time cash benefits paid to the families of the deceased. An analysis of more than 130 appeals on this issue received by the Ombudsman's Office in 2023 revealed numerous facts of delay or inaction by TCC and SP employees in submitting requests to the military unit to obtain documents, as well as delays from the command of military units in providing documents. - What happy end story from your work would you like to share? - We have a lot of happy end stories: these are the long-awaited meetings of those released from captivity with their relatives, the return of Ukrainian children, the renewal of veterans' rights. I will recall the story of the reunion of a mother-prisoner of war and her son, who had not seen each other for more than two years. During the exchange on May 31, the boy finally met his mother, who had returned home from captivity. The woman was on Azovstal. I would like to note that the boy was brought home by the Office of the Ombudsman from the TOT of Ukraine. Such stories inspire and give even more energy to work. - What would be a victory in the Russian-Ukrainian war for you? - The Ukrainian Peace Formula, which is based on the UN Charter, provides for the restoration of a just peace for Ukraine. This will be a victory, including the restoration of the territorial integrity of Ukraine, the withdrawal of Russian troops and the cessation of hostilities, as well as the release of all prisoners and deported persons. This is the 4th point of the Peace Formula, for which I am responsible as the Ombudsman of Ukraine and work on its implementation every day. Ukraine's victory is actually important not only for us, but also for the entire democratic world. Not everyone is fully aware of the threat posed by the potential loss of Ukraine. This will mean the destruction of world security and a return to the era of empires and colonies, in which no human rights will be discussed at all.

the Russians invented a tourist attraction for foreigners, but they were wrong: what went wrong	Recently, pro-Kremlin Telegram channels circulated an alleged memo from the Embassy of Great Britain in Ukraine, in which Britons are advised to avoid contact with employees of TCC and joint ventures, not to maintain eye contact with them, not to respond to racist statements from them and not to sign any documents. In fact, the brochure, the photos of which are distributed by propagandists, does not exist - it is a poor forgery of the Russian fakers themselves. In comments representatives of the diplomatic service informed Ukrinform journalists that the British Embassy in Ukraine did not print such flyers, and the information on the Internet is fake. In addition, when creating a fake, the Russians made a mistake - they indicated that in Ukraine there is a general mobilization of conscript men from 25 to 65 years old, and not from 25 to 60 years old, as it actually is. So, the purpose of this fake is to discredit TCC and joint ventures in the eyes of foreigners, to sow the false opinion that citizens of other states are also subject to mobilization in Ukraine, and TCC employees can supposedly -mobilize- them just from the street.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/rosiyany-vygadaly-pamyatku-dlya-inozemcziv-ale-pomylylys-shho-pishlo-ne-tak/	2024-10-02T20:52:11-07:00

The projectile hit the cleavage: the soldier Jackson told how our tankers knocked out an enemy tank ...	Our correspondent was told by a participant in the battle with the call sign -Jackson- about one of these episodes, which took place among the tankers of the 1st separate Siver tank brigade. That day, the commander of the tank unit set a task: to take a position. If necessary, hold the defense and wait for the approach of light armored infantry. Two -sixty-fours- moved towards the specified position, but in the war, not everything is going as planned. That time, Russian tanks overtook them and had already entered the mentioned position. As tankman Jackson recalls: — The most frightening thing was that no one expected that a Russian -80- would -fly- at us from the right side across the field. She jumped out and immediately fired a shot at the tank of our brothers. The projectile hit the -décolletage-, in front of the mechanic-driver. The second shot of the Russians was at us, but thanks to the mechanic-driver we managed to dodge. He counted to five and yanked the lever. Our tank literally jumped to the side, and we dodged that shot. Since our second tank was hit, the Russian expected that we would roll back, run away. It would be logical. But the crew and I decided to go to the end, press the Russian, and moved forward. And then it turned out to be simple - the Russian rolled out, aiming the cannon at the place where the tank was hit and where, according to his calculations, we should be. But we had already passed him and were behind him. And I just had to aim clearly and shoot. I remember that I wanted to see live and up close how the turret of a Russian tank flew away, but it turned out that I only fired one shot - there was a problem with the loading mechanism. With that single successful shot, -Jackson- managed to hit the engine and transmission compartment and completely destroy the engine of the Russian tank. He stood in the middle of the field. Our tankers waited for the Russian crew to get out, to either take them prisoner or destroy them, but in vain. In the meantime, tankers got out of our knocked out tank. Mehvod, unfortunately, died, the tank commander received burns, and the gunner was stunned. When the tankers were already on the armor, an order was sent over the radio to leave immediately - because they heard from the intercepts that the Russians were already directing artillery, and the tankers, together with their surviving comrades, rolled back. the Russian -eighty- still stood in the middle of the field, a little later another of our tanks simply shot and burned it. Not a single Russian tanker ever got out of the tank.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/snaryad-vluchyv-u-dekolte-voyin-dzhekson-rozpoviv-yak-nashi-tankisty-yedynym-postrilom-pidbyly-vorozhyj-tank/	2024-10-02T20:36:34-07:00
Cooperation causes damage: the US Army tested a Finnish mortar	As informs the official portal of the Scandinavian arms manufacturer, field tests took place in the first decade of September within the conference Maneuver Warfighter Conference in Fort Moore, Georgia, USA, ArmyInform reports. A crew of Soldiers demonstrated a variety of successful fire missions using US Patria NEMO 120mm Turreted mortar ammunition. A mortar system integrated into the US Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) and Fire Direction System (FCD), which has become a key achievement in the US-Finnish joint effort. Since 2020, Patria has been conducting a turret mortar feasibility study, including Foreign Comparison Tests (FCT) with the US Army. This study focuses on Patria NEMO, the world's leading turret-mounted mortar system, renowned for its versatility and effectiveness in a variety of combat scenarios. The Patria NEMO 120mm mortar complex is a remote-controlled turret weapon that can fire both direct and indirect fire, including while moving. One of its key features is the ability to simultaneously hit multiple rounds (MRSI), which allows hitting a target with up to six mines at the same time. In addition to a high level of protection, the NEMO system is designed to be light, compact and adaptable to different platforms: tracked vehicles, wheeled armored vehicles and naval vessels. The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) is a tracked military vehicle designed to replace the aging M113 series. The AMPV fulfills a variety of roles on the battlefield, offering enhanced protection, mobility and modularity. It is built on a tracked chassis similar to the Bradley fighting vehicle, which ensures high performance in various terrains and operating conditions. BAE Systems produces the AMPV, which is designed to perform a variety of mission types, including troop transport, logistical support, command operations, and medical support. Its configurations include a general purpose transport variant, a mission control variant for mobile command centers, medical evacuation and treatment vehicles, and a mortar transporter capable of providing indirect fire support. The main advantages of the platform include improved armor protection against small arms, artillery shrapnel and improvised explosive devices, which ensures better protection of personnel. Its high mobility allows it to operate effectively alongside other armored vehicles such as the M1 Abrams and M2 Bradley, making it a vital asset in modern warfare. AMPV's modular design, which allows it to adapt to different requirements on the battlefield, provides important flexibility and a sense of readiness for different combat and support roles. The US Army is looking to expand the capabilities of its Armored and Stryker Brigade Combat Teams by equipping them with rapid and accurate indirect and direct fire capabilities. These efforts are aimed at ensuring reliable protection of work crews, while reducing their physical load and minimizing the impact of impulse noise and blast overpressure. &nbsp; Patria NEMO 120 mm Turreted Mortar System integrated into the US Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV).

About the quarrel with the TCC, the parents of their students in the battalion and the collapse of t...	This time, our correspondents spoke with the deputy commander of one of the battalions of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksandr Panarin. Before serving in the Armed Forces, he taught at a school and university. How does Oleksandr measure the result of the teacher's work? Should the -Defense of Ukraine- school course be changed? But why did the hero of this interview quarrel with the TCC for several days? About it in our article. — Can a person who taught at a university or school apply his skills during military service? — I will tell you more, it was teaching skills that helped me adapt to the army. At first, I was a platoon commander in the unit for a month, but in fact during March 2022 I was engaged in setting up the vital activities of the battalion, because the unit was created from scratch according to the wartime staff. From the second month of service, I was actually assigned to the position of deputy company commander from the MPZ, then company commander, then battalion psychological officer, and now I am the deputy battalion commander. Before the army, my teaching load included pupils, students and even graduate students. And this teaching experience gave me the opportunity to establish normal work with subordinate soldier personnel. In our unit there were people from different social strata, different worldviews, but when they got together, it was necessary to communicate with them in simple words, without any clever constructions. And previous experience helped me in this. — Did I understand correctly that you worked in a school before teaching at a university? — No, at the same time. I had a load of 0.75 in a general secondary school in Kyiv. And one and a half rates of workload at the university. — What tasks did your unit perform at the beginning of the Russian invasion? — The battalion carried out the accumulation of servicemen for the Ground Forces and was responsible for the defense of one of the districts of Kyiv. Already as a company commander, together with my unit, I had an area of ​​responsibility and built defensive structures on the outskirts of the city. — Today society is discussing how to replace and update the school subject -Defense of Ukraine-. What is your vision on this subject? — I even joined the process of reforming -Defense of Ukraine-. I guess I risk being a bit involved: my wife is also an educator and was the moderator, actually, of the working group that developed the new program of the school course -Defense of Ukraine-. My position is, of course, it's all in time. Definitely. It's our big mistake that we didn't do this in 2014. We must understand today that Russia as a geopolitical entity will sooner or later cease to exist in the format in which it exists, that is, the Russian Federation within those huge borders. It will remain what is territorially called ethnic Russia. Because they will separate from it on a national basis, just like in 1917 and 1991, when there were previous disintegrations, in fact, in the form of the empire, in fact, in the form of the Soviet Union. Now will be the next stage. The Russian ethnicity itself will continue to live on the border with Ukraine. And she will continue to hate us, because a priori she will not consider herself to be guilty of not preserving her state, but us for the fact that we destroyed it. In addition to the practical component of this school subject, there is also an ideological one. I have in mind what we demonstrated first in 2014, in February-March, and then in February-March 2022, when the whole society stands up for the protection of the Motherland, for the protection of the state. And in this course at least elementary practical foundations will be laid. So that every graduate of the school knows what a weapon is, what a takmed is, etc. If every Ukrainian has this basic knowledge, then the enemy will think about whether to attack Ukraine. By the way, the enemy is currently copying us. They began to introduce a course where they learn to fly UAVs into their similar subject. They copy what we do. This also shows that the enemy is also watching this: how we raise our children, our future soldiers. Therefore, I am only in favor of these changes in the school curriculum. Children should have an understanding of the old truth: if you want peace, prepare for war. — And how would you rate the generation of your pupils and students in general? — In the first days of the large-scale invasion of those who said, -will anything come of this young generation?-, there were queues to the TCC are less than those about whom they said this. Do you understand? Those who were told that -there will be no people of you-, they just proved that their generation is absolutely normal and cool. Unfortunately, among my former students, who also enlisted in the army, there are already dead people&#8230; When the large-scale invasion began, I wrote on my social media that I was joining the army. Although at first they did not want to hire me as a teacher at TCC. Because he had the right to postponement. And I had to fight with the TCC for several days so that I would still be called up&#8230; And we discussed all this in social networks with my students. Parents of my students even served with me in the unit. Then there were funny moments with them during the service. I am a co-author of school textbooks on history, which are used by Ukrainian children. According to the amount of circulation, at least every third schoolchild in Ukraine studies using textbooks, where I am a co-author. And then in the unit, my parents came up to me and said that they had found a textbook with the same last name as mine. And I answered that yes, I am the author. — How can the result of a teacher's work be measured? — The result is my pupils and students. Perhaps only doctors and teachers can understand this euphoria when, having invested your knowledge and efforts in children, you later see the result. I always tell students that the result of my work is not in the test or exam they take. And when, in a few years after graduating from the university, they, walking down the street, will not go to the other side, but will come up and say hello, this will mean that I have done my job well. We never have an instant result, we all work for the future. Sometimes for a very long time.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/pro-svarku-z-tczk-batkiv-svoyih-uchniv-u-bataljoni-ta-rozpad-rf-intervyu-iz-zastupnykom-kombata-oleksandrom-panarinym/	2024-10-02T20:22:59-07:00

Two kilograms of explosives on the heads of the enemy - our drones have developed a new ammunition	A video about the ammunition appeared on October 2 on the brigade's channel. FPV operators deliver this ammunition under the door, on the floor, and if lucky - directly -into the hands- of the occupant. As soon as the enemy gathers somewhere, a package containing 90% TNT and 10% of a secret mixture ``according to grandmother's recipe'' goes there. The ammunition has already been used several times against the Russians in Vovchansk, Kharkiv region. As reported by ArmyInform, the drones of the 4th mechanized battalion of the Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky demonstrated last walk of the occupier in Luhansk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/02/dva-kilogramy-vybuhivky-na-golovy-voroga-nashi-dronari-rozrobyly-novyj-boyeprypas/	2024-10-02T11:17:11-07:00

I thank each of our combat brigades for their true resilience and true courage,- the head of state said. The President emphasized that every week, despite everything, our soldiers ensure a truly tangible defeat of the occupier. -And this is the most important thing — to exhaust the enemy and provide Ukraine with the opportunity to convince its partners of precisely such steps that can fundamentally and strategically change the military situation,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. He added that Ukraine very much needs determination from its partners in the long-range issue. -Individually, I want to thank every leader, all friends of Ukraine for understanding that the pressure on Russia is not enough now, and that is why - only why - the Russian leadership does not take diplomacy seriously. We need more strength,- said the President. As reported by ArmyInform, the command of the Defense Forces decided about the maneuver to withdraw Ukrainian units from Vugledar in order to preserve personnel and combat equipment. This allowed the Armed Forces to occupy new positions from which it will be possible to conduct further hostilities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/02/nashi-voyiny-shhotyzhnya-zabezpechuyut-spravdi-vidchutne-urazhennya-okupantu-volodymyr-zelenskyj/	2024-10-02T10:58:04-07:00
At home, the waves also help: the elements destroy the protective structures of the Kerch Bridge	Unprecedented measures of the Russian occupiers to strengthen the security of the illegal extension to the Ukrainian Crimea on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- commented the spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. — The enemy sees that the danger to this object, which they allegedly already protected as much as possible, still exists. And it, as a minimum, is not decreasing. Therefore, they are forced to react somehow. It is probably impossible to push the air defense to infinity, although they are trying. But, nevertheless, seeing the danger of using marine drones in particular, they are trying to block the water area, he said. However, there is nothing new in these actions of the occupiers - they have resorted to them before. The elements also make their corrections. -The weather makes adjustments to the plans of the occupiers, and periodically these structures are hit by the elements, so they are forced to restore them,- the spokesman noted. He emphasized that the Russians have objective reasons to worry about the safety of the bridge, as Ukraine has not given up its intentions to eliminate this illegal extension to the Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula. — I can confirm that the Russians are charging air defense there as much as possible. And it really seems that they are much more concerned about the safety of this facility than the safety of facilities within the Russian Federation itself. This is objective - you can see that the effectiveness in some cases is much greater right on the enemy's territory. Therefore, it can be concluded that they are trying to protect this building as much as possible, said the military officer. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that defensive structures of the occupiers in Crimea can withstand neither storms nor bribes, so the -shopopalo- that is being built next to the Kerch bridge will not be completed this season.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/02/vdoma-i-hvyli-dopomagayut-styhiya-rujnuye-zahysni-konstrukcziyi-kerchenskogo-mostu/	2024-10-02T10:42:33-07:00

He also said that today he listened to the report of the head of the Foreign Intelligence Service, Oleg Ivashchenko, regarding the strengthening of the Service and the work on extremely sensitive information obtained by our Ukrainian spies. -On the other hand, we are also working on the intentions of the enemy.

We are also grateful to the Ministry of Economy for maximally helping to invest, finance and expand our production capacity. But at the same time, our businesses are not fully loaded this year. Additional funding is required. Ukrainian defense industry is growing - here are a few examples. This year, we are producing more artillery pieces per month than any other country in the world.

Russia was caught in another fake about the destruction of the Ukrainian F-16	The claim was quickly denied by the X Network itself, which added a comment: -The photo shows a US Air Force F-16 that crashed in 2019.- The original image did not have the Ukrainian coat of arms on the tail of the plane, which indicates that the photo was -edited- by the Russians. Russian resources actively -dispersed- information about the alleged loss of four F-16 fighter jets as a result of an -unexpected missile strike- on September 26. This untrue information was presented without any confirmation or concrete facts. Now, finally, the fakers managed to get -proof- - a photo of one plane from 2019. In addition, pro-Russian sources spread a fake that a mural with a -lost- fighter jet had appeared in Arlington near Washington, where the Pentagon is located. what are we paying for?-. Such fake messages are aimed at manipulating public opinion. These are fabrications created to reinforce the narrative about the -inefficiency- of Western aircraft.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/02/rosiyu-spijmaly-na-chergovomu-fejku-pro-znyshhennya-ukrayinskogo-f-16/	2024-10-01T20:36:25-07:00
A symbiosis of stealth and precision: a new cruise missile with a flight range of 2,000 km was prese...	-With more than 20 years of experience in the design and production of combat-proven cruise missiles, Lockheed Martin (LM) has developed the AGM-158 XR concept to offer a significantly increased attack range that can be rapidly manufactured and delivered to the U.S. military,- noted in the official release of this well-known arms manufacturer from the USA, ArmiyaInform reports. The JASSM-ER and LRASM samples became the basis for the development of this missile with an increased range. The AGM-158 XR retains the characteristic trapezoidal profile and inconspicuous design characteristic of missiles of this family. However, the new ammunition has increased dimensions, which makes it possible to equip the missile with additional fuel and a heavier warhead. This will provide the ability to launch from long distances, thus increasing the safety of aircraft and their ability to inflict more damage on enemy forces. According to forecasts, the AGM-158 XR will have a launch range comparable to Tomahawk-class missiles or even surpassing it, which is approximately 1,600 km. The AGM-158 XR is designed to be compatible with a variety of platforms. It can be installed on all aircraft such as F-35, F-22, F-15 capable of using JASSM or LRASM, except F-16. The company is also studying the possibility of placing this missile on board aircraft that vertically take off and land. There are prospects for creating ground modifications. The video released by LM does not differ in details, other than general phrases such as: -greater range of confrontation-, -reduced time for development and production- due to JASSM-ER solutions, etc. Defense Express (DE) ICQ experts noted that for Ukraine, one of the main ones is that the AGM-158 XR is not suitable for the F-16. This is due to the fact that the missile has increased in size to achieve a much longer range. Which one, by the way, was not announced at Lockheed Martin. -It is also not said how much the XR has grown in size, but the photo shows that the tail section of the rocket is indeed significantly elongated. In addition, JASSM-ERs are 4.26 meters long and 63.5 meters wide. Also, so that no one has doubts, the description of the new missile clearly states that the AGM-158 XR carriers will be F-35 of all versions, F/A-18E, F-15E, as well as all bombers, i.e. B-1, B-2, B-52, and the latest B-21,- DE researchers emphasized. At the same time, weapons market researchers stated that for the F-35, increasing the size of the missile is not of particular importance, because even the usual JASSM does not fit into the internal weapons compartments. That is why the Joint Strike Missile is integrated under this fighter, and all AGM-158s are still launched from external pylons. But for many potential operators of this missile, as IKK Defense Express believes, the lack of integration with the F-16 is unlikely to be a problem. In particular, the AGM-158 XR is unlikely to appear in the very near future, as only a mock-up has been shown so far, indicating that it can be developed quickly. Moreover, it is primarily intended for the United States, and only after satisfying the primary domestic needs, if, of course, it is ordered by the Pentagon, will be exported exclusively to -selected- countries, which with an extremely high probability will be armed with the F-35. At the same time, under certain alternative scenarios where the US would need to quickly arm partners with long-range cruise missiles for the AGM-158 family of cruise missiles, there are alternative launch methods. The first is sea or land, because objectively nothing prevents adding an accelerator to a missile and launching it from a ship or a land-based launcher. And such work is already underway with the anti-ship LRASM, which will be integrated into the Mk 41 universal launch cell. Lockheed Martin has set a production plan of 1,100 JASSM-XR missiles annually, with the possibility of releasing different models depending on market demand. Today, the company continues work on the rocket project, which will take several years. In the near future, tests in the air are expected. The American company Lockheed Martin has developed a new variant of the JASSM-XR cruise missile.

The battalion from Obolon liberated Vovchansk, was in the hell of the Serebryan forest and shoots do...	Mobilized at the beginning of a large-scale invasion as a junior lieutenant, Valery worked his way up from the officer of the planning group to the battalion chief of staff and recently received the rank of major. In a conversation with the ArmiyaInform correspondent, Valery Lubarsky talked about the combat path of the rifle battalion, technological the development of the unit and anti-aircraft drones, thanks to which 13 enemy UAVs have already been shot down. Next is his direct speech. I am a lawyer by profession, I worked as a lawyer in Kyiv for a long time in civil and economic cases . He graduated from the military department at VIKNU, had a military lawyer certificate. They led groups, taught people how to choose equipment, orient themselves in the terrain in the Crimea (even before 2014) and in the Carpathians. These skills really suited me during my service: working with maps, sense of distance. Civilian life was active, practiced Brazilian jiu-jitsu for over 10 years. Already in the ranks of the Armed Forces, he received a black belt. I tried surfing, cycling, skiing, and by the way, I got the nickname -Skier-. I had no military experience before the large-scale invasion. In 2014, he completed a short course in the -White Wolf- organization, now they are part of the -Alpha- SBU unit. For a long time, he visited the -Ukrainian Legion- - a paramilitary organization known to many in Kyiv. They provided a good base, taught the elements of the Combat Statute, takmed, the basis of fortification. He independently read military literature, trained in shooting, and had a basic culture of handling weapons like a civilian owner. Since the fall of 2021, I have been thinking about a reservist contract. Soon after, the Law -On the Foundations of National Resistance- was adopted, and for me it was an important signal that systematic work had begun at the state level in the field of territorial defense. Before the Russian invasion in February, my wife and I went on vacation to Georgia, where us and the beginning of the great war. At that time, our 4-year-old son was in a village near Vyshhorod. On February 24, I decided, first of all, to get to Ukraine, hide my son and wife in a safe place, and after that to mobilize. In the end, I managed to send my family abroad, and I stayed at the station in Kyiv, sat in the car and thought: -Goodbye to my old life.- In the 129th battalion of the TrO, I was assigned to the position of officer of the headquarters planning group, because I had the rank of second lieutenant and knew how to work with maps and information. I was mobilized on March 5, and on the first day I was given a blank card with the words: -This should be the battalion commander's working card.- They began to set up a situation on the northern outskirts of Kyiv, to go to the positions. At that time there were a lot of people who wanted to serve, the number of the battalion was about 40% more than the regular number. Everyone, let's say, was -squeezing- concretely, but everyone looked at each other and completed the tasks. About a month later, the 244th separate rifle battalion was created and I was offered the position of deputy chief of staff there, which scared me at first . The battalion mainly consisted of residents of Kyiv, mainly shellmen, partly from the Podilsky, Shevchenkivskyi districts. A day after the assembly, we left for Bila Tserkva, where we had a designated line for setting up a defense line. There we were under the command of one of the brigades, preparing fortifications from scratch. We made a plan for defense taking into account the topography of the area, tried to think creatively: ambushes, mobile fire groups, etc. Then we had about 800 people, almost all of them voluntarily mobilized. There were some people with ATO/OOS experience, ex-contractors and even with Afghanistan experience. We conducted training and night outings in the Kyiv region, and this helped us a lot in the future. The commanders tried to show leadership as much as they could so that the people felt confident. There was no such thing as: -I'm an officer, you're all scrambling, and I'll chase you.- In August 2022, we received combat orders to advance to Kharkiv Oblast. Prior to that, our two combined companies had already gone to the East, they fought hard enough there, in particular, they defended the Lysichan refinery, then in Bakhmut, they had battles near Girsky, Zoloty. They just hit the shaft of the enemy's artillery in the summer of 2022, there were the first losses and in general there was no flow. In the Kharkiv region, our battalion took the line along the Pecheneg reservoir, I organized the first advanced KP, there they began to form the first unit of UAVs. According to our state, it was not provided for then, but it was necessary to fly. Later we interacted with the SSO group, they began to give us the first live broadcasts, targeting. We then transferred them to the 14 OMBr, to which they were subordinated, and they were already hitting targets with American M109 Paladin self-propelled guns with our correction. Preparations for the Kharkiv counteroffensive were conducted covertly. At one point, I even thought that it had started, but it turned out to be radio training, the combrig sounded convincing. However, in a few days, our offensive did begin, in which two of our companies took part as assault troops. During the retreat, the Russian troops blew up bridges, tried to blow up the dam of the reservoir, but they did not succeed. When the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation had already broken through the enemy's defense line, we went to the settlements near Vovchansk, cleared them in a day and immediately received orders to occupy Vovchansk and its surroundings. We entered the city literally after the CCO group. In the city and, in particular, at the Aggregate Plant, they found an enemy ammunition depot, two damaged 120 mm mortars, and our mortarmen collected one worker from them and called him -Frankie- - Frankenstein. He helped us a lot and on that rotation and later in the Serebryansky Forest, because we had only 60-mm mortars in the state at that time. They tried to conduct a counter-battery fight, because almost from the first evening they started shelling us from the territory of Russia. It was possible to track down and destroy or damage up to 3 enemy mortar units. In Vovchansk itself at that time there were many civilians, people almost fought for the humanitarian. We organized security, generators to pump out the sewage, start the heating. At that time, the Russians left Kharkiv Oblast and already on their territory began to go in other directions, and we did not know their exact actions and intentions. There was a feeling that we were a little like -death rowers- there. The 14th brigade, in fact, did not follow us, they were sent to the offensive on Izyum, and we were given to the 4th tank brigade. We were very well received in the 4th OTBr, the brigade commander and the headquarters treated us with respect. We were instructed to make a plan for defense, I was then the TVO of the chief of staff and defended all our plans. In the end, we resisted this plan until December while we were there. A tragic story stuck in our memory: we saw a video from an enemy drone, which dropped a grenade and killed our soldier an hour and a half before. Ours shot down this drone and it was with a memory card, at that time -maviks- were launched with cards. Katsapas did not erase the material from her for a week, we received some intelligence. The tragedy of history was that we saw the last minutes of our soldier. In the Kharkiv region, we found traces of slave labor in the construction of Russian positions. There was a prison at the Aggregate Plant, where the occupiers kept, including illegal migrants from Sri Lanka. On the outskirts of Vovchansk, in a chalk mountain, there was a regimental stronghold, huge shelters were hollowed out in the hard ground, and this was done in a short time. I was amazed then. Now we don't let them dig like that anymore, our bombers fly all the time. In general, we observed the attempts of the Russian DRG, there were mortar firefights, and we started practicing the use of SPG-9 from closed positions. In December 2022, we were replaced by another unit of the TrO and we returned to Kyiv. At the end of February, the battalion went to the Kreminny direction to Serebryansky lis under the command of the 95th ODSHBr. At first there was a negative interaction, some of their sergeants called our soldiers -disposable-, -meat-. We took it harshly, we told the commandos and brigade commanders of paratroopers that we will beat your sergeants if they don't shut up, they will get a -melon-. , there was close coordination from our side, soldiers and sergeants fought well, some officers showed themselves excellently in acute situations. Everything was constructive. In some places, our experienced fighters taught the young addition of paratroopers, as they were in positions together. And, in this way, mutual respect and cooperation were gradually established. At that time there were assaults, one after another, up to ten a day. All this with armored vehicles, they drove infantry 30-50 meters to our trenches. Before that, UR-77s were thrown at us, TOS-1 -Solntsepok- worked, we all encountered the Terminator BMPT there for the first time, the Russians threw T-90M -Proryv- tanks into battle. Katsaps pressed, rushed into the trenches, threw grenades from under-barrels, plus constant mortar and artillery fire. Such was the density of hostilities. Since April, the intensity of assaults began to decrease, probably they transferred forces and means to other directions. However, from March to June we had significant losses. I gnashed my teeth and raged for every person I lost, I couldn't take it as a statistic. Then it was generally like a cold shower after Kharkiv region, where there was mostly success. In June 2023, we left for recovery in Chernihiv region and carried out so-called stabilization actions there: counter-sabotage actions, work of mobile fire groups, etc. And constant training, since autumn every week there was a field trip with a -legend-, in addition to constant training at shooting ranges. After conditional recovery, the battalion went east in March 2024 and was attached to one of the assault brigades . In the spring, the Russians periodically attacked with armored groups, tanks and BMPs drove through the fields from Bakhmut. For example, on April 12, we had a battle: our battalion destroyed two tanks: one was shot down with NLAW from a trench, and the other was shot down with FPV drones, the allies destroyed a couple of BMPs. Later, Russian attack aircraft were captured. Opposite us were the -Kadyrivets-, they were engaged in dropping drones a lot, and there was also a large unit of the army corps of the so-called -Luhansk People's Republic-. They encountered storm-z stormtroopers. After that, large-scale assaults stopped and the Russians switched to the tactics of small infantry groups, which, for the most part, still works. First, they entered through Ivanovske, then the Katsaps got stuck in the forests near Chasovoy Yar, Klishchiivka, in which very soon -green grass- grew and it became a huge problem. Now the enemy chose the direction of concentrating the main efforts in the direction of Pokrovsk and Toretsk. They can afford a strategic offensive operation in only one or two directions. All other directions they have are mostly active defense, small groups, many drones, mining from copters, shelling from MLRS, anti-aircraft missiles. We are actively looking for people in the UAV unit. We have a full-time platoon, in which the corresponding full-time positions are clearly prescribed. In our battalion, various types of drones perform the functions of surveillance, bombing, field logistics, as well as anti-aircraft copters to destroy enemy reconnaissance UAVs. Since the beginning of June, we have destroyed 13 such drones — SuperCam, three -Orlan- and nine ZALA. Most recently, a Russian drone was shot down at an altitude of more than 3,000 m. We have vacancies for UAV operators, medics, several officer vacancies - we have created staff groups for unmanned systems, EW. We have social elevators working well for people who want to responsibly contribute to the service, especially at the battalion level. We're plus or minus the enemy on drones. It is provided by the state, small volunteers, -Sternenka Community-, -Return alive-, private donors make collections. For example, in the spring we had a shortage of drones and my friend collected 4 or 5 Mavic 3T for us, which is more than a million hryvnias. There were many such episodes, war is a bottomless pit. These are our -eyes- at night, this is critically important. Our brigade purchases through tenders, drones are also provided by the authorities of Kyiv. Professions such as mortars, LNG operators, AGS, which stop the enemy's offensive are also needed. If you are a surveyor in civilian life, then this is a 60% ready mortar. In the battalion you will be taught, you will form a skill and you will work. To sum up, the recommendation of the chief of staff of the infantry battalion TrO is that you need to get a profession in civilian life that will push you into the Defense Forces. Get a specialization in UAV, Tacmed, Radio-Electronic Intelligence, Radio Affairs. There is a high probability that you will be taken hand and foot to a good unit, where proactive people are valued. in the Armed Forces or recruiting centers .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/02/bataljon-z-oboloni-zvilnyav-vovchansk-buv-u-pekli-serebryanskogo-lisu-ta-zbyvaye-orlany-istoriya-majora-lyubarskogo/	2024-10-01T20:11:52-07:00
Residents of Kurshchyna were afraid of us, because they thought that we would act like their militar...	The conversation with the soldier was made public on the brigade's page . -When the operation was just beginning, the top management explained to us the essence of where we need to move and then we have already acted. Of course, we had advance planning and even a few days ahead of the assigned tasks in our direction. At certain moments, it seemed that the Rashists would demolish everything in their path with KABs and FPV-shkas, however, our troops prepared quite effectively and had a variety of EW devices,- says Bizon. According to him, when he entered enemy positions with his comrades, he took twice as many shells and stores with him, because it is always better to have a surplus than at a critical moment to think about whether you will have enough ammunition. -When we finally flew, many katsaps were caught off guard. In addition, we did not waste much time and continued to advance, entering other villages. Now a new stage of the war has come, this has never happened in history, but these events will forever be etched in the books... The most important thing now is to keep this momentum and we are sure that it will play its role at the level that the higher command planned and sees it.- Bison notes. The defender says that, in general, the whole operation is a continuous and large-scale assault. Bison, together with his brothers, built fortifications in order not to be cut down by debris, and then simply continued to go forward and forward. -Many of the Rashists themselves surrendered to us as prisoners, some of them were -three hundred- and already after being wounded, they also surrendered. Once a situation happened that will also be immortalized for ages. An active battle began, katsaps were everywhere, but none of our men even flinched. We just kept going forward and singing the national anthem of Ukraine. It seems to me that such a moment also morally suppressed the enemy, because they saw our determination and cohesiveness of actions to such an extent that we went into battle even with a song,- recalls the soldier. Bison was wounded during one of the combat missions. That evening, they left with his group for an assault and an enemy FPV drone flew into their armored car... -This is a war and everyone is aware of what can happen. Civilians of Russia were afraid of us, because they mistakenly believed that we would act like their military, but we are human and do not have such cruelty. The Ukrainian people are strong and wise, but behind the Russians you can immediately see anger towards the whole world and envy, which, probably, makes them shoot cars with civilians, torture people and commit other crimes... We are not like that, we just want to return our people to their native flag constitutionally defined territories,- Bizon assures. He was a private entrepreneur in civilian life. Two young daughters are growing up in his family, and he jokingly says that one day he will tell his children about all the awards he received in the difficult struggle for Ukraine. -My first state award was for the storming of the city of Yampil. Then I was awarded the medal -For Military Service to Ukraine-. After that, we were transferred to Luhansk region, there was a very large enemy assault and we repelled the landing, and quite successfully, after which I was awarded the Order -For Courage- III degree. Now for our next operation, I know that they applied for the award of the Order -For Courage- of the 2nd degree. Of course, it motivates, gives even more determination and is pleasant, but the main reward for each of us will be Victory,- Bison emphasizes. ArmyInform told about a locksmith who became a harpist.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/zhyteli-kurshhyny-boyalysya-nas-bo-dumaly-shho-my-diyatymemo-yak-yih-vijskovi-boyecz-bizon-pro-vijnu-na-rosiyi/	2024-10-01T11:57:05-07:00
Echelon defense and mining: how the border defense with Belarus is arranged	Andriy Demchenko, the spokesman of the State Border Service, told about how the border protection in the North is organized on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny-. — Each unit defending this direction independently builds engineering and fortification fortifications. This includes a trench line, dugouts, firing positions, and observation posts. Local authorities are also involved in this, in order to carry out the necessary work in our border area on a larger scale and more powerfully, so that it is such an echelon defense, he said. In addition, units of the Defense Forces mine the most threatened areas and carry out round-the-clock video surveillance along the state border. — As for the border line, then, of course, obstacles are necessary to prevent attempts to pass, including subversive groups. For this, the most threatening directions are mined, where the enemy's equipment can follow. Also, these are means of local control, i.e. video surveillance systems, which are deployed along the entire length of the border with Belarus so that we can actively and constantly monitor both our border and what is happening on the other side, said the spokesman of the State Border Service. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the North Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups are trying to penetrate Ukrainian defenses and terrorize civilians.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/eshelonovana-oborona-ta-minuvannya-yak-oblashtovano-zahyst-kordonu-z-bilorussyu/	2024-10-01T11:42:22-07:00

Tactical replacement: at sea, the enemy made a bet on strategic aviation	He told about this on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. — They returned to the practice of using strategic aviation in our direction. This also did not happen for a long time, they unsuccessfully tried to solve problems at the expense of tactical aviation, and returned to this very practice, he said. The spokesman noted that the occupiers did not succeed immediately and recalled the damage to a civilian grain carrier by a Russian missile launched from a Tu-22 missile carrier of the enemy's strategic aviation. — Now they can see a way out of such tactics. In any case, we try to repel these attacks as much as possible. I have in mind the Defense Forces of Ukraine as a whole, because this is the work of a large air defense force, that is, the Air Force in the first place. -We, in turn, chat in the same way, because the Navy is actually the first to meet all the objects that enter our territory from the south from the sea,- the officer explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Navy of the Ukrainian Armed Forces explained why the Russians throw their sailors into infantry assaults.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/taktychna-zamina-na-mori-vorog-zrobyv-stavku-na-strategichnu-aviacziyu/	2024-10-01T11:28:51-07:00

We have built a very effective defense system. Currently, we apply all our latest military developments and control enemy activity along the border in our difficult natural conditions. This is our front line and we are trying to destroy the enemy even before the approach of the border, he said. He noted that thanks to the Kursk operation in the north, the number and activity of Russian sabotage and intelligence groups has significantly decreased, and he also emphasized that the offensive in Kursk allowed the Defense Forces to seize the initiative and impose on the Russians an agenda beneficial to the Ukrainian military. — The Kursk operation is given due to the fact that earlier we were in constant tension that the enemy might carry out some offensive actions in the direction of Chernigov, Sumy, Kharkiv. Now the enemy has shown what he is capable of, we with him and in all directions know what to do and are already taking the initiative into our own hands and dictating our terms, the spokesman emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kurshchyna, the Defense Forces are confronted by enemy units of various types - both those with a high level of training and combat experience, as well as low-quality units that are not always properly trained and manned and do not have any combat experience.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/dyktuyemo-vorogu-umovy-kurskoyu-operacziyeyu-syly-oborony-zirvaly-nastupalni-plany-voroga/	2024-10-01T10:53:50-07:00
The occupiers shot 16 Ukrainian prisoners of war in Donetsk region	This was announced on October 1 by the Prosecutor General's Office. According to the agency, on October 1, 2024, information appeared on Telegram channels about the alleged shooting of 16 Ukrainian servicemen by representatives of the Soviet Union. According to the media, another war crime was committed by the Russian occupying army in the area of ​​Mykolaivka and Sukhyi Yar villages of Pokrovsky district. The released video shows how, under the control of the enemy, captured soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine left the plantation. After they lined up, the occupiers deliberately opened fire on them to defeat them. The wounded, who showed signs of life, were finished off at close range with automatic rounds. Such actions are a cynical and gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and qualify as a grave international crime. -This is the most massive known case of execution of Ukrainian prisoners of war on the front line. And this is another evidence that the murders and torture of prisoners are not an accident, but a purposeful policy of the Russian military and political leadership,- said General Prosecutor Andriy Kostin. Measures are currently being taken to verify the published material. Investigative and search actions aimed at establishing all the circumstances of the specified crime have been initiated. As ArmyInform reported, three Ukrainian prisoners of war -> killed the occupiers in the Toretsk direction. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/okupanty-rozstrilyaly-16-ukrayinskyh-vijskovopolonenyh-na-donechchyni/	2024-10-01T10:38:23-07:00
More than 30 countries and almost 300 companies — the President about the forum of defense industrie...	The text of the appeal from appeared on October 1 on the President's website. -It is absolutely fundamental for Ukraine that the interest of not only partner states, but also defense companies of the world in cooperation with us, with our defense sphere, is constantly growing. Some of the agreements have already been implemented. And with regard to investments in defense production in Ukraine, and with regard to localization. Even more — at the stage of preparation,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. He reminded that Ukraine is already doing things that we didn't have before, namely the 155-caliber and long-range drones, naval drones. -We are creating a new basis for the use of Western armored vehicles - this is both repair and maintenance. Good things are being done for the development of our missile program. And it is very important now to accelerate with all this. I am grateful to everyone who understands this,- said the President. According to him, the report of the head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense, Lieutenant General Kyryl Budanov, and the Minister of Defense Rustem Umerov was heard on how our intelligence assesses the prospects for this year, Russian intentions, and the tasks that the Kremlin sets for its military. -We clearly see the main guidelines of what exactly needs to be answered and exactly how,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy assured. According to him, Ukraine is working to speed up the decisions of our partners regarding funds from the use of Russian assets. -There is a political solution. A sense of justice — that Russian assets should work to protect against Russian aggression — is shared by all partners. A joint effective mechanism is needed. And this will not only give Ukraine more stability — it will give the right meaning to the whole situation. It is necessary to ensure all elements of justice for Ukraine — for the country that Russia criminally attacked. And this is important for everyone in the world — for everyone who values ​​international law and the world order that ensures peace,- the President said. He also congratulated all Ukrainian soldiers, all our heroes with Protection, with the Day of defenders. -And all of us in Ukraine must remember: the independence of our state and the real sovereignty of Ukraine, our unity with the global world and Russia's just responsibility for this war are what can most honestly and for generations preserve the full weight of the feat of those of our people, who defends Ukraine in this war, who fights for Ukraine, and all those who gave their lives for independence,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy reminded.

To attack the Donetsk region from the south: the Armed Forces spoke about the plans of the Russians	About this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- spoke the spokesperson of the OUV -Tavria- - Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn. — Recently, the enemy continues to add personnel to his units. In addition, at two points, in particular, near Priyutny and near Robotyny, the enemy is beginning to gather personnel in order to form assault groups and assault units, he said. The spokesman explained that no large enemy offensive groups have been detected at the moment, but the enemy is actively forming and advancing assault groups to advanced positions. — As for such offensive groups, they have not been identified so far. But assault groups, for example, in the Priyutny district, have already moved to advanced positions. They are now conducting reconnaissance and in the near future we expect that this section of the front will be activated, the military said. In his opinion, the enemy's plan is to seize part of the Donetsk region, advancing from the south. — Priutne is located a little south of such a settlement as Velika Novosilka. There is a small part of the Donetsk region there, so, most likely, the goal and task of the enemy is to capture a part of the Donetsk region, as Russian politicians have previously stated, Vladislav Voloshyn suggested. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Russians have established logistics in Azov region with the help of the newly built railway.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/nastupaty-na-doneczku-oblast-z-pivdnya-v-zsu-rozpovily-pro-plany-rosiyan/	2024-10-01T10:09:09-07:00

According to the investigation, after the full-scale invasion of Russia, minor citizens of Ukraine were taken to the boarding house -Polyany- in the suburbs of Moscow, which is part of the structure of the management of the affairs of the President of the Russian Federation. -We are talking about 16 underage boys and 15 girls. Among them are three children from Mariupol, whom the Rashists forcibly took from their father, and sent him to the Olenivska colony,- the SBU said. 19 orphans and children deprived of parental care were also deported from Mariupol. Another 9 minors were kidnapped from children's social centers in the cities of Shakhtarsk and Khartsyzk. The SBU documented that the Kremlin's directive to deport Ukrainian children from the temporarily occupied part of the territory of the Donetsk region was carried out by the head of the local occupation administration of the Russian Federation, Denys Pushylin. For this purpose, he signed -Resolution No. 84- on the departure of children allegedly for -rehabilitation- in medical facilities and recreation facilities on the territory of Russia. -The Gauleiter entrusted the execution of this instruction to his -adviser- - Eleonora Fedorenko and Svitlana Maiboroda, who heads the so-called -service for family and children's affairs of the DNR-, - the SBU noted. As the investigation revealed, the kidnapped children were first taken to temporarily occupied Donetsk, then transported by bus to Rostov-on-Don, and then by plane to Moscow. From there, the minors were taken to the country boarding house of the Putin administration. -Subsequently, some of the deported children were handed over to citizens of the Russian Federation for -education-. In particular, one child was placed with the family of Maria Lvova-Belova, the authorized representative of the President of the Russian Federation for children's rights,- the SBU noted. We will remind, on March 17, 2023, the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued arrest warrant for Russian dictator Putin, who is suspected of committing war crimes in Ukraine. In addition, an arrest warrant was issued for the so-called children's ombudsman of Russia Maria Lvova-Belova. On the basis of new documented facts, SBU investigators notified Pushylin, Fedorenko and Maiboroda in absentia of the suspicion under Part 2 of Art. 28 and Part 1 of Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (violation of the laws and customs of war, committed by a group of persons following a prior conspiracy).

The tradition of creating military icons was revived in the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra	Launched in 2024, the initiative to revive the Lavra icon painting school aims to restore the ancient craft of Baroque icon painting, which has sustained the spirit of warriors for centuries. According to the general director of the Reserve Maksym Ostapenko, this is an important stage in the preservation of cultural heritage. -With this project, we aim to revive an important part of Ukrainian cultural heritage - a military icon, which has always been a symbol of protection and spiritual support for soldiers. In times of war, when a nation is fighting for its freedom, the restoration of these traditions is of particular importance. The project not only brings lost crafts back to life, but also strengthens national identity by combining history, culture and faith. Military icons should become talismans for our defenders and symbols of the unity and stability of the Ukrainian people,- Maksym Ostapenko noted. During the event, the vicar of the Holy Dormition Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, Avraamiy, consecrated the icons and emphasized that in times of war, spiritual support is of particular importance. The State Secretary of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Lyudmila Daragan added that this is only the first stage of the joint project to create combat glue nodes for the armed forces brigades. -Our struggle for freedom, for the right to live on our land, is waged not only with weapons, but also with the power of our faith. By the power of boundless prayer of millions of Ukrainians. Our warriors on the battlefield are doing impossible things. Today, as in the past, the presence of icons in combat units supports the spirit of heroes and increases confidence in our victory,- states Secretary of Defense Ludmila Daragan. Consecrated icons were handed over to three military brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: the 95th Separate Assault Polis Brigade, the 96th Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of Kyiv and the Independent Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi. These icons are a revival of Ukrainian baroque traditions and will become spiritual talismans for our defenders, said the author and curator of the project, Deputy Director General of the Reserve Svitlana Kotlyarevska. The images written for three military brigades depict the patrons of the soldiers, in particular Archstrategist Michael, who is the personification of the heavenly protector of the Ukrainian army. The work on these icons lasted for several months, the artists - icon painters Lilia Belska and Yurii Guzenko, recreated the authentic techniques of the 18th century Lavra icon painting, combining national and sacred symbols. -This will spiritually support our defenders, because they are far from their homes, from their loved ones, from temples. Thus, they will have the opportunity to offer their prayers to God through the chaplains, through joint prayer and through the icon,- noted Andrii Gul, military chaplain of the separate presidential brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi. The icons created within the -Military Icon- project are made in accordance with the heraldry of military units. In addition to large brigade icons, servicemen will be able to receive miniature personal icons created according to the original. This will enable soldiers to always have a spiritual amulet with them even in the hottest spots of the front. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the History Museum of Kyiv the opening of the exhibition project -ΩΜΟΦΌΡΙΟ.

In one of the military units of Kyiv, a photo exhibition -Length in war- opened	The exhibition is a joint work of two authors - Colonel Oleksiy Dmytrashkivskyi and Junior Sergeant Oleh Palchyk, servicemen of the Public Relations Service of the Russian Armed Forces, who serve in the -TRO Media- unit. -Length to War- is two separate projects: -The Face of War- and -On the Other Side of Peace-, which are combined into a common exhibition and are constantly supplemented with new materials. Sergeant of the communication department of the command of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Georgy Spasokukotskyi, told the audience about this. — Colonel Oleksiy Dmytrashkivskyi, who was a military pensioner at the beginning of the large-scale invasion, started work on this exhibition. He recorded the crimes of the Russians on the hot tracks in Buch. At the same time, he also shot a documentary film, which is now shown to the residents of the Kursk region and shows what actually happened near Kyiv at the beginning of the invasion. This film, by the way, has already been included in the materials of the international court, said the representative of the TrO Forces. Subsequently, O. Dmytrashkivskyi headed the Public Relations Service of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and recruited to his team specialists who in civilian life worked in the film industry, on television, and in the mass media. And this team is constantly on the front line. As Giorgiy Spasokukotskyi noted, it is easier to name a place where they were not than to list the positions where an experienced team of military journalists worked. At the exhibition, visitors will see fifty photos, these are portraits of our defenders, taken directly in combat positions or in location; the consequences of Russian aggression and the lives of civilians who are in the de-occupied territories or near the front line; military training and combat work of artillery and other weapons, etc. The photos are taken at different times, from the beginning of the full-scale invasion to the present day. — The authors aimed to show the efforts, the price of these efforts, made by all the Armed Forces of Ukraine — boys and girls, in order to achieve our Victory, as well as photo-fixing the crimes of the Russians. I am proud of our team, I believe that after looking at these works, our descendants will know what war is, what struggle is, what the price of this struggle is and the price of Victory, which we will certainly win, - said Georgy Spasokukotskyi. My attention was drawn to Oleg Palchyk's photo work -Ukrainian Cossacks writing a letter to Puil and his mare Lavrov-, taken in September 2023 in the Kyiv region. This is what Giorgiy Spasokukotskyi said about its creation: - French artist Emerick Louisset came to Ukraine and was inspired by what is happening in our country. He said that such a thing is impossible in France, even if someone attacks France - not everyone is ready to fight for it. He was delighted with what he saw and wanted to understand the reason why. When he saw Ilya Ripin's painting -Zaporozhians writing a letter to the Turkish Sultan-, he wanted to make a photo with this plot. After all, our war lasts much longer than 10 years&#8230; We called for the brigades. Here are not disguised people from the street, but professional soldiers with combat experience, some of them have been fighting for more than 2.5 years. You can view the exhibition -Length to War- online at the website a> Territorial Defense Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Everyone flies! There is a green light for the creation of private drones	This was notified on September 30 by the Deputy Prime Minister for Innovation, Development of Education, Science and Technology, Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov. According to the Deputy Prime Minister, the need for professional drone operators is constantly growing. There is a demand for this profession in military units, so educational institutions that provide quality knowledge are needed. -Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, dozens of private training centers for UAV pilots have appeared in Ukraine, but there is no unified system for regulating their activities. The government has adopted a resolution that will start the certification of private UAV schools. Educational institutions will be able to receive a certificate and officially train operators who, after successfully passing the exams, will be able to take the positions of UAV operators in military units of all components of the Security Forces and the Defense Forces,- said Mykhailo Fedorov. In order to obtain a license, an institution must: — conduct training in the operation or manufacture of drones — have 3+ drones for pilot training and certification — have training programs for pilot training on these devices — hire 3+ certified instructors to conduct training.

Killer of the FSB was detained in Zaporizhzhia - in hot pursuit - immediately after the attempt - SB...	About this declares the Security Service of Ukraine. It is noted that the counter-intelligence of the Security Service on a hot pursuit detained an FSB agent who attempted to assassinate one of the officials of the Melitopol City Council in Zaporizhzhia. -According to the instructions of the Russian special service, the killer laid in wait for the official in the entrance of a residential building, and then hit him several times on the head with a hammer. Despite numerous injuries, the victim survived. For the conspiracy, the attacker acted under the guise of a utility worker who was carrying out technical work in the apartment building where the official lived,- the counterintelligence officers said. After committing the crime, the suspect was preparing to flee to the temporarily occupied part of the Zaporizhzhia region through the territory of the EU. He planned to use one of the -evasion schemes- to cross the state border. Employees of the Security Service -on a hot trail- established the location of the hired killer and detained him while trying to escape. The figure turned out to be a recidivist who lived in temporarily occupied Melitopol. -The man came to the attention of the occupiers when, even before the full-scale invasion, he was serving a sentence in a Russian prison for premeditated murder. In June 2024, he was finally recruited and sent to special training courses at the training center of the FSB in the temporarily captured part of the territory of the region,- the special service informed. There, under the guidance of instructors of the Russian special service, the agent was engaged in fire training, knife fighting techniques and practiced conspiracy measures. To carry out an enemy mission, the killer arrived in Zaporozhye, pretending to be a migrant. After arriving in the city, he began tracking the work and residential addresses of his victim, as well as the main routes of her movement. In order to -cover his tracks-, the agent constantly changed the addresses of rented apartments, and communicated with his Russian curator through fictitious nicknames in an anonymous messenger chat. In the case of the murder of a Ukrainian official, the occupiers promised their accomplice to hand over a house in Melitopol that belonged to local residents who were forced to leave it due to the occupation. The perpetrator is in custody. He faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property. How reported ArmyInform, the head of the FSB intelligence group, which operated in Zaporozhye, received a life sentence. His accomplice was sentenced to 15 years in prison.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/kilera-fsb-zatrymaly-v-zaporizhzhi-garyachym-slidom-vidrazu-pislya-zamahu-sbu/	2024-10-01T04:32:04-07:00

Patriot in two months, F-16 - longer: the Ukrainian military is mastering the weapons of partner cou...	About this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- told First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Lieutenant General Ivan Havrylyuk — After analyzing more than 2.5 years of the active phase of the war against the Russian Federation and the training of our servicemen on various types of weapons provided by partner countries, each type of weaponry has its own program of retraining and retraining of our servicemen. But, at the same time, our servicemen were mostly people who already had an appropriate level of training on typical Soviet-made models. That is, if the training program for artillery systems takes about six months in partner countries, our servicemen were allowed to undergo training and show high results upon completion of training within two months, he said. He noted that it also takes about two months to train air defense military specialists capable of performing combat missions using the Patriot air defense system. Instead, F-16 pilot training takes longer because mastering the aircraft's control in the air is only part of a fighter pilot's basic military training. Regarding training on F-16 aircraft or other aircraft of NATO partner countries, we understand that a more comprehensive approach is necessary here. Because simply learning how to fly a plane in the air does not mean that you have achieved the level that is necessary today in the battle to gain at least a temporary advantage in some areas, let alone complete air superiority over the Russian Federation, which we currently have is very annoying, especially to the border areas, and to military personnel on the front line, using a huge number of guided aerial bombs, the military explained. Another important aspect is the training of technical specialists capable of servicing aircraft and the arrangement of the relevant infrastructure. - In addition, the training of technical personnel for maintenance and support in combat condition of these aircraft is of great importance. Also, the infrastructure and planning of the full complex of the use of these aircraft in interaction with the radio engineering forces, with the Air Defense Forces of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Ivan Gavryliuk noted. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Ministry of Defense named the main achievements of Ukraine in the production of its own weapons, how to eliminate the advantage of rf in the mobilization resource and informed that the ratio of the number of Ukrainian and Russian artillery shells on the battlefield has improved.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/patriot-za-dva-misyaczi-f-16-dovshe-ukrayinski-vijskovi-opanovuyut-zbroyu-krayin-partneriv-u-pryskorenomu-rezhymi/	2024-10-01T04:03:42-07:00

But, at the same time, it is clear that the Russian Federation has human potential and a much greater human resource and mobilization resource than Ukraine, he said. The First Deputy Minister of Defense explained that the advantage on the battlefield can be gained primarily due to the effective implementation and application of the latest military technologies. -We continue to address issues to level this advantage on the part of the Russian Federation by implementing various innovative solutions and military technologies to ensure superiority on the battlefield,- the military officer emphasized. He informed that the Defense Forces of Ukraine have introduced and are already working mechanisms that allow to quickly identify and solve problems that arise in the military during hostilities. — Today, the process of identifying a problem on the battlefield, quickly making the right decision to solve this problem and implementing it in the technologies or samples of weapons that arrive on the battlefield has already been established. Although it is still imperfect, we are taking powerful steps to study this problem, Ivan Gavryliuk said. He noted that an important component of success is the promptness of introducing modern technological solutions into the everyday combat work of the Ukrainian army. -We clearly understand that the side that will gain an advantage on the battlefield and win this war will be the one that will solve problematic issues faster and implement innovative technological solutions,- the First Deputy Minister of Defense emphasized.

According to Dmytro Pletenchuk, if the information about the involvement of sailors of the Northern Fleet in the battles in the Kharkiv region and the Pokrovsk region is confirmed, this can mean a very serious signal. -This can only indicate a serious degradation and a serious shortage of personnel. Because specialists who belong to the ship's crew, they need quite a long time for training. And in fact, this practice has probably not been used in the so-called Russian Empire, probably since the Second World War,- stated Dmytro Pletenchuk.

Vovchansk, a factory and 20 armored vehicles: the Russians tried to cover the armor with bodies	Exclusively for ArmiyaInform, the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, commented on the results of the repulse of the Russian assault in Vovchansk: -Yesterday morning, the enemy began assaulting the positions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the area of ​​the settlement of Vovchansk. The enemy's armored vehicle advanced, on board of which the enemy's assault groups were placed. Covering was carried out by two tanks. The equipment on the approaches to the position of the defense forces was detected and it was hit by fire with the help of artillery and FPV drones. In total, during the past day, 20 units of armored vehicles were destroyed and damaged in Vovchansk alone — 2 tanks and 18 armored vehicles. The total loss of enemy manpower in the Kharkiv direction amounted to 202 people, of which 135 were irreversible and 67 were medical. The intensity of hostilities was such that the number of irreversible losses of the enemy exceeded sanitary losses for the first time.- As we can see, everything again ended with a sold-out concert at the Kobzon, the extraordinary scale of which is clearly visible in the photos and videos circulating on the Internet. In the analytical report of the Institute for the Study of War on the course of repelling large-scale Russian aggression for September 30, 2024 stated that -a Russian war blogger said that Russian forces recently attacked Aggregatny Zavod, but did not specify the result.- Ukrainian military man, volunteer of the 24th separate assault battalion -Aidar- Stanislav Bunyatov reported that the Russians engaged 17 MT-LB, 3 tanks and more than 100 paratroopers to the assault in the urban development of Vovchansk. According to his data, the losses of the enemy amounted to: 16 -motoliga- were destroyed, 1 tank was damaged (it was able to retreat with the remains of armored vehicles). -Now the guys are finishing off the rest of the infantry, the bulk has already been sent to the kobzon,- the soldier said. Later, he specified enemy losses, noting that apart from armored vehicles, the invaders did not count a hundred dead soldiers and another 25 wounded: The accuracy of the calculations of the enemy's manpower lost here is obviously approximate. However, the order of numbers, judging by the comment of the spokesman of the -Kharkiv- OTU, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, regarding the losses of the enemy in the Kharkiv direction in general and the photo and video materials distributed on the network, is close to reality. The main reason for the senseless assault of the Russians with the use of a large number of armored vehicles in the urban development of Vovchansk is quite understandable. This is their loss of control over the Aggregate Plant, which was finally liberated from the occupiers by units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. -It is difficult to imagine something more senseless and merciless than the order of the Russian commander, who has just been &lt;encouraged - ed.&gt; for the loss of the aggregate plant. But the whole Russian army is involved,- stated on the Byt Ili channel. The desire of the Russian command to cover up its own stupid decisions leads to even more stupid decisions - and so on ad infinitum. The desire of the Russian commanders to cover the -fifth point-, to cover the image media defeat from the loss of the plant, and to gain respect in front of the higher command prompts them not to count on the losses. -Today in Vovchansk, snipers sacrificed 2 companies of paratroopers and 17 units of equipment. We are waiting for the howl in the Katsap pubs-, said the administrator of the Telegram channel -✙ MAGNAT ✙ -. He did not make himself wait long - cheerful reports about -hard rolling- and -vigorous progress- quickly changed to desperate whining in the comments to the extremely careful reports of Russian propaganda channels that all is not well for Russians in Vovchansk. However, they can only write the truth in anonymous comments, because the administrators of propaganda zhu-channels have long been under close surveillance by the Russian special services and allow -freedom- only within clearly defined frameworks. -A fool again. And now again the -net- will begin to oppress,- wrote an enraged propagandist of Russian fascism from one of the smaller Russian propaganda telegram channels, hinting at censorship of ZU propagandists. Larger Russian propaganda resources do not even dare to make such extremely cautious statements, knowing that authorized persons in civilian clothes may come after them. Commentators, however, are bolder because they are harder to calculate. Here are some samples of their typical posts. The devastating meat-armor assault of the Russian invaders in Vovchansk demonstrated that trying to cover the armor with bodies is an unproductive idea, because both the soldiers will be torn to shreds and the armor will burn. However, it is unlikely that any conclusions will be drawn from this in the Russian army, where equipment is more expensive than the lives of personnel, and winning relations with the higher command are more valuable than everything else combined. Earlier, ArmyInform wrote about the successful repulse of enemy assaults by units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine using a large number of armored vehicles in the Kupyan direction and on the Lipetsk section of the Kharkiv direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/vovchansk-zavod-ta-20-bronemashyn-rosiyany-sprobuvaly-prykryty-bronyu-tilamy/	2024-09-30T23:21:56-07:00

The end of the war, elections in the USA, -Plan for victory- over the Russian Federation: the expert...	-The world is very globalized, where each country has its own interests. Russia attempted to restore -superpower status- by attacking Ukraine. the Russians want to significantly expand their geopolitical influence in the world and Europe, reduce the role of the United States and NATO. This is impossible without the seizure of Ukraine. Even Lenin said that losing Ukraine is the same as losing one's head. Where are we now in this war? In my personal opinion, we have already reached the middle. Only I can't specify where that middle is. Was it already last summer or autumn, or maybe it is some other period of time. Why do I think so? Because there are all the main signs that the search for a formula to get out of this phase of the war, to put it very correctly, has begun. What is the argument for my reasoning? The first is the big peace conference in Switzerland that took place in June of this year. More than 80 countries took part in it. An unprecedented phenomenon since the Second World War, there has been nothing like it since. The second argument is the visits of a huge cavalcade of diplomats, European and Ukrainian, to China. And a whole series of very specific statements by leaders of various influential countries, for example, Turkish President Erdogan. He stated that he is ready to mediate between Russia and Ukraine in ending this phase of the war. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also reflected a few weeks ago that, they say, he is ready to talk to Putin. This means that the search for the formula has begun. It will definitely be finalized. In my personal opinion, it will happen next year. A lot will depend on who wins the US presidential election. At the moment, by a small margin, Kamala Harris has more positive momentum than Donald Trump. But everything can be solved literally overnight, because the American electoral system is very specific. It is about the electoral college of the USA. As a rule, they do not violate the will of those people who vote one way or another, but there may be exceptions. Albert Gore won the election from George W. Bush, but the electorate voted his way. Similarly, Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election over Trump, but again voters voted differently. Therefore, it will really be decisive who will sit in the chair of the president of the United States. I want to express a personal position and dispel fears about the possible election of Trump. He now strongly reflects that he will become president and -end the war- in three days. US leadership is governed by the system of checks and balances defined by the United States Constitution. That is, there is a balance of power. Let's not forget that Trump has already been the president of the United States once. And the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine has already been ongoing, although not full-scale. There were no overly big bows towards Russia or Putin. And there were sanctions to block the construction of the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline. Plus, American liquefied gas went to European Union countries en masse. And this is clearly a powerful blow to the Russian Federation. There are also the interests of the most powerful US military-industrial complex in the world. Almost everything there is 99% owned by private firms. General Dynamics, McDonnell Douglas, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin got a taste of very big money. I am sure that the owners of these strategic US enterprises will find the keys to the hearts of even personalities like Trump. It is necessary to understand that the axis of evil has been crossed. It definitely includes Russia, North Korea, China and Iran. The situation in the Middle East is especially influenced by Iran. Since 1989, a theocratic regime headed by ayatollahs has been in place there. They have an eschatological vision of the world, that is, they are really ready to burn the world with nuclear catastrophes under the banner of Allah. And even, despite the sanction, build a pretty good military-industrial complex. Shahedi is a fairly successful example of this. It was also confirmed that the Iranians provided the Russians with artillery ammunition of up to 122 mm and 152 mm caliber. According to Western media, Russia has allegedly already received or is about to receive several hundred Fath-360 ballistic missiles from Iran. The warhead of the missile is 150 kg, the flight range is up to 120 km. But there is also other information that they allegedly suspended the process of transferring these missiles there. The Americans are now very heavily leveraged in part of the nuclear deal with Iran. Let's not forget that $150 billion of oil belonging to Iran is frozen in world bank accounts. Is a potential Iranian strike on Israel possible? Iran has already carried out a massive combined missile-drone strike against Israel this year. But there was no escalation after that. Now Israel is attacking Hezbollah facilities in Lebanon, let's remember the unique -pager- operation. And somehow Iran is in no rush to give its Lebanese proxies more support than they can afford. China's position will also depend on the White House election. They play on the sly and take their time. Let's not forget that the Chinese are far from being true friends of the Russian Federation. They have a very old and long -history of relations- with Russia since the middle of the 19th century. Two treaties humiliating for the Chinese are Aigun and Peking. Then the territory along the Amur River passed to Moscow. China was weakened by the Opium Wars, and the Russian Empire, of course, took advantage of this. The Chinese are playing their strategic game, fighting for the next world order and who will play the leading role there. At the moment, it would be very beneficial for China to freeze the battle line of the Russian-Ukrainian war. But as long as the Kursk bridgehead exists, things will not stop like this right now. In fact, the issue of the Kursk bridgehead will be decisive at the point of potential negotiations and how the potential demarcation line will be drawn. — the Russians destroyed the Yalta-Potsdam system of international relations. The formation of the next system will take place in a different way, perhaps not even in force. But there is a nuance, everything will greatly depend on what this system will actually look like. Now, of more than 200 countries on the planet, two-thirds are autocracies, only one part are democracies. But the most important thing is: in the larger historical context, we have already defeated the Russians. Why? Ukrainian statehood survived. For Moscow imperialism, for Russian identity, an independent Ukraine is not at all acceptable as such. And we are, we exist. This is a win. For the first time, we have the full support of the entire civilized world. I really like historical parallels. At the beginning of the 20th century, Ukraine had at least five enemies. The second is our infighting, the lack of unity in the actions of the Ukrainian national forces, which did not compromise in the name of national interests. Plus the unfavorable international situation. This time we are not fighting for the restoration of the Ukrainian state, now we are fighting for its preservation. Even if there is a truce and the Russians take a break after the cessation of hostilities, they will use this time to strengthen their own military capabilities. I emphasize that the next phase of the Russian-Ukrainian war is inevitable. Next year, the Kremlin has budgeted the largest amount since the Soviet Union - more than 140 billion dollars. It is actually the third largest military budget of any country in the world, at 6.5% of GDP. It was more only in the 1980s in the Soviet Union, which reached 15%. Therefore, the next phase of this war is inevitable and only a matter of time. How is it composed, for whose benefit? I am sure that sooner or later, when Moscow's imperialism begins to pour down for real, we will definitely take back all our territories.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/zavershennya-vijny-vybory-v-ssha-plan-peremogy-nad-rf-ekspert-rozkryv-detali-geopolitychnoyi-shahivnyczyi/	2024-09-30T21:00:06-07:00
What is known about the holidays that Ukrainians celebrate on the first of October	On this day, we honor modern defenders of Ukraine and Ukrainian heroes of different eras. Modern soldiers multiply and develop thousand-year-old Ukrainian military traditions. In the Ukrainian tradition, this holiday is associated with the Day of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God. In connection with the transition of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church to the New Julian style of the calendar from last September, in 2023 the Day of Defenders was moved from October 14 to October 1. The idea of ​​the intercession of the Mother of God — protector from enemies — has deep roots from the times of Rus and the introduction of Christianity in 988. Prince Yaroslav the Wise built a church at the Golden Gate in Kyiv as an expression of gratitude to God and the Holy Mother of God. The Feast of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God was one of the most important Cossack holidays, which is why it got its second name — Cossack Protection. It was on the Feast of the Intercession — on October 1 that the Cossacks held councils at which they elected a new hetman or members of the chieftainship. At the same time, a unique type of icon appeared — -Cossack Protection-, where Ukrainian Orthodox hierarchs, hetmans and Cossacks are depicted under the omophorion of the Mother of God. Also, the veneration of the Intercession by the Cossacks affected the huge number of churches named after the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God and on toponymy. Today, many villages in Ukraine bear the names Pokrovka, Pokrovske, Novopokrovka, etc. Protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary: history of the holiday, folk signs During the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917–1921, the traditions of the military Cossack community were revived. They became the basis for the development of the armed forces of the Ukrainian People's Republic, the Ukrainian State, and the ZUNR. First of all, this can be seen in the names of military formations and military terminology, which was used to denote ranks, positions and military structural elements: Cossack, squad, chotar, bunchuzhny, half-hundred, centurion, kurinny, osavul, colonel, chieftain of a brigade, chieftain of a division, chieftain of a corps . This was reflected in the uniforms and appearance of the soldiers of the Ukrainian military formations of those times. -Mazepinka- cap, black caps with colored brims, Circassians and other elements of ancient Ukrainian military clothing. Fighters often shaved their heads following the example of the Cossacks, leaving only a herringbone. During the Second World War, natives of different parts of Ukraine and Ukrainians of the world, who were in regular armies or became partisans, served in auxiliary formations or on the front lines, went through the entire war or died in the struggle, side by side with other peoples they fought against Nazism. Soldiers of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army took up arms to protect Ukrainians from both totalitarian regimes — Nazi and Communist. They fought for the restoration of Ukrainian statehood, followed Cossack military traditions. The symbolic day of the creation of the UPA — October 14, 1942, which then fell on the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God. The struggle of the UPA was a continuation of the Ukrainian liberation movement of the period of the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917–1921, the underground fighting Ukrainian military organization and the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in the 1920s–1930s. Today our army has become one of the most capable armies in Europe, having 10 years of combat experience behind him. Already during the Russo-Ukrainian war, Ukraine reformed and modernized the Armed Forces according to the latest standards, as well as restored uniquely Ukrainian military traditions, strengthened the ideological component of patriotic education of personnel. In battles with units of the Russian regular army, our army became professional and became one of the most important institutions of the country. Today, Ukrainian society trusts the Armed Forces the most. The modern Armed Forces inherited the headdress, insignia and slogan from previous generations. -Mazepinka- is a headdress with a front wedge-shaped cut, part of the Ukrainian military uniform. It stylistically imitates the appearance of Cossack headdresses of the second half of the 17th century, when Ivan Mazepa was hetman. This is how they were depicted in contemporary portraits. -Mazepinky- began to be worn by Ukrainian snipers during the First World War. Later, this headdress became widespread in other Ukrainian formations — the Galician Army, the Carpathian Sich, and the UPA. Since 2017, the -mazepinka- has been the official headdress of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The sleeve trident is a badge of distinction worn on the sleeves of uniforms by the soldiers of the UNR Army and Chief Ataman Simon Petliura himself. -The cloth trident, the colors according to the types of weapons, the forms according to the drawing,- said the order of July 30, 1919. A simple trident, without details, was easy to make in the conditions of continuous hostilities and the small and unstable rear of the UNR Army. Continuing the Petlyur traditions, modern defenders of Ukraine wear tridents on the sleeves of their uniforms. -Glory to Ukraine! -Glory to the heroes!- — the slogan of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. Currently, it is the official salute in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Appeal -Glory to Ukraine! -Glory to the heroes!- was approved in the spring of 1941 by the II Grand Assembly of the OUN led by Stepan Bandera, and on October 4, 2018, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine approved the greeting -Glory to Ukraine! -Glory to the heroes!- as official in the Armed Forces and the National Police. According to the materials of the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/shho-vidomo-pro-svyata-yaki-ukrayinczi-vidznachayut-pershogo-zhovtnya/	2024-09-30T20:51:12-07:00
Dates -end of war- from -numerologists-: what's wrong with them	This time, the mysterious -numerologist- experts set December 12, 2024 as this day. In this delusional fakers compare the dates of the beginning of the First and Second World Wars with the date of the invasion of Russian troops into Ukraine. The so-called numerologists emphasize the fact that Russia started the war against Ukraine on February 24, 2022, and if you add up all numbers of this date together, the result will be the number 5. The same number is obtained as a result of calculations of the dates of the beginning of the First and Second World Wars. And also on the date - 12.12.2024. Such -calculations- are not new. Even at the beginning of the large-scale invasion, -number magicians- predicted the end of the war on March 14, 2022. Then this date gradually shifted, predicting new and new days of victory / peace / surrender. Actually, the war with Russia did not start on 24.02.2022, but in 2014, so completely different dates should have been taken for calculations. In addition, the authors of the plot manipulate the beginning and end of conflicts, -adjusting- them to the desired result. Spreading misinformation, Russian narratives, swaying the psyche are additional tools in the war that the enemies are waging against Ukrainians. Not the last role in the information war is played by Russian so-called numerologists and fortune-tellers. A battalion of Russian fortune-tellers-experts, synchronously with the media, picks up key messages regarding military operations, the greatness of -Mother Russia- and the future of Ukraine. This is how they zombify a credulous, mystic-loving audience. And this way of spreading Russian narratives is almost the simplest. This requires very few improvised means: a bright manicure, massive rings on the fingers, a hanging tongue and a memorized technique of the main Kremlin messages. Unfortunately, since the beginning of the invasion, military-political schedules have become so popular that for many, they are the only source of true information that non-critical thinkers sincerely believe.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/daty-zavershennya-vijny-vid-numerologiv-shho-z-nymy-ne-tak/	2024-09-30T20:37:26-07:00
And again Gatling: Polish gunsmiths created a system to fight drones based on a 12.7 mm machine gun	How goes in the information message posted on the official portal of the Polish Army, this system was developed to combat low-class drones - nano and micro, as well as other small flying objects, ArmiyaInform reports. This type of defensive solution is a short-range anti-drone weapon, also known as a -weapon of last resort,- and is used when the drone is relatively close to the target. The system is ideal for protecting critical infrastructure. The basis of the armament of this system is the WLKM 12.7 mm multi-barreled machine gun, designed according to the Gatling scheme, which effectively hits targets at a distance of up to 2 thousand. meters It is worth reminding that Gatling machine gun is one of the most famous first rapid-fire weapon systems, the predecessor of the modern machine gun. Invented by Richard Gatling, the system became famous for its use by the Northern States Army during the American Civil War in the 1860s, when it was first used in combat. The System Zwalczania Dronów combat system was the result of a collaboration between Zakłady Mechaniczne Tarnów and WAT. The main goal of the development is to provide an effective solution to combat UAVs while maintaining a balance between cost and functionality. The system uses affordable ammunition, the latest target detection and tracking technologies, which makes it a reliable tool on the battlefield. The system is equipped with remote control and can work both in manual and automatic modes. The flexibility of the design allows it to be installed on various platforms, from stationary facilities to mobile vehicles and marine vessels. A key component is the WLKM 12.7mm Gatling type machine gun developed by Zakłady Mechaniczne Tarnów. The weapon uses 12.7 mm x 99 NATO (.50 BMG) ammunition and has an adjustable rate of fire from 250 to 3,600 rounds per minute. The maximum range of fire reaches 2 thousand. meters Queues can have 50-200 shots, which gives flexibility when firing at different types of targets. The machine gun is equipped with four rotating barrels, which are driven by an electric motor with a voltage of 27 V. Also, the system is integrated with an optoelectronic head, which includes daytime and thermal imaging cameras, as well as a laser rangefinder. The radar system allows detection of UAVs, including small drones, at a distance of up to 15 kilometers. System Zwalczania Dronów supports three modes of operation: — manual mode — the operator fully controls the system and independently directs the machine gun to the target; — semi-automatic mode — the system helps in tracking the target on the basis of video analysis, which reduces the burden on the operator; - automatic mode - the system autonomously detects, identifies and accompanies targets, but the final decision to open fire remains with the operator. Remote control allows the operator to be at a safe distance from the combat zone. Control is carried out through a panel with a large screen, on which information from cameras is displayed, which allows the operator to more accurately assess the situation and increases his safety. System Zwalczania Dronów is a modern and multifunctional solution for combating drones. The powerful WLKM 12.7 mm machine gun, integrated surveillance and automatic tracking systems make this weapon an effective tool for modern military operations, ensuring safety and flexibility in operation. Practical tests of the anti-UAV defense system System Zwalczania Dronów.

Previously, they flew at a distance of 15, 20 to 30 kilometers. Now they have made changes and they are already flying further, the spokesman explained. The shelling of Zaporozhye was caused by the improvement of Russian aerial bombs. In other words, the occupiers are hitting the city only because they can. — They tried to use them in Zaporozhye, inflicted several blows with these bombs. It's a success for them. Unfortunately, for us this is the terror of the local civilian population, because civilians live in the center of Zaporozhye and we see how many losses and victims such strikes cause. the Russians saw that they were succeeding and terrorized Zaporizhzhia almost all week with these guided aerial bombs, Vladyslav Voloshyn emphasized.

Nothing is in vain if we remember Heroes: an art exhibition for the Day of Defenders of Ukraine open...	It was organized by the Department of Humanitarian Support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine together with the National Union of Artists of Ukraine. The exhibition presents the works of three artists: People's Artist of Ukraine Viktor Kovtun, military serviceman Vasyl Telichka-Evert and Volodymyr Rebrov. All three artists were presented by the head of the NSHU Kostyantyn Chernyavskyi: — Viktor Ivanovich Kovtun — People's Artist of Ukraine, head of the Kharkiv organization of the Union. Viktor Ivanovych lives in Kharkiv, he has not left anywhere. He painted two portraits of fallen heroes, which after the end of the exhibition will be solemnly handed over to the families of the fallen as a sign of our respect. The second artist is Vasyl Telychko-Evert, a member of the NSHU and a military serviceman, who at the beginning of the large-scale invasion volunteered to join the ranks of the ZSU. Here are his works directly -from the trenches-. These are drawings of his fallen brothers. The third artist is Volodymyr Rebrov, a future member of the NSHU, who presented very interesting graphic works. They can be called both portraits and, at the same time, images of the souls of Ukrainian soldiers, Ukrainian heroes. The head of the NSHU noted that both oil painting and drawings in graphic techniques are presented at the exhibition. And although this exhibition is small, it touches every chord of the soul. Pain, courage, anger and pride of the Ukrainian people, love for the native land and faith in our inevitable Victory are concentrated in the pictures. — On the eve of the celebration of the holiday of defenders of Ukraine, it is a great honor for the NSHU to participate in this exhibition, which is dedicated to our defenders — those who died, and those who live and fight, — noted Kostyantyn Chernyavskyi. The senior soldier of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, artist Vasyl Telychko-Evert talked about his works: - These are images of my brothers, which were taken in a small album that was in a backpack. Unfortunately, you don't carry a sketchbook, paints, or brushes with you in your gear, but a notebook and a pencil were always with me. Here are the guys who left us. They were alive when I painted them, and now their earthly life is over. But, as our chaplain says, with God there are no dead - everyone is alive. Everyone has a choice how to spend their life. I am proud that I knew and was friends with these brothers of mine. Vasyl Telychko-Evert said that an exhibition of his sketches called -Diary- was held in the artist's house. — I redrew my entire platoon. These were life sketches - someone is cleaning a weapon, someone is resting after dressing and portrait sketches - who is laughing, who is serious, I already knew their characters. In general, I'm a painter and I've done painting exhibitions. And he began to use pencil and paper only with the beginning of a large-scale war. Therefore, it is a diary, and an artist's diary is not always written. It is visual. I did not plan to make an exhibition of them, but the impetus to exhibit these works was the fact that the boys were gone. This is a tribute. Volodymyr Rebrov had his own motivation to create: — I draw war with a pencil on paper. There are eight works in this exhibition, and in total I have about 400 of them. These are paintings that convey some kind of emotion that every Ukrainian felt. They are colorless: only two colors are present - yellow and blue. This emphasis is immediately visible in the works. On the first day, there was a feeling of desperation, no one was prepared for what was happening. As an artist, I had to have some kind of anchor to keep me from going crazy. I ran to the subway, taking with me sheets of paper and a pencil. It became my personal salvation. When I started posting these works on social networks (I posted my first drawing on February 26, 2022), they were actively shared, and I realized that this was saving not only me, but also many Ukrainians. The artist is sure that in these drawings there is a chronicle of a large-scale war from the beginning to the present day. He published two volumes of the book -War through the eyes of a Ukrainian artist- with poems by poets and portraits of heroes. Currently preparing for printing the third volume, which will be released at the end of December. - In these works, I honored heroes, supported cities that suffered, or simply wanted to show what a special people we are - beautiful, courageous, brave. I believe that one day there will be a place where I could show all these paintings at the same time, said Volodymyr Rebrov. At the opening of the exhibition, relatives of fallen heroes Danylo Podybayl, a soldier of the 128th battalion of the 112th brigade of the Russian Army, and Nina Kvashi, a combat medic of the 5th company of the 2nd battalion of the 72nd OMbr named after the Black Zaporozhets, who were portrayed by Vasyl Kovtun, were present. The mother of the deceased, Maria Podybailo, thanked the artists and the organizers of the exhibition for the fact that they engrave the memory in the ages: - Nothing is in vain if we remember our Heroes. These portraits are a type of a large number of warriors. They are all Heroes - both those who are alive and those who have fallen. There is no need to separate them, Maria Podybailo concluded. The exhibition will continue in the premises of the Central House of the Armed Forces of Ukraine until October 13.

He builds fortification equipment, arranges his positions for personnel, firing positions for means of destruction. Also, in some places, it conducts remote demining with -Pelyustka- mines and anti-tank mines, he said. Also, the enemy performs an internal rotation, evacuating casualties and bringing new fresh forces into position. — In these directions, the enemy conducts internal rotation, that is, there are personnel who performed certain combat tasks and now the enemy is evacuating current losses and also recruiting new personnel. This does not speak of any significant accumulation of any groups. This is a normal rotation, this is a replenishment of the current incomplete team, he said. At the same time, the military officer emphasized that the Russians are carrying out these and other measures precisely with the aim of resuming offensive actions. — The enemy receives provisions, receives ammunition wherever he can. He is building up the communication system, he is building up the control system, he is making wire communication there. This indicates that sooner or later the enemy will create the conditions for an assault and will continue its offensive actions again, Vitaliy Sarantsev said. Also, the occupiers are intensifying aerial reconnaissance with the aim of identifying the positions and routes of movement of the fighters of the Defense Forces of Ukraine and inflicting fire damage on them. At the same time, the Ukrainian military hinders the actions of the occupiers by all available means, in particular by destroying their shelters. In the operational information of OTU -Kharkiv- every day there are dozens of such destroyed enemy positions. - They are constantly building fortification equipment, constantly building some kind of fortifications for personnel - trenches, covered gaps, dugouts - this is really the case. But, at the same time, we also monitor their actions and, if you read our messages, we destroy several dozen shelters of enemy personnel every day, and sometimes together with the enemy. For this, both artillery and unmanned aerial vehicles - FPV drones are used. . Earlier, ArmyInform reported that vidmovyvsya/->the enemy suspended offensive actions north of Kharkiv in the Hlyboke-Lyptsi area, but did not abandon previous plans.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/30/pidgotuvatysya-do-shturmiv-v-zsu-nazvaly-golovne-zavdannya-okupantiv-na-pivnochi-harkivshhyny/	2024-09-30T08:27:05-07:00

Quality versus quantity: in Kurshchyna, the Defense Forces are confronted by enemy units of various ...	Vadim Mysnyk, the spokesman of OTU -Siversk-, drew attention to this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon. — The situation is changing, some units can be replaced, but this does not give anything in terms of quantity. The determination is more based on the quality of combat training and combat experience of these units. So we're continuing our operation, carrying out the command's tasks, and I think we'll see the results in the near future, he said. The military noted that the front for the enemy is also stretched for tens and hundreds of kilometers, so he is forced to control it along its entire length, moving units to certain areas for this purpose. — For them, it is tens and hundreds of kilometers, and they are also forced to make certain movements, taking into account the transport infrastructure and the natural features of the area, such as rivers, forests, and so on, the spokesman explained. He said that on the opposite side of the battle line, the Russians are forced to field units of varying quality, which are not always properly trained and staffed, may not have any combat experience. - On the other side of the border, there are units of various types - both conscripts and border guards, as was the case in Kurshchyna, and quite a few combat units are arriving.

- Sweet couple: neighbors for setting fire to a military car - shines - 10 years behind bars	This is reported by the SBU. The impersonators turned out to be a 24-year-old local resident and her 40-year-old neighbor, who were looking for quick money on the Internet. -The woman was approached by a hostile representative and offered money in exchange for her cooperation. The main targets of the enemy were military vehicles that were undergoing maintenance in Prykarpattia after completing combat missions at the front,- the Security Service of Ukraine says. In order not to search for and burn these cars herself, the accused involved an accomplice. When going -on the job-, the attacker followed the steps of the conspiracy: he acted in the dark, hid his face and wore protective gloves. However, such measures did not help the attacker. The arsonist himself and his accomplice were arrested in hot pursuit after setting fire to a camouflaged minibus. During the searches, mobile phones were seized from the detainees, which they used to coordinate their criminal actions and communicate with the customer. On the basis of the received evidence, the investigators of the Security Service notified both henchmen of the Russian Federation of suspicion under part 2 of Art. 194 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (intentional damage to property by arson). The perpetrators are in custody. They face up to 10 years in prison.

-Solntsepyok- due to image defeat: Aggregate plant became the number one target for the occupiers in...	The reasons for the fixation of Russians at the Vovchan Aggregate Plant on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon and the national telethon -The only news- explained the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv-, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. — After the Defense Forces liberated this facility, it became the number one target for the Russian occupiers. They have concentrated all their firepower on this location, they are inflicting fire damage with all the available weapons and with the use of the TOS-1A heavy flamethrower system, and they have also dropped aerial bombs on it, he said. The spokesman said that, in addition to shelling, the enemy is also trying to storm the plant. -We understand the importance of this object for the Russian occupiers, who will continue to try with all their might and using every opportunity to get there,- said the military officer. The officer explained why the Defense Forces' resumption of control over this facility hit the enemy hard. - First, it expanded our area of ​​control over this part of the city. This allowed us to more actively carry out certain logistics activities. And, of course, this caused a certain psychological effect for the enemy, who is demoralized in a certain way, said Vitaly Sarantsev. The spokesman explained that the loss of the plant was a powerful image blow for the enemy. -The events that took place in Vovchansk made a depressing impression on him, so we are observing the deterioration of the enemy's moral and psychological state,- he said. In view of this, the enemy is trying to recapture the plant at any cost. — The adversary tries to establish new units, tries to carry out internal rotation. He is replacing the personnel who performed combat missions there, replacing them with fresh forces, fresher and more prepared to continue assault operations in that direction, the spokesman said. At the same time, he noted, it is currently about intensifying Russian shelling and replacing the enemy's personnel without significantly increasing their number. Instead, units of the Defense Forces take all appropriate measures to arrange reliable defense of the plant. — This object is under our control with all security measures being observed so that we do not suffer losses in personnel and weapons, the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Russian commanders sentenced the soldiers to a senseless death at the Vovchansk Plant, trying to hold the object with the help of sabotage, starvation and execution of soldiers. ArmyInform also informed, how many occupiers were captured during the restoration of control of the Defense Forces over the territory of the Vovchan Aggregate Plant, and explained that part of the personnel of the Russian invaders is demoralized by the fact that the Russian army lost the plant.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/30/solnczepokom-po-imidzhevij-porazczi-u-vovchansku-czillyu-nomer-odyn-dlya-okupantiv-stav-agregatnyj-zavod/	2024-09-30T07:04:45-07:00

About how the Russian military arranges trenches, passages and tunnels on the broadcast of the marathon -Suspilne Novosti- Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, said. — The practice of building underground tunnels is not new. The opponent previously resorted to it in other directions and even raised the issue of introducing additional small departments or units in the units that will deal with these works. In their opinion, this is a quite effective tool that allows you to carry out covert engineering work and then move personnel between certain locations, he said. The Ukrainian military observed the enemy's installation of underground passageways and tunnels in the urban development of Vovchansk last week and took appropriate measures to force the Russians to stop these actions. - We observed these actions of the enemy last week, at the moment I have no information about their continued actions, because we have taken certain measures to force them to stop. At the moment, I do not know whether these actions are already taking place in some other areas, the spokesman said. He emphasized that the enemy is constantly learning and resorting to non-standard actions with the aim of accomplishing the invading tasks assigned to him, and also told how the occupiers are setting up underground communications. — Works are done manually. Roughly speaking, they go into a building where there is some basement, where it still remains, and try to dig into the side of another building from this basement. In this way, they try to move from building to building in order to accumulate personnel there and in the future to carry out some assault actions. That is, only human labor is used, - explained Vitaly Sarantsev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Russian invaders resorted to -mole tactics- in Vovchansk and dug tunnels, why do the Russians need underground passages and told how the invaders tried to hold the plant in Vovchansk with the help of undermining, starvation and the execution of soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/30/lizut-po-pidvalah-yak-rosiyany-oblashtovuyut-pidkopy-tuneli-ta-pidzemni-hody-u-vovchansku/	2024-09-30T05:56:49-07:00

On his personal account are 15 units of destroyed enemy equipment and dozens of Russian vehicles that went to a -concert- in Kobzon. Another three dozen pieces of equipment were destroyed by his subordinates, for whom their commander is a mentor and a leader, for whom they are ready to go through fire and water. -We were driving along the field road to MTLB when we saw a tank coming towards us. It was a long way to the front, so we were sure that it was our equipment. But when they compared it to a formidable combat vehicle, and saw a -zetka- on board, they realized with horror whose it really was,- says -Moisei-. The crew of the enemy tank did not immediately find out that they had crossed paths with Ukrainian equipment on the road, and this gave the Sicheslav paratroopers a small chance for salvation. -The Russian tankers, it seems, didn't quite know where they were, that's why they didn't immediately shoot our transporter at the entrance. We had time to drive away from them a little more, after which I ordered to hurry up and hide in a ravine near the road. Running into the landing nearby was, in my opinion, reckless,- the paratrooper explains. The tank eventually noticed that they had missed the Ukrainian MTLB, so they quickly turned around the steel monster and shot the paratroopers' multi-purpose tractor with two shots, which caught fire and started burning. After that, a large-caliber machine gun began to abundantly, but in vain, pour a hail of lead on the empty landing, where, in the opinion of the enemy tankers, Ukrainian fighters were hiding. According to Moisei, this happened in March 2022 near Avdiivka. Then the anti-tankers were saved by a seeming miracle and, undoubtedly, by the coolness of their commander, who did not lose his temper in a difficult situation, but acted clearly, as befits a well-trained military leader. Moses also remembers well his first miraculous rescue, which happened to him in the distant 2014. He was then a private soldier in one of the Dnipropetrovsk military units. -It was necessary to get out of the surrounded Ilovaisk. There was no confidence that we would be able to do it. But our unit succeeded: the combatant then made several correct decisions, which actually saved us: yes, there were wounded during the exit, but everyone returned alive. Then I understood for the rest of my life what an experienced commander at the head of a unit means,- says Moisei. In the fall of 2022, he had to escape certain death for the third time. It happened in the Kharkiv Region, near Yampolivka, when the Siecheslavs were chasing the Russians, liberating Ukrainian towns and villages. Then his anti-tank calculation took up a position near the village, preparing to destroy any equipment that tried to leave it. But the Russian Ural with infantry in some strange way managed to jump out of the settlement unnoticed, after which he began to drive into the rear of Moisei's anti-tank calculation. The situation was then saved by the crew of the Czechoslovak UAV, which noticed the approach of the enemy's equipment in time and reported the danger of its anti-tank gunners. Having changed their position in a flash, the paratroopers under the command of Moses attacked the enemy Ural with infantry. Then they destroyed four more trucks of the occupiers, one of which, after being hit by an anti-tank missile, set off good fireworks, because it was completely filled with ammunition. The paratrooper is philosophical about his amazing rescues. -Just hoping for a miracle in an extreme combat situation is hopeless. First of all, you need to rely on yourself and your comrades, know your military specialty well and learn to master your emotions, no matter how difficult it may be - this is exactly what can save a soldier's life. That's why I tell my subordinates to never relax, but to constantly prepare, because luck, although a -lady- and capricious, loves the learned and brave,- says Moisei. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 25th Sicheslav Airborne Brigade of the Airborne Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine using the Ratel S platform -z-desyatkom-rosiyan/->destroyed an underground passage with enemy personnel near Novogrodivka. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/30/zitnuvsya-z-vorozhym-tankom-vprytul-i-vyzhyv-protytankist-mojsej-rozpoviv-pro-svoyi-dyvovyzhni-poryatunky/	2024-09-30T05:16:58-07:00
Probing defenses and terrorizing civilians: Russian DRGs operate in the North	About what the Russian saboteurs are doing on the northern border of Ukraine on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon the spokesman told OTU -Siversk- Vadym Mysnyk. — The threat is not going anywhere, the activity of using DRG remains. But, in view of the fact that the border is a front line with all the relevant features, the use of the DRG here is not always optimal for them, he noted. Also, the Defense Forces actively use technical means to detect enemy saboteurs in a timely manner. However, there are isolated cases of attempted penetration of Russian DRGs into the territory of Ukraine. Their tasks remain traditional — probing the Ukrainian defense zone and terrorizing civilians. - The tasks are the same. They check our lane and defense system. And they also terrorize the local population. There were many cases when they destroyed the cars of civilians, and the civilians themselves were destroyed. If they have the opportunity, they carried out such attacks, - explained Vadym Mysnyk. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Defense Forces forced the enemy to practically abandon the use of DRG in Sumshchyna, therefore minuvanni-misczevosti/->Russian saboteurs on the northern border focused on mining the area. Instead, Ukrainian defenders detect enemy saboteurs with the help of UAVs and other technical means of surveillance and thanks to the Kursk operation are significantly strengthen border protection in Sumshchyna.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/30/promaczuyut-oboronu-i-teroryzuyut-czyvilnyh-rosijski-drg-diyut-na-pivnochi/	2024-09-30T05:07:38-07:00
Thanks to cooperation with Denmark, Ukraine received a new efficient method of producing modern weap...	About this informs September 30 Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The Armed Forces have already received the first samples of artillery manufactured within the framework of this cooperation. The first joint project was the production of Bohdan self-propelled artillery units for the Ukrainian army. Financing was provided by the Danish government. During the visit of Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen to Kyiv, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov discussed with a foreign delegation such a format of support for the Ukrainian defense-industrial complex. Dmytro Klimenkov also described how the -Danish model- of supporting the Ukrainian defense industry works: The main selection criterion is compliance with the priorities of the Armed Forces. -The -Danish model- is a cheap and effective approach to the production of modern weapons and ammunition. The world currently lacks the capacity to produce more weapons, so it is very important that the Danes are now helping to modernize the Ukrainian military industry,- noted Dmytro Klimenkov. According to him, for Ukraine this is defense independence and an investment in the economy. -We have our own facilities, technology is shared with us. Localized defense production in Ukraine will allow not only to reduce dependence on foreign supplies, but also to respond more flexibly to the needs of the front, quickly adapting the production of weapons to the requirements of hostilities,- he said. Dmytro Klimenkov called on other partner states to scale up the -Danish model- and join the initiative. As reported by ArmyInform, Denmark invests almost 600 million euros to strengthen the defense industry of Ukraine. Of which 175 million euros will be allocated by the Government. Another 400 million euros will come from surplus profits of frozen Russian assets.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/30/ukrayina-otrymala-novyj-efektyvnyj-sposib-vyrobnycztva-suchasnoyi-zbroyi-zavdyaky-spivrobitnycztvu-z-daniyeyu/	2024-09-30T04:50:50-07:00

In the spring of 2023, attackers were preparing a series of terrorist attacks against the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and SBU special agents who are carrying out combat missions on the southern front. -To do this, the agents monitored the places of temporary bases and the movement routes of Ukrainian defenders in the territory of the region,- the report says. They sent the received information to the FSB via messenger in the form of markings of military facilities on Google maps with a detailed description and photos. -According to the received coordinates, the occupiers planned to carry out targeted strikes using missile weapons,- the SBU explained. The FSB was also preparing a plan for the physical elimination of Ukrainian servicemen through the activation of explosive devices that were to be installed in the areas where the Defense Forces are concentrated. To prepare terrorist attacks, the enemy agency received money from its Russian curators, which went to the bank details of the group's resident. SBU counter-intelligence agents exposed the agents in advance, documented their crimes step by step, and detained them during a special operation in Zaporizhzhia in early May 2023. As the investigation established, the resident of the group turned out to be a 52-year-old local resident. He came into the eyes of the occupiers because of his pro-Kremlin views, which he demonstratively expressed among those around him. At the end of December 2022, he was remotely recruited by an FSB personnel officer and assigned a task. -In order to carry out the instructions of the Russian special agent, his henchman involved an accomplice. This accomplice worked as a driver for the head of one of the district administrations of the regional center. Subsequently, the resident involved five more residents of the region in the group,- the SBU noted. During the searches, automatic weapons, ammunition for them, combat grenades, as well as mobile phones with evidence of crimes were seized from the perpetrators. According to the materials of the Security Service, the court found the resident of the group and his accomplice, the official's driver, guilty of 2 Art. 28 and h. 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law by prior conspiracy by a group of persons). Other members of the hostile cell are under investigation. As reported by ArmyInform, the SBU detained a Russian agent who -ppo/->spyed on the locations of air defense in Cherkasy region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/30/gotuvaly-seriyu-teraktiv-proty-komanduvannya-zsu-dovichne-uvyaznennya-otrymav-rezydent-agenturnoyi-grupy-fsb/	2024-09-30T03:26:51-07:00
