KABs overhead, queues at the pharmacy and four hours to live: ArmiyaInform report from front-line Ko...	What kind of destruction the city suffered, how its inhabitants live in the conditions of approaching the contact line, and why Kostyantynivka is so important for the enemy, further in the material. Every day, the Russian aviation attacks the city with aerial bombs, with artillery strikes, the Rashists destroy high-rise buildings, private houses, social institutions, educational institutions, industrial enterprises and objects of critical infrastructure. Enemy reconnaissance UAVs are in the air and are adjusting fire. The contact line came closer to the city by less than 10 km, and to the ridges about 6-7 kilometers. This is if you take the distance from the Temporal Ravine, in which heavy battles are going on. Some villages and settlements of the Kostyantyniv community, which are located along the front line in the direction of Toretsk, have been completely destroyed, others are subject to unprecedented shelling and destruction. About 17,000 people remain in Kostyantynivka, and more than 1,000 residents live in the villages of the community. By the way, almost 80 thousand people lived in the city before the invasion. The closer we get to Kostyantynivka, the fewer civilian cars there are, mostly military pickups on the road. The central road, which runs alongside the railway, actually divides the city into two parts. The industrial part is on the plain, to the left, if you are moving from Druzhkivka, on the heights are private sector houses and multi-apartment buildings, to the right - behind the industrial facilities, on the hill is another part of the residential sector of the city. So, this part of the city, which is closer to Chasovoy Yar, suffered the most destruction. All around destroyed houses, shops, gutted educational institutions and kindergartens, glass from broken windows everywhere, destroyed production facilities and workshops of industrial facilities. Once upon a time, before the Great War, many enterprises worked successfully in Kostyantynivka, among them, for example, a bakery, a milk factory, and a glass factory. Now they lie in ruins. We approach the former building of the Kostyantynivska City Council. In front of it, you can see the explosions from the Russian anti-tank missiles, the building is ransacked, like everything around in this area. Nearby is a shattered school. The least number of people live in this part of the city, but single silhouettes of residents can still be seen on the city streets. Lyudmila Mykolaivna lived in Kostyantynivka all her life, a pensioner. -It's very scary, especially when the weather is sunny, then the Russians hit the city much more. I still have water, gas and electricity in my house. There are problems with the light, power grids are destroyed, they are fixed, of course. Interruptions with heating. My friends are already living without electricity, water and gas. But it is good that relatives are moving to Dnipropetrovsk region. -Many people still have stoves in their homes, so they heat and cook with them,- the woman says. Almost a year ago, the Russians hit the S-300 on Kostyantynivka and destroyed the railway station. In addition, a temple, private and apartment buildings, shops, market pavilions, three educational institutions, administrative buildings and a post office were also destroyed in this area. Now there are some shops and even open pavilions with products, there are vegetables, fruits, meat, eggs, fish and dairy products. Agricultural goods are sold. In other areas of the city, there are also small shops where you can buy products. All the big supermarkets have already been destroyed by roaches. There are several points of dispensing free drinking water in the city. People come on bicycles, with wheelbarrows and -pushchairs- to conveniently carry bottles of water. Bread is brought, as in other settlements of the community. Pharmacies work, most of the necessary medical drugs are there, so people, for example, with cardiovascular diseases, are provided with pills. Ukrposhta branches, polyclinics, even queues at ATMs for cash are open. There is a minibus that runs around the city once an hour and takes residents to different districts of Kostyantynivka. The Kostyantynivska community has a strict curfew: it lasts 20 hours a day — from 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 a.m. the next day. That is, only at this time residents can be on the street and actually have four hours for everything: to buy groceries, collect drinking water, go to the pharmacy, and so on. But just to breathe fresh air. When the electricity goes out in the city after shelling the occupiers, generators are turned on in shops and pharmacies. Even if the city is shelled, residents still go shopping, they say they are used to it. -Of course it's scary. But we have nowhere to go, there are many single people, they need to at least buy bread. For example, my relatives moved to Odeshchyna, I am here alone, I have to take care of myself. They call to me, I will finish my business here and go,- says Anastasia, a resident of the city. There are -points of unbreakability- in Kostyantynivka, volunteers bring hot food, distribute -humanitarian food-, plus you can get warm clothes here. -Everything you need for life in the city is there. We pray to God and ask him to give strength to the Ukrainian army to stop the Russian occupiers, - adds a grandfather and grandmother walking along the sidewalk, - we have lived here all our lives, where should we go, we have a home here, two pensions are still enough and we don't need much. There is food and water, the TV is working. And it will be spring soon, and it will be warm there, the smell of flowers and the trees will turn green. Let's go further. There is a queue at the pharmacy, people complain that there is not enough time to live. -Four hours to solve all current issues is very little. It's good that the hospital is still open, so help is available. There are qualified doctors, but we don't know what will happen tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,- residents say. In the conditions of war, city utility workers do everything possible to improve the lives of residents. Sometimes they even work under enemy fire. Utility workers are trying to eliminate the consequences of shelling and destruction as soon as possible. Serhiy Gorbunov, the head of the Kostyantyniv city military administration, said that the city still has gas, electricity and partially water supply. -There is no water supply in some areas of the city, because the enemy destroyed one of the water mains, we are delivering water. After each shelling, the entire infrastructure is destroyed, we try to restore everything immediately. We provide people after shelling with construction materials for the preservation of residential premises and civil infrastructure. Volunteers help a lot,- said Serhiy Gorbunov. The center for providing administrative services of the Kostyantynivska hromada works in the mode of recording people's statements regarding destruction, surveys and entries in the registers of information about damaged and destroyed property. It is good that all the children were taken out of the city to a safe place. Schools, of course, are not functioning, schoolchildren study remotely. Entrepreneurs and owners of small shops are reluctant to communicate, do not want to be photographed. For the most part, their business is on the verge of closing, there is no revenue, so they work on their own enthusiasm. They say that while people are still in the city, they will be open to residents. The city remains one of the potential targets for the aggressor, in particular because of its railway hub. Rail logistics make it much easier for the occupiers to deliver troops and ammunition. Moreover, the probable occupation of Kostyantynivka will open the way for a further attack on the large Kramatorsk-Druzhkiv agglomeration. Kremlin seeks to achieve its goal of full occupation of Donetsk region. But the Defense Forces of Ukraine destroy the occupiers on the contact line and prevent them from advancing. The enemy is suffering losses, almost every piece of Ukrainian land on the front line is littered with corpses of Russian invaders. &#8230;When ArmiyaInform journalists were working in Kostyantynivka, the enemy attacked the city with barrel artillery and anti-aircraft guns. As a result of the strikes, private houses, a gas pipeline line, the electricity network and cars of residents were damaged. Recently, the enemy has been striking the city with the use of attack UAVs. Every day, the local city military administration calls for the need to evacuate the civilian population to safer regions of Ukraine! Take care, evacuate in time! For questions about evacuation, please call: 050 567 88 87, 093 420 18 83.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/kaby-nad-golovoyu-chergy-v-apteku-ta-chotyry-godyny-dlya-zhyttya-reportazh-armiyainform-z-pryfrontovoyi-kostyantynivky/	2025-02-04T20:51:01-08:00
500 bullets at the enemy with one -shot-: a mine-explosive master class from -Bach-	- The call sign appeared very simply - they came up with the guys when they started in the sapper company. How do callsigns appear? If you don't come up with something yourself, then something will be stuck on you and that something may not be the best. That's why they came up with something related to the sabotage business, detonations, - explains the soldier with a smile. -Bach- comes from the town of Hlyboka in the Chernivtsi region. The future sapper volunteered for the army in the first days of the large-scale invasion. Together with their cousin, they rushed into battle, although they did not have any military experience or long-term service in the Armed Forces. -I came with my cousin. Before the war, we went to the same job and were abroad for almost four years together. On the third day, it was my brother's birthday and I came to his room in the morning and said: -Well, -Boy- - he had a call sign even before the war - I kind of thought I'd go.- And he says that he also made up his mind, and we are a military commissar together,- recalls Nikita. Training at the Yavoriv training ground in Starychy, in contrast to the modern one-and-a-half-month BZVP, was less long, but every extra day in the -textbook- was perceived by the fighters as little more than a punishment, because they wanted to get to the front as soon as possible. -We imagined that the training would be like in the American movies - an obstacle course in the swamp, survival in the forest, urban battles&#8230; In fact, it was not so little, but we were very afraid that we would not make it to the war, we were very excited. We were preparing for VOS 100 as infantry and we hoped that we would be like Rambo in the trenches putting out fuckers - just like in the best blockbusters,- says -Bach-. During the formation of the brigade in Zolotonosh, Nikita and his brother were enrolled in the sapper company, but -Bach- began to fully master the mine and explosive business under the guidance of more experienced colleagues already during the hostilities in the Donetsk region. The fighter got there at the beginning of April 2022. He fought in the Severodonetsk region near Voivodeship. -Our first combat sorties were tough. It's hard for a person from a -citizen- when you don't distinguish between -exits- and -arrivals- - it seems that everything is flying around you. At first, we marched like a company of sappers, because we had to kill the whole -squad-, but in fact we were infantry. Only in the time free from fighting, sappers and contractors came to us, told us, showed us what to do, gave us some kind of basic course,- says the fighter. He gratefully remembers his comrades hardened in combat operations during the ATO/OOS, because they could give useful advice, prompt and show what and how to do. After all, a confident military man, every infantryman must master the elementary things of working with an explosive device. -Each infantryman should at least be able to set an anti-personnel mine. Of course, anyone is afraid to touch a mine, but in fact it is as safe as possible if you handle it competently and carefully,- says -Bach-. What's more, the sapper emphasizes, competently installed mine barriers not only do not pose a danger to their own infantry, but also save their lives. -The modern tasks of sappers are to install mine-explosive barriers. For example, infantry is entrenched and sits on observation posts, that is, it holds some area of ​​responsibility. We are moving forward, setting mines of the MON type in a controlled manner. This is how we -sewing up- our own infantry, so that the enemy cannot approach our positions without losses,- explains the sapper. Even the smallest of the MON-50 anti-personnel mines can stop the advance of a large group of the enemy, because its explosion provides a directed explosion and the impact of half a thousand pieces of debris in a certain sector. -You just press one button and 500 bullets will fly in one sector. We are laying mines along the front to occupy the entire area. Then instead of shooting 20 stores, you can press one button. You see, there's a group coming. Click and the group lay down. The first two of the group fall automatically, because you have already sifted through them. And others will not crawl further, because some of them are -300-, and others are frightened and must evacuate the wounded. Although they met in the Kupyansk direction of -storm-zet-, they simply have no choice to go back there - only forward, because behind them are -blockades-, explains -Bach-. -I personally did not participate in the offensives, but we cleared paths, worked with SSO groups, with the DRG, with intelligence colleagues who were preparing for offensive actions,- the military man says about the role of sappers in preparing for offensive actions. The so-called -gray zone- between the positions is very densely mined both by us and by the enemy, so before the fighters can start an assault, sappers must both remove their own mine barriers and clear the way to the enemy's positions from enemy mines as much as possible. -In order for the group to pass covertly without losses, we climb out first and clear all the mines. If there is an opportunity, we use mine detectors. If there is none, then simply by crawling, with feelers. First, we made a corridor in our barricades, crawled, made as much as possible to the enemy's positions - and then the group can enter through a safe corridor,- says the sapper. A path for armored vehicles is also cleared in a similar way, but mechanized means such as demining units can be used there. They make it possible to lay passages about 4 meters wide in enemy minefields, which is enough for the movement of a tank. The sapper emphasizes that an infantryman must be able not only to detect, but also to set mines. The damage that can be inflicted on the enemy by laying mines of directed action can in many cases be fatal for him. This is how you can destroy and stop entire groups of Russian infantrymen: -As practice shows, people are taught how to handle weapons, shooting, tactics, and tactical equipment at the BZVP. For engineering training in general, there may be only 1‒2 hours for the entire course. But in today's realities, the infantry must be able to lay mines. Now there are many mines of the American model of the M18A1 Claymore type. In our military, it is considered engineer ammunition, and in the US army, it is infantry ammunition. It goes just like a one-shot RPG, just like grenades. The same goes for -Claymore- - a small handbag, an anti-personnel mine and a net with a ready-made detonator. You may not have a sapper with you in the trench every second who can supply you. But there may be several claymore mines. Then he climbed out carefully, put it down. I have acquaintances from the assault brigades, and they tell me that there were cases when our guys held the defense with the help of such mines and repelled several assaults. The assault group simply goes, they put a mine behind the parapet, click - and the group lay down. Stopped smoking, recharged. You see the group again - the mine was placed, click. And whoever remained alive was shot. That is, in skillful hands, you can do serious things.- Since August 2024, -Bach- has served in the 115th separate mechanized brigade as an instructor in mine and explosive training. He teaches newly arrived infantrymen not to be afraid of mines, demining explosive objects and setting mines in combat conditions. -We let you feel every live mine, every detonator, every -fly-, every detonator. We explain and show how to blow up, what are the blasting machines and so on. Everyone felt everything, made several attempts to install it. Of course, without detonation, but the fighters get basic experience and will be able to use it in combat conditions,- says the sapper. During his service as a mine and explosives instructor, he and his brother with the call sign -Monk- have already trained several hundred fighters. -Bach- is sure that thorough comprehensive training of Ukrainian soldiers is one of the key keys to victory. After all, it is not enough to be motivated and have the necessary weapons - you should be able to use them skillfully. Therefore, the service of the instructor is an important contribution to the victory over the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/500-kul-u-voroga-odnym-postrilom-minno-vybuhovyj-majster-klas-vid-baha/	2025-02-04T20:38:52-08:00
Term service in Chechnya, or rape by Buryats: how they force Ukrainians on the TOT to sign a contrac...	Mobilization processes in the occupied Ukrainian territories are already ongoing. For example, conscription is already being held there. As the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported at the beginning of January, from October 1 to December 31, 2024, in the temporarily occupied territories of the Zaporizhia and Kherson regions, the aggressor state Russia mobilized about three hundred people. -The occupation administrations intensified pressure with the aim of increasing the volume of conscription in the enslaved communities of the Kherson region and the Zaporizhia region - they require all men under the age of 60 to register for the so-called -military registration-. Those who try to avoid participating in the war against Ukraine are threatened, in particular, with the deprivation of earnings and means of livelihood,- said the message of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. Also, in the occupied territories, they are actively working with the population to sign a contract for service. According to the data published by the Center of National Resistance, for almost 10 months in 2024, about 10,000 of Ukrainians living in the temporarily occupied territories became servicemen of the Russian army. And in general, according to the Russian plan, at least 150,000 recruits should be added to the ranks of the occupation forces. Among them, a significant share falls on temporarily occupied Donetsk region, Luhansk region, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson region and annexed Crimea. Intensification of mobilization in the occupied territories began in 2024. In particular, in the fourth quarter, for the first time with the start of the conscription campaign, military commissars in the occupied territories received strict mobilization tasks, says Petro Andryushchenko, head of the Center for the Study of the Occupation. These tasks were transferred to the occupation authorities, so that they would send the workers of communal enterprises to the military commissariats. And then they tried to force these people to sign a contract for service in the Russian army. For example, such cases were first recorded in the Mariupol district, and later spread to the Melitopol and Berdyan districts. -The conscription campaign began in October. Military commissars went around the villages, collecting boys under the age of 23. They were brought to the Military Commissariat and the blackmail began. They threatened that they would now be conscripted and sent to Chechnya or to the Buryats. And there they will be raped and the like. And such threats worked. Some guys signed a contract. We know about 15 such facts in the Mariupol district alone,- says Petro Andryushchenko. Also, the occupiers constantly -process- those who were called up for long-term service. They try to -motivate- to sign the contract in different ways. -They were also locked up in military commissariats and forced to sign a contract. They said that they would not be sent to the front. They will be cooks, drivers. They offered 800,000 rubles for signing a contract and from 200,000 rubles a month. These are smaller amounts than offered in the regions of Russia. But this is a lot of money for the occupied territories. They are also -pressing- even in the military units themselves. For them to sign contracts. And it worked too. Because we have data on prisoners from the same Mariupol district. That is, as soon as someone signed a contract, he almost immediately found himself at the front. And if they were lucky, they were captured,- says Petro Andryushchenko. By the way, the treatment of conscripts from the temporarily occupied territories in the Russian army is a separate story, which we have already discussed they wrote. According to Petro Andryushchenko, the situation will only worsen in the near future. The spring draft is approaching, which will have even more aggressive plans for mobilization. In addition, the occupiers have a need to increase the number of mobilized. -Why do I come to this conclusion? On average, the occupiers gather 30-35 thousand people for the army. And they lose from 40 to 45 thousand every month. There is also a clear drop in the number of people willing to sign a contract on the territory of Russia. Therefore, it is unlikely that they will be able to significantly increase this mobilization under such conditions. And this means that coercive measures must be included. And where to do it? In past years, they did it at the expense of their marginals, convicts and migrants. Society approved it. Now this can be done at the expense of occupied territories. -Busification- in conditional Berdyansk or Mariupol will be perceived normally by the same Muscovites. Like, you wanted to join Russia, so go now and fight,- says Petro Andryushchenko. Meanwhile, everything is ready for this in the occupied territories. Military registration is available, the data has been updated. Locking people in the occupied territories is easy. -Block exits to Crimea and the territory of the Donetsk region, and that's it - mobilize as much as you want. And it will happen sooner or later. The Russians have everything ready there. And they are able to collect the necessary number of people by coercive measures,- believes Petro Andryushchenko. In 2022, several tens of thousands of Ukrainians joined the ranks of the Russian-controlled LNR and DNR groups. Forced mobilization there began about a week before the full-scale invasion began. Usually it happened like this - orders came from the military commissariat to the enterprises that the men should appear at a certain time, like for -retraining-. And there they immediately issued weapons, uniforms and sent to the units. And then these very people went to storm Ukrainian positions in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, they were transferred for the so-called -consolidation- and maintenance of territories captured by the Russians in the Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhya, and Kherson regions. It was the residents of Luhansk region and Donetsk region that were captured by Ukrainians in large numbers. For example, near Mayorsk, the Ukrainian military managed to capture 10 mobilized men from the occupied Horlivka. All of them worked in educational institutions. And all of them were forcibly mobilized and thrown into battle without preparation. Interviews with some of them was once published by journalist Volodymyr Zolkin. Aggressive forced mobilization in the occupied territories continued throughout 2022. People were taken away not only from enterprises, but also raids were arranged through the streets of occupied settlements. Many people got into the occupation army simply by going out into the street for some need. The SBU wrote about one of these stories. Here are literally two quotes from the interrogation of this prisoner, which demonstrate how mobilization in the occupied territories took place at that time: -I went to the store to buy food, they packed me right on the street and brought me to some building. Then they loaded it into a dump truck and took it with the others further.- -They told us to fight. But when the shelling began, I climbed into the tank with the others and hid. They don't shoot because they don't even know how to shoot.- And there were a lot of such stories in 2022. It is not worth counting that nothing like this will happen again. The only guaranteed possibility of not getting into the ranks of the occupying army is to defend ourselves and not allow the enemy to occupy our country. By the way, the mobilization of the adult population in the occupied Ukrainian territories is only part of Russia's plan to replenish its mobilization resources. Another component is militarization of Ukrainian children who are supposed to be there mobilization reserve of the aggressor state.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/strokova-sluzhba-u-chechni-abo-gvaltuvannya-buryatamy-yak-prymushuyut-ukrayincziv-na-tot-ukladaty-kontrakt-z-armiyeyu-rf/	2025-02-04T20:32:58-08:00
Aiming at nuclear deterrence: France develops new hypersonic missile to reach Mach 7	As informs the specialized defense portal Zone Militaire, this project, implemented by MBDA France with the support of the ONERA aerospace research center, is aimed at creating a weapons system that will provide the country with the ability to withstand challenges from Russia and China, ArmyInform reports. The special feature of the ASN4G is its combination of hypersonic speed, stealth and long range, making it an unrivaled deterrent tool. In turn, the experts of the Army Recognition site detailed the plans of the French gunsmiths. This product should replace the existing medium-range missile ASMPA and will be compatible with Rafale F5 fighters. The claimed range of ASN4G is 1K. km, and the speed will reach 8.6 thousand km. km/h ASN4G is expected to reach speeds of Mach 6 to Mach 7, far exceeding ASMPA's capabilities. This speed, combined with improved maneuverability, will allow the missile to avoid radar detection and interception by modern air defense systems. The range of the ASN4G is claimed to be twice that of the ASMPA and will provide greater operational flexibility. The missile will also have stealth characteristics achieved through the use of specialized materials that reduce radar visibility and withstand extreme aerodynamic and thermal conditions during flight. The ASN4G engine is based on a supersonic jet engine developed under the PROMETHEE program. This propulsion system uses mixed combustion technology to transition between subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic speeds, ensuring the rocket's ability to maintain high speeds over long distances. The inclined X-shaped tail (aerodynamic rudders) with -camber- angles of about 120 degrees, as well as the -zigzag- edge of the tail part of the ASN4G airframe should maximally reduce the EOP of the missile when irradiated by the enemy's ground and air-based radar from the rear hemisphere. At the same time, the area of ​​aerodynamic rudders is very significant, which indicates the possibility of performing anti-aircraft maneuvers of medium intensity even in the upper layers of the stratosphere (35-38 km). The architecture of the ASN4G on-board radio electronic equipment, including the guidance system, attracted considerable interest from experts. Based on the sketch, there is (in addition to the inertial navigation system and radio altimeters) a wide range of radio reconnaissance sensors for the detection of radiation sources and their identification, with further comparison with templates from a preloaded database. This is evidenced by the presence of large radio-transparent panels on the sides of the fuselage that form the nose. Passive antennas of the radiation warning station can also be placed behind them to alert the BCOM (Board Digital Computing Machine, - ed) of the missile about -capture- by illumination and guidance radars of the air defense system, or active search engines of anti-aircraft missiles and missiles of the -air-to-air- class. The development and use of the ASN4G sketch variant for France will mean the appearance in its armed forces of not a conventional 4th-generation multi-purpose hypersonic missile with nuclear -equipment-, but a multifunctional strike-reconnaissance hypersonic platform. The missile's compact design ensures compatibility with existing platforms, including the Rafale F5 fighter and future systems such as the Future Combat Air System's Next Generation Fighter (NGF) (FCAS). Development of ASN4G began in the 1990s at the same time as the modernization of ASMPA. In 2014, the French Ministry of the Armed Forces approved the program, with initial research focusing on two key approaches: stealth and hyperspeed. The choice in favor of hypersonic speed was based on its effectiveness in overcoming increasingly sophisticated restriction and denial of access and maneuvering systems (A2/AD). ASN4G is part of France's broader strategy to modernize its nuclear deterrent capabilities. It will be integrated with the Rafale F5 fighter and compatible with future platforms. Its deployment will strengthen the airborne component of France's nuclear deterrent, which is operated by the Strategic Air Force (FAS) and the Naval Nuclear Air Force (FANu). The missile's ability to perform complex maneuvers at hypersonic speeds ensures its effectiveness against modern missile defense systems. In parallel, related efforts include ArianeGroup's development of the V-MAX hypersonic glider, which complements the ASN4G program objectives. ASN4G is expected to be operational by 2035, and its service life will last beyond 2050. Its development is a continuation of France's commitment to maintaining an independent and reliable nuclear deterrent. With the integration of a hypersonic engine, improved stealth and increased range, the missile is designed to ensure the effectiveness of France's deterrent position in an increasingly contested security environment.

Russia made up -a discharged veteran of the Armed Forces of Ukraine- from -Cirque du Soleil-: analys...	The fake spread quickly through pro-Russian Telegram channels and, as it usually happens, crumbled at the first verified fact. According to the version of Russian agitators, the unknown -Ukrainian fighter- decided to become a circus performer after serving in the Armed Forces. His talent impressed everyone, but then the administration allegedly found out that he was -ex-military- and immediately got rid of him, citing some -political reasons-. Some versions of this fake even contained unique -details- - it was said that circus artists were afraid to work next to him because -he was too good with a knife- and -reacted too quickly to sudden movements.- It sounds like a script for an unsuccessful drama on a second-rate propaganda channel, but in fact it is another clichéd product of a factory of fakes aimed at discrediting Ukrainians in the world. Russian fakers are constantly working to create the impression that Ukrainians are becoming -dangerous to the world- because of the war. Their goal is to sow fear and mistrust, portray the Ukrainian military as aggressive, unbalanced, or even unadapted to normal life. This is part of their information war, which has little to do with reality. -Cirque du Soleil- does exist, but -discharged veteran- does not. The only thing that can be confirmed for sure is that real clowns are sitting in the Kremlin. And if someone really lost their job, it is the Russian propagandists, who can no longer make even their fakes convincing.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/rosiya-vygadala-zvilnenogo-veterana-zsu-z-czyrk-dyu-solej-rozbir-novogo-fejku/	2025-02-04T20:04:38-08:00

Russian agents were preparing a terrorist attack against the police in Bukovina	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on Tuesday, February 4. According to the investigation, two attackers were preparing to blow up a police team in the Vyzhnytskyi district, which was supposed to arrive after a fake call to 102. -To commit a terrorist attack, the perpetrators planted an improvised explosive device (IED) in an abandoned farm building, equipped with self-tapping screws for maximum damage. The explosive device was hidden in a garbage bag, and nearby in a juice box was a mobile phone that filmed the entrance to the building. Using remote access to the gadget, the occupiers planned to activate the SVP when the police entered the building. By this time, the agents should have gone into hiding,- the message reads. They received all relevant instructions from their Russian curator through social networks. The operatives of the special service detained the suspects, who turned out to be local drug dealers aged 17 and 18, after they planted explosives and returned to their apartments. Both defendants were notified of suspicion under the articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: Detainees face up to 12 years in prison with confiscation of property. As reported by ArmyInform, the SBU detained a saboteur in Rivne , who was preparing a terrorist attack on the railway.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/agenty-rf-gotuvaly-terakt-proty-policziyi-na-bukovyni/	2025-02-04T11:15:31-08:00
Skirmishes in the Pokrovsky direction have decreased, the enemy is looking for detours and maneuveri...	This was reported by the deputy commander for psychological support of the 155th of the separate mechanized brigade named after Anna of Kyiv, major Ivan Surov. -The intensity has indeed decreased a bit, but the general tactics have remained the same. That is, they try to advance in small infantry groups under the cover of artillery. And yes, indeed, the last day or two, the intensity of hostilities has decreased a little,- confirmed the soldier. He also added that currently the enemy is trying to move mainly during the day. -The Russian troops currently have a shortage of night optics, and our drones, known as -Baba Yaga- or -Vampire- — are active at night — heavy bombers. Since they are easy to see during the day because of their large size, they work mainly at night,- explained the representative of the 155th OMBr. In turn, the commander of the 59th separate assault brigade named after Yakov Handziuk of the Forces of Unmanned Systems with the call sign -Bird- notes that, despite the huge losses, the Russian invaders do not stop, but try not to enter into a head-on collision with Ukrainian units, but to bypass them. -The enemy uses different tactics, tries to carry out assault actions in different ways. On armored vehicles, on lightly armored vehicles or, in general, with ordinary vehicles that they have available, such as buggies. Tries to use different tactics. Tries from one side - the brigade fights back decently - tries from the other. Maneuvering,'' said the combatant of the 59th OShBr. As reported by ArmyInform, The defense forces defeated a convoy of Russian Federation in the Pokrovsky direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/manevruye-boyezitknen-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-stalo-menshe-vorog-shukaye-obhidni-shlyahy/	2025-02-04T11:07:18-08:00

According to Borodin, the entire system of commanding the enemy's troops is built on -unlimited- manpower. Everyone is thrown into the attacks - some debtors, some convicts, some mobilized go into the attack. They cook for one or two weeks. -Their system is built on losses. They perfectly understand the shortcomings of this system, it is adapted to these shortcomings. The latest trend is that they don't even say to storm a target. They say we must go and take positions, that is, their positions. Near the pine tree. And these are our positions,- Oleksandr Borodin said. As reported by ArmyInform, on In the direction of Pokrovsky, the enemy tried to break through the Ukrainian defenses, throwing into battle a tank, two BMPs with infantry, but thanks to the coordinated work of our warriors, this offensive turned into their defeat.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/u-nyh-systema-pobudovana-na-vtratah-rosijskyh-shturmovykiv-na-kupyanshhyni-vidpravlyayut-pomyraty-vtemnu/	2025-02-04T10:44:54-08:00

As the tank commander told, the order was received to roll out to the village of Kalynivka and -disassemble- the enemy positions there from 200 meters away. On the way, Russian FPV drones started working on the tank, one of which damaged the triplex through which the mechanic was looking. However, the tank reached Kalynyvka and started firing. At this time, several more drones flew over it. The car caught fire, almost lost control, the turret jammed. But the tankers were able to turn around and roll back. The tank commander had to look out from the tower and say where to go, because the mechvod could not see anything from his place. -Near total loss of control, several FPV landings, driving blind in a tank on fire and mission accomplished!

-Training is the key to success-: Marine -Mickey- on preparing for battle	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Mickey- together with his family had to stay in occupation for several months. When they were lucky and were able to go to the territory controlled by the Ukrainian troops, the boy immediately went to the territorial center of recruitment and social support to join the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. -There was absolutely no thought that I could do it differently. I swore an oath to the Ukrainian people, served a term of service. Besides, I have seen plenty of how the occupiers behave on our land,- the young scout shares his thoughts. At TCC -Mickey- he was immediately offered to join the then 124th separate territorial defense brigade. First, he got into the car company, and then continued to serve in other logistics units. However, from the first days, the fighter dreamed of serving in intelligence. -Intelligence is a very interesting place of service, here a lot depends on ingenuity, ingenuity, non-standard approaches to tasks. You are constantly on the move and forced to improve,- the warrior notes. A junior sergeant's unit and really special. Marine scouts perform complex and very important tasks. They often operate independently, without the support of adjacent units, on the front lines and behind enemy lines. Reconnaissance is not simply about observing the positions of the occupiers. Scouts pave a safe way for infantry to positions, scout for mine-explosive barriers of the enemy, analyze changes in the general situation in the area of ​​their responsibility, and, of course, are directly engaged in the destruction of manpower and equipment of the Rashists. -During combat missions, mostly everything depends on you. How did you prepare, how was the task plan drawn up, what factors were taken into account, what equipment was selected based on the specifics of the task. We pay a lot of attention to personnel training, especially to young recruits. I train them myself, constantly, every day, unless we are on a combat mission. If a fighter successfully completes a training task, well, well done. If not, let's train further,- the young commander smiles broadly. There is a place for both dreams and hopes in war. And it should be so because it gives strength to continue our struggle for our country, the liberation of its territories and our people, who are waiting for us in the Ukrainian lands occupied by the Russian invaders. Despite the difficult years spent in the war, -Mickey- does not lose optimism. He dreams of returning with his mother to his native village and planting a vegetable garden again. And he definitely wants to visit Henichesk and ride the water slides there. The man is convinced that this will definitely happen. As reported by ArmyInform, Sergeant of the Air Force Yevhen Pogozhih knows what a real risk is.

In the Pokrovsky direction, the Russians on BMPs landed in the area of ​​responsibility of the 5th Assault Brigade. Unfortunately, the enemy BMP managed to escape, but all 11 Russians who rushed were eliminated by the brigade fighters. Again, in the Pokrovsky direction, the injured Russian tried to escape from the FPV drone of the Skala attack aircraft. The regiment's aerial scouts followed his movements. Towards the end, the occupier decided to lie down next to his previously liquidated colleagues and pretend to be dead. Our FPV eliminated him in this position. These and other topics are discussed by our presenters - Lieutenant Yevhen Nazarenko and Junior Lieutenant Volodymyr Kravchuk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/k-2-polyuye-na-rosiyan-dron-oshtrafuvav-okupanta-vertolit-zbyvaye-shahed-strim-iz-pryfrontovogo-mista/	2025-02-04T08:41:11-08:00

The corresponding footage was made public by the 155th separate mechanized brigade named after Anna of Kyiv. On them, you can see how the Russian moves from one shelter to another, but at some point he loses his vigilance and relaxes too much, as a result of which he catches the eyes of the Ukrainian defenders. In turn, the soldiers of the Armed Forces immediately met the invader with heavy fire, literally peppering him with lead.

When the second drone arrived for control, it saw the quad bike on fire and the driver lying on the side of the road and looking dead. But our pilots decided to look into the face of the enemy. And his nerves couldn't stand it, he got up and tried to grab our drone, after which the video disappeared. The third drone recorded the traumatic separation of the enemy's head. That is, the second drone worked. In addition to this trick, the UA_REG Team fighters also attacked enemy vehicles and armored vehicles. As reported by ArmyInform, the operator of the UA_REG Team unit of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine made a selection of destroyed Russian vehicles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/majzhe-poviryly-na-kurshhyni-rosiyanyn-tak-dobre-udavav-z-sebe-mertvogo-shho-zdyvuvav-pilotiv/	2025-02-04T08:07:17-08:00
The government has expanded the list of free medical services for veterans	About this on Tuesday, February 4, reported in the Ukrainian government, noting that the Cabinet of Ministers has already adopted the relevant resolution. -This project is another important step towards high-quality medical support for veterans, which takes into account the consequences of war and provides personalized assistance to everyone who defended Ukraine,- the message reads. What will change? Now, veterans who signed declarations with their family doctor will be able to receive: Who can benefit? How will it be possible to receive free medical services? Sign declaration with a family doctor (or contact a doctor with whom it has already been signed). Submit the following documents: -Services will be provided in medical institutions that will sign a contract with the National Health Service for extended primary medical care for veterans. These can be both communal hospitals and private clinics, as well as private practice doctors with the appropriate license,- the government explained. The project will start already at the beginning of March, and when all mechanisms are set up, veterans will be informed about it separately. -The health of veterans is our duty. War is exhausting both physically and psychologically, so it is important not only to treat, but to prevent diseases. Regular visits to the family doctor help to avoid serious diseases and complications. Together with the Ministry of Health, we are working to ensure that veterans have the best conditions for treatment and recovery,- said the head of the Ministry of Veterans Affairs, Nataliya Kalmykova.

Hugging trees, burying themselves in the grass — the Russians took amazing dying poses	The video was released on February 4 on the brigade's channel. Some Russians hugged the trees, pressed themselves with all their might to blend in with them and make themselves invisible. Others hid in the bushes. Some buried themselves in the grass, some tried to pretend to be dead. But our drones did not allow themselves to be deceived and made life easier for our infantry by destroying the stormtroopers. As ArmiyaInform reported, the enemy is intensifying its efforts in the Pokrovsky direction.

There is ammunition, there are wounded - the Defense Forces will receive a new ground drone	About this reported on February 4 the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine with reference to the Main Directorate for Life Cycle Support of Weapons and Military Equipment. NRK Gimli is a universal unmanned platform designed to perform a wide range of tasks in the complex conditions of high-intensity combat operations. Depending on the configuration and attached equipment, the workers perform the tasks of evacuating and moving personnel, transporting ammunition, property, and performing other important support and maintenance tasks. In addition, the Gimli NRC can be equipped with weapons and perform the functions of a mobile combat module, carrying out fire damage to enemy targets. Gimli's robots are small in size, making them easy to transport. Equipped with a silent electric motor. A full battery charge is enough for several hours of continuous operation. Robots are able to perform tasks both during the day and at night. The Ministry of Defense reminds the producers of OVT that useful information on the codification procedure of new samples of weapons and military equipment can be found at here. The robot is named after a character from the Lord of the Rings book, a mighty dwarf. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense approved 10 samples of combat helmets. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/tudy-boyeprypasy-zvidty-poranenyh-syly-oborony-otrymayut-novyj-nazemnyj-dron/	2025-02-04T07:13:03-08:00
For a middle finger in the direction of the Armed Forces - 6 years in prison: the Poltava TCC hopes ...	This is the same man from Poltava who the year before last spat at a veteran, provoked a conflict with military personnel of the Poltava TCC and SP, and later posted a video on his Instagram showing the middle finger to the Ukrainian military. Someone will say that almost two years have passed, everyone has already forgotten about this character, and the Ukrainian court has only now made a decision. Yes, the millstones of the legal process grind slowly, but relentlessly. Especially since such cases are not frequent in our country. And, one way or another, the culprit will be imprisoned for the next 6 years and half of his property will be confiscated. -The sentence for Roman Zavoloka is quite expected and fair. We hope that the sentence for the murderer of our serviceman will be just as fair. It is only a pity that the guilty verdicts are not able to change the attitude towards the military servicemen of the TCC and SP, who faithfully and faithfully perform their duties,- the Poltava Regional TCC and SP commented on the event. It may seem that the sentences really will not change the attitude towards the military from TCC and SP. But this is only at first glance. It is only necessary to create a precedent. If the society sees that the state awards 6 years of imprisonment for a middle finger to the military forces of Ukraine, then whoever wants to repeat Zavoloka's -feat- is unlikely to raise a hand to do so in the literal sense. And with this, believe me, comes a change in attitude towards military personnel serving in the TCC and SP. Those whom the state does not allow to be insulted, sooner or later, the part of the country that, according to the Law, is considered conscripts, begins to respect. And it is not for nothing that in the comments of the Poltava TCC and SP expressed the hope that the sentence for the killer of their colleague from the regional Poltava territorial recruitment center would be just as fair. We are talking about the crime committed by the suspect Vadym Kuzub on February 1 of this year, shooting at a military man who was accompanying the mobilized to the educational center. -It is unacceptable that people of various levels of influence and media influence - from Russian bots and agents to people's deputies - are trying to justify the very fact of the murder of a soldier by a civilian in 2025. It is unacceptable the phenomenon when, instead of working on solving problematic issues, instead of planned and immediate work with the goal of eradicating systematic contempt for military personnel of the TCC and SP, there is a detailed examination of the identity of the killed soldier and a discussion of whether he was sufficiently -military,- Poltava emphasized. TCC and joint venture. Yes, Russian bots in social networks did a lot to blacken the image of the deceased. But, you must agree, after today's sentence to Roman Zavolotsa, confidence increases significantly that any citizen who dares to attack a soldier of the TCC and SP will certainly be punished. ArmyInform earlier reported that the commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Major General Mykhailo Drapaty, expressed his position regarding the latest cases of attack on the military in the rear. According to him, the killings of servicemen are a red line that cannot be crossed, and society should not silently watch the disrespect for the defenders of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/za-serednij-palecz-u-bik-zsu-6-rokiv-tyurmy-u-poltavskomu-tczk-spodivayutsya-shho-i-dlya-vbyvczi-vyrok-bude-spravedlyvym/	2025-02-04T07:02:27-08:00
A traitorous mother is grief in the family: a woman involved her minor son in arson	This was reported on February 4 by the Security Service of Ukraine. The main -targets- of the enemy were administrative buildings of state institutions, SUVs of the Defense Forces and relay cabinets of Ukrzaliznytsia. To commit crimes, Russian special services remotely recruited local residents who were looking for -easy- earnings on Telegram channels. For example, a 40-year-old local woman was detained in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, who organized the arson of a military pick-up truck of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and 3 relay cabinets on railway lines. The woman received the relevant -orders- from Russia via messenger, and for their fulfillment she involved her 17-year-old son and his classmate. After -agreeing- on a potential target, the young men arrived together at its location and set it on fire with a flammable mixture. A 17-year-old student of a local college was arrested in Rivne -on hot pursuit-, who burned down an official car of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This transport was driven to the western region for maintenance after completing combat missions at the front. In order to commit the crime, the suspect made an incendiary mixture with his own hands in his room in the dormitory. A 34-year-old resident of Shepetivka, who set fire to the premises of the city council, was arrested in Khmelnytskyi region. First, the woman broke a window on the first floor of the administration building, and then threw a bottle with an incendiary mixture into the middle. As a result of the fire, the windowsill and the floor in one of the offices of the state institution were damaged. Currently, all detainees have been notified of their suspicion of crimes committed under several articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: The perpetrators face various terms of imprisonment, including life imprisonment with confiscation of property.

-Instructor- back in battle: the story of a school teacher who became a company commander on the fro...	Fierce battles on the front line Since 2023, Yevhen has been serving in the 58th brigade, where he joined from the reserve unit. During this time, he passed the hottest points of the front — the Avdiiv and Vugledar areas. Among the most tense battles, he mentions Krasnohorivka, Stepove and Ugledar. The assaults here continued from morning to evening, and the task of the Ukrainian soldiers was to restrain the enemy. Yevhen notes that the enemy's tactics remain the same - the enemy's troops are acting head-on, trying to take quantity, not quality. A feature of the battles in the Vugledar region was the active use of motorcycle groups by the Russians: fighters on high-speed motorcycles broke through to the positions of the Ukrainian troops, throwing grenades into the trenches. Despite the difficult conditions, the motivation of the fighters remains high. -We have been fighting for independence for more than a thousand days. Who but us?- Yevhen emphasizes. He is convinced that Ukrainians are a nation capable of adapting to any conditions and fighting for victory. According to him, representatives of various professions are currently fighting in the ranks of the Armed Forces - teachers, doctors, mechanics, agronomists. -Man is a creature that knows how to survive. And if there is motivation, we will win,- he adds. The commander emphasizes the importance of rest and moral support of the military. Exhausted battles require regular rotations and attention to the psychological state of the fighters. At the same time, he believes in victory: -We want to return to the borders of 1991, and we will work on it. But the main thing is to prevent this war from happening again in a few years.- Addressing civilians, Yevgeny urges them not to be afraid of mobilization and to join the ranks of the Armed Forces. -War is not good, but one must protect one's land, one's children, one's women. We will stand, because the truth is with us,- concludes the officer. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian special services and the military are increasingly trying to influence the families of Ukrainian prisoners of war. Numerous cases have been recorded when the occupiers contact relatives immediately after taking the defender into captivity.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/instruktor-znovu-v-boyu-istoriya-shkilnogo-vchytelya-yakyj-stav-komandyrom-roty-na-peredovij/	2025-02-04T06:04:10-08:00

Russia uses explosive drones to terrorize civilians	informs the State Emergency Service of Ukraine about this. If you see a suspicious object that looks like an explosive drone, under no circumstances approach it or try to touch it. Instead, report the find immediately to 101 or 102. The Russian occupiers continue to use -killer- drones that detonate on contact, putting civilians in mortal danger. It is especially important to explain this to children, who may not be aware of the threats and accidentally become victims. The State Emergency Service urges Ukrainians to be extremely careful, avoid suspicious objects and immediately report them to the appropriate services.

Transfer through Army+: the MOU explained the difference between orders and orders	In the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine explained what are the differences between these documents and how their implementation is controlled. For officers, the Personnel Center of the Armed Forces prepares a transfer order. At the same time, there are orders for private, senior and non-commissioned officers. Both documents are mandatory. Orders and transfer orders can currently take up to two weeks to form and finalize. However, it is important to distinguish between these documents. When contacting the military unit, the soldier or sergeant should ask for the transfer order itself. In Army+, cases are recorded when the order is already ready, but the soldiers are still not transferred, waiting for the order. When changing the place of service, the order does not indicate the position of a military person. Only name, title, part number and taxpayer card number are provided. Thus, if a position has changed within one military unit, this is not an obstacle to transfer. This is a violation of the right of a serviceman, because orders and orders are mandatory. The Central Office for the Protection of Servicemen's Rights together with the military administration bodies respond to possible cases of commanders ignoring the execution of orders and monitor their execution. If the military unit received an order or order, but ignores their implementation, it is necessary to report this to Army+. The MOU noted that the Central Department for the Protection of Servicemen's Rights will receive the appeal and will monitor the implementation of the order or transfer order. Previously, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine published an explanation of the transfer mechanism in the Army+ application, as well as the reasons why delays may occur.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/perevedennya-cherez-armiya-u-mou-poyasnyly-chym-vidriznyayutsya-nakazy-j-rozporyadzhennya/	2025-02-04T05:06:13-08:00

A record number of Russians are looking for their missing people in Ukraine: the -I want to find- pr...	This is reported by Coordinating Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. During the month, 8,548 requests for information on missing soldiers of the army of the aggressor country were received. This is 22% more compared to the previous month, which is the highest figure for the entire duration of the project. -I want to find- is a separate project of the Coordination Headquarters, which was launched in January 2024 with the goal of facilitating the exchange of prisoners of war. During the project's operation, it received more than 60,000 inquiries about missing Russian servicemen. It is important to note that this figure does not include the dead and is only part of the real number of missing Russians. According to experts, the total number of missing Russian soldiers may be 2-3 times higher, since not all families turn to the Ukrainian project. However, even this statistic is impressive. Of the 60,000 applications received, the project confirmed the captivity of 1,790 soldiers of the aggressor country, 408 of whom have already been exchanged for Ukrainian defenders. These figures are also lower than the actual number of POW invaders, as they are based solely on applications received. The increase in the number of -I want to find- requests from Russians is an eloquent testimony to the huge losses suffered by the enemy in Ukraine. This is not surprising, because Russian commanders are increasingly resorting to the tactics of -meat assaults-, sending untrained soldiers to the front, -zeroing- them and leaving the wounded on the battlefield. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian special services and the military are increasingly trying to influence the families of Ukrainian prisoners of war. Numerous cases were recorded when the occupiers contacted relatives immediately after taking the Defender into captivity.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/rekordna-kilkist-rosiyan-shukaye-svoyih-znyklyh-bezvisty-v-ukrayini-proyekt-hochu-najty-otrymav-hvylyu-zapytiv/	2025-02-04T04:07:00-08:00

-Too risky-: the story of a fighter who brought his comrades out from under enemy fire	The story of the fighter's heroic deed was made public on the page of the air command -East-. The village of Liptsi, which was liberated from the invaders by the Ukrainian military for the second time, is of strategic importance. From here, the enemy could direct artillery fire on Kharkiv, so holding positions is critical. Daily artillery duels, drone attacks and small assault groups of Russians make the situation extremely tense. Logistics and unit rotation are complicated — enemy FPV drone operators control the roads. It was in such conditions that Sergeant of the Air Force Yevhen Pogozhih, together with his comrades, found himself under heavy fire when entering the position. When 50 meters to the destination, the enemy FPV drone dropped a grenade. One of the soldiers, an Air Force fighter with the call sign -Doc-, was seriously wounded. He had to be evacuated urgently. -The brothers shouted that it was too risky,- says Yevgeny. — But there was no other way out. Together with his friend, he began to carry the wounded, hiding behind the trees. However, a Russian drone spotted them and corrected the mortar fire. — The real mortar horror began. The mine fell a few meters away from me. He was wounded in the knee and face. If it weren't for the means of protection, I wouldn't have survived, Yevhen recalls. Despite the danger, the brothers managed to be carried to the evacuation vehicle. Ukrainian soldiers continue to put pressure on the occupiers, causing them significant losses. According to Yevhen, the motivation of Ukrainian defenders is extremely high, and each of them knows what they are fighting for. Sergeant Pogozhih has been in the Air Force since 2006. After his release in 2019, he briefly returned to civilian life, but with the start of a full-scale invasion, he again joined the ranks of the defenders. His wife also serves in the radio engineering troops, so she understands well what it means to be in the military at this time. Yevhen is currently undergoing treatment. The medical commission and doctors' decisions are ahead. But his fighting spirit remained indomitable: - There is something to fight for. So go for Victory! As reported by ArmyInform, when the full-scale invasion began, George - bijczya-shho-ne-znaye-slova-vidpochynok/->pensioner, military reserve- did not hesitate for a minute. He immediately applied for service in the Steel Border border brigade and returned to the fight for Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/zanadto-ryzykovano-istoriya-bijczya-yakyj-vynis-pobratyma-z-pid-vorozhogo-vognyu/	2025-02-04T01:06:09-08:00
National resistance: how Ukraine is building a comprehensive defense system	This is about in the notification of the Ministry of Defense. From the experience of repelling the armed aggression of the Russian Federation, Ukraine has rethought its approaches to protecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state. One of the powerful tools for countering the Russian aggressor was the concept of national resistance, a system that unites the efforts of the military, civil authorities and citizens in the fight for the independence of Ukraine. -For the third year already, our military has been restraining the enemy Russian army, which has carried out a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. All citizens of Ukraine should help the Defense Forces,- emphasized First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Lieutenant General Ivan Havryliuk. According to him, this is both the maintenance of law and order and countering saboteurs in the government-controlled territories, and assistance to the Special Operations Forces in the temporarily occupied Ukrainian lands. -In order for Victory to come closer, every Ukrainian must realize his role in the defense of the state during hostilities and in emergency situations. We must strengthen military-patriotic education, which forms a stable motivation to protect the Motherland,- he assured. National resistance is a set of measures aimed at protecting Ukraine by maximally involving its citizens. National resistance gives every Ukrainian an opportunity to contribute to the defense of the state. The main goal is to increase the state's defense capability, provide Ukraine's defense with an all-encompassing character, and help ensure the readiness of Ukrainian citizens for national resistance. The system of leadership of the national resistance is built in such a way as to ensure clear coordination of all components of the resistance. At the head is the President of Ukraine as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, who exercises leadership through the Minister of Defense of Ukraine. National resistance has three components, each of which performs its specific tasks. The first is territorial defense, which protects important facilities, maintains law and order, and counters subversive groups in controlled territory. The second component is the resistance movement that operates in the territories where Ukrainian sovereignty needs to be restored. This may include both information operations and physical opposition to the occupiers. The third component is the preparation of citizens for national resistance. This component of the system provides people with the necessary knowledge and skills to protect their land. It includes both military training and emergency training. Territorial defense units perform a wide range of tasks: from guarding important facilities to countering subversive groups. In emergency situations, they help rescuers and ensure the safety of the civilian population. An important task of territorial defense is also participation in strengthening the protection of the state border and creating conditions for the safe functioning of authorities. In wartime, ground defense units often become the first line of defense for their communities against various threats. Territorial defense also takes an active part in information confrontation, carrying out measures to counter enemy information operations. In addition, it helps in the provision of assistance to the population, which is especially important in the conditions of martial law. Territorial defense has three interrelated components: The military component includes military management bodies, military units of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, other forces and means of the Security Forces and Defense Forces involved in the performance of territorial defense tasks. The civil component includes bodies of state power and local self-government. They provide administrative support, coordination of the population and resolution of territorial defense measures. The military-civilian component is the headquarters of territorial defense zones (districts) and voluntary formations of territorial communities. They are a connecting link between military and civilian structures. The territorial defense management system is built on a clear hierarchical principle. At the national level, leadership is exercised by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces through the Commander of the Territorial Defense Forces. Within the borders of the land military zone, leadership is exercised by the heads of regional military administration bodies through the relevant headquarters. Each zone and district of territorial defense has its own leaders and headquarters, which coordinate actions at the local level. The resistance movement is a component of the national resistance, which operates where it is necessary to restore the sovereignty of Ukraine over the temporarily occupied territory. Its main tasks include forming a resistance network, conducting special operations and creating obstacles to the actions of the occupiers. An important function of the resistance movement is to carry out informational and psychological operations and to carry out intelligence activities. Specific work methods are protected by state secrets. The leadership of the resistance movement is carried out by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces through the Commander of the Special Operations Forces. The preparation of citizens for national resistance is aimed at forming citizens' patriotic consciousness, mastering practical skills and skills to protect their state. The main tasks include the formation of citizens' understanding of their role in the defense of Ukraine, training in actions in the conditions of hostilities and emergency situations. Special attention is paid to military-patriotic education, which forms a stable motivation to protect the Motherland.

If someone uses the terms -Ukrainian Nazis-, -Ukrainian militants-, -hokhlopiteks-, -banderlogs- and the like in their speech or in posts or comments on social networks, it is clear to everyone that this is done by the Russian occupiers or their henchmen. However, there are apparently neutral terms that are aimed at distorting reality and filling it with meanings beneficial to Russian propagandists. For example, at the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the mass propaganda media of the Russian occupiers tried to use the term -ZSUShniks- to designate the servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Used exclusively in a negative context, this term did not take root in Ukrainian social networks, because despite its pretended neutrality, it tried to replace and stand in for other objective and positive definitions in the speech: -Ukrainian military-, -servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine-, -defenders- and others. Having failed in the task of discrediting the entire Ukrainian army and its servicemen, enemy propagandists and numerous bots have focused their efforts on undermining its foundation — the territorial centers of recruitment and social support. The main goal of the enemy was the disruption of mobilization, and the means used by Russian propagandists were provocations against servicemen of the TCC and SP and artificially exaggerating in the information space those cases when the servicemen of the Armed Forces were unable to resist them. From just a few isolated cases to hundreds of thousands of calmly and correctly mobilized conscript citizens of Ukraine, Russian propagandists have created a fictitious image of demonized -manhunters- who seem to only do what they do by twisting and beating civilians in the rear. At the level of language, this image of the enemy was fixed with the help of the term -TCKashniki- to denote servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who are serving in the territorial centers of recruitment and social support. Russian propagandists began to artificially contrast -TCKashniks- with defenders from the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Instead, in fact, the opposition of military personnel who serve in the TCC and SP and all other structures, parts, units and units within the Armed Forces of Ukraine is artificial and harmful in nature. There are no -TCC cashiers- — there are servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who are currently serving in the TCC and SP. And before that, many of them served in combat units and were injured during combat missions. It is impossible at the same time to support the Armed Forces and throw mud at the servicemen of the TCC and SP, applying the derogatory term -TCKashniki- to them. Anyone who denigrates servicemen from the territorial recruitment and social support centers is actually directly opposing the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This means that Ukraine is a direct enemy of the Ukrainian people and the state.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/tczkashnykiv-ne-isnuye-voroga-vydaye-mova/	2025-02-04T00:32:10-08:00

He didn't ask if he could - he just stood up: the story of a fighter who doesn't know the word -rest...	The story of the fighter was made public on the DPSU page. Giorgii says that his decision to return to the army was completely conscious: -When I heard that the Steel Border was being created, I immediately applied. I was waiting for orders and was ready to engage in combat work.- The combat routine of his unit is a daily confrontation with the enemy, who uses the latest technology, intelligence, drones and advanced weapons. However, Ukrainian defenders constantly adapt and find effective methods of struggle. The enemy tries to test his weapons on Ukrainian soldiers, but our soldiers quickly analyze his tactics and give a worthy response. -Ukraine is a place where the aggressor tests the maximum of its innovations. But we don't just keep hitting, we learn and improve our tactics.- According to George, high-quality fire support is of great importance. Drones, artillery, mortars and strike drones help destroy the enemy and protect our soldiers. -The calculations of the attack drones -Vampire- showed themselves very well in battle. They allow not only to inflict fire damage, but also to remotely mine the territory where it is impossible for sappers to reach.- When enemy equipment moves to Ukrainian positions, fighters can remotely install up to a hundred mines, which greatly complicates the enemy's offensive. Despite the high combat training and coherence of the unit, George admits that the hardest thing is losing comrades. -When you send people on a mission, and you don't know if they will return. This is the hardest part. It's incredibly difficult.- The Russian army fights en masse, not counting its losses, but for the Ukrainian military, every fighter is not just a soldier, but a person behind whom family, friends, and a whole life stand. When asked what his greatest desire is, George gives a short answer: -To hear the word 'Victory'.- That's the most important thing for all of us.- He believes that the Ukrainian army will be able to stand and win back every meter of native land. As reported by ArmyInform, Vadim with the call sign -Popil- never planned to become a soldier. Before the Great War, he lived a quiet life in Khmelnytskyi, worked in a private firm, traded in dairy products.

Rescuing the wounded in the dark and under enemy fire: ArmiyaInform report from takmed exercises	It is almost impossible to see something in the dense darkness - it is early in Donetsk region. Actually, that's why the fighter came out right now, because it was too dangerous to do so. -I'm here, I'm the -three hundredth-!-, we hear a few meters from the exit from the shelter. Archer is injured and needs help. Fortunately, all this is just an imitation of a possible situation during real hostilities - a final check during tactical medicine exercises in the 2nd International Defense Legion of Ukraine. ArmiyaInform visited the final class and talked with the fighters and instructors. An intensive two-day training in tactical medicine for the soldiers of the Defense Forces is an initiative and one of the main areas of activity of the All-Ukrainian Association -Patriot- Public Organization. Classes are conducted by highly qualified specialists, the purpose of which is to provide primary or significantly improve the already existing skills and abilities of combatants. -Our manager and founder of the foundation, Hanna Maiboroda, has been involved in this community since 2014, since the time of the ATO. The main direction of the NGO -Patriot- is medical, training for both military and civilians. Now we go to different destinations and work with everyone who comes to meet us, because the demand and need for such trainings is extremely high,- says Nils, a representative of the organization. He is a former fighter of the 4th brigade of operational assignment -Rubizh- of the National Guard of Ukraine, was a combat medic in the -Force of Freedom- battalion, so he not only perfectly knows the theory, but also has considerable practical combat experience. Nils emphasizes that such trainings with soldiers, who are taken on rest during rotations, are extremely important, because they allow to constantly update their knowledge of tactical medicine. Important features of the trainings are work exclusively with small groups of 4-6 people, good supply of consumables and training dummies, as well as maximum approximation to real combat conditions. During the final exercise, fighters must render aid to a wounded comrade while simulating intense shelling of the position, in the dark and under conditions of heavy smoke. -Why is it important to implement this kind of approach? Because it is absolutely incorrect to train military personnel only in hothouse conditions for the reason that, unfortunately, there will not be ideal conditions in war. Soldiers need to be mentally and physically prepared for those moments that will arise during their real work,- explains former serviceman of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, tactical medicine instructor Andrian. That is why the fighters spend the second day of training -in the field-, helping the wounded in full combat gear and with weapons in their hands. The training is so close to reality that they need not to remove, but to cut off the uniform from the wounded - training clothes, as well as all other consumables, are provided by the NGO -Patriot-. -We use individual first-aid kits of fighters and various mannequins - for tamponade with simulated bleeding, for needle decompression, fully equipped in accordance with all requirements and standards. In the final session, we dress the wounded in second-hand clothes that can be cut, and also add simulation of explosions and smoke using airsoft and smoke grenades,- says Nils. The instructors are very satisfied with the work of the fighters during training. This is not surprising, because even an outside observer immediately notices how the students do not just perform a number, but take the initiative and ask the instructors to further explain some aspect or practice an educational exercise. -The guys are very well involved in the work. I really like that they always have questions, they talk about some situations from their own experience, they ask to comment on unclear points. Often at first they believe that they already know everything and we will not teach them anything new. But then during classes, we see how their eyes light up, how they want to work,- says Andrian. The final session must be held late in the evening, because, as experience shows, the front freezes during the day and all the events take place at night. Therefore, it is very important that fighters know how to provide first aid in the dark. Also, in the evening, after intensive training, they are already tired, and they will have to rescue a wounded comrade when they are tired. -Today we worked all day in the field in full ammunition, worked out the full MARCH algorithm and individual elements of assistance. And now (during the final class — ed.) we gathered all our knowledge together and fully practiced rescuing the wounded, giving him first aid and preparing him for evacuation,- says one of the fighters of the 2nd International Legion, who just completed training. He is satisfied with his studies, but he hopes that he will not need to use the acquired knowledge in real life: -Thank God, all these are now stickers, shams, dummies. In reality, it would be terrible. However, it is better to know and be able to never need it, than not to know what to do when the need arises.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/poryatunok-poranenyh-u-temryavi-ta-pid-vorozhym-vognem-reportazh-armiyainform-z-navchan-po-takmedu/	2025-02-03T20:46:52-08:00
A fighter on miniatures: the appearance of a UAV interceptor drone, similar to a fifth-generation ai...	As noted, not without a certain amount of boasting, on the official portal of the developer firm from the American city of Brighton , in Colorado, this next-generation jet-powered interceptor shares common features with the Lockheed F-35B stealth fighter and F-22 of the 5th generation, ArmyInform reports. The device has a length of 1.8 m, a wingspan of 1.5 m and flies at speeds of up to 320 km/h. A jet engine simulator is installed on it - an electric motor rotates turbines, which creates thrust. According to the plan, the machine will receive its own vertical takeoff system (eVTOL, Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing). It is designed to detect, track, identify and neutralize enemy drones. According to the plan of the developers, the CobraJet will have the possibility of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) and a nozzle with a thrust vector, which provides increased maneuverability. The interceptor is equipped with VIPER air-to-air missiles, each of which has a PYTHON warhead to neutralize kamikaze drones. The authors of the UAS Vision profile site about unmanned aerial vehicles stated that the CobraJet is powered by solid-state batteries with a high energy density and equipped with flight controller/autopilot with artificial intelligence, day/night camera and inertial sensors for autonomous flight in 24/7 mode. In addition, it is powered by an -electric jet engine-, a system consisting of in-duct turbines driven by an electric motor to create thrust. VTOL capability allows the CobraJet to launch from mobile platforms such as trucks, ships or other aircraft such as C-130. The SkyDefense Command and Control (C2) control system integrates VRAM (Visual Real-Time Terrain Monitoring). VRAM uses an artificial intelligence-based operating system to quickly analyze data from CobraJets and involve operators in decision-making. In addition, CobraJet drones are designed to maintain operational efficiency even in challenging electromagnetic environments, thanks to advanced anti-jamming radios and GPS receivers that provide reliable communication and navigation in jammed conditions. To further enhance their capabilities, satellite communications systems such as Starlink are being explored, offering the potential for uninterrupted communications and increased effectiveness in electronic warfare scenarios, even in remote or highly competitive areas. -Our CobraJet neutralizes enemy UAVs with airborne munitions and returns to base to rearm. This approach significantly reduces the cost of counter-drone operations, while maintaining stealth and effectiveness against new threats, including unmanned ground vehicles,- SkyDefense President Nick Verini was quoted as saying by American news resource on unmanned aerial systems UASweekly. The product also offers a mobile configuration suitable for law enforcement, Department of Homeland Security and Defense and military applications, according to SkyDefense. In this configuration, the C2 and VRAM systems are housed in tactical or militarized cyber trucks designed to operate in extreme environments with low acoustic and thermal signatures to avoid enemy detection. If you believe the promises of SkyDefense, its new device should be presented to potential customers already in the second quarter of 2025. In this case, it will become a revolution in the military, since this device is a universal hunter for drones and ground robots. Intrigue is fueled by the fact that, apart from low-quality renderings, the manufacturer has not shown anything yet. In the future, according to the assurances of the SkyDefense management, it is expected that the technologies used in the CobraJet will develop in the direction of increasing its flight range, expanding the capabilities of autonomous control and integration with more complex combat control systems. In addition, SkyDefense plans to adapt its platform for civilian tasks, such as territory monitoring or emergency response. Graphic presentation of the CobraJet unmanned drone interceptor.

-Operation -Phantom subpoena-: how Ukrainians in Europe are deported by invisible special agents-	It would seem that what could be a more reliable source of information than Telegram channels with names like -Pravda UA- or -Lawyer for all-? Well, or the same -anonymous sources in the State Border Service- who work exclusively in the fantasies of panic lovers. According to the mythology of these experts, mobile groups are already operating somewhere in Poland or Germany that search for men, instantly hand them a summons and, if possible, deport them to Ukraine on the spot. Eyewitnesses (anonymous, of course) even saw men being dragged into buses similar to those taken to the resort, but without Wi-Fi. The problem is that no real case of such -extradition- has yet been confirmed. And from a legal point of view, this is just nonsense. There is no mechanism of -instant deportation- at the request of the Military Commissariat in international law. Ukrainian legislation also does not provide for the possibility of abducting its citizens on foreign territory. A separate -sensation- is the fact that Ukrainian embassies allegedly transfer the data of evaders to the local authorities, which gladly help to deport them. The reality is that embassies do not have access to lists of conscripts (otherwise they would not ask to bring documents for consular registration by hand). Also, European countries are not very happy to run around with summonses from Ukrainian cafes, because they have more important things to do. Although, perhaps, the latest Ukrainian technology actually works: summonses are transmitted via Wi-Fi at the level of a biometric passport, and they are automatically signed in the phone through Diya. That is why it is so important to go only to McDonald's, and not to suspicious Wi-Fi zones! Some even say that Ukrainian men are no longer being released from Europe without the permission of the Military Commissariat. In particular, there were several stories about the refusal to board flights due to the fact that the -passport is in the database-. And here it is interesting: if someone is already in Europe, why should he be -not released-? Does it work like this: -Sorry, you can't fly to Egypt, but we will help you - Warsaw-Kyiv flight-? The answer is simple - everyone who benefits from creating chaos. Russian bot farms that are happy to fan panic. Dodgers who are looking for an excuse. Telegram channels that need more subscribers. If these horror stories are to be believed, soon subpoenas will be sent through Privat24, and Ukrainian men will be hunted down in European supermarkets, where they are hiding among cheese discounts. But for now, the reality is this: no one issues summonses at the border, no one is deported on the lists, and Ukrainians in Europe can sleep peacefully (unless it's not very peaceful if you have to pay for an apartment in Berlin).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/operacziya-prymarna-povistka-yak-ukrayincziv-u-yevropi-deportuyut-nevydymi-speczagenty/	2025-02-03T20:04:19-08:00
In Kyiv, they said goodbye to the Belarusian sniper: the story of Maria Zaitsava, who died for Ukrai...	Maria asked not to cry and not to bring flowers to her as a farewell if she dies, said reserve colonel Ruslan -Santa- Myroshnychenko, ex-commander of the Second International Legion: -Maria was a strong girl, a soldier, a volunteer. She commanded us to be courageous, strong, to fight the enemy. So, please don't cry. These are not my words, these are what she said. Let's not cry, gather together and fight. And we kill! Glory to Ukraine! Long live Belarus!- Maria joined the International Legion in November 2022. She was a combat medic for a long time. -I noticed that such a fragile girl appeared, a child in fact. I immediately paid attention, because then I thought, what is a high school student doing in my combat unit? But this high school student, relatively speaking, has a very well-formed personality, mature thoughts, and a well-formed determination to fight. She repeatedly repeated that she is not an object of pity, she wants to be a specific subject of struggle and she proved it every day,- said Ruslan Myroshnychenko. At first, she worked in the medical evacuation crew, and then as a combat medic directly at the positions. She was always very goal-oriented and constantly studied, recalls Maria, her fellow health instructor at the medical center, Sergeant Ruslan Boychuk. -She and I came to the Legion almost at the same time. They were in the same crew together, they took positions together. So we have a situation where some women become stronger than men. Men hide, but women even come from abroad. Maria could live peacefully in the Czech Republic, she lived there, she had a residence permit, but she came here,- recalls Ruslan Boychuk. According to Ruslan Myroshnichenko, he did not want to let her go directly to the position. But she convinced him that she could do it. And she saved the lives of several servicemen thanks to her coolness and composure. During one of the trips to the position, Maria was wounded. A fragment of a mine fell into her hand. But after treatment, she immediately returned to the unit. And she said she wanted to become a sniper. -So she firmly told me that that's enough, -Santa- is enough, I'm ready to kill. She had a desire to take revenge for her brothers,- recalls Ruslan Myroshnychenko. And Maria began to train as a sniper. At first, it was an improvised training ground in the East of Ukraine, and then she was sent to sniper courses. After returning from training, she performed combat missions in the Chasovoy Yar region, and then in the Pokrovsk region. She was an effective sniper. -This girl has struggled her whole life. And she died during a combat mission. She was in position until the last,- said the commander of the Second International Legion, Major Oleksandr Yakymovych. According to him, the unit presented Maria Zaitsava with the award -For Courage- (posthumously).

The enemy does not change its task to destroy the Ukrainian energy industry — the President	About this President said on February 3 in his evening address. -the Russians do not change their task to destroy the Ukrainian energy industry, they constantly strike and do so in order to adjust their strikes to the capabilities of our defense - to make it more difficult to repel. I thank all our soldiers, each and every one working to defeat this threat - our air shield, all air defense forces, mobile fire teams, all EW forces and EW developers. This is a constant rapid evolution of means of radio-electronic warfare. We have to be much faster in it,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. According to him, there were relevant reports at Stavka regarding the protection system, covering energy facilities, and reconstruction after the strikes. Air defense capabilities and the need for anti-missile defenses were discussed separately. -There are new tasks for our diplomacy, for the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine — to work with partners. Supply for the air defense of Ukraine is critical and must not stop. It is necessary to constantly search in the world how to strengthen protection, how to make more production of necessary things in Ukraine, how to add localization of production, how to obtain licenses from our partners. This is a big job, on which the future of Ukraine largely depends,- the President noted. As reported by ArmyInform, Volodymyr Zelensky listened to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and noted the soldiers of the 2 assault regiments.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/vorog-ne-zminyuye-svogo-zavdannya-znyshhyty-ukrayinsku-energetyku-prezydent/	2025-02-03T11:35:02-08:00

International partners have provided military ecologists with advanced equipment for chemical analys...	About this informs on February 3 the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The equipment was transferred as part of international aid with the support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Swedish government. The official ceremony took place in Kyiv with the participation of the First Secretary of the Embassy of the Kingdom of Sweden in Ukraine, Nils Dahlquis, who handed over the equipment to the head of the Center of Excellence for Mine Action and Environmental Safety, Colonel Oleg Ryabchuk. Now in the arsenal of Ukrainian military ecologists there is an MX908 mass spectrometer and a Raman Serstech Arx substance identification analyzer.

If someone does not want to serve in his army, he will be -meat- in the Russian army: an expert on f...	Now the experience of wild -safari-mobilization-, tested since February 2022 in ORDLO, is being repeated there. The other day GUR released a video abuse of forcibly mobilized Ukrainians in the Russian armed forces. About why illegal conscription in the occupied territories is another war crime of Russia, says an expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Studies-, a candidate of political sciences and a military serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yury Oliynyk. ― First of all, it is a flagrant violation of the Geneva Conventions and other international documents that prohibit the mobilization of the population in the occupied territory of a state with which there is a war (in particular, Article 51 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and Article 8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court - AI). In this way, Russia cynically violates internationally accepted norms. The population that remained in the occupation is brutally used as meat, obviously targeted by people from Russia for control. This is usual for the occupier to instill fear, which is intensified by inter-ethnic confrontation - a practice that has been used for decades and even centuries according to the principle of -divide and conquer-, - believes Yuriy Oliynyk. He says that a typical example of this situation is one of the peoples of the Caucasus, the Chechens. ― In the 1990s, they fought for their freedom, in the 2000s, Moscow was able to overcome them, and many people succumbed to Russian propaganda that soon there will be peace and tranquility, there is no need to fight. Now, instead of fighting for their own freedom, they shed blood for the interests of the invader. In addition, Chechens are specifically demonized in the eyes of other enslaved peoples of the empire in order to instill fear and so that there is no trust in them, the expert explains. It is also a clear example of what can await the population in the occupied territories if the occupied territories continue to expand. ― Against the background of the Russian propaganda campaign that is currently being conducted against the mobilization in Ukraine, against the TCC and SP, we see how they will actually act if they occupy a larger territory of Ukraine. They will not take into account the opinion of the population, but will carry out forced mobilization of everyone they catch. Therefore, if someone does not want to serve in his army, then in the event of the capture of Ukraine by the enemy, he will be used as meat for the needs of the invader.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/yakshho-htos-ne-hoche-sluzhyty-u-svoyij-armiyi-to-bude-myasom-u-vijsku-rf-ekspert-pro-prymusovu-mobilizacziyu-na-tot/	2025-02-03T04:44:00-08:00

-Begins to hang on his opponent-: why Pokrovsky's defense resembles the 10th round of a boxing match	The spokesman of the operational and strategic Major Viktor Tregubov of the -Khortytsia- troop group. According to Viktor Tregubov, the enemy's ambitions remain unchanged — to capture the city, cut the routes to it and leave the defenders of the city without supplies. However, now the Russians do not have such a great advantage that would allow them to effectively introduce offensive actions. -If they suddenly have some new powerful reserve. If they suddenly become an absolutely unlimited number. If they have an unlimited number of vehicles, an advantage over drones, then of course this could somehow change the situation,- said the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops. But, Viktor Tregubov is sure, the situation looks like there is no such great advantage now. And an offensive for the Russians is a guaranteed four-digit number of losses in just one day. -It's a bit like a boxing match that goes to the 10th round. When both boxers are tired. But the one who attacked more actively, attacked more actively at the beginning, he was already a little more tired. He just doesn't have enough energy. And he is already starting to hang on his opponent. This is what is happening here with the Russians,- Viktor Tregubov noted. As reported by /a> ArmyInform, fighters of the 13th operational brigade of NSU -Chartiya- destroyed 15 Russian invaders, as well as an ammunition depot, a cannon, and an enemy shelter.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/pochynaye-vysity-na-svoyemu-supernyku-chomu-oborona-pokrovska-nagaduye-10-j-raund-bokserskogo-poyedynku/	2025-02-03T04:24:24-08:00

FPV drones on fiber optics: the SBS commander talked about ways to counter them and similar developm...	The Commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces Colonel Vadym Suharevsky told about itin an interview with Radio Liberty's -Donbas Realities- project. -If I'm not mistaken, we recorded the first use of such drones by the enemy at the beginning of summer. Then there was a certain decline and now an active phase again. This is exactly the stage of the Cold War, when the arms race is based on the fact that something effective is invented, and the other side will come up with a way to counter it,- he noted. According to him, it is now a step behind the Ukrainian side. -We must use this technology to our advantage and find an effective means of combating it. I will announce in advance that certain ideas and results are already planned. After a journey of testing and scaling, I think we'll get there. Yes, this is a really dangerous weapon,- said the SBS commander. Vadym Sukharevskii noted that this is, on the one hand, a revolutionary approach, since all EW systems, on which billions of money have been spent, are ineffective against FPV drones on fiber optics. On the other hand, this tool constrains the occupiers in a maneuver, so the way to fight it can be effective when building a normal countermeasure system. -Our guys are already learning, they're already adapting to these drones.

-Stolen heritage-: GUR presented a database of cultural values ​​stolen by Russia	This is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The event was attended by representatives of the European Commission, UNESCO and 28 partner countries, 19 of which were represented at the level of ministers and deputy ministers of culture. The public database -Stolen Heritage- was created by the joint efforts of the Ministry of Education and Culture of Ukraine, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine, and the expert community. It became operational at the beginning of October 2024 and is available on the War &amp; Sanctions. Currently, the database contains information on 828 objects of cultural heritage stolen by the Russian occupiers and almost 300 individuals and organizations involved. The information is constantly updated and supplemented. -The destruction and appropriation of the cultural heritage of Ukraine is an element of the Russian Federation's large-scale aggression. Russia's goal is to deprive the Ukrainian people of their right to exist by destroying their national memory and identity, appropriating history,- said a representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine during the presentation. The publication of information about cultural values ​​and works of art stolen by Russia is an important tool in the fight against their illegal circulation and the policy of cultural genocide on the part of the aggressor state.

The Commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces Colonel Vadym Suharevsky told about itin an interview with Radio Liberty's -Donbas Realities- project. -As for planning and intelligence - yes, it is there, it is being conducted.

It's effective, and we really know, can and know how to detect different types of systems and hit them accordingly,- he said. According to him, the -Baba Yaga- drone-bomber, infamous for the enemy, hit the Russian -Buk-M3- at a distance of 57 kilometers from the front line. -What's more, he was found literally 40 minutes before his injury. Our -bombers-, the units that use them, show an example of extraordinary efficiency,- added Vadym Sukharevskyi. He noted that in the last two months alone, the Nemesis unit hit more than 15 units of the precious BUK-M3, Thor and other enemy targets. -Just yesterday, our unit effectively hit an enemy tank at a depth of more than 34 kilometers. It's an FPV,- the SBS commander said. He said that the confirmed and possible depth of operation of the Unmanned Systems Forces today is more than 2,000 kilometers. -Accordingly, depending on the tasks, we will develop technologies in the future. My task is to make the state and the army strong, ready for any future war,- Vadym Sukharevskyi emphasized.

-The guys at the gun are counting on me-: the story of the wounding and return to the front of a sol...	The story of the fighter published on the page of the 148th separate artillery brigade of the Airborne Assault troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. On February 23, 2022, he was at the -No Limits- concert, feeling an uneasy feeling. The next morning the war began. The first thing Vadim did was to evacuate his family. Friends and acquaintances who passed the ATO advised not to rush to the military commissariat - -your turn will come.- And it came in the spring of 2023. Vadym was designated as a driver in the artillery brigade of the Airborne Assault Troops at the Military Commissariat. -I've been driving all my life, so this position didn't come as a surprise,- he recalls. But the war quickly taught that the ability to drive is only a small part of the tasks that have to be performed. Every week, Popil and his brothers drive more than a thousand kilometers with ammunition on broken roads and sticky fields. He not only delivers the shells, but also helps move the guns after the battle. Rollover is always a danger, because the enemy has already calculated the position and can strike at any moment. -Sometimes we invest in 15-20 minutes, and sometimes we get stuck for an hour,- he says. Another feature of the job is constant waiting. -We can sit in the landing at midnight with a full body of shells, waiting for the moment when the enemy will give us a window for safe unloading. Sometimes you have to hide and wait for shelling, because you can't retreat - the infantry is counting on us.- Also, a lot in the lives of gunners is weather dependent. -We are constantly monitoring the weather. If, for example, there will be a full moon at 11:00 p.m., we need to do everything before the enemy gets better visibility.- But this is a two-sided game - the Russians work according to the same principle. War does not allow relaxation. -It was even calmer in Zaporozhye. But not now. FPV drones have become our daily threat. Air defense and electronic warfare do not see everything. On the day when an FPV flew into our car, we were already far away from the firing range, we were driving without headlights with a night lamp, and even the command said that there was no threat. But an enemy drone found us and hit the roof.- The impact came between him and the driver. -My left side was injured, his right side. Shrapnel wounds, lacerations, contusions. They helped each other, our pick-up truck picked us up and quickly took us to the headquarters.- Despite the injuries, Vadim returned to his work. -It was difficult. When I was driving on a fire road after treatment, I even had a panic attack. But the fear passes. When it's hard, I think about my relatives and about the guys at the gun - they count on me, and the infantry counts on the artillery. Here, everything is interconnected.- Work without days off. In addition to shells, they carry food and parcels. Constantly optimizing routes to make them faster and safer. And every night before going to sleep, Vadim remembers the day he experienced. -When CABs fly nearby, you are covered with earth and debris, and even the windows of the cars are intact - you understand that God protects us.- For his service, Vadym was awarded the Iron Cross medal. -What does she mean to me? It's more for my baby. Dad's pride.- As reported by ArmyInform, 28-year-old Oleksandr with the call sign -German- is drona-bomber operator 128 separate of the Transcarpathian Mountain Assault Brigade. Before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he worked at a mining and beneficiation plant in Kryvyi Rih.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/hlopczi-bilya-garmaty-rozrahovuyut-na-mene-istoriya-poranennya-ta-povernennya-na-front-bijczya-z-pozyvnym-popil/	2025-02-03T02:43:45-08:00

Instead of the ring, the front: how the kickboxer -Aras- stood up for Ukraine	The story of the fighter was made public on the DPSU page. Denys recalls that the military theme fascinated him since childhood: -In kindergarten, when there were performances, they asked what you want to be when you grow up.

This was reported by the commander of the 429th separate regiment on the -Suspilne.Novyny- broadcast. of unmanned systems -Achilles- Yury Fedorenko. According to Yuriy Fedorenko, having a huge number of personnel, the enemy uses -quite interesting- tactics. People are the cheapest expenditure material for them, so it is constantly thrown forward. -The enemy is constantly trying to conduct combat reconnaissance in order to find us on the front line. And in the case of detection, fire damage begins to be actively carried out in the place where the fire came from. Due to its drones, artillery and many other things. The Defense Forces are used to such tactics,- he said. In addition, in order to accelerate the offensive, from time to time the Russians continue to use armored vehicles.

A saboteur who was preparing a terrorist attack on the railway was detained in the Rivne region	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. However, the attacker did not even have time to install the SVP, because the SBU detained him near the track -in the act of red-handed-. According to the case materials, the agent turned out to be an unemployed 23-year-old resident of Lviv Oblast, who had already been prosecuted for vandalism at the burial sites of Ukrainian soldiers. He came to the attention of the FSB as an ideological supporter of racism and because of his desire to leave for Russia, which he repeatedly wrote on social networks. As the investigation established, the suspect received step-by-step instructions from his Russian curators: to arrive in Rivne region, take the explosives from the cache and install them according to the specified coordinates on the tracks. During the investigation, evidence was obtained of the suspect's performance of another task — he collected information about the locations of the bases of units of the Defense Forces in Lviv Oblast.

How to choose a weapon that will not let you down: tips from a special agent -Den-	This is discussed in the post on the brigade page. According to -Dan-, his favorite assault rifle is the Colt M4. He calls it a -simple, time-tested classic- and notes its reliability, ease of use and -survival-. -More than 50% of its reliability, survivability, etc. depends on the operator himself,- says the fighter. He emphasizes that weapons must be carefully cared for and protected from external influences, especially in an aquatic environment. -Dan- said that working in the water requires the use of sealed bags or summaries that contain quality lubricant, cleaning agents and a special nozzle to prevent dirt from entering the barrel. Regarding the choice of weapons for various tasks, the fighter noted that he takes the M4 both for land and underwater operations. Although, he said, he might occasionally use the 5.56mm M249 SAW light machine gun. -I find the AR-15-based carbine with a barrel up to 12 inches, with a gas tube instead of a piston, to be the most versatile for a wide range of tasks. -In my case, it's an M4 carbine with an 11.7- barrel,- -Dan- said. He also shared his experience with various weapons including the Canadian C8, SCAR, Haenel and Daniel Defense. -My main principle for choosing a weapon is that it should be tested by time and harsh operating conditions, and it should be based on accumulated practical experience of use by other shooters in different situations. I don't want to learn about the -nuances- of the weapon sample already during the task. A banal delay when shooting at one operator can frame the whole group,- the fighter emphasized. According to him, operators can have different rifles in one group, but the whole group can also be equipped with the same rifles in the same configuration. The choice of weapon depends on the task, the time of day, the area of ​​operation, as well as the attachments on the rifle, such as the LCV, optical/collimator sights, thermal imaging attachments/thermal sights, and flip-up magnifiers. As the Army reported, fighters of the 73rd SSO center in Kurshchyna /->hit the enemy's personnel and equipment with all available means.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/yak-obraty-zbroyu-yaka-ne-pidvede-porady-vid-speczpryznachenczya-dena/	2025-02-03T00:29:29-08:00

The old is liquidated, the new is not created: what kind of military justice does Ukraine need. Expe...	After all, can civilian investigators and prosecutors professionally investigate case materials related to the military and military cases, and civilian judges - deliver a fair verdict? Yes, the Verkhovna Rada is currently working on draft laws on the military police and military specialization of judges, which are intended to bring the creation of the military justice system closer. ArmyInform asked a lawyer, a military officer of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Oleksandr Musienko, about the need to create a system of military justice. He states: the issue of the creation and functioning of the military justice system is long overdue. -Unfortunately, judicial and law enforcement reforms that were taking place did not take into account the growth of challenges and those related to Russian aggression, starting from 2014. What's more: the existing system of military justice - the courts and the prosecutor's office - were effectively liquidated, and no fully functioning institutions were created in their place. During this time, the defense and security sector was only growing. Accordingly, a lot of issues arose that required legal settlement, as well as correct interpretation and assessment of the actions of military commanders and military personnel. There were also signs of the problem of considering criminal proceedings related to military service and repelling Russian aggression. It even caused indignation in society and questions in the military sphere,- says Oleksandr Musienko. According to him, the questions that most often arose and still arise in this context: can law enforcement agencies or courts that do not have specialized knowledge in the military field properly evaluate the actions of a military commander, taking into account all the specifics of conducting hostilities. -The other side of the issue is that the military could be indignant over the fact that they can be evaluated by people who have not received appropriate training or have professional experience related to the military,- says Oleksandr Musienko. He emphasizes that he studied the experience of the existing systems of NATO countries, partners of Ukraine. -Full-fledged military justice systems exist in the USA, Canada, Great Britain (with their own peculiarities). France even has a separate code for the military, the Code of Military Justice. These countries introduced a system of military justice also because their armies had the experience of participating in hostilities. This made it possible to make sure that this is the best way to settle legal issues that arise in the course of hostilities, as well as bringing servicemen to justice,- the interlocutor comments. The system of military justice (with its own peculiarities - ed.) also exists in Israel. -For example, in addition to the relevant legislation and the regulation of the activities of the military, there is also an institute of military legal advisers, who help the command to make decisions, observing the norms of international humanitarian law, the need to act in accordance with the internal legislation of Israel,- says Oleksandr Musienko. According to different estimates, he says, more than a million people are involved in the defense and security sector in Ukraine today. -Active hostilities continue, many questions arise regarding the interpretation of the norms of military legislation and their correct application. The law enforcement function can also be singled out as a separate item. Military specifics require specialists to have professional experience and knowledge in this particular field. In order to fully assess the actions of a fighter during hostilities, knowledge and experience are necessary. This is definitely capable of improving the application of legislation, maintaining law and order in the Defense and Security Forces, reducing the burden on the law enforcement system and the court, which have to conduct investigations and consider many other categories of cases,- the interlocutor emphasizes. He emphasizes again: -The creation of a full-fledged system of military justice is more than justified. Moreover, it is necessary to have a closed cycle in this area. That is: the military police, the prosecutor's office and the courts. If not the creation of military courts, then at least the introduction of specializations for judges who consider the relevant categories of cases. These specializations should include training courses, training and consideration of exclusively categories of cases in the military sphere. Therefore, passing the necessary laws is very important.- Oleksandr Musienko adds that the creation of a military justice system will solve the issue of better enforcement of the relevant norms of current legislation, as well as military law. -In addition, the question of the fairness of consideration of certain high-profile cases will be removed, or at least minimized. The best experience of our partners will also be taken into account,- the lawyer and military officer summarized. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/stare-likvidovane-nove-ne-stvorene-yaka-vijskova-yustycziya-potribna-ukrayini-ekspert-pro-svitovyj-dosvid/	2025-02-02T20:57:18-08:00
An island with hypersonic ambitions: Taiwan has developed a rocket that travels more than 2,000 kilo...	As reported by reporters of the local publication Liberty Times, the ammunition -Qingtian- is a development of engineers of the Academy of Sciences of this partially recognized island state, ArmyInform reports. In turn, experts from the Dutch defense portal Army Recognition, who studied this project, noted that the newest missile is based on programs Yunfeng and Yungeng II, originally designed for a range of 1,200 to 2,000 kilometers. The hypersonic complex was named Qingtian (-Qingtian-) - literally -Blue Field- in translation. It is interesting that one of the counties of the Chinese province of Zhejiang, located on the coast of the East China Sea, has the same name. Perhaps the creators of the project wanted to hint at the combat capabilities of the missile and its range. -Qingtian represents advances in propulsion, navigation and guidance technologies, increasing range, speed and operational flexibility. Mass production of the Qingtian began in late 2024, with initial units already delivered to the Taiwan Air Force's missile brigades,- Army Recognition said. The National Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) led the development of Qingtian. Thanks to the use of composite ceramic materials, the rocket can withstand extreme conditions associated with speeds in excess of Mach 6. These characteristics allow it to avoid air defense systems and expand its operational application. According to published data, the Qingtian missile complex is the result of further development of the existing systems of the Yunfeng series. Already developed solutions and ideas were used within the framework of the new project, and new components and technologies were also introduced. Thanks to this, it was possible to maintain continuity, as well as to obtain a significant increase in the main tactical and technical characteristics. The main element of the -Qingtian- complex is the missile of the same name. Its exact appearance and parameters, for obvious reasons, still remain unknown. However, some data are available that allow us to make estimates and assumptions. The Qingtian is a land-based missile designed for use on a variety of launchers. In flight, the product develops a speed of at least 6 M, which allows it to be classified as hypersonic. The flight range reaches 2000 km. For comparison, missiles of the Yunfen series have a speed of no more than 4-5 M and a range of about 1-1.2 thousand. km According to the available data, the Taiwanese missile is similar to some foreign developments in its technical appearance. She received a fuselage of a characteristic shape with a pointed nose and a special air intake. There are probably planes to create lift in horizontal flight. The glider of the product is manufactured using alloys and other materials resistant to high mechanical and thermal loads. -Liberty Times- reports that, for this purpose, CSIST and related organizations have conducted several additional research works. The dimensions and mass of the rocket remain unknown. At the same time, some features of the compatible launcher are reported. Based on these data, it can be assumed that the length of the missile reaches 10-12 m. The mass is not less than several tons. Qingtian will be deployed on both fixed launch systems and mobile platforms, increasing survivability against potential pre-emptive strikes. The Czech-made Tatra Force 12X12 trucks were chosen for their off-road ability, adaptability to mountainous terrain and maneuverability. If Czech purchases face difficulties, the American Oshkosh M983 is an alternative platform. The adoption of mobile launchers marks a departure from previous trailer-mounted systems in line with modern military trends favoring autonomous launchers. The Qingtian program builds on decades of work on Taiwan's long-range strike capabilities, originating from the Yunfeng program. Despite challenges such as technical issues with guidance systems and international restrictions under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the program has made significant progress since key restrictions were eased in 2023. This mitigation, facilitated by agreements with the United States, gave Taiwan access to critical precision targeting and movement components, increasing the Qingtian's accuracy and range. Taiwan's defense initiatives also include the domestic production of submarines and research into advanced propulsion technologies such as the Hypersonic Jet Propulsion Engine for future hypersonic applications. These efforts diversify Taiwan's missile inventory and meet a variety of tactical and strategic requirements. Taiwan's missile advances have come in response to China's increasing military pressure. According to the US Department of Defense, the People's Liberation Army Missile Force (PLARF) currently has more than 3,000 ballistic missiles, including 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), such as the DF-5, DF-31, and DF-41, which have a range exceeds 12,000 kilometers. The PLARF also operates 900 short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), 1,300 medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), 500 intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) and 400 ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs). These systems include dual-purpose missiles such as the DF-26, DF-17 equipped with a hypersonic cruise warhead, and the CJ-100 with a range of 3,000 to 4,000 kilometers. The Qingtian missile, with a range of about 2,000 kilometers, can target strategic targets in mainland China. Expert reports show that its reach extends to areas north of Beijing, including Hohhot in Inner Mongolia. This range covers important political and military centers, including Beijing and other urban and industrial centers. The Qingtian deployment gives Taiwan the ability to deal with critical areas in northern China, strengthening its overall defense strategy. Hypersonic missiles, including the Qingtian, challenge existing defense systems due to their speed, maneuverability and low-altitude flight path. When able to be in flight at a speed of more than Mach 5, they reduce the reaction time to interception. Unlike ballistic missiles, which follow predictable trajectories, hypersonic systems perform evasive maneuvers, making detection and tracking more difficult. Their low-altitude profiles further evade radar detection, requiring advanced interception technologies to counter their threat. It should be recalled that Ukraine will continue to adhere to the principle of one China in the issue of Taiwan. This was once again emphasized by the Ukrainian side during personal meetings. > the leadership of the foreign policy departments of our state and the People's Republic of China in July 2024. Taiwan strengthens defenses with hypersonic missiles.

Training of paratroopers at the BZVP: the instructor of the DSHV talked about the peculiarities of t...	Six o'clock in the morning. Getting up, charging, after breakfast, the mobilized go to training sessions. Lunch break, classes again. And until the very evening. This is how basic military training goes 24/7, 45 days. -Smoke, fire, shots, sounds from shell explosions. So that it does not happen all around, the paratrooper must be focused and steadfast. Keep the combat mission in your head that needs to be accomplished,- the tactics lesson goes. Platoon commander Rostislav talks about the peculiarities of the combat situation on the front line. — Enemy drones are a threat from the air. You need to constantly watch the sky. The adversary is now massively using FPV drones with drops, he continues. Cadets are divided into small groups of 15-20 people. While some are learning tactics, others are mastering mine and explosive business. Another group moves to the trenches for practical actions - repelling the enemy's offensive. Rostislav is 25 years old. He is from the Dnipropetrovsk region, graduated from the National University of Civil Defense of Ukraine in Kharkiv. Worked in a mine. From 2021 in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. His story is unique. With training at a military department and an officer's rank behind him, he enlisted as an ordinary soldier. Didn't say anything about his -military- experience. He says: he wanted to experience on his own skin what it was like to go from a simple soldier to an officer. Joined the ranks of the 25th separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade. He was trained at the same Training Center. I went to Avdiivka, to the area of ​​combat missions, as a simple marksman-sniper of the reconnaissance company. This was exactly half a year before the large-scale invasion. Then he carried out combat missions in Verkhnyotoretsk and Soledar. They offered to become an instructor to train future paratroopers. Already here in Zhytomyr, they were given the rank of officer. -Everything is real. First of all, it depends on the desire of the mobilized servicemen themselves. From their motivation to defend Ukraine and readiness to destroy enemies. Here at the Training Center, the instructors will go out of their way to train the cadets to perform extremely difficult combat missions and kill the Rashists. Moreover, the duration of BZVP should be increased now. 45 days is of course much better than one month. We start the preparation with certain basics. First of all, this is fire training: the boys master the Kalashnikov assault rifle, AGS, RPG, as well as RPK, DShK and Browning M2 machine guns. We put a lot of emphasis on classes in tactical medicine, engineering training and tactics. These are the four aspects that are most important in education today. We use tactics every day. Cadets master the tactics of actions in the composition of departments in defense and offense. This is movement, deployment in battle order, rush from equipment and passes in all the main ways. Analyzing the experience of combat operations with the enemy, especially in the context of the use on the front of small assault groups, recruits learn actions during a confrontation with the enemy. They fire at short distances, practice trench clearing. They are opposed by other groups of military personnel, as they imitate the Rashists. Then we change the scenario, those who were defending are already advancing. The deeper a soldier digs into the ground and properly arranges the dugout, the more likely he is to survive during shelling. We have been teaching this simple truth of engineering training to cadets since the first days of BZVP. In battle, situations sometimes occur that our guys are saved not by a machine gun, but by a shovel. Anti-aircraft missiles, drops from drones, fire from tanks, mortars and other artillery: this is what the enemy uses to attack our positions. And it is logical that shelters should be properly arranged and deep holes should be dug. This will save the lives of paratroopers. We teach the mobilized to set up firing points, trenches and strongholds. Plus topography and communication. The ability to communicate correctly and in a timely manner at the front line. Using our own examples, we tell the boys that they should prepare for the most difficult. The men who come to us for the BZVP often do not understand what is being asked of them here, they do not have the motivation to defend the country. Many say something like: -We are simple people, we worked in -peaceful- professions and were not born for war at all.- What we do right away: sit down and talk to every recruit. We determine his psychotype, whether he volunteered himself or was served with a summons. We convey to them the importance of protecting Ukraine from the aggressor, we say that it is necessary to change those guys who have been at the front since the first days of the invasion. That the state needs them. I, as well as other instructors of the center, were not born for war, we did not have automatic weapons in our hands when we appeared in this world. I prove the information using my own example. At the age of 25, for some reason I am here in the army, protecting the Ukrainian people from the enemy. So are other military personnel fighting at the front. They protect your homes so that your children go to school and do not feel the effects of war. So, many people have to explain on their fingers. The situation on the battlefield is dynamically changing. Now any movement on the front line, approaches to it, as well as in the depth of battle formations is almost impossible to hide. The enemy's massive use of reconnaissance UAVs and FPV drones is a frontline problem. And the meeting of our fighters on the battlefield with enemy drones is inevitable. We teach cadets to counter enemy drones, how to camouflage positions so that they cannot be detected from the air. Always watch the sky. Everyone should be able to identify the operation of a drone by ear and distinguish its type, constantly move and be able to hide from it. Because if the enemy has visually noticed you, he will not let you rest. If the drone has already -burned- you and you hear the sounds of the propeller, you should not just stand still and fall into a -stupor-. It is necessary to inform fellow citizens about the danger by voice and to run to shelter. The enemy pilot does not hear you, but only sees the picture in front of him, that is, the target. Therefore, it is important to react in time. You can try to knock down the -fpvishka- with automatic turns, but from a safe distance from it. It is more realistic to hit a drone-bomber with a machine gun. It is larger than FPV and not as fast. Of course, we are learning to use electronic devices. It is necessary to be able to suppress the work of FPV drones and other UAVs of the enemy. The psychological obstacle course for paratroopers is always exhausting and difficult, but extremely effective. All recruits go through this lane, it is, so to speak, the culmination of the BZVP at the Training Center. Here the emphasis is on cohesion and brotherhood. Cadets must understand that they are one mechanism and each of them is a certain part in it. If one drops out, it becomes more difficult for the others to work. It is very difficult to cross the psychological barrier physically. The length of the obstacle course is 350 meters, on it there are ten elements that the cadets must overcome. But when the boys pass it, they already feel like -rexes-. And it becomes easier for them both morally and physically. I do not understand at all why everyone thinks that somehow this war will not affect them or will simply bypass them. We are at war with the Russians, there are a lot of them. Russia presses and advances every day. The enemy simply will not stop on its own, it must be stopped and destroyed by the Defense Forces of Ukraine. We also suffer losses, our defenders need to be changed, units need to be strengthened. I do not understand why many people, relatively speaking, at breakfast, over a cup of coffee, open YouTube and watch some, sorry, -nonsense-, some pacifist bloggers and so on. On the contrary, it is necessary to prepare oneself for the defense of the Motherland. There are many video courses on tactical medicine, see how to apply a tourniquet. There are a lot of videos on the basics of handling weapons: how to disassemble a machine gun, its characteristics. Go to the shooting range, learn to shoot there. You don't need to sit at the computer, -play dances-. Study, it will be much easier for you and us when you are drafted into the army. In almost three years of the great war, thanks to YouTube alone, it was already possible to become at least a soldier of the first year of service. Having learned all that is needed to survive the war. What can I say to men sitting at home on sofas. Such men should eventually understand that they are not just -egg carriers-, but defenders of their homes and families, their country. Don't whine about life, finally be real men. Come here and show what the Airborne Assault Forces are capable of. We will prepare you qualitatively and then we will beat Russia. Currently, there are many recruiting centers in Ukraine, you can choose a profession yourself. There is even an opportunity, without the participation of the TCC, to mobilize in the military unit you want.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/prokachka-desantnykiv-na-bzvp-instruktor-dshv-rozpoviv-pro-osoblyvosti-pidgotovky/	2025-02-02T20:23:39-08:00
A fake on a chain: the Russians - tie up - the Ukrainian military before the battle	Well, judging by the level of creativity, Russian propagandists have obviously overheated under Skabeeva's lamps. Because even for traditional Russian lies it is too much. The information dump appeared in a format typical for Russians: low-quality photos or videos of dubious origin, signed in the style -that's how Ukrainian commanders lead soldiers to the slaughter.- To enhance the effect, anonymous -eyewitnesses- or -prisoners- are also added, who say that no one in the Armed Forces wants to fight, and therefore the soldiers are literally -convoyed- to the front in handcuffs. In the best traditions of Russian propaganda, the -evidence base- of this fake looks like a set of pixels on the screen of a push-button phone. The video is blurred, the voices are distorted, and the face is unknown. But, of course, this is quite enough for the Russian consumer, who has not checked any information for a long time. Now let's open a curtain of reality. In the Ukrainian army, in contrast to the army of the aggressor country, people fight not because they are -driven-, but because they are defending their country. Yes, war is difficult, it is pain and loss. But Ukrainians go to battle because they are fighting for their land, not for the imperial ambitions of the Kremlin elder. In addition, if we talk about handcuffs and the fear of our own soldiers, it is in the Russian army that there have long been stories about zagradzagons and -Kadyrov overseers- who do not allow their own soldiers to retreat. There, -mobs- are thrown into a meat grinder without preparation, and those who refuse can simply be shot. But it is, of course, not for Russian news. This fake is another attempt to demoralize Ukrainians and fuel the myth of the -collapse of the Armed Forces.- They need anything to show that the Ukrainian military allegedly does not want to fight. But the problem is that the desired does not become a reality just from propagandists' fantasies. What's next? Maybe next time they will tell that Ukrainian pilots are tied to the cockpits of fighter jets, and gunners are chained to the guns so they don't escape? The Russians lie - it's not news. But every time their fictions become more and more pathetic. And this only confirms that in reality they have nothing to brag about. So while they are sculpting new horror stories, the Ukrainian military continues to do its job - smashing the occupiers. Without handcuffs, but with great motivation. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/fejk-na-lanczyugu-rosiyany-povyazuyut-ukrayinskyh-vijskovyh-pered-boyem/	2025-02-02T20:03:08-08:00

He said this in his evening address. -Anti-aircraft defense and a sufficient number of anti-missiles are a necessary condition for bringing peace. I am grateful to all partners who help us with this and who have a complete vision of what we need,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The head of state recalled that this week Ukraine received new support packages from na-12-mlrd/->Sweden, Finland and Croatia. -Thank you! We are working to ensure that next week there will be such necessary decisions for Ukraine - decisions regarding the support of our state, our people, and our army. -Patriots-, -Iris-T-, all types of necessary air defense, the development of drones and investments in the production of weapons here in Ukraine - this is the protection of the lives of our people, this is the protection of the very idea that peace is possible,- said the President. As reported by ArmyInform, during January 2025, the air defense of Ukraine shot down more than 2,300 means of the enemy's air attack. During January 2025, the defense forces of Ukraine carried out two dozen strikes on military and industrial facilities on the territory of the Russian Federation, which are involved in a large-scale war against Ukraine.

The heating system and entrance doors in the apartments were dismantled first. Residents of this building began to ask about the deadlines for the completion of repairs. According to promises, the work is scheduled to be completed only in the second half of 2026, which is causing outrage among local residents due to the excessive delay. As ArmiyaInform reported, the so-called -LNR government- recognized the catastrophic state of housing and communal infrastructure in the temporarily occupied part of Luhansk region. According to their estimates, the average level of wear and tear of critical objects reaches 80%.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/dokumenty-v-obmin-na-dopomogu-u-lnr-z-bagatoditnyh-simej-vymagayut-rosijski-pasporty/	2025-02-02T10:42:03-08:00

A pro-Russian spy who was studying the movement of Ukrainian ships was detained in Odessa	According to information of the SBU, the agent collected intelligence on the bases and routes of warships of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Odesa seaport According to the investigation, the collected information was to be used by the Russians to prepare combat operations in the maritime zone, including the launch of cruise missiles and kamikaze drones. In addition, the agent was tasked with identifying the fire positions of the Ukrainian air defense in order to bypass the defense of the Ukrainian military.

Beating and blowing up beds: the occupiers mock forcibly mobilized Ukrainians	About this informs GUR Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. According to the information of the -I want to live- project, last fall, thirty people illegally mobilized by Russia from the occupied districts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions got into one of the military units on the territory of the occupied Crimea. The Russians appointed as sergeants for them natives from the Caucasus, who incite inter-ethnic enmity, systematically arrange beatings of illegally mobilized people from the occupied Ukrainian territories, detonate training grenades in the barracks, create unbearable living conditions, and force them to observe the performance of prayers. In addition to systematic humiliation from the Caucasian -commanders-, the illegally mobilized also complain of terrible and insufficient food. As a reminder, in the period from October 31 until December 31, 2024, the aggressor state of Russia forcibly mobilized about three hundred people in the occupied territories of the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions. Illegal conscription in the occupied territories is another Russian war crime. -Everyone who has become a victim of forced mobilization has a chance to leave the occupying army and not participate in Russia's criminal war against Ukraine thanks to the I Want to Live project,- the department emphasizes. As reported by ArmiyaInform, Russian commanders en masse ->transfer their mobilized military, who refuse to voluntarily sign a contract with the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, to the so-called -meat- units.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/pobyttya-ta-pidryv-lizhok-okupanty-znushhayutsya-z-prymusovo-mobilizovanyh-ukrayincziv/	2025-02-02T06:12:46-08:00
Air Force of the Ukrainian Armed Forces: -Orlan- did not fly over Odesa, did not correct the -Iskand...	This is stated in messages of the Southern Air Command. As you know, between 19:15 and 20:05 on January 31, 2025, the Russians hit with three ballistic missiles -Iskander-M- according to predetermined coordinates. The strike was aimed at the historic center of Odessa. Information immediately appeared in the public space, as if the Russian Orlan-10 drone was correcting a -ballistic- strike directly over the city, and this strike could have been avoided by destroying the UAV. -We officially deny it! However, in order to prevent the further spread of unverified information, the -Southern- air command appeals to bloggers, volunteers, opinion leaders and media persons to comment more carefully on this topic. We thank you in advance for your understanding and are ready to communicate on similar issues,- the statement reads. Regarding the Russian reconnaissance UAV and countermeasures, PvK -Pivden- reported the following: on January 31, 2025, Odesa and the entire south of Ukraine was in the zone of continuous low cloudiness. The lower limit of clouds is 90 m, the upper limit is 3600 m. The reconnaissance UAV -Orlan-10- was indeed fixed, but not over Odesa, but in the waters of the Black Sea at a distance of 25-30 km from the coastline. Today, no correction by a drone is required for launching missile strikes against fixed enemy targets. -Orlan-10- at this time is usually used for the purpose of video recording the results of Russian terrorist actions, as well as for determining the areas of the -exits- of our air defense missiles. -On January 31, the enemy UAV was detected early! It was seen by radar operators during the entire flight (see the diagram), up to the place of destruction - when it became possible (due to the small radius of use of anti-aircraft FPV drones). -Orlan- was struck by the calculation of FPV drone interceptors in the Koblevo area,- the statement said. It is reported that in 2024 units of the Southern Air Command detected and destroyed 106 Orlan-10 reconnaissance UAVs, 75 of them within the Odesa region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/povitryani-syly-zsu-orlan-nad-odesoyu-ne-litav-udar-iskanderiv-ne-koreguvav/	2025-02-02T06:02:34-08:00
How to generate an electronic referral to the VLK in Reserve+: explanation of the Ministry of Defens...	The Ministry of Defense answered key questions about the new feature. What has changed for a conscript? Previously, a conscript could only receive a referral to the VLK in paper form. For this, he had to visit his TCC and JV. Now a person who wants to undergo an examination for fitness for military service can get a referral to the VLK online. To do this, it is enough to log in to the Reserve+ application and submit a request in a few clicks. So the referral to Reserve+ will be immediately to the medical facility? That's right. After submitting a request to Rezerv+, a person receives a notification within a day, which contains all the necessary details: the number and date of registration of the referral, the address of the health care institution for undergoing VLC, the head of which TCC signed the referral. This notification is sufficient to schedule an inspection. Who can receive an electronic referral to the VLK? The Reserv+ service can now be used by conscripts who themselves want to undergo an examination for fitness for military service. That is, they have not yet received a summons to pass the VLK. Received a summons to the VLK. Is it necessary to come to the TCC? Currently, yes. Soon we will also add the possibility of electronic referral, if a person has already received a paper summons to pass the VLC. Is it necessary to go to the TCC after the VLK to update the military registration document? There is no need for this. The Military Medical Commission itself will send the data to the TCC. An employee of the TCC will enter the information into the Reserve register — and the user will receive an updated military registration document in Reserve+. What will happen if you generate an electronic referral and do not come to the VLK? If the conscript himself wants to undergo a fitness test and does not appear, the notification in Reserve+ remains valid for 30 days. After that, the request must be submitted again - and the application will receive a notification with the same or updated information. Will the summonses for passing the VLK also be electronic? No, the summonses will remain paper. They will still be delivered by physical mail. In Reserve+, the TCC cannot independently initiate requests for the passing of the VLK, as well as any other subpoenas. Such a concept as an electronic subpoena does not exist in the legislation. The service of electronic referral to VLK is voluntary. It can only be initiated by the Reserve+ user. Will all referrals be digital now? No, the paper alternative remains. If desired - for example, if it is not possible to use a smartphone - a conscript can continue to receive a paper referral to the TCC, as before. How often do you need to undergo a medical examination? The decision of the Medical Examination on the suitability of a conscript for military service is valid for one year from the date of the end of the medical examination. Therefore, conscripts must update their medical information every year. Should I go through VLC if there is a reservation? If a person has a reservation or deferment, they should not be referred to VLC. The exception is people with the status of -limited suitability- - all of them must undergo a re-examination of the VLC within the terms specified by law. So, a person with the status of -limited suitability- can receive a summons to pass the VLK - and in this case must appear at the TCC, even if he has a reservation or a postponement.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/yak-v-rezerv-zgeneruvaty-elektronne-napravlennya-na-vlk-roz%ca%bcyasnennya-minoborony/	2025-02-02T05:44:17-08:00

According to the investigation, at the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the woman moved to the Vinnytsia region, where she obtained resettled status. While there, she began to cooperate with the FSB. To obtain intelligence, the woman used her nephew, who previously served under a contract in the Armed Forces, but deserted and hid in Toretsk. During telephone conversations, she asked him for information about the positions of the Ukrainian military and the consequences of Russian shelling. She transmitted the received data to the Russian curators via messenger, and after each communication session she deleted the correspondence.

Therefore, now the enemy does not do this, sometimes uses light automobile equipment,- Nadiya Zamryga recounted. The servicewoman also said that the Russians use ATVs or cars for assaults in order to be less visible - but our soldiers still destroy them. A change in the tactics of the Russians in the Kupyan direction has not yet been observed. -These are also small groups of infantry that try to move towards the positions of the Armed Forces during the day and at night,- says Nadiya Zamryga. At the same time, the enemy is pulling up reserves in manpower, but this is due to significant losses in manpower and the enemy. As ArmyInform wrote, the other day the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the Kupyan direction managed to stop promotion enemy in the area of ​​Kolesnikivka and to significantly stop the advance in the direction of Zagryzovo.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/yidut-na-vsomu-shho-ruhayetsya-u-zsu-rozpovily-pro-speczyfiku-rosijskyh-atak-na-kupyanskomu-napryamku/	2025-02-02T04:12:18-08:00

He told about this on the broadcast of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- on February 2. . -There is no place to strengthen for quite a long time. A few weeks ago, there was a rumor that the Russians had tightened the pass regime; that the so-called -Rosguard- is raging. They have a separate unit related to marine infrastructure that conducts appropriate inspections. It has happened before. And repeatedly. And even last summer, illegal tourists complained that it was harder to cross bridges than the state border. Of course, they take extreme measures to preserve this object. The reasons are well known to all of us, and the main one has a purely political symbolic component,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. He also emphasized that the Crimean bridge is an important component (so far) of the logistics chain of the Russian army. As ArmiyaInform wrote, at the beginning of January 2025 it became known that, as a result of a recent storm, the protective barriers that the Russian occupiers placed around the illegally built Kerch bridge scattered across the strait.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/dmytro-pletenchuk-prokomentuvav-zakydy-rosijskyh-media-pro-posylennya-ohorony-kerchenskogo-mostu/	2025-02-02T03:51:10-08:00
Sent to storm on crutches: the occupiers demonstrate the latest development on the battlefield	A military serviceman told about this in air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- on February 2 Viktor Petrovych of the 77th separate aeromobile brigade of the DSH. -They must forcefully stimulate the personnel to go into battle, because, as the scouts wrote to me, the enemy used the newest development against us - an infantryman on crutches. It is obvious that an infantryman on crutches would not have gone on the attack if he had not been shot in the back with a barrel. They physically affect their personnel,- Viktor Petrovych said. The host asked whether our military actually had the chance to see with their own eyes the Russians who, relatively speaking, stormed with casts or other traumas and injuries, to which the paratrooper replied: -Yes, they have already seen it in battle. It is quite difficult to believe that such a thing can happen until you see it with your own eyes from a drone. Yes, this is information from our scouts: enemy servicemen on crutches were going to attack,- explained the speaker. As it became known, units of the 77th separate aeromobile brigade of the Russian Air Force are currently performing tasks in the Borova region of the Kharkiv region. As ArmyInform wrote, a few days ago, according to the observations of our military, to the mass grave of Russians in the pipe near Chasovoy Yar, delivered -attack crutches-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/vidpravyly-shturmuvaty-na-mylyczyah-okupanty-demonstruyut-novitnyu-rozrobku-na-poli-boyu/	2025-02-02T03:35:58-08:00

He said this in an interview with the German publication Bild. -The front is moving in the wrong direction. But at what cost? lose 1,000 to 1,500 people a day who are killed or seriously injured. And yet the Russians do not achieve their goals. And our task is to make sure that they never achieve their goals. Therefore, no: Ukraine will not lose. And we have to support her in becoming stronger,- Mark Rutte said. He added that against the background of talks about possible negotiations, it is necessary to make sure that Ukraine is in the best position. -We must continue to support them with weapons and train their soldiers. And if they want to one day have peace talks, they have to put Putin at the negotiating table. But I cannot describe to you exactly how these negotiations will take place. I already have an idea of ​​how this composition might look. But we don't want to make Putin smarter than he is now. We keep it a little secret. Only the end is certain: after this, Putin will never try again,- Mark Rutte is convinced. At the same time, he warned against naive beliefs that Putin will easily go to negotiations and fulfill all agreements. -Just look at what happened in Bucha. Therefore, if a peace agreement is reached, it must be sustainable. We must ensure that he can never, ever again conquer even one square kilometer of Ukraine,- Mark Rutte said. As ArmiyaInform reported, on January 29, a meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council at the level of ambassadors was held at the NATO headquarters with the participation of the Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, the Minister of Justice of Ukraine Olga Stefanyshyn. Key topics of the meeting were the security situation in Ukraine, the implementation of the decisions of the Washington NATO Summit and the progress of Ukraine in the implementation of reforms, in particular within the framework of the adapted Annual National Program.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/gensek-nato-rosijska-armiya-vtrachaye-1000-1500-lyudej-na-den-i-ne-dosyagaye-czilej/	2025-02-02T03:18:03-08:00
The Navy of the Ukrainian Armed Forces explained why the Russians did not use Caliber during the las...	During the last missile attack, the Russians did not use the Kalibr cruise missile launchers, there may be several options for such actions by the Russians. This opinion was expressed by a spokesperson on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- on February 2 Dmytro Pletenchuk of the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. -During the last missile attack, the Russians did not use cruise missile launchers. And it's actually surprising, because they usually involve them too,- Dmytro Pletenchuk said. When asked by the presenter why the Russians do this, Pletenchuk replied that there is no verified information. -The reasons can be different, we can assume several different options. But none of them are confirmed&#8230; It may be their own problems or non-applicability decisions. They understand very well that the effectiveness of these missiles comes down to the fact that they are a distraction: rather harsh, expensive, dangerous, but still a distraction. And given the poor performance, they decided to save them for some other situation. There can be many options. Maybe this time they decided that the attack would not be so massive. It is difficult to say now, it will probably become clear later,- the speaker noted. As ArmiyaInform wrote, in January this year the Navy of the Armed Forces -mi-8/->recorded a decrease in the use of Russian military aircraft over the Black Sea after the loss of two Mi-8 helicopters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/u-vms-zsu-poyasnyly-chomu-rosiyany-pid-chas-ostannoyi-raketnoyi-ataky-ne-zastosovuvaly-kalibry/	2025-02-02T03:07:05-08:00
The murder of a TCC employee: propaganda uses crime to disrupt mobilization and divide society	A man in a balaclava and pixel pants, armed with a hunting rifle, approached one of the TCC servicemen and demanded to give him the weapon. After receiving a refusal, the attacker fired from a distance of 2-3 meters. The intruder took the military weapon from the wounded man and disappeared in an unknown direction together with one of the newly recruited servicemen who was on his way to the training center as part of the team. The deceased serviceman of the territorial procurement center is survived by his wife, children, and parents.- Such a text could be seen yesterday on the official pages in the social networks of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Poltava Regional Territorial Center for Manpower and Social Support, in the mass media, social networks, various Teltgram channels. The committed serious crime is murder. Moreover, the killing of a serviceman while performing his official task of escorting mobilized citizens of Ukraine to the training center. Killing in a crowded place with the threat of civilian casualties. During the investigation of this crime, different versions may be considered. The investigation will establish all motives and reasons. However, today this crime can already be considered as a continuation of the Russian information campaign aimed at disrupting measures to equip the Defense Forces of Ukraine and, even more, to transfer, for Ukrainian society, the emphasis on the need to strengthen measures to repel Russian armed aggression (the number of victims of which, in particular in relation to the civilian population, increases daily) to the confrontation of conscripted citizens of Ukraine with representatives of the territorial centers of recruitment and social support, the National Police of Ukraine, by other persons designated for carrying out mobilization activities. Numerous -bloggers-, lawyers, -indifferent citizens- are heating up the topic of this confrontation every day. It is significant that the most odious of them, the topic of the armed aggression unleashed by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the war crimes of the occupiers against the civilian population, the victims of this aggression, are simply absent from their posts. There are only -TCC- in the role of thieves and -fighters against the system- who deliberately evade their duty to protect their country from the enemy. They correspond to the narratives used in Russian propaganda and Russian information operations against Ukraine. The result of such information operations for the enemy should be a forceful confrontation between -evaders- and -tskshniks-, which can easily be turned into a civil war of the civilian population, which -does not want to fight for Zelenskyi, for the deputies, for ... (you can put anything in place of the three dots)- and the military, each of whom can easily be called a -tskshnish- in such a confrontation. -I saw a car with military license plates - they were sleeping or detonated with explosives-, -there is no war-, -children of deputies do not fight-, -TCCs are illegal-, -let someone go to fight first, and then we-... All these theses were written by the enemy. Because of them, the prerequisites for civil confrontation are created, which is a necessary condition for the enemy to occupy all of Ukraine. The practical implementation of such activities of the enemy is quite simple to understand, although it requires regular measures to demonize mobilization and the structures that directly carry it out, to intimidate our conscripted citizens, to discredit state power and military leadership. Even in relation to yesterday's crime: a military serviceman killed by a criminal is survived by his wife, children, parents, and in the comments under the official messages you can see the following: Among such commentators there are obvious bots (no posts, history, characteristic attributes and activity on their own pages at all), so are real citizens of Ukraine (perhaps those who pretend to be real): The quite large number of reactions to their comments is indicative (this can also be artificial reception), which is designed to demonstrate public support for their messages. Simultaneously with the appearance of such comments under official posts, corresponding posts appeared in Russian propaganda telegram channels and, even, a report about this crime in the Russian international media Russia Today, which, unfortunately, is still presented in various countries of the world: Characteristically , that the enemy identifies the criminal who killed our serviceman as -Robin Hood-. The same -Robin Hoods- merged the positions of our troops, aimed (and continue to aim) Russian missiles at our cities and villages, in the temporarily occupied territories, together with the Russian occupiers, torture and kill our civilians. For the enemy, they are really very useful. What do we all need to do? First, to clearly form a relationship to the committed crime. This is not a confrontation with the TCC. This is the killing of a serviceman of the Armed Forces while performing his official duties and, even more, a combat mission. That is, the responsibility of the criminal should lie in the area of ​​crimes against the national security of Ukraine and terrorism. With the maximum possible punishment. Secondly, in no case should we forget who our enemy is and who kills Ukrainians every day. If employees of the TCC exceed their official authority, notify the hotline of the Ministry of Defense, the Ground Forces Command, report it to law enforcement agencies, use all possible tools to protect your rights. Together with the warning of the representatives of the warning groups themselves about the need to observe the law and the fact that the enemy is provoking a confrontation and it is not necessary to help him in this. Third, determine the attitude towards -useful idiots- and -enemy agents-, both overt and covert. If there is no Russian armed aggression for them, it is evil, no defenders and no friends. They do not intend to help you in anything, just as the aggressor does not intend to make your life easier. Evil must be punished, if only informationally - by ignoring their materials, or, if it is impossible to refrain, expressing one's attitude towards the enemy. When Kyiv did not surrender in -three days-, and all of Ukraine - in -several weeks-, at that time, our only strength was unity and a common position. One can have different attitudes towards certain politicians, statesmen, military leaders, but a united, common, independent and sovereign Ukraine is a reality and a future for us and our children. And no Russian IPSO with all their manuals and -Kremlin-tinged Robin Hoods- should divide us.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/vbyvstvo-praczivnyka-tczk-rospropaganda-vykorystovuye-zlochyn-dlya-zryvu-mobilizacziyi-ta-rozkolu-suspilstva/	2025-02-02T02:49:24-08:00

These observations were shared by -Societal News- on Sunday, 2 February, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, Viktor Tregubov. -Armored vehicles are used by the Russians in a limited way&#8230; She became, in fact, vulnerable.

The department emphasized that bombing the civilian population is a trademark of Russian criminals. Even when the civilians are local Russians. -Already traditionally, numerous Russian publics blame Ukraine for the attack. It will not work! There is indisputable evidence and the results of objective control that the strike was carried out by Russian tactical aircraft,- the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine emphasized. In particular, the department released screenshots from the Viraj-tablet system with the flight path of the Russian guided aerial bomb. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukrainian soldiers disassemble collapse of boarding school in Suja: 84 people were saved.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/povitryani-syly-zsu-oprylyudnyly-dani-shho-sprostovuyut-rosijsku-dezinformacziyu-pro-udar-po-sudzhi/	2025-02-01T21:32:05-08:00

The total combat losses of the enemy from 24.02.22 to 02.02.25 are approximately: As reported by ArmyInform, fierce battles at the front: Pokrovsky direction remains the epicenter of the confrontation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/visim-desyatkiv-odynycz-avtotehniky-ta-1320-pihotyncziv-genshtab-zsu-oprylyudnyv-vtraty-rf/	2025-02-01T21:19:31-08:00
Fierce battles at the front: the Pokrovsky direction remains the epicenter of the confrontation	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The enemy carried out two missile and 34 air strikes, using 40 missiles and 39 guided bombs, 739 kamikaze drone strikes, and almost 4,500 attacks on the positions of our troops. The enemy attacked our fortifications on the Kupyansk direction 17 times in the areas of Topoli, Dvorichna, Petropavlivka, Stepova Novosilka, Hlushkivka, Zagryzovo and Lozova settlements. In the Lyman direction, Russian troops stormed the positions of Ukrainian defenders 15 times near Novoyehorivka, Terny, Yampolivka, Kolodyaz, Torsky and in the direction of Novomykhailivka. In the Seversky direction units of the Defense Forces repelled four attacks by enemy troops near Verkhnokamyanskyi and Bilogorivka. In the Kramatorsk direction our troops repelled seven enemy attacks in the areas of Chasiv Yar, Stupochka and Bila Hora settlements. In the Toretsk direction the occupiers stormed the positions of our defenders seven times in the Toretsk and Crimea regions. In the Pokrovsky direction the enemy carried out 39 assault and offensive operations. The greatest activity of the Russian occupiers is in the districts of Zeleny Poly, Elizavetivka, Promeny, Zvirovoy, Udachny, Uspenivka, Novooleksandrivka, Srybny, and Dachny. according to calculations, our soldiers eliminated 151 and wounded 126 occupiers in this direction; destroyed the -Msta-B- howitzer, the BM-21 -Grad- self-propelled howitzer, a mortar, three cars, three motorcycles and two UAVs of operational-tactical level, also caused damage to two units of automotive equipment, two -Msta-S- self-propelled howitzers and an enemy tank. In the Novopavlovsk direction the invaders carried out two attacks on the positions of Ukrainian troops, the enemy tried to advance in the direction of Constantinople and Rozhlyv. The enemy's attack aircraft struck in the Vremivka region. In the Gulyajpil direction, the aggressor made two attempts to dislodge our defenders from their positions in the Novosilka area. Novopil suffered from enemy airstrikes. In the Orykhiv direction two clashes took place in the Shcherbakiv and Nesteryanka areas. In the Dnieper direction the Russian invaders once tried to dislodge our units from their positions, they did not succeed, they suffered losses. The Defense Forces of Ukraine continue the operation in the Kursk direction. In total, Ukrainian soldiers repelled six attacks of the invading army in this direction, at present, one battle is still ongoing, in addition, the enemy's aircraft carried out 18 airstrikes on its own territory, dropping 23 anti-aircraft missiles, and the enemy also fired 230 attacks on populated areas and the positions of our troops. In the Kharkiv direction since the beginning of the day, the enemy has not carried out assault operations. There were no significant changes in the situation in other areas. The department honored the Ukrainian soldiers of the 3rd separate assault brigade, 43rd separate mechanized brigade, 60th separate mechanized Ingulets brigade, 79th separate amphibious assault brigade of Tavria and 128th separate mountain assault brigade of Zakarpattia, who steadfastly deter crowd overwhelming enemy forces. As ArmyInform reported, paratroopers -Jack- and -Oliver- told how in the very first battle, six occupiers were captured at once.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/zapekli-boyi-na-fronti-pokrovskyj-napryamok-zalyshayetsya-epiczentrom-protystoyannya/	2025-02-01T21:14:54-08:00
You don't want to fight for Ukraine, you will fight for Russia: 10 thousand Ukrainians from TOT call...	So the recent post on Facebook of the Ukrainian soldier only on his the page had almost half a thousand reposts. And on the page of another user who shared the post with her, the number of reposts reached two thousand. And continues to grow. So why are these messages suddenly responding? Sometimes too emotional, sometimes with the use of not quite censorious language - but why do people read them and pass them on? Probably because when we talk about the reluctance of a part of Ukrainians to serve, we always return to a simple formula: you don't want to fight for Ukraine, you will fight for Russia. And every time one of the Ukrainians talks about it, he hits a nerve. And other military men spoken out about it more than once. But a significant part of society still thinks that this fate will pass them by. It won't actually go away. Recently publicized by the Center of National Resistance (CNS) the figures indicate precisely it. Thus, in almost 10 months of 2024, about 10,000 Ukrainians living in the temporarily occupied territories became servicemen of the Russian army. We are talking about the temporarily occupied territories of Crimea, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions. According to message CNS, conscription to the Russian army in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine began in October last year. -According to the plans of the Kremlin Fuhrer, the ranks of terrorists should be replenished by at least 150,000 new recruits. Among them, a significant share falls on temporarily annexed Donetsk region, Luhansk region, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson region and annexed Crimea,- the publication says. The Central Intelligence Agency clarifies that the first recruitment to the Kremlin's terrorist army took place in the fall of 2023: -Then, as now, recruits were promised that their service would not be connected with participation in the so-called svo. However, as practice has shown, most conscripts were forced to sign contracts with the Ministry of Attack of the Russian Federation and continue to fight against the Motherland. The head of Zaporizhzhia OVA Ivan Fedorov also in his Telegram notes that such conscripts are promised that they will serve in the military units of the occupied Crimea, Rostov Region and Krasnodar Territory. -There is no faith in promises - at the beginning of the occupation Gauleiter Balytsky already promised a 5-year moratorium on service in the Russian army for citizens of the TOT. As expected, he lied,- writes Ivan Fedorov. And he adds that residents of captured territories who were forced to join the enemy army can turn to the state project -I want to live- to voluntarily surrender to captivity and save his life. But even without these facts listed above, in Ukraine they remember very well who in February 2022 fought together with the Russians against our country. These were residents of the temporarily occupied Luhansk region and Donetsk region. And this is a clear example of what fate awaits every Ukrainian if his hometown is captured by the enemy. As joked one recently from bloggers on Facebook, -10 thousand mobilized Ukrainians in the occupied territories for 2024. Conflicts with the military commissars of the Russian Federation have not been recorded. Somehow it is.'' And indeed, in those territories, something is not observed in the social networks of a stream of angry posts against the bad employees of the Russian military commissars and their arbitrariness. And knowing the appetites of the Russian imperial machine, we can say with confidence that the fact about 10,000 conscripted Ukrainians last year can only be the beginning.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/ne-hochesh-voyuvaty-za-ukrayinu-voyuvatymesh-za-rosiyu-10-tysyach-ukrayincziv-z-tot-pryzvaly-na-sluzhbu-do-armiyi-rf/	2025-02-01T20:56:48-08:00
Under Pokrovsk, the enemy is hidden by -Gradams- in tandem with the Romanian APR-40 systems: a repor...	-My reactive artillery battery reports directly to the brigade commander, we execute commands through the brigade artillery chief and the combined fire support department. In the Pokrovsky direction, we carry out combat tasks in a non-stop mode, in fact continuously. We have domestic 122-mm BM-21 -Grad- rocket launchers and Romanian APR-40 in our arsenal. The Romanian rocket launcher is practically an analogue of the Grad, which also uses Soviet-style 122 mm shells. Firing from jet systems is always a demoralizing weapon for the enemy. We cover the specified area with volley fire and blow everything there -to fluff and dust.- We destroy control points, warehouses of heavy armored vehicles, weapons and warehouses with ammunition in the depth of the enemy's battle formations. Now it is very hot in the Pokrovsky direction, the occupiers are advancing in small assault groups. We destroy rashists in shelters, fortifications and in places of haste. No one survives there after our righteous fire. In this way, we stop the advance of the enemy's infantry in the zone of responsibility of our brigade. On the day when a large number of Russian attack aircraft are destroyed, the enemy no longer advances in that direction. After all, they need time to prepare new -kamikaze-. Depending on the projectiles, we can attack the enemy at a distance of up to 40 km, mostly we work at a distance of 20-30 km. The crews of the Grad and APR-40 jet systems are in constant combat readiness for use. So that you understand, for example, the time from taking an unprepared position to starting fire is only 3 minutes. Of course, it takes much more time to aim at the target, for example, on -Hrad- up to 15-20 minutes. Before that, air reconnaissance finds out what needs to be destroyed, the command determines the priority of the defeat and passes it on to us. One -pack- of rockets is 40 shots in 30 seconds. Any volley fire system has the possibility that projectiles fall with a certain dispersion, forming a so-called dispersion ellipse. So, we can cover an area of ​​4 hectares with fire. Of course, the largest concentration of projectiles will fall closer to the center of this ellipse and form a zone of stable damage. That is, everything that is in this area is actually destroyed. Under the conditions, if there is not, for example, some kind of powerful underground shelter. The other day we got the coordinates of the target: somewhere 20 km from the contact line, the Rashists had created a field ammunition depot, it was well camouflaged, but our aerial scouts still found it. We were hit by several shells, there was an explosion, oh how beautiful, they said that for several hours shrapnel from ammunition flew around. And once in Zaporozhye, when they were carrying out combat missions, they managed to destroy the command post of a regiment of the Russian Armed Forces. Russian officers worked there, there were many of them. They put a whole -package- of -Hrad- shells there. Another telling story for the enemy to get out of our land. One day the Rashists were advancing on motorcycles, their infantry had to quickly reach the plantation and establish themselves there. Our calculation worked effectively and covered the advance of the occupiers. It was 7 or 8 motorcycles that were blown to shreds. You yourself understand that the salvo fire of a jet system is not a single shell of 152 mm or 155 mm barrel artillery caliber. Maximum damage and destruction of everything around - this allows you to effectively inflict losses on the Russians. What we really need is more shells. The most popular are high-explosive fragments. We want to destroy the enemy much more and drive him out of our land forever. The enemy has the upper hand in the sky. Russian Zala, SuperCam and Lancets are constantly in the air. Therefore, we choose positions for striking with caution, and if we fire from closed firing positions, we try to mask them well, cars, of course, in caponiers. Strict compliance with safety measures. There is no way without it now. We install -anti-lance- protection, an anti-drone net, plus a EW works on the installation. What else is very important in our daily combat work. The ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft installation constantly leaves with us for cover. It works at a distance of 50-100 meters from our systems. -Zenitka- is capable of hitting air targets at heights of up to 2.5 km. If there is a need to shoot down FPV drones, then the artrocalculations are connected with automatic machines. EW tools do not always effectively suppress the work of Lancets. Plus, katsaps already use -fpvishki- on optical fiber. This is a problem and something needs to be done about it. In terms of technical characteristics and capabilities, the Romanian MLRS is almost indistinguishable from the work of our BM-21 -Grad-. Depending on the projectiles, the range of fire is the same, the capabilities of the machine are the same. The only difference is the aiming speed. On -Hrad- the calculation is done faster than on the Romanian installation. There are no questions at all about the accuracy and destruction of racist targets. What is the working principle of the Grad anti-aircraft missile system and the APR-40? Conventionally speaking, the enemy advances or makes a breakthrough to our positions on the front edge. Calculations of combat vehicles of the battery immediately leave for the firing positions. We set the compass, determine the main direction of fire based on these coordinates, which are provided by aerial scouts. We launch the -Nettle- system software. To work with -Kropyva-, you only need to know the coordinates of the targets and locations of your artillery battery, weather conditions. The data is entered into a tablet, then the boys automatically calculate the direction of fire and the distance to the target. All. We are waiting for the command to open fire. As soon as such a command arrives, we open fire, and after the -breakdown-, let's say so, we assemble and quickly leave the positions. So that the enemy does not catch us. Shoot and run tactics. Our work is similar to the work of the Hymers. Only the American systems are more powerful and hit at a much greater distance.- -Before the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, he lived with his family in Irpen, Kyiv region. He worked in a logistics company, the last position was the manager of warehouse logistics. In total, I had 12 warehouses under my command throughout the territory of Ukraine. On the fourth day after the start of the great war, he barely managed to get his wife and children out of the city, and he himself got out on the ninth day. Went out with the dog on foot through the woods. I watched all sorts of things. After the liberation of Kyiv region from the occupiers, he returned home. Housing had to be restored. When enemies came from Buchi, our residential complex on the outskirts of the city was the first of the houses to come under fire. Finished all my work matters, later received a summons and to the army. BZVP took place in -Desna-, before that he did not serve in the army. At the educational center, they looked at me, they saw that I am an adequate person, I have an education, I have a lot of experience working in large teams. They offered to join the artillery. The 117th brigade was being formed just at the training ground. Got into a jet artillery unit. Performed the duties of a scout-rangefinder. I am the kind of person who wants to know and be able to do everything, I learned a lot on my own in artillery work, studied the operation of the -Nettle- system, raised money on my own and bought myself a -Mavik-, flew other UAVs as well. In short, I took up anything useful in our work. The brigade artillery chief noticed me and dragged me to the joint fire support section, where artillery fire control is carried out. I took the position of staff sergeant. Managed unmanned systems in the department. Received the rank of officer. Then he was appointed commander of a reactive artillery battery. As soon as the position became vacant, they told me: -Your battery, your guys, you know everyone.- You will go as a combatant-. In principle, it doesn't matter to me in what position to beat the occupiers. The main thing is to do it efficiently and to the benefit of the state,- says Ilya with the nickname -Nazhdak-. -In our battery, all the guys are charged and extremely motivated to destroy the enemy. When you reset the targets and give them the command to hit, they jump for joy. It is a great pleasure to lead such personnel,- adds the battery commander.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/pid-pokrovskom-voroga-kryyut-gradamy-u-tandemi-z-rumunskymy-systemamy-apr-40-reportazh-armiyainform/	2025-02-01T20:40:13-08:00
The first is real: construction of a full-fledged aircraft carrier has begun in Turkey	As stated in the information of the Turkish portal SavunmaSanayiST with reference to the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic, the sheet metal cutting ceremony for the national aircraft carrier MÜGEM, the national submarine MİLDEN and the air defense combat destroyer TF-2000 took place in the command of Istanbul Shipyard, reports ArmyInform. -Thus, the necessary practical solution to the construction of 3 different warships, which will advance the Turkish Navy one more step forward, was implemented,- the publication emphasized. The hull design of the MÜGEM (translated as -National Aircraft Carrier-) was developed with the help of a multidimensional optimization tool to improve compatibility with sea conditions and maneuverability. These functions, tested with the help of simulations, will allow the ship to move through the sea in the most efficient way. The special design of the bow of the ship provides fuel savings of 1.5%, and also increases privacy and operational efficiency by reducing underwater noise. According to the Army Recognition website, Ankara independently developed the Milli Uçak Gemisi (MÜGEM) aircraft carrier project. It should become the largest ship in the entire history of Turkish shipbuilding. The declared length is 285 meters, width is 72 meters, draft is 10.1 meters. Water tonnage is 60,000 tons. It is assumed that the ship will have a crew of no less than 800 personnel. For comparison, ships of a similar class - the British Queen Elizabeth has a displacement of 70,000. tons, and the French Charles de Gaulle - 42 thousand. tons The aircraft carrier is expected to reach a speed of 25 knots and have a range of 10,000 nautical miles at 14 knots. This is ensured by four LM2500 gas turbines from General Electric and two variable-pitch propellers for efficient maneuverability. The aircraft carrier is designed in the STOBAR configuration (-short take-off from the springboard, landing on the air finisher-). Meanwhile, American aircraft carriers are being built in the CATOBAR configuration (catapult-assisted take-offs and aerial finisher landings). MÜGEM will have three launch sites. Two are for take-off and one is for landing aircraft. A launch catapult (a device for launching aircraft from a small platform, ship or vessel) has not yet been planned. Instead, the ship has a springboard (an inclined ramp curved upwards, which allows the aircraft to take off with a shortened run). However, this design is only part of the conceptual model of the new ship. Later, the springboard will be replaced by a flat deck and catapult when Turkey gets its own developed catapult system. As the name suggests, MÜGEM is to be built almost entirely without foreign components. The goal is to create an aircraft carrier that is 80 percent Turkish-made components and materials. It is possible that Turkey will want to design an electromagnetic catapult for MÜGEM. Such launch systems are successors to conventional steam catapults and are used by the US on the aircraft carrier Gerald Ford and by China on the Fujian. As indicate experts of the IKK Defense Express (DE) defense portal, MÜGEM will have an air wing with up to 50 aircraft devices But against the background of the lack of a full-fledged deck fighter, its composition will not be entirely traditional. The only manned aircraft will be the combat version of the Hürjet trainer, which has rather limited combat capabilities. But it will be compensated by drones: reconnaissance-strike TB3 and -Currently, the aircraft carrier will be equipped with a springboard, but in the future there are plans to equip it with a catapult. The latter can open the possibility to diversify the composition of the air group, in particular thanks to a special version of the national fighter KAAN. It is worth noting that the construction dates of MÜGEM remain unannounced, but are most likely planned somewhere in the 20s-30s,- DE noted. MÜGEM will not only have armed planes and drones, but will also be equipped with weapons. The corresponding systems should mainly be used to defend against air and sea attacks. It is planned to install the MiDLAS missile launch system with 32 launchers containing anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles. In addition, the project envisages 4 Gökdeniz systems. This is an analogue of the American Phalanx system, which is detailed in one of its materials told our publication. Each of the 35 mm Gökdeniz guns has its own radar, which allows autonomously hitting air targets at short distances if necessary. These include drones and cruise missiles and other incoming missiles. There are also 6 Aselsan STOP units. These are 25mm automatic guns. Combat modules can automatically track targets using optical image recognition. Turkey now has only one -conditional- aircraft carrier in its fleet: TCG Anadolu. And this is a landing ship in general. It is identical to the Spanish flagship -Juan Carlos I-, so it was not designed in Turkey. With a displacement of 27,000 tons, it is half the size of MÜGEM. In theory, it can still be used as an aircraft carrier if the hangar is reconfigured to accommodate aircraft. Initially, it was planned that up to 10 American F-35Bs would be placed on the ship. This is a version of a stealth fighter with a vertical takeoff. Given that, in addition to the Anadolu, Turkey plans to have another similar Trakya ship in its -line-up-, together with the MÜGEM, this will formally expand the aircraft carrier capabilities of the Turkish Navy to three ships. For comparison, Italy has only the 35,000-ton Cavour, France has the aforementioned Charles de Gaulle, and only Great Britain has two Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers. At the same time, the area of ​​responsibility of European states is much wider than in Turkey. In conditions where any attack by another state on Turkey, as a NATO country, is excluded with almost 99% probability, the appearance of a full-fledged aircraft carrier in its fleet indicates the growth of foreign policy ambitions and the further use of such a ship as a tool of -power projection- and foreign political influence Turkey.

Fantasy palmistry: Russian absurdity about lengthening life lines on the palms of conscripts	Seriously. It's not even a joke. They really wrote it. According to the version of Russian -experts- on telegrams, in a Kharkiv private clinic, for $3,000, you can perform an operation that -guarantees a long life.- Because, you see, Ukrainians are so superstitious that instead of normal medicine they decided to rely on surgical intervention in their own palms. After this procedure, as the Russians claim, -patients get a longer life line, which seems to increase their chances of returning from the front.- 1. -REN TV- level fiction This is not even a new fake - similar -stories- appear from time to time in East Asian countries, where palmistry still has some popularity. But in Ukraine, where medical science is developed at a level higher than that of the Russians (who still treat -DNA changes after vaccination-), such things look like a blatant absurdity. 2. Military conscription and -plastic surgery- Let's imagine: a man receives a summons, but instead of collecting documents or passing a medical examination, he carries $3,000 to a private clinic to have an additional incision made on his palm. Well, yes, this is obviously a more logical option than simply serving or going abroad, as the same Russians like to describe it. 3. Phantom clinic No specific name of the clinic, no address, no real feedback. Just -in Kharkiv-, -sources report-. Although the sources seem to be somewhere in the Kremlin between the seventh and eighth shot of vodka. 4. It doesn't work at all Any doctor, even a Russian one, will tell you that surgery on the palm of your hand does not change life expectancy in any way. Because this is not mysticism, but physiology. But in a country where people still believe in -magical biofields- and -energy cleansing- from Kadyrov, apparently, such theories are valid. Comic absurdity aside, this fake has a clear purpose: Russian propaganda is so desperate that it just makes up fakes -on the fly- without even making any effort to make them believable. Unfortunately, the next step will probably be even more absurd. Maybe soon they will say that in Ukraine conscripts are transplanted with a frog's heart for -greater endurance-, or that in Lviv Oblast they developed a ritual of -protection against the draft- with the help of lard and embroidery? Well, we are waiting for new -masterpieces- from Russian information dumps.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/fentezi-hiromantiya-rosijskyj-absurd-pro-podovzhennya-linij-zhyttya-na-dolonyah-vijskovozobovyazanyh/	2025-02-01T20:11:22-08:00

Volodymyr Zelenskyi: Every Russian drone or missile is made up of components from other countries	He expressed this opinion during his evening video address on Saturday, February 1. -We must always be completely honest about such Russian terror: they would not have managed to inflict such damage on their own, so intensively and literally every night. Every Russian -shakhed- and every Russian missile are components produced by other countries. One hundred and sixty-five strike units in one night strike of Russia - all these -Iskanders-, -calibers- and other means of killing - are hundreds and even thousands of components from other countries. European countries, China and even America,- the head of state said. According to him, without such critical components, the Kremlin regime -will not have any opportunity to disrupt the lives of other peoples.- -Therefore, it is critically important that the sanctions are really strong and that they cannot be circumvented under any circumstances. There should be no way to supply Russia with critical components for defense production. Violation of sanctions should be interpreted as complicity in the war, and whoever helps destroy life should be held accountable,- the President emphasized. He also added that Ukraine is currently working to attract even more resources from partners to strengthen its air shield. -Protection against shelling is an absolute priority. Much remains to be done, but every partner of ours in the world who helps it is a lifesaver. And this is exactly what everyone in the world should think about now: about life, about joint work, about pressure on the aggressor and about the approach of real peace. Peace that Russia will not give. A peace to which they can only be pressed. We will press on!-, Volodymyr Zelenskyi assured. &nbsp; As reported by ArmyInform, the number of victims of the Russian attack on a high-rise building in Poltava increased to eight people.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/volodymyr-zelenskyj-kozhen-rosijskyj-dron-chy-raketa-cze-komponenty-z-inshyh-krayin/	2025-02-01T10:55:57-08:00
Fraud with products for the army: a large-scale theft scheme in the military unit was exposed in Kyi...	The DBR informs about this. During June-November 2023, they stole at least 30% of products from the warehouse, reducing the daily food supply for servicemen accordingly. This -leftover- of products was also used in another money-making scheme. A representative of the military unit, in collusion with a private enterprise, issued -empty- invoices for the alleged supply of other products worth millions of hryvnias. The same products that were not issued to the soldiers and then went on sale were accounted for on paper. Such actions caused losses to the state in the amount of more than UAH 5.4 million. As reported by ArmyInform, law enforcement bodies exposed the accountant of one of the military units in the Odesa region, -vyplat-znyklyh-bezvisty-bijcziv-dbr/->which appropriated more than 2 million hryvnias of payments to missing soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/shahrajstvo-z-produktamy-dlya-armiyi-na-kyyivshhyni-vykryto-masshtabnu-shemu-kradizhok-u-vijskovij-chastyni/	2025-02-01T10:49:42-08:00
Destroying their own cities - Russian troops attacked a boarding school in Suzhi, Kursk region	This was reported at the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, publishing footage with the consequences of the attack. At the same time, they emphasized that the strike on a civilian object was -targeted-. -At the time of the attack, there were dozens of local residents in the premises who were preparing to evacuate. The Russian side had information that only civilians — local residents, including women and children — are in the boarding school,- the report says.

The occupiers are forced to resort to using stolen motoblocks, but even this time they did not reach their final destination,- Ukrainian fighters note. As can be seen in the released footage, when one of the invaders noticed the approach of the FPV drones, he immediately jumped out of his vehicle, because it was moving so slowly that the only chance for him to survive was to flee on foot. However, his henchman was less lucky, because as a result of being hit by a drone, he was left lying next to a motoblock that had been stolen somewhere. -That's why it hurts, and that's why it's fun,- Ukrainian soldiers commented on their video.

In total, the radio engineering troops of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine detected and escorted 165 enemy air targets: Anti-aircraft missile units, EW devices and mobile fire groups of the Air Force and the Defense Forces of Ukraine were involved in repelling the enemy air attack. According to preliminary data, 56 -Shahed- strike UAVs/simulator drones of various types were shot down, another 61 UAVs did not reach their targets (lost in location). Some of the enemy's cruise missiles were destroyed by anti-aircraft defense. A significant part of the missiles, due to the active opposition of the Defense Forces, did not reach their goals. However, there are also injuries, in particular, missiles that enter the target on a ballistic trajectory. Detailed information on enemy missiles has not yet been made public. As a result of the Russian strike, civilian objects and objects of critical infrastructure were hit by missiles and attack UAVs. Hitting a residential building in Poltava by an Kh-22 missile, shelling the historic center of Odessa with -ballistics- is yet another evidence of the barbarism and terrorism of the Russian leadership. Also, on the night of February 1, the enemy attacked Ukrainian enterprises and objects of the Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the Zaporizhia, Odesa, Sumy, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, and Kyiv regions.

He served in the infantry for two years, and then, due to his health, he was transferred to another unit, where he began his new path - as an operator of unmanned aerial vehicles. After that, he did not stop, asked the command and went to study engineering, becoming an instructor in this specialization. -I served two years in the infantry, felt what it was like to be at ground zero.- And now that we fly drones, it helps the infantry. As soon as they do not reach the infantry positions, it becomes easier for them,- says -Sirko-.

But in addition to the important work that directly affects combat results, he talks about the team spirit in the Presidential Brigade. -There is an adequate command here, the guys and I understand each other half a word. You can turn to the commander, and he will listen to you, support you, help you if necessary. This is what allows us to work harmoniously and efficiently,- he adds. Sirko was now training new fighters, including those who had previously evaded service. He does not blame them, but gives them a chance to adapt to the war, improve their skills and help at the front. It is his duty not only to carry out combat tasks, but also to pass on knowledge to the younger generation, who will defend Ukraine in the near future. -We will show, teach. I have three children, a wife. I also want to see my children grow up. But nothing, we have no way back, we have to fight to victory. And the victory will be ours anyway, because there is no other way,- concludes Sirko, clearly aware of the importance of his mission.

I neutralized and wounded one of the opponents. Later, the wounded man died,- says -Jack-. At some point, the occupiers began to convince our fighters to stop resisting, claiming that all this was allegedly -just politics-, but when they realized that all this was useless, insults and intimidation started. However, no matter what threats the Russians expressed towards the Ukrainian military, it still did not help them in any way. -They started throwing away their weapons when they realized they had no chance&#8230; Then the last attack aircraft came down to us and we already started tying and packing them,- the guys said.

This is an important advantage on the battlefield,- he adds. The tank driver does not hide that he deliberately chose to serve in the army. -This is my choice, my profession. And when difficult times come, a man must be a man,- concludes Alexander, for whom military service is not only a duty, but also a vocation.

-A bullet stuck in a bulletproof vest-: an incredible story of a fighter with the call sign -Murchik...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. His first battles took place in a volunteer unit, although Maxim himself does not like to mention it. Already in the composition of the 58th brigade, he went through numerous fierce battles, including defensive and offensive battles. In one of the hottest places - the village of Urozhany in Donetsk region - he destroyed a Russian tank from the NLAW complex, and together with his brothers captured a group of invaders. Maxim says that during one of the battles, he and his brothers were waiting for an assault group that was supposed to attack the enemy's position in the hangar. However, everything did not go according to plan: during the landing of the attack aircraft, the Russians opened fire, as a result of which one fighter was killed and three others were injured. Despite the loss, the operation had to continue. So the only fighter left from the assault group turned to Maxim and his comrades with a request for help. -He said that there were no more than five Russians in the hangar. I replied that I couldn't storm, and he reassured me: -I can't either, but we'll manage.- And we left,- the fighter recalls. In fact, there were 15 enemies in the room. However, Maxim and his comrades gave them a fight: several were eliminated, seven were taken prisoner. Three more Russian commanders, armed with a machine gun, remained inside. Maxim decided to act by trickery - he took one of the prisoners and returned with him to the hangar to convince the rest of the enemies to surrender. But when they got close, the Russians opened fire. The prisoner was wounded, and Maxim himself hid behind a concrete column, waiting for the enemy to run out of ammunition. -When they shot the ammunition, they ran away. I looked at myself - a bullet from a Kalashnikov machine gun was sticking out of my bulletproof vest: it pierced the phone and got stuck in the plate,- says Maksym. Later, among the prisoners, it turned out that they were also from the 58th, but Russian brigade. The oldest of them is 62 years old, a former prisoner who spent 48 years behind bars. The youngest is 19 and was a conscript. They warned of a planned assault on Ukrainian military positions by 500 militants. And the fighters themselves had only two stores for each. So Maxim returned to the hangar again to collect the enemy's ammunition. In the end, the assault never took place, and the unit was changed. However, the trials for Maxim did not end there. In one of the battles, when he aimed a missile complex with a laser beam at an enemy tank, the occupiers managed to fire first. The shell exploded ten meters from him, covering it with earth. His brothers pulled him out from under the rubble. During another battle near Urozhany, he was wounded by an enemy drone attack. After a month in the hospital, he returned to service and continues to fight. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Separate Presidential Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine there is a constant process of improving the skills of fighters. oleksandr-pazik-pro-pidgotovku-voyiniv-u-prezydentskij-brygadi/->.

She was preparing an explosion near the building of the special service: a detained Russian agent	The Security Service of Ukraine informs about this. This location is currently not being used by secret service personnel who have been redeployed to back-up work stations for the duration of a full-scale invasion. However, a potential terrorist attack could have resulted in large casualties among civilian passers-by in the central part of the city. At the scene of the incident, the detainee found a bag in which there was an improvised explosive device with a capacity of 7 kg in TNT equivalent. Such a charge is enough to seriously damage the building and cause fatal damage to people around the epicenter of the explosion. According to the case materials, the Rashists remotely recruited a 22-year-old drug addict from Lviv, who was looking for -quick- money on Telegram channels, to prepare a terrorist attack. On the instructions of the occupiers, the girl came to Kyiv, where her Russian curator rented an apartment for her in the city center in advance. After moving into temporary housing, she picked up a mini-surveillance camera via courier and installed it on the balcony. With the help of remote access, the enemy was able to monitor the central street of Kyiv in online mode and thus wanted to record the consequences of the terrorist attack. Employees of the SBU worked in advance and arrested the perpetrator -in the act- when she took a bag with an explosive device from a hiding place and headed to a rented apartment. During the search, a mobile phone was additionally seized from the detainee, which she used to communicate with the Russian special service. So far, the investigators of the Security Service have notified the suspect of suspicion under several articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: ch. 2 Art. 111 (treason committed under martial law); h 1 Art. 14, ch. 2 Art. 258 (preparation for the commission of a terrorist act committed by a group of persons with a prior conspiracy); h 1 Art. 263 (unlawful handling of arms, ammunition or explosives). The perpetrator is in custody. She faces up to life in prison with forfeiture of property. Urgent comprehensive measures are underway to bring to justice all persons involved in the planning and preparation of the terrorist attack. The special operation was conducted under the procedural guidance of the Prosecutor General's Office. As reported by ArmyInform, in Cherkaschyna, a suspect of working for the Russian Federation, who was preparing strikes, was detained in the places of deployment of the Defense Forces, but failed in its mission, falling into the hands of the Security Service of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/gotuvala-vybuh-bilya-budivli-speczsluzhby-zatrymana-agentka-rf/	2025-02-01T01:29:16-08:00

But there are cases when storming enemy groups are selected: that is, from units that are not directly against us, but those that specifically come in to carry out storming operations. They are quite well equipped and trained,- the serviceman noted. He added that the more enemy assaults there are, the more the enemy wants to surrender: -Because they don't have much motivation, especially local mobilized (drafted into the Russian army - ed.). Therefore, it is possible to capture them. They then tell us that their task is to go to a certain point and from there wave the drone, show that they have arrived, and wait for reinforcements when the next group has to go forward. But, as a rule, they are all destroyed and do not wait for the next group.- Earlier ArmyInform reported that in the Kupyan direction, the enemy begins assaults, releasing ill-prepared infantry at the positions of the Defense Forces, in order to detect our firing positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/bez-motyvacziyi-na-toreczkomu-napryamku-pozycziyi-zsu-shturmuyut-meshkanczi-donechchyny-ta-luganshhyny-yakyh-mobilizuvala-armiya-rf/	2025-02-01T01:01:19-08:00

He willingly shared the details of his -business trip- to the war, and his words were once again confirmed: the Russian command views its soldiers as cannon fodder. -I didn't know where I was being taken,- said the captive. According to the prisoner, he was in SIZO-2 in Kuibyshev (Novosibirsk region). No one informed him about a possible -business trip- to the front and did not allow him to sign any documents. -On November 14, 2024, I was sent by stage. I didn't know where I was going. On the way, other prisoners have already explained that we were heading to the Tolmachiv airport at the RDSU (Russian volunteer special service), -he said. He was never issued documents, a military ID, or a passport. From Rostov Zecs were loaded into military trucks and transported to the 74th Motorized Rifle Brigade. The command in the brigade consisted of former prisoners who mocked the new arrivals, beat them and took personal belongings. Already at the front line, it became clear that new recruits were being used as cannon fodder without the right to retreat. -We were told to take the stronghold, throw grenades at it and hold it. On the way, those who had already fought said that it was suicide. We are going in the same direction, and we are all crazy. We are all corpses,- admitted the captive.

-Communal apocalypse- in the Luhansk region: the infrastructure was on the verge of collapse due to ...	The head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, Artem Lysogor, reported this on his page. . At the same time, the occupiers do not take into account the destruction they caused during the storming of the cities of the region in 2022. Then the infrastructure of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Rubizhny, Kreminnaya, Girsky, Zoloty and Popasnaya was completely destroyed or badly damaged. In fact, this is a confirmation of many years of ignoring any major repairs. Instead of modernization, the occupation authorities only charged local residents for water, electricity, gas, and heat without investing in system maintenance. For almost 11 years of occupation, the occupation administration only exploited the infrastructure left by Ukraine, without thinking about its renewal. Now, when it is in a critical state, the residents of the temporarily occupied territories are threatened with a real communal collapse. What does this mean for local people? According to Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, this is evidence that the occupiers not only destroyed Ukrainian cities and villages, but were also unable to provide basic conditions for life. -That is, for a decade, starting in 2014, the occupiers did not attempt to make major repairs or install new equipment, while charging the population and businesses monthly for the use of water, electricity, gas, and heat,- — noted Lysohor.

Ryazan, Saratov, Engels: map of attacks by the Defense Forces of Ukraine on Russian military facilit...	Unlike the Russian army, which is shelling residential areas, educational institutions and hospitals, Ukrainian strikes are aimed exclusively at enemy logistics, defense facilities and weapons storage facilities. ArmyInform collected information on all strikes in January, confirmed by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. On January 14, the Defense Forces of Ukraine carried out the most massive attack on the military facilities of the occupiers at a distance of 200 to 1100 km deep into the Russian Federation. Targets in the Bryansk, Saratov, Tula regions and the Republic of Tatarstan were hit. Krystal Plant was hit twice during the week, after the first hit the fire lasted for five days. This oil depot supplied fuel to the Engels-2 military airfield, where Tu-160 strategic bombers are based. In today's conditions, when the Russians are under sanctions, it will be almost impossible to restore the lost resources. This is especially true of the fuel T-8B, which was manufactured exclusively to the order of the Russian army. Also twice, the Defense Forces attacked the Liskinskaya oil depot in the Voronezh region of the Russian Federation. The company belongs to one of the largest Russian state-owned corporations, Rosneft. Last week, two strikes were also made against the Ryazan Oil Refining Company, one of the four largest oil refineries in Russia, which annually produces about 840,000 tons of aviation kerosene. TS-1, which is 8.4% of the total production volume of this product in Russia. The loss of such a resource is a significant blow to the logistics and provision of Russian military operations. Ukrainian drones have also successfully visited oil refineries and fuel storage sites in the Kaluga, Volgograd and Nizhny Novgorod regions of the Russian Federation. In addition to the refinery, Ukrainian attack UAVs attacked production facilities involved in the production of Russian weapons. The Kremniy El microelectronics plant in Bryansk was affected. This is one of the key enterprises of the microelectronics industry of the Russian Federation, which produces a wide range of microcircuits and components used in the Topol-M, Bulava missile systems, S-300 and S-400 air defense systems, as well as in the on-board electronics of combat aircraft. In the Bryansk Region, in the city of Seltso, a chemical plant was hit, where ammunition for barrel artillery, rocket launcher systems, aviation, engineering ammunition and components of Kh-59 cruise missiles. The Smolensk Aviation Plant, where combat aircraft are modernized and produced, was also attacked by Ukrainian drones. In addition, the Defense Forces struck the warehouses for the storage of attack UAVs of the Russian occupiers in the Oryol region of the Russian Federation. Ukrainian drones hit concrete structures where thermobaric warheads, which are equipped with UAVs, were stored. It is known in advance that the enemy will no longer use more than 200 Shaheds against Ukraine. The defense forces of Ukraine also managed to successfully hit the locations of the Russian occupation troops. The force of our strikes was felt at three command posts of Russian groups in Kurshchyna. In the Belgorod region, it was possible to successfully hit the positions of the anti-aircraft missile division of the 568th anti-aircraft missile regiment of the radar company of the radio engineering battalion of the 336 radio engineering regiment. In addition, two enemy anti-aircraft missile complexes - -Tor- and -Buk- - were destroyed in Bryansk region during the attack on the chemical plant.

What UAVs are capable of on fiber optics: ArmiyaInform report on drone testing	We immediately noticed the pilot Tatiana with the call sign -Red-. The woman was constantly checking whether the drone was connected correctly, whether there was a video signal and whether everything was ready for the demonstration flight. — We use optical fiber in these drones to counter enemy EW, says Ruda. - Our goal is not to give the enemy the opportunity to muffle the fiber-optic control system, and this allows radio masking of the crews. Tatiana says that the absence of problems with radio interference provides high-quality communication from the point of take-off of the drone until it hits the target. - Our fiber optic FPVs can fly as far as the coil will allow. Currently available in 3, 5, 10 and 15 km. However, we plan to integrate larger ones so that the drone can fly 50 km, the pilot added. Meanwhile, one of the representatives of the -Sky Hub- school talked in detail about how to properly connect the optical fiber to the drone. - The assembly takes 30 minutes in total, followed by the setup procedure on the laptop. If there are ready-made settings, then it will take three minutes, if it is a complete setup process, then it will be 30 minutes. A very important stage is the testing of the drone. The pilot should fly it first without load, then with a load, give feedback so that the drone improves and is ready for use on the front, the military noted. He also emphasizes that the quality of the optical fiber is an extremely important issue, because it depends on them how high the rate of damage to the target by the drone will be. It is not only small FPV drones that are integrated under optical fiber. Recently, large bombers, or as they are also called -mothers-, have also been following this path. - In fact, optical fiber is a control system and can be integrated into all front-line drones except the Mavic. The advantage of such a solution for large bombers is that the reel, for example, weighs 3.2 kg, maybe less. If this can be significant for an FPV drone, then for our -mothers- it means simply taking one less projectile, - says Dmytro. — Bomber payload is 21 kg for every 10 km. Maybe it will fly a little shorter distance, but that's normal. In addition, the man noted that when the coil ends, the drone simply releases it and the UAV returns on its channels or azimuth to the point from which it took off.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/na-shho-zdatni-bpla-na-optovolokni-reportazh-armiyainform-z-testuvannya-droniv/	2025-01-31T20:47:33-08:00
About superiority in information warfare, support of front-line media and the project -Press officer...	—Mr. Serhiy, what, in your opinion, has changed in Ukrainian journalism, the national information space since the beginning of Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine? — I note that Ukrainian journalism began to transform even after the events of 2013-2014. She has changed a lot. After all, the concepts of war, hostilities, the need to repel the occupiers on the battlefield - these topics, difficult topics, have been in the Ukrainian media since 2014. But from the moment of a large-scale enemy invasion, every media person, in one way or another, has already become a war journalist from the point of view of fulfilling his duties. Because it was always necessary to take into account the increased danger in which our entire society is, within which our reporters have to work. And, accordingly, the agenda of the Ukrainian media from February 2024 is really determined by the factors that the priority should be topics that help Ukrainians to save lives, to unite in order to repel the occupiers. Topics related to coverage of the exploits of Ukrainian heroes and the Defense Forces in general. At the same time, it must be said that a radical restructuring took place in the activities and the very existence of the domestic media in a situation of increased danger, as well as in the conditions of the destruction of the unstable market of Ukrainian mass media, unstable financial income. Today, they define our information field. Unfortunately, we are saying that hundreds of Ukrainian media and thousands of journalists have stopped their activities both due to economic factors and factors related to the war and the occupation. Accordingly, it must be stated that Ukrainians' access to independent sources of information, in particular regional information, is unfortunately decreasing in Ukraine. But on the other hand, actually, in Ukraine, hundreds and hundreds of already experienced military personnel continue their daily work, professionally covering defense topics and providing objective current information from anywhere in Ukraine. But, of course, the key point that unites us and our colleagues from the international media of the democratic world is the existential challenge. Because Russia sees journalists and the media as a threat to its military offensive, a threat to its propaganda. Propaganda is an integral part of Russia's insidious aggression. So, here we see that this is also a certain battlefield for both Ukrainian and international media to protect their standards and values, which are defining for us, and the freedom for which our soldiers are currently fighting on the front. —Indeed, today hostilities are taking place not only on the fronts of the Russian-Ukrainian war, but also in the information space. In your opinion, on whose side is the advantage in these duels? What do Ukrainian media representatives benefit from, and where are we still failing? — Of course, we currently have a large-scale information war with the enemy. And here we still cannot say that we are on the same level as the Russians. And today in Ukraine, the majority of domestic media still do not receive significant state support for their existence and development. Here, of course, there is an objective factor: in wartime, the priority of state budget spending is directed to the support of the Defense Forces, because they must be provided with everything they need. But at the same time, it would be important for the Ukrainian government to loudly call on international partners to strongly support Ukrainian media so that there is stability in their reporting. Because if we talk about the professional quality of domestic mass media, it is at a high level: both nationally and regionally. And, accordingly, thorough journalistic materials - investigations, reports - they expose the fakes and lies of Russian propagandists. But, again, it is not enough for newsrooms to compete on the information field by themselves. The support of the Ukrainian media space is necessary. We say that the Ukrainian media will benefit from courageous, objective reports from the frontline. Representatives of our mass media document war crimes, so these objective materials are taken into account by international institutions, governments, and international media. Therefore, we say that Ukrainian media really win here, and we are visible. When we talk to our foreign partners and compare Ukrainian materials about the war with reports from frontline reporters of leading international media outlets, we again see the same level and the same expertise. Yes, they paint a terrible picture of the war, but we do not plunge into some primitive counter-propaganda, which would simply be a direct reflection of Russian propaganda. So it's still somewhat of a victory that we've been able to stay truthful in our coverage of these difficult events. Although, of course, the absolute priority for all journalists and the media should be the rule not to harm the Defense Forces and the Armed Forces of Ukraine. So, today, we see that our military mostly adheres to non-disclosure agreements regarding weapons, etc., so that the enemy does not use the mass media to plan their attacks. But, again, since the enemy is extremely powerful, it is difficult to conduct this duel without significant external support, both methodical and informational, analytical, and expert. - What projects did the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine start to implement in the conditions of a large-scale war, and why was it successful? - We completely restructured our activities. And, accordingly, the key priorities for us are both the issue of safety of journalists and the security of the media in general, as well as the search for resources for the survival of the media, for their sustainability. Among our initiatives, already after providing some kind of emergency aid, is mediation in providing journalists who escaped from temporarily occupied territories with financial support, assistance with equipment, as well as starting a network of journalistic solidarity centers. This is actually a network of small regional press hubs in separate regions of Ukraine. Initially, they were created in Western Ukraine. But at the moment, their activities are intensified in the front-line territories - these are Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro. Within the framework of this network, we administer requests from journalists from all regions and from abroad, related to the provision of protective equipment for work on the front, with the receipt of equipment, with the receipt of psychological assistance. We organize seminars, trainings on physical safety, hand over first-aid kits. And, in fact, this is such a system of mutual assistance with the assistance of the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine, but with the basic support of the UNESCO headquarters, the International European Federation of Journalists and our various international partners. - One of the Union's activities now is the support of regional printed publications in the front-line and de-occupied areas. How important is this project? — Yes, in addition to the network of journalistic solidarity centers, our prominent task is the initiative to revive front-line newspapers. In the conditions when Russia is attacking infrastructure facilities, for thousands of Ukrainians living in the de-occupied territories or in areas close to the contact line, the print local media is often the only source of qualified and important information about their regions. The initiative of the Union is that we finance, again with the help of an international Japanese donation, the printing of the first issue of a local front-line newspaper as a restart of all processes in the circumstances of relocation, suspension of activities, etc. And then we recommend these projects to our other international partners for sustainable support. And, in fact, the result of such activity is the revival and support of 32 front-line newspapers. In particular, in Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Donetsk, Sumy, Chernihiv regions. We understand that it is this network of front-line magazines, it is, perhaps, a newspaper information marathon that bridges the information deficit in regions where the National Telethon cannot technically reach. Get to places where Ukrainians do not have the opportunity to use the Internet or receive a TV and radio signal. This is our project of regional media lobbying both at the level of the government of Ukraine and at the level of international partners. Because it is often difficult for foreign donors to understand and see the contribution of journalists in the regions. - In continuation of this topic. Perhaps this is a trivial question, but periodically from the same volunteers who cooperate with international structures, we have to hear that partners from abroad are a little tired of the Ukrainian war: the international community is not so active in helping. At what expense do you manage to support this aid? — Indeed, we say that this is a general challenge for us, for the Union of Journalists of Ukraine, for other public organizations, and for the government to attract external support. Since the international organizations are somewhat tired of the war, one can say so. And on the other hand, this state of war between Russia and Ukraine and the state of conflict, according to their terminology, is no longer news for foreigners, it is no longer a stressful factor, as it was in 2022 from the moment of the invasion. And these are already certain realities. And that is why they are already shifting their gaze somewhere and are determined with certain priorities, switch to other countries, with other military conflicts. In particular, today many of our partners are paying attention to the Gaza Strip region, to the Middle East in general. Now the topic of the revolution and the liberation of Syria is gone. Yes, it is extremely difficult to attract high-level support to the Ukrainian media sector. But, on the other hand, despite the fact that we too are tired, we are exhausted, but we understand that we do not have the right to stop, we do not have the right to switch to any other topics at all. As long as this unjust war is going on in Ukraine, we increase our efforts, our activity: we inform the international community every day, prepare certain facts, report on the importance and effectiveness of aid. After all, let's take concrete facts: the same laptops handed over to Mariupol journalists. They allow colleagues to remain in the profession, to create materials that are necessary both for migrants from the Donetsk region and for informing the whole world. What unites and inspires us is the understanding that the resources, the help we attract, we proudly pass it on to our brave colleagues who work not in capital offices, not in quiet regional centers, but on the front lines. In particular, I admire the courage of the editor-in-chief of the newspaper -Vorskla- from Velika Pysarivka, in the Sumy region, Oleksiy Pasyuga, who lays out his so-called Route of Truth every week. Every week, he carries and distributes a freshly printed newspaper along the route from Okhtyrka, which is a relatively safe city, to Velika Pysarivka, on the border with Russia, leaving copies in village shops. I admire Svitlana Karpenko, who regularly brings copies of her newspaper to Orihiv, which is 2-3 kilometers from the contact line. And hundreds of residents of Orihiv, who live in basements without electricity, receive true and reliable information. I admire my colleagues from Kherson, Kramatorsk, Sloviansk, Pokrovsk and Myrnograd, who bring the truth to their fellow citizens. Such examples of dedication and courage of professional journalists are, in fact, the strongest arguments for us and for our efforts. And, of course, we cannot fail to mention another one of our priorities. This is a campaign of solidarity with Ukrainian journalists illegally imprisoned by Russia. We are making efforts to support the relatives and friends of our colleagues, whom Russia has unjustifiably thrown into its prisons, and to put pressure on international organizations with the aim of making efforts to release Ukrainian journalists from Russian prisons. After all, at least 30 Ukrainian media workers are currently in Russian prisons. At the same time, we have many of our colleagues who were detained by the occupiers in Zaporizhzhia, Kherson region, and their whereabouts are currently unknown. We also organize international photo exhibitions, such as -Freedom of Speech Shot-, which draws attention to our imprisoned colleagues. We make various printed reports, video materials. But, unfortunately, the key profile challenge in this war for the democratic world is that the aggressor country absolutely ignores all international rules and conventions that the Soviet Union and Russia ratified and integrated at one time. And on top of all that, Russia is slanderous, it makes -marks- on Ukrainian journalists that they are allegedly terrorists, subversives, spies, in order to discredit media workers in any way. But at the same time, we see that the civilized world clearly listens to the arguments of the Union of Journalists of Ukraine. We confirm the journalistic status of each of our colleagues. And we demand, of course, the dismissal of our colleagues. And the results are already there: the fact that Nariman Dzhelal was released in 2024 through exchange, and Maksim Butkevich, who was also released last year through exchange, is a certain contribution to this common cause and due to the efforts of NSJU activists. — Even before the first Russian attacks on Ukraine, many journalists served in the ranks of the Defense Forces in the ranks of the NSJU members. Already after 2014, and especially after 2022, military journalists were joined by mobilized communists. Do you lose touch with them? What is he like? — Of course, this is also one of our priorities — support for our comrades, our heroes, who are already performing their duties for the defense of Ukraine in various positions. And accordingly, both our regional organizations and the central office, we are also looking for volunteer resources to support our colleagues in the military. We also make a corporate contribution to the support of the Union of Journalists of Ukraine for the Defense Forces, and launched our initiative -Press officers are important!-. This is a direct joining of efforts to support colleagues who, in their ranks, organize information about our heroes and military operations. Which, in particular, provide escort of civilian journalists to frontline positions. And within the framework of such an initiative, we launched a special award of the Union of Journalists of Ukraine. This is such an honorable award from the multi-thousand-strong journalistic community to recognize the military work of press officers, about whom we receive the best feedback from civilian war-journalists who go to the front. And in 2024, Serhiy Cherevaty, Roman Chop, Ilya Yevlash, Serhiy Skibchyk, Kateryna Petrenko and other colleagues were among the first to receive this distinction. But, in addition to moral recognition, we also conduct fundraising campaigns and hand over vehicles to press officers. In particular, we also provided a car for Soledar's press service, once on the hottest Bakhmut route. And in 2024, we handed over a car for the press service of the 24th brigade. At that time, in May, the positions of the 24th Brigade were in New York, a Ukrainian village located a few kilometers from the contact line with the occupiers. Personally, it was a great honor for me, together with my colleagues, to come to the position in New York, hand over the car there and understand that it will really help the press service in its extremely responsible and dangerous work, both in terms of covering events from the front and accompanying civilian journalists, especially international filming groups Because we also understand that international support and great global solidarity with Ukraine largely depend on this. And in this unjust war, it happens precisely because the citizens of democratic countries will receive this terrible truth about the war, about its injustice, through their media. And, accordingly, they begin to demand from their governments to make efforts to properly support Ukraine. Recently, the NSJU has brought cooperation with the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine to a new level. Especially in the part of establishing effective communications between the Defense Forces and civilian media in matters of dissemination, additional attention to our army heroes, in general to the Ukrainian army. In particular, we regularly recommend publishing the best materials of the information agency ArmiyaInform in the leading regional media. These are portrait materials that add emotion and details to the images of Ukrainian soldiers and officers, our defenders. We also assist in collaboration between Army FM, Army Radio and the civilian media sector. The union conducts various activities to encourage civilian journalists and their editors to create more professional, in-depth materials on army topics, recruiting topics, army support topics, etc. So, we understand that the military media alone is not enough in informing to tell stories about all the realities that exist. Likewise, for the military, general public support is extremely important. We are very moved by the reviews when soldiers, officers are wisely remembered when their relatives, close people call them, say, from Sumy region, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and are proud of their relatives wrote a local newspaper or local journalists.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/pro-perevagu-v-informvijni-pidtrymku-pryfrontovyh-media-ta-proyekt-presoficzery-vazhlyvi-intervyu-z-golovoyu-naczspilky-zhurnalistiv/	2025-01-31T20:35:12-08:00
Blatant thefts of the fake state: when and from whom did Russia steal the coat of arms, flag and ant...	ArmyInform reminds of the most flagrant thefts of Russia, which it considers its -primordial-. The coat of arms of Russia is a double-headed eagle, which they -borrowed- according to the official version from the Byzantine Empire. According to another, no less popular, he was a legacy of the Golden Horde, because he was minted on their coins by Khans Uzbek (1283–1341), Janibek (d. 1357) and Aziz Sheikh (1365–1367). But it is more likely that this coat of arms became a trophy. It began to be used after the conquest of the Tver principality by Muscovy. Back in the 14th century, Tver was an implacable rival of Moscow for primacy in Zalissa, and the struggle between the Tver and Moscow princes for the khan label on the Grand Duchy of Volodymyr was very fierce. &nbsp; The double-headed eagle was on the coins and seal of the last prince of Tver, Mikhail Borisovich, issued in the 1470s. And already in 1497 (a few years after the conquest of Tver) he first appears on the state seal of the Moscow prince Ivan III, along with the title -prince of Tver-. The Russians got their tricolor from the Netherlands. The Dutch engineer David Butler, who oversaw the construction of the first Russian sailing ship -Orel- (a type of Dutch pinas), appealed to the Boyar Duma with a request -to ask His Royal Majesty for an order: which, as is the custom in other states, to raise on the ship a flag-. The king ordered to ask him, the butler, which is the custom in his country. Thus, the Dutch tricolor flew over -Orly-. According to another version, in 1693 Peter I ordered a Dutch-built frigate in Amsterdam. In 1694, when it arrived, the Dutch red-white-blue flag was flying on its stern, so the Tsar decided to declare it the trade flag of Russia. Soon, the Russian white-blue-red flags successfully misled the security of the Baltic Sea ports. They were simply confused with the Dutch&#8230; The basis of the modern Russian anthem is the song -Hymn of the Bolshevik Party-, which was written in the 1930s and glorified by Stalin. It was this work that later became the basis of the anthem of the USSR, which Putin returned with cosmetic changes in 2000. The author of the melody of the Bolshevik national anthem is the well-known plagiarist Oleksandr Alexandrov. Therefore, it is not surprising that this melody also turned out to be stolen, like everything else in Russia. The piece, which has now become Russia's national anthem, used a chord sequence from the -Canon in D major- by German Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel. Although, it is possible that Alexandrov took it from the later work of the Ukrainian composer Mykola Lysenko -Epic Fragment-. <iframe loading=-lazy- title=-Mykola Lysenko.

This song became popular during the Soviet-German war under the name -Holy War-. As we can see, Russia does not have its own coat of arms, flag and anthem. She stole them like everything else.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/krychushhi-kradizhky-derzhavy-fejk-koly-i-v-kogo-rosiya-vkrala-svij-gerb-prapor-i-gimn/	2025-01-31T20:22:23-08:00
Zradophilia Undoes, or Why Video Confessions About Mass Waste From Positions Is Fake	Another -investigation- of the Kremlin's fake agents is the -sensational confession- of the Ukrainian military about the alleged lack of rotations and massive waste from positions. A deepfake video, where some unknown fighters in -pixels- complain about the command, is already circulating in the Russian public. In the video, you can see a group of -Ukrainian military personnel- (although half of them wear Russian-style armored personnel carriers), who complain to the camera: -We have been sitting here without rotations for a year, we are not allowed to leave,- -The command has abandoned us,- -The Armed Forces of Ukraine is falling apart, guys just go-&#8230; One of the -fighters- even declares that his unit is -forced to leave their positions- because -they were betrayed.- 1. Deepfake - but not deep The voices of the characters in the video are superimposed on a separate track, in some places the desynchronization of lips and sound is visible. The conclusion is that either the Russians took an old video and re-edited it, or they used artificial intelligence, but again -saved-. 2. -Fighters- without faces and with strange chevrons Everyone in the video has their faces covered - some in balaclavas, some just in the shadows. But something else is interesting - one -military- unit has a chevron on his sleeve&#8230; up a drigue. Another one has it sewn on the other way around. 3. Phrases that the Ukrainian military will never say: -They have left us, no one is changing us- - the Ukrainian military clearly understands the system of rotations, and it is unlikely that they will -complain- about it to the camera for TG channels. -The command abandoned us- - the Ukrainian army is famous for the fact that the commanders fight alongside their subordinates, unlike the Russians, where the -mob- and the commander are two different castes. -We have nothing to fight- - well, except for the tens of thousands of drones, Leopards, artillery, and MSRW that somehow destroy Russian equipment every day. 4. Why are there -no rotations-? For some reason, the Russians do not explain how -the military is sitting without rotations- when literally every day there are official videos about the rotations of units in different areas of the front. But who cares about real facts when you can invent another betrayal? Russia is again trying to attack not only with drones, but also with fakes, but, as always, in a clumsy, primitive way and with a lack of understanding of how the real Ukrainian military works. Zradophilia is canceled, the video is in the furnace, and thanks should not be given to Russian fake generators, but to our infantrymen, artillerymen and drones, who do everything every day so that Russian mobs no longer have to -complain- about anything. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/zradofiliya-skasovuyetsya-abo-chomu-video-ziznannya-pro-masovi-vidhody-z-pozyczij-cze-fejk/	2025-01-31T20:01:29-08:00

As ArmiyaInform correspondent reports, Lieutenant General Ivan Havrylyuk, First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, announced this during a briefing on January 31. -I, as the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, whose authority does not include the function of procurement at all, but due to the great failure and the understanding that many things will not be completed, I had to take about 30% of my official time, starting from September 2024, to focus specifically on the areas of procurement of lethal weapons. And at the end of 2024, the problem turned into a media problem in general, and later into the next plane. Not in relation to the structure as an agency, as a state enterprise, but in relation to the person of the head of this agency,- said Ivan Gavrilyuk. He emphasized that two state agencies will continue to function in Ukraine: the State Rear Operator and the Defense Procurement Agency. -Today, the budget of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is almost 80% of the budget that goes to the Security and Defense Forces. This is about 1.5 trillion hryvnias in total. From this resource, more than 400 billion was allocated for the purchase of weapons, military equipment, as well as for repair and maintenance,- said Lieutenant General Ivan Gavrylyuk. Ivan Gavrilyuk emphasized the importance of uniform and timely supply of resources for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -We cannot allow a decrease in the monthly provision of the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This is necessary to maintain the front line, stabilize it and create conditions for further actions that will bring us closer to the big goal — victory over the Russian Federation,- said the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine. He also emphasized that any involvement of the state in internal disputes will only delay the achievement of this goal. According to him, the more Ukraine is distracted by various -showdowns-, the more distant the victory will be. As ArmiyaInform wrote, on January 31, the MOU officially announced that from the position held the director of the SE -Defense Procurement Agency- Maryn was dismissed Bezrukova. Arsena Zhumadilov has been appointed temporary acting director.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/zmina-kerivnycztva-agencziyi-oboronnyh-zakupivel-zastupnyk-ministra-oborony-poyasnyv-prychynu/	2025-01-31T11:53:18-08:00

According to the investigation, the suspect sought out a conscript who wanted to leave the country during the war and promised to help with a transfer to Romania for $4,000. It has been established that he ordered the man to arrive in Prykarpattia, and from there ensured his delivery to the border town of Zakarpattia Oblast and settlement in one of the recreation complexes. In order to implement the plan, he involved several more accomplices, materials related to which are allocated in a separate proceeding. According to the developed plan, one of the accomplices was supposed to take the -client- to the border, and the other - to take him on foot through the area he knew well, past the checkpoints. The settlement, according to the agreements, was supposed to take place after the success of the illegal device. Law enforcement officers documented the criminal activity of the specified persons, and they themselves were detained on the way to the starting point. At present, precautionary measures have been taken against all those involved.

The enemy is trying to manipulate public opinion in the temporarily occupied territories, in particular through newspapers that contain distorted information about Ukraine. It is noted that, although such printed publications as Novorossiya and Gorlovka are not popular among the local population, the occupiers have intensified measures to spread propaganda. Since the beginning of 2024, they have been trying to impose narratives about -Russia's inevitable victory-, -protection of the Russian language- and -social assistance to its members- on the residents of TOT. Most of the publications in these publications contain outright fakes aimed at discrediting the Defense Forces of Ukraine and justifying the aggressive actions of the Russian Federation. Ukrainian military, analysts, and law enforcement officers continue to document cases of information terror and the fight against Russian propaganda. As reported by ArmyInform, the situation with the disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW) has reached a critical limit in the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region. The occupation administration of the Russian Federation did not provide the normal functioning of the garbage collection and processing system, which causes increasing dissatisfaction among the local population.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/tak-starayutsya-a-nihto-ne-chytaye-gazety-novorossyya-ta-gorlovka-ne-populyarni-na-tot/	2025-01-31T11:44:30-08:00

According to reports, the attacker turned out to be a 33-year-old local resident, recruited by the FSB through social networks. -He was preparing coordinates for Russian missile and drone attacks in the region.

The kingdom of waste: the garbage crisis is worsening at the TOT of Donetsk region due to the inacti...	About reports Center of National Resistance. As it is noted, the waste disposal system during the years of occupation actually failed due to lack of proper maintenance. The occupiers not only do not support its functioning, but also completely ignore the problems in this area. The lack of separate garbage collection, the lack of specialized recycling enterprises and the chaotic accumulation of waste caused an environmental disaster at TOT. The situation is aggravated by an acute shortage of personnel in communal services, as a significant part of the workers was forcibly mobilized by the Russian army. This is another proof of the occupiers' indifference to the lives of local residents. The main goal of the Russian Federation is maximum exploitation of the region's resources and complete control over the population. According to the Center of National Resistance, the deliberate neglect of the communal sphere and forced mobilization is a direct violation of the Geneva Convention on the Protection of the Civilian Population in Time of War. As ArmiyaInform reported, the Kremlin is building dens in the occupied territories: a Rosguardian who -crushes- drug dealers was exposed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/korolivstvo-vidhodiv-na-tot-donechchyny-zagostryuyetsya-smittyeva-kryza-cherez-bezdiyalnist-okupantiv/	2025-01-31T10:51:12-08:00

Yes, Russians from the Bryansk region are so afraid of swindlers and marauders from their own army that not only do they not want to help them in any way, but they don't even want to open their doors to these -heroes-, preferring to hide from them in their homes. -They walk elegantly, it seems that they are with some kind of Perm. Let us remove your fingers. Themselves dressed in uniform&#8230; They are robbing! That's why the hell knows what it is. It is better to sit closed. Do not open to anyone, even in the uniforms of these soldiers,- complained one of the local residents. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the military of the Russian Federation complains among themselves that mobilized Russians are sent -to m yaso- for refusing the contract.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/nas-grabuyut-meshkanczi-bryanshhyny-skarzhatsya-na-maroderstvo-z-boku-svoyih-vijskovyh/	2025-01-31T10:40:46-08:00

In Transcarpathia, two channels of illegal transportation of people across the border were exposed	About this informs State Border Service of Ukraine. One of the cases occurred on the outskirts of the village of Velikiy Bychkiv. Law enforcement officers detained two local teenagers, 17 and 18 years old, who tried to smuggle a 19-year-old resident of Lviv region to Romania. According to the ferrymen's plan, the boy was to cross the border by swimming across the Tisza River. He paid 11 thousand dollars for this service. The law enforcement officers documented the receipt of illegal benefits and detained the perpetrators in accordance with Art. 208 of the CPC of Ukraine. Another attempt to illegally cross the border was detected near the village of Solotvino.

The radar operator -Kasper- explained why, at the age of 19, he changed his duty at the monitor to t...	His story was shared by in the social networks of the command Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to the 19-year-old fighter, he always dreamed of being like his older brother. -Enter the Kharkiv National University of the Air Force, get the rank of officer. He still does not give up on this dream. He only postponed it a little - until the victory of Ukraine. He says: now he is more needed here,- said the PS of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. After entering the service, the boy became a radar station operator in the tactical aviation brigade, however, when the opportunity arose to join the Ground Forces, he immediately took advantage of it. -The work of a radar operator is interesting and responsible: you carefully look at the monitor, monitor, fix targets, send them to the command post- However, when the order came to rotate to the Rifle Brigade, I volunteered immediately. After all, it is the land that bears the heaviest burden of war today. And I - young, healthy, strong - can and want to be there,- he explains his decision. At the same time, Oleg complains that he has not yet been entrusted with direct participation in assault operations, maintaining forward positions or complex combat operations. -Now our main combat area is Vovchansk. We stand on the second line, and at any moment we are ready to replace our guys, who are directly on the front line. We hold positions side by side with paratroopers. Frankly speaking, there is no division between us. We immediately became a single strong organism, because in the end we all have one common goal,- Kasper shares. In this regard, he advises the youth who are trying with all their might to avoid service, not to be afraid and while there is still time, to undergo at least basic training in medical aid and military affairs. -This is our land, we have nowhere to run. So we just have to fight. Each of us must defend and win!-, the Ukrainian soldier urged. As reported by ArmyInform, earlier in the Air Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the story of the unique aerial combat of the legendary -Beekeeper- was told, during which he destroyed enemy Su-25 without using weapons.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/operator-rls-kasper-poyasnyv-chomu-u-19-rokiv-prominyav-robotu-bilya-monitoru-na-sluzhbu-u-strileczkij-brygadi/	2025-01-31T09:56:26-08:00

The occupiers shelled the center of Kramatorsk for the second day in a row	This time the explosion was less powerful, so there were no casualties or damage. -This morning at 10:30 Kramatorsk suffered an enemy attack - the central part of the city. According to preliminary information, an attack UAV. Fortunately, there were no casualties or damage,- said Oleksandr, head of the Kramatorsk City Military Administration. Honcharenko. The consequences of the explosion and the work of utility workers were recorded by ArmiyaInform. Utility workers work tirelessly. A significant part of the windows that were broken yesterday have already been covered with chipboard plates, and the road surface is being restored at the site of the tear from yesterday's explosion. Today, an enemy munition hit a flowerbed nearby - just a few hundred meters from the previous hit. There are significantly fewer local residents on the street today. Lilia, who is inspecting the house, informs her neighbor by phone that the windows of her apartment, fortunately, survived, despite the fact that today's explosion happened much closer to her house. In Lilia itself, the windows were broken yesterday. The woman complains that building materials to patch broken windows are provided only to those who stay at home. Instead, nothing is issued for the temporary repair of the houses of those who left. Neighbors across the driveway left Lilia the apartment keys, but she can't help them. - They say, leave. Many of my neighbors have moved out and left me the keys to their apartments. And yesterday, building materials were issued only to me, because I am registered here and presented my passport. And what should I do with neighboring apartments? They are not given materials, although I have the keys to the apartments and copies of their documents, she says. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that On January 30, the occupiers shelled the center of Kramatorsk.

Two years under water - our fighters captured a unique trophy from the Russians	The video of the operation was published on January 31 on the brigade's channel. At one time, the Russians abandoned it when they fled. Left with full ammunition. For a long time, the BMP was not visible, due to the water, the level of which in the local pond had risen significantly. But during the fighting, the dam was damaged, the water level dropped, and our fighters noticed enemy armored vehicles actually in the middle of the pond. The idea immediately arose to withdraw the BMP and involve it in the Defense Forces. Preparation for this operation lasted one and a half months. Finally, the BMP was pulled out and after repairs it will start destroying the Russians. -On the one hand, this is a brilliant, thoughtful, heroic operation. On the other hand, if our soldiers had enough modern equipment, perhaps we wouldn't have to risk their lives and health for the sake of such -monsters,- the brigade commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 63rd mechanized brigade made a selection of Russian soldiers, which lit up after meeting our drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/dva-roky-pid-vodoyu-nashi-bijczi-zahopyly-u-rosiyan-unikalnyj-trofej/	2025-01-31T04:03:00-08:00
Change of leadership of the Defense Procurement Agency: official comment of the Ministry of Defense	This is stated in the message at site MOU. -This decision of the ministry is justified by the need to guarantee a stable and continuous supply of weapons and ammunition to the front,- the ministry said. Among the key reasons for the change of the head of the AOZ in the ministry were named: non-fulfillment of planned supplies for the front, numerous remarks of the General Staff regarding poor planning of defense purchases and untimely communication on the part of the Agency, unjustified postponement of supply schedules. Numerous leaks of classified information, which will become a separate subject of consideration by law enforcement agencies, are absolutely unacceptable. Given the significant interest in this case, the Ministry of Defense clarified the legal aspects of the change in the Agency's leadership. On October 11, 2024, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved the nominations of members of the Supervisory Board of the Agency, which included two representatives of the state and three independent members. In accordance with international corporate governance standards, the Supervisory Board had to play a key role in monitoring the Agency's activities, ensuring its transparency and effective management of public procurement in the defense sector. The appointment of the first three members of the Supervisory Board (which is sufficient for its jurisdiction) took place on October 25, 2024 by order of the Minister of Defense. However, for a full-fledged start of work, the members of the Supervisory Board had to conclude contracts with the Agency. After the official formation of the council by the Ministry of Defense, the Agency was unable to ensure proper legal registration of legal relations with all members of the Supervisory Board, which led to a delay in its work. This is confirmed by the fact that the first constituent meeting of the Supervisory Board took place on December 17, 2024 (almost two months after the approval of the Minister's order). On January 20, 2025, one of the independent members of the Supervisory Board announced his resignation from the board. The reason was the lack of proper communication on the part of the Agency regarding the agreement on the details of the contract with him. This situation led to the reduction of the number of members of the Supervisory Board to four, which disturbed the balance and efficiency of its work. In addition, this composition of the Supervisory Board did not meet the requirement of the law that the majority of members should be independent. On January 20, 2025, the Ministry of Defense received a letter from the Chairman of the Supervisory Board with a notice of a meeting on the same day, at which it was planned to extend the contract with the Director of the Agency. On the same evening, the Agency's message about this decision appeared on Facebook, although the Ministry has not yet given its approval. On January 21, the Ministry of Defense received another letter from the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, in which the Ministry was given only a few hours to respond. On the same day, the MOU officially recommended not to renew the contract with the director, justifying its decision with arguments. However, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board did not convey this information to all members of the Supervisory Board. In the evening of the same day, the Agency again announced on Facebook about the -unanimous- extension of the contract. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board of AOZ did not ensure proper communication with its members and the Ministry of Defense. Some council members reported that they had not received the positions of the Ministry of Defense, although they were sent officially. After the Ministry of Defense independently sent its position to all members of the Supervisory Board, the independent members changed their opinion and voted against signing an additional agreement on the extension of the contract with the director. The Ministry of Defense emphasized that the mentioned actions of the Supervisory Board did not comply with the principles of transparency and consistency and contained a number of procedural violations: -It is important that when Maryna Bezrukova was hired by the Agency in January 2024, the contract with her was concluded by the Ministry of Defense, which acted on its own behalf as the authorized management body of the Agency. The law establishes that the change of the contract takes place with the consent of its parties. Therefore, the extension of the contract with Maryna Bezrukova required the consent of the Ministry of Defense,- the MOU stressed. Despite this, on January 23, 2025, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board Yuriy Dzhigyr signed an additional agreement without the appropriate approval of the Ministry of Defense. By this, he exceeded the limits of his powers, defined by the law and the Charter of the enterprise. Considering the unsatisfactory performance of the Agency under the leadership of Maryna Bezrukova, as well as the lack of cooperation and proper communication on the part of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board (representative of the state), the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine decided to replace state representatives in the Supervisory Board. The relevant information was immediately brought to the attention of both the specified persons and the Agency. Thus, only 2 members out of 5 remained in the composition of the Supervisory Board, which made it ineligible. In accordance with the legislation, in the event of the Supervisory Board's incompetence, its powers are temporarily transferred to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. This gives the Ministry of Defense the right to make decisions on the management of the Agency, in particular, on the appointment, dismissal and removal of the director, as well as the appointment of an acting director. -In the conditions of war, effective defense procurement is a key priority of the state. Currently, the Ministry of Defense and the leadership of the Defense Procurement Agency are focused on contracting and uninterrupted supply of weapons and ammunition to the front. Contracting continues daily as usual,- the MOU said. The ministry reported that in the near future, in accordance with current legislation and corporate standards, a permanent head of the AOZ will be appointed. Both procurement agencies of the Ministry of Defense continue their work. In the near future, the leadership will be elected and approved, in accordance with all due procedures. -Ukraine is a state governed by the rule of law, where every citizen can appeal a decision in court. At the same time, all actions must take place exclusively within the framework of current legislation. The Ministry of Defense also turned to law enforcement agencies for an investigation and legal assessment of the actions of the Agency's former leadership,- the statement said.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/zmina-kerivnycztva-agencziyi-oboronnyh-zakupivel-oficzijnyj-komentar-minoborony/	2025-01-31T03:48:21-08:00

According to him, such a result was achieved thanks to a detailed analysis of the enemy's actions.

And also hunt Russians every night and every day with attack drones, destroy shelters, warehouses with ammunition and fuel. -Actually, we do not observe assaults as such. For now, they are trying to pull up and concentrate some forces, moving in small groups of two, three, five people.

To which the soldier replied: -We knew and know only that we need to hold Pokrovsk.- As Olga Reshetylova notes, the new 155th Brigadier General and his deputies created an investigation department, which included representatives of each of the battalions that suffered losses: -The -investigators- are actually minute-by-minute reconstructing the events during which contact with servicemen was lost, with find out what measures were used for evacuation, analyze intelligence reports to understand what could have happened to the missing brothers.- The military ombudsman notes that this is a good example of not a formal approach to conducting official investigations, but a real investigation, which should be implemented in other military units. -True, such investigative departments should not be deployed after the fact, but in real time. In addition to conducting high-quality official investigations, it is also a source of analytics for commanders and a subject for conclusions and work on errors. In the near future, the families of the missing persons from the 155th brigade should be provided with comprehensive information about the situation with their relatives,- Olga Reshetylova wrote in her post. It should be recalled that for the first time information about the problems at -Anna Kyivska- was announced by journalist Yurii Butusov in his investigation -The true story of -Anna of Kyiv-: SBI opened a case regarding the formation of the 155th brigade.- As a result, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrsky said that -paid particular attention to building the capabilities of the unmanned systems unit of the 155th Mechanized Brigade, as well as problematic issues that need to be resolved. I gave all the necessary instructions.- Subsequently, in mid-January, the commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Major General Mykhailo Drapaty, in his message noted that he reported to the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces about the situation in the 155th brigade and the decisions made by the command of the Ground Forces for support of the unit and resolution of problematic issues voiced both by the servicemen themselves and by journalists. -I believe that the 155th brigade named after Anna of Kyiv is promising and will prove itself. Yes, it takes time and effort of many to correct mistakes made during formation. But the newly created Ukrainian brigade named after Anna of Kyiv can and should become a real -Gallic rooster- - a symbol of France: proud, indomitable and ready to fight for freedom,- Mykhailo Drapaty wrote at the time. Recently, the journalists of -Suspilny- visited the 155th brigade. In the video story, Serhiy Tsvetkov, commander of the unmanned systems battalion, told about this: -When PR goes like this (we are talking about public publicity about the situation in the brigade. — Ed.): well, like, the brigade can’t do anything there, then it affects the meetings, people don’t want to inform, they don’t want to help, because, like, there is a missing brigade and can't do anything. But in reality it is not so. We never give up and go only together to victory.- As proof of this, on January 30, the official page of the 155th published a post from the video, where it is noted that the brigade once again captured a Russian soldier. -One of the priorities for the -Anna Kyivska- brigade is replenishment of the exchange fund. Often, capturing an enemy is a more difficult task than destroying it. After all, it exposes to additional danger the person who demands to lay down his arms. It is not the first time that the fighters of the 155th OMBr have been recognized in this kind of operations, regularly demonstrating resilience and ingenuity,- the post states. As the military ombudsman Olga Reshetylova reported in her post, the intensive work in combat units gives a completely different understanding of the course of events: -While discussions were raging in Kyiv about the fate of the 155th brigade, its servicemen continued heroic battles: they went on assaults, fought back and held their positions.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/rozsliduvachi-pohvylynno-rekonstruyuyut-podiyi-vijskovyj-ombudsmen-pro-sytuacziyu-u-155-brygadi/	2025-01-31T00:31:40-08:00

Separately, she spoke about the process of rehabilitation and prosthetics: - It begins when the injured person first finds himself in the hospital. First, it is necessary to understand what exactly the patient needs. If it is an upper extremity, it should be taken into account when choosing a profession. If the lower one, prosthetists find out how much he will walk, what his requirements are, etc. Employees of the prosthetics center go through the entire process with the injured, starting from the examination in the hospital and ending with prosthetics and training on how to use the prosthesis. The director of the Center for Prosthetics and Rehabilitation noted that since the beginning of the war in 2014, they had to quickly create conditions for studying new technologies. — We have mastered electronic prosthetics of upper and lower limbs, in particular sports. The NATO project helped a lot in this, because we managed to train 20 specialists who are currently working all over Ukraine. We studied the technologies that we need in prosthetics for young guys, Antonina Saleeva stressed. Today, many veterans have completed a full course of rehabilitation, and there are even those who continue to serve in combat units.

How the propaganda of the Russian Federation takes away the childhood and life of young people in th...	The militarization of youth in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as in the Republic of Crimea, has been ongoing since 2014, and with the beginning of a large-scale invasion, the unfortunate -military-patriotic- upbringing will also be experienced by the younger generation of Kherson region and Zaporozhye. This -gentle time bomb- is laid by Russian propagandists purposefully and methodically. ArmyInform systematized what Ukraine and the world are doing to counter this; to bring to justice each propagandist personally, and the Russian Federation as a state. In 2016, the Russian Ministry of Defense created a youth -military-patriotic- military organization. In fact, it is a movement that imposes the ideology of Russian aggression and educates the future soldiers of the occupation regime. It includes schoolchildren aged 8 and over. Among other things, children are forced to take an -oath of loyalty- to Russia, promise to -protect its interests- and -cultivate great patriotism.- After that, they are taught fire and tactical training, drone control, etc. In addition to Russia and the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, branches of -Unarmy- also exist in Armenia, Tajikistan, and unrecognized Abkhazia. The occupiers work with the youth not -quietly-, but also generously report on their work on brainwashing young Ukrainians under occupation - you can find a lot about this on the Internet. By the way, the occupied part of Zaporozhye. Only within a few months of 2024 it becomes known that: And this is not the whole list. And this is only part of the information from temporarily occupied Zaporozhye. &#xfe0f; The head of the Center for countering disinformation, officer of the Defense Forces of Ukraine Andriy Kovalenko in the ArmyInform comment states that at least 1.5 million children from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine have already passed through Russian propaganda processing. The Center for Combating Disinformation is engaged in the search and identification of individuals and legal entities involved in the abduction of children on the TOT, their ideological processing and integration into the occupation structures. In addition, the center is working on identifying propaganda networks of the Russian Federation that involve children, identification of propagandists and cultural figures, special services of the Russian Federation, who are involved in these processes. -The Center forwards the collected data on identified propagandists, natural and legal persons who commit crimes against Ukrainian children to the appropriate state bodies for taking measures, including inclusion in the sanctions lists,- says Andriy Kovalenko. Yes, on War&amp;Sanctions site there is a separate section _blank- rel=-nofollow- href=-https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/kidnappers/persons->-Kidnappers-. Everything about those involved in the specified crimes on TOT is systematized there. In particular, according to Kovalenko, we are talking about almost 300 individuals and about 100 legal entities. And all the curators from the Kremlin and the special services of the Russian Federation, who work in the direction of the militarization of children from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, are gathered on the indicated website in the section -Kremlin mouthpieces-. Their names are also known, emphasizes Kovalenko. -In social networks, with the help of Vkontakte or Odnoklassniki, Russians are building a structure of propaganda, and teenagers from TOT are involved in this work. Later, children with leadership qualities are -taken on a pencil-. This is how the Russians cultivate potential agents of influence. And no matter how the Russian-Ukrainian war ends, these processed teenagers will already be agents of influence in the future. And this is a big problem that Ukraine will still have to face,- comments Andriy Kovalenko. Therefore, Ukraine should take preventive steps in order to extract children from the occupation: that is, protect them both physically and mentally, from the point of view of national security, and from the point of view of the strategic future. Thus, the national initiative of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy Bring Kids Back UA was launched in Ukraine. It is aimed at the return of children forcibly deported by Russia. In January 2025, CPD and Bring Kids Back UA presented an analytical report-Militarization of Ukrainian children in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine-. Only an abbreviated version was published for the general public, its non-public part was presented to the Ukrainian special services. Among other things, the authors of the report draw attention to the fact that the militarization of children on the TOT poses a threat to their very lives. -The involvement of children in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine by the Russian side in military formations, training them in combat skills and instilling the ideology of aggression has tragic consequences. Children's participation in hostilities not only deprives them of their childhood and the possibility of a peaceful life, but also often results in the loss of their lives. These actions of the Kremlin are not only a crime against children, but also part of a hybrid war strategy aimed at destroying the Ukrainian nation,- the report says. Analysts also collected specific names of children treated by Russian propaganda, who later joined the ranks of the Soviet Union and were eliminated by the Ukrainian Defense Forces on the battlefield. This is, for example, Dmytro Kotov. In 2015, he graduated from Gymnasium No. 6 in Jankoy. He was a member of the -Junior Army-, this is confirmed by data from open sources. After graduating from the Sevastopol State Technical University, he completed contract service on the large amphibious ship -Novocherkask- of the 197th amphibious brigade of the Crimean naval base of the Russian Federation. On March 24, 2022, Dmytro Kotov died while participating in the Russian Federation's war against Ukraine. Is Ivan Shifman. He studied at school No. 1 in the city of Kalmiuske. In 2019, he joined the ranks of the Youth Army. After coming of age, he joined the ranks of the People's Militia of the Donetsk People's Republic and began serving in the First Separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Russian Federation. Since the beginning of the full-scale war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, he has been a participant in hostilities in the settlements of Starognativka, Granitne, Maloyanisol, Zaytseve, and Rozivka of the Donetsk region. On April 14, 2022, he died on the battle line near the village of Novobakhmutivka, Donetsk region. Is Ilya Moskvitin. He was also a member of the -Junior Army- unit that operated on the territory of the temporarily occupied Donetsk region. According to the materials published on the page of the movement, on April 14, 2022, Ilya Moskvitin was killed when he was detonated by an anti-personnel high-explosive -Petal- mine. The authors of the report summarize: since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the Russian Federation has intensified the militarization of Ukrainian children in all temporarily occupied territories. And it is used as a tool to accumulate mobilization reserves of the enemy army. -These actions show, in particular, that the Kremlin has no intention of stopping the war against Ukraine and the Ukrainian people,- analysts emphasize. Analysts single out several means of countering the militarization of Ukrainian children. In particular, it is necessary to increase international pressure on the Russian authorities through additional sanctions against organizations and individuals involved in the militarization of children in the Russian Federation. In addition, it is worth creating global monitoring mechanisms for such violations. It is important to intensify cooperation with humanitarian organizations to finance programs of psychological rehabilitation, social adaptation, and training of specialists for the reintegration of children. It will also be appropriate to develop educational initiatives to prevent similar crimes and create a platform for coordinating the actions of international and national structures in the field of child protection.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/yak-propaganda-rf-zabyraye-dytynstvo-i-zhyttya-molodi-v-okupacziyi-i-chomu-ukrayini-vazhlyvo-protystoyaty-militaryzacziyi-na-tot/	2025-01-30T20:53:37-08:00
Who cares about Oreshnik: the expert named the systems capable of stopping Russian terror	Which countries have a system capable of countering Oreshnik? But do we have the resources to create our own anti-missile system of the same level? Military expert Petro Chernyk answered these questions. Oreshnik is a very serious missile system. the Russians present it as incredibly new, but in fact it is far from the case. So what is it? First. This is an old RSD-10 -Pioneer-, which was developed since 1976. This is a pretty serious system. Up to 5,000 kilometers - the task of shocks. The speed of the acceleration units of each is within the limits of 10 thousand kilometers per hour. This is classic atmospheric ballistics that reaches its target at a very high speed. the Russians claim that at the moment there are up to 36 combat elements in the Oreshnik booster unit. But there is a serious point here: it is highly doubtful that there is an explosive. Most likely, this is the kinetic part, because when any body is accelerated to such a speed, even a kilogram of nuts at such a speed will release more energy than one kilogram of TNT equivalent. And if you look very carefully at the single strike (we are talking about last year's strike on the city of Dnipro - ed.) that took place, you can understand the following: from the look at how these combat units came, it is very doubtful that they had any quality. Because a lot of light is clearly visible in the video. So friction light is generally combustion. It is doubtful that the Russians struck a real hard blow. The second system from which the so-called Oreshnik could grow is the RS-24 Yars, its lighter part. Is it possible to knock it down? It looks like neither the MIM-104 Patriot nor the SAMP/T system can handle it at the moment. But to claim that this is impossible at all is also not entirely correct. The Americans have a simply fantastic THAAD system, designed to shoot down just such ballistic targets. This system is atmospheric, it works beyond 200 kilometers. But there is a nuance. One machine costs 2.5 billion dollars. Yes, yes, I was not wrong. This is for one car. And the calculating machine is $600 million. Americans can afford it. And the only country that could afford to buy it is Saudi Arabia. True, there is some optimism. The Americans made the Typhon launcher, literally in 2024 they brought it into service. First of all, this system is designed to fire such a beautiful missile as the BGM-109 Tomahawk. But the package also includes the same launch container: it can launch the RIM-161 Standard Missile 3. This is exactly what an anti-missile is. They were developed against such ballistic weapons. There can be optimism for us if our American allies come to the conclusion that it can be handed over to Ukraine. And it is necessary to look objectively in the direction of developing own systems. Let me remind you that out of more than 30 heavy intercontinental ballistic missiles developed by the Soviet Union at one time, two-thirds were developed in our country at Pivdenmash. That is, the technological potential is there, the scientific potential is there. Only apply intelligence, apply engineering thought, apply financing. I am more than sure that there can be an own strategic anti-aircraft missile system that can cope with what is called Oreshnik. Although, for the sake of justice, it must be stated that at this very moment we really do not have such complexes yet.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/komu-oryeshnik-po-zubah-ekspert-nazvav-systemy-yaki-zdatni-zupynyty-rosijskyj-teror/	2025-01-30T20:44:22-08:00
An unexpected sensation: the deepfake taught Ukrainian soldiers to fear and surrender	Well, the algorithm was probably trained on their -mobs-, because such logic is foreign to the Ukrainian army. On the front lines, everyone knows very well: rotations are indeed difficult, delays happen, but what happens for sure is hard counter-attacks instead of -organized retreats- to the camera. And now to the details that once again betray the masters of propaganda: So if you see a new -incriminating video- on the Internet, where -military forces- for some reason speak in the voices of bots and look as if they were drawn by a drunk neural network artist - feel free to laugh. Because the only thing that really leaves the ground after such fakes are the remnants of the reputation of Russian propagandists.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/nespodivana-sensacziya-dypfejk-navchyv-ukrayinskyh-voyiniv-boyatysya-ta-zdavatysya/	2025-01-30T20:29:39-08:00
The combat horse of the Defense Forces with an interesting history: on the battlefield is the Pinzga...	As told then our agency, in the acquisition of the first batches of these cars were invested by both businessmen from the -citizen- and a former entrepreneur who at that time was already serving in the Ukrainian army, but continued to inform the army while remaining incognito. Two SUVs from that batch served in the combat brigades of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the rest were sent to other branches of the military. Subsequently, a few dozen more machines were transferred from Britain, which began to work both as tractors and medevacs, and as deep reconnaissance, support and communication vehicles. Therefore, in the present material, we will pay tribute to the -Pintzgaurs-, or as our soldiers nicknamed these armored vehicles - -Pintzam- and we will recall both the history of their creation and deal with some technical characteristics. The concept of this SUV was developed at the beginning of the 60s of the last century by Erich Ledvinka, the son of Hans Ledvinka, who went down in history as the engineer of the legendary Czech Tatra design. The car was built in the late 1960s by Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Graz, Austria and named after the Pinzhauer, an Austrian horses. It became popular with military buyers and remained in production throughout the rest of the century. In 2000, the rights to the armored car were sold to Automotive Technik Ltd (ATL) in Great Britain. ATL was subsequently acquired by Stewart &amp; Stevenson Services, Inc. in 2005; in May 2006, Stewart & Stevenson became a subsidiary of the aerospace and defense group Armor Holdings, Inc. A year later, Armor Holdings was acquired by BAE Systems plc. -One that provides rock-solid reliability and true go-anywhere ability!-. This was the description given to this -grasshopper- by the British military. In the basis of the design of this car, instead of a frame, a large backbone tube is used, which is lighter and stronger than a conventional frame for the driver. And the most important thing is that not only the drive shafts pass inside this pipe, the gearbox and transfer case are integrated there. Thus, all these units are shockproof. The car also has an original independent suspension. Thanks to this design, Pinzgauer has earned a reputation as a reliable off-road vehicle. The capabilities of the civilian unarmored versions of these vehicles were better than those of the Hummer or Land Rover Defender in some situations. The armored version received an additional 3 tons of weight, which to some extent affected the passability. Pinzgauer Vector with a 6×6 wheel formula, namely, such armored vehicles arrived in the first batch to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, quickly developed for the needs of the British military in Afghanistan. As experts from the Dutch defense portal, the Army Recognition Pinzgauer Vector was developed and put into mass production in less than nine months under an expedited contract awarded by the then Defense Acquisition Agency (DPA) to meet Urgent Operational Requirements (UOR). The Pinzgauer Vector PPV (Protected Patrol Vehicle) 6×6 is an armored version of the Pinzgauer 718 light tactical truck. The armored vehicle was produced from 2007 to 2009. The machine was equipped with a new armored body developed by BAE Systems Land Systems. It is believed that this machine has the maximum level of protection for its weight category - Kevlar armor is actively used here, in particular on the floor, and multilayer armored glass is installed in the cabin and rear doors. The machine provides protection against fire from small arms and fragments of artillery shells. The armored floor provides better protection against explosion and rollover, and the case is equipped with a reflective coating to help control temperature. The design of the Pinzgauer Vector is similar to a light truck with a two-crew cabin in the front and a landing compartment in the back, which accommodates four soldiers who can quickly enter and exit the vehicle through two doors at the rear of the vehicle. However, as the experience of using these machines shows, in some armies of the world, up to 12 soldiers were placed in the landing section. Each of the landing doors is equipped with a viewing unit to provide a view of the rear of the vehicle. The roof also has two large hatches that will allow two crew members to have a good all-round view. The Pinzgauer Vector is equipped with a 10 hp diesel engine. It can travel at a maximum highway speed of 105 km/h with a maximum range of 700 km. The weight of the car is 4400 kg, the maximum payload is 1600 kg. If we talk in more detail about the engine and transmission of this armored car, in the mid-1980s, more powerful 6-cylinder in-line diesel engines with a capacity of 109 hp began to be installed on the Pinzgauer instead of the gasoline 4-cylinder engine from Volkswagen with a capacity of 88 liters. The new engine practically did not fit into the engine compartment, so these versions received a characteristic -hump- in the front part. Later versions received a 2.5-liter 5-cylinder turbodiesel engine with a capacity of 120 hp. with ZF automatic transmission. The engine met Euro-3 standards. The 145-liter tank was enough for the claimed 700 km of mileage. Different versions of the Pinzgauer had different top speeds: for the Pinzgauer Vector PPV 6×6, 105 km/h is declared. As for the specifics of the Pintsa chassis, depending on the configuration, its ground clearance can reach 40 cm. The machine has large amplitudes of suspension travel up to 20 cm, differential lock (separately for each of the three axles), traction control system. Minimum distance between front and center axle. Such geometry provided tremendous opportunities for overcoming off-road conditions. The car has short front and rear overhangs, that is, it feels free on the asphalt. Early versions of the Pinzgauer had drum brakes on all wheels, which had to be disassembled and cleaned after forcing a deep ford because they would clog and lose their effectiveness. New disc brakes are installed on more modern versions. RunFlat tires are used. These vehicles are capable of towing trailers up to 5000 kg on-road and up to 1800 kg off-road. Among the interesting design features, it is worth noting the presence of an obstacle-setting device installed directly during the production of the machine, which counteracts improvised explosive devices. Incidentally, it should be noted that such all-terrain vehicles were supplied to the armies of about 30 countries. In particular, Austria, Bolivia, Great Britain, Venezuela, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Oman, Pakistan, Serbia, Slovenia, Switzerland, and later Ukraine. If we compare this Austro-British -horsefly- with machines of a similar class that were inherited by the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union from the Soviet army, then we are probably talking about the UAZ-452 - a car that occupies an intermediate level between a jeep and a truck. However, there can be no further comparison in the conditional classification: -Pinz- in all parameters is several heads higher than that miracle of the Soviet automobile industry.

-Unskilled hands do not hurt-: how a logistics officer ensures the battalion's combat effectiveness	The story of the fighter was made public on page 46 of a separate airmobile brigade of the DSHV. One of the vivid examples of his work is the restoration of the damaged Husky armored car during the battles near Robotyn. Despite the shelling and difficult conditions, -Smart- together with his guys was able to repair the car right on the position, which allowed it to be later evacuated and returned to the formation. -They literally forced her to puta on the position, under Robotyn,- Oleksandr recalls. — Even here, half a hundred meters away, the -Leopard- rolls into position, and we twist the nuts. To the accompaniment of the battle, we did not even hear him appear. He shot and rolled away. The enemy begins to cultivate the territory in response. Everything around is on fire. And we have nowhere to go, the task must be completed. And the car was restored to a condition where it could at least be towed on a trailer. Later, she was evacuated, and after a short repair, she returned to service.- According to -Umnogo-, his team is able to repair any equipment, even foreign ones. They find spare parts all over the world, turn to volunteers and even make parts themselves. -We had a problem with the fan on the Humvee. Tried on a tractor, reground, digested, adjusted&#8230; And it's still going. A clumsy person's hands don't hurt,- Oleksandr jokes. Thanks to -Umny- and his team, the time to repair equipment has been significantly reduced. What used to take hours or even days is now done in minutes. -For example, what used to take five hours to repair is now done in 20 minutes. What used to take a day is now just three hours,- says Umnyi. Oleksandr believes that the main thing in work is responsibility and constant self-improvement. He demands the same from his brothers. -Development, self-improvement, responsibility- is the motto of -Smart-, which helps him and his team to successfully perform their tasks and ensure the combat capability of the 46th brigade. As reported by ArmiyaInform, FPV-group bomb technician Ilya with the call sign -Murena- worked as an inspector of tactical-operational response of the patrol police of Kyiv before the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, but very quickly learned how to equip ammunition, -so that they explode before in the face of the Russians-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/u-nevmilogo-ruky-ne-bolyat-yak-oficzer-logist-zabezpechuye-boyezdatnist-bataljonu/	2025-01-30T11:52:54-08:00
How do the mobile baths of the Armed Forces of Ukraine work and how do they differ from Russian ones	As the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine explain, it allows soldiers to maintain cleanliness even in the most difficult conditions, such as a training ground, a field camp, or even a combat zone. -This is especially important in winter, when the lack of normal conditions for washing can be dangerous to health,- the military said. According to them, the mobile bath and laundry complex (MLPC) is quickly deployed and quite easy to use, since all it needs is free space for installation, water and electricity. But how does the Ukrainian MLPK differ from the trophy field bath of the Russians, see in the plot.

For this, he involved a local law enforcement officer,- the report says. According to the investigation, the first client was to be registered as a driver of an international route bus for $18,000, but after receiving an advance in the amount of $10,000, the dealers were detained. Currently, criminal proceedings have been initiated against them under Part 3 Art. 332 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. The sanction of the article provides for punishment in the form of deprivation of liberty for a term of up to 9 years.

Previously, he worked in the Federal Service of the Russian Federation for the control of drug trafficking, and after its liquidation, he transferred to the Russian Guard. Experience in -covering- the drug business helped him take the position of head of coordination of anti-narcotics commissions. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, Yukhman not only organizes the activities of drug dealers, but also receives a regular salary from them. The Center has at its disposal the personal documents of the occupier and his family, as well as evidence of his criminal activities. The collected materials are used to form an evidence base that will allow Yuhman to be held accountable for crimes against the Ukrainian people.

As reports the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Staff Sergeant Ihor Zova once encountered such invaders , who is currently defending his native Kharkiv Oblast and has already managed to get injured, and before the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, he worked for a large company and had a quiet civilian life. -I was born in a family of military medics. More than 20 years ago, he began his adult life with service in the anti-aircraft missile regiment. But already in the 2000s, he said goodbye to the army, as he thought then, forever. And here I am again. Came to serve in the radio engineering battalion of the Air Force. When the need arose, together with his brothers, he came to the aid of the Ground Forces, because, after all, we all have the same goal!- he explains his motivation. And somehow, during a combat mission, a whole group of enemy soldiers fell into the hands of Zova and his comrades. -Got into position. The first explosion causes a small earthquake. Zova rhetorically asks his comrade: -When do you think we should expect the next one?- Less than a minute has passed. Swarms of drones overhead. But the soldiers are determined not to give the enemy even a meter! That's why they are entrenched, keep the defense- - said the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And already in the evening of the next day, a group of the enemy came to their positions. -The task is clear: destroy the enemy or make him surrender. The main problem is the unknown: what weapons do they have, are they guided by drones? Therefore, they decided to act decisively and in the most coordinated manner. -On your knees! Captivity is the only reasonable way out for you!- shouted Igor. The three occupants fell to the ground in confusion and immediately agreed. They were sure that they were going to their own. And the offer to surrender was met with joy,- the military said. According to Ihor Zova himself, this became a good motivation for his battalion, and later 12 more invaders were captured by his comrades. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukrainian soldiers met a -rare type of occupier- in the Siver region, who after the elimination of his henchmen had the sense to surrender.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/poloneni-rosiyany-ne-pryhovuvaly-radosti-shtab-serzhant-zova-rozpoviv-yak-zmusyv-zdatysya-czilu-grupu-okupantiv/	2025-01-30T11:09:32-08:00

The government is currently negotiating with suppliers in Sweden and Europe for the supply of priority equipment, such as artillery and drones, Kremlin ministers said. In total, the aid package announced by Paul Jonsson consists of eight components, the largest of which is various purchases of the latest equipment, mainly from Swedish and other European defense industries, to be transferred to Kyiv. In particular, it includes: As reported by ArmyInform, Lithuania transferred a batch of MANPADS and missiles to Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/shvecziya-ogolosyla-najbilshyj-paket-vijskovoyi-dopomogy-dlya-ukrayiny-na-12-mlrd/	2025-01-30T08:36:00-08:00
Documents confirming the Ukrainian past of Kurshchyna were presented in Kyiv	In particular, the exhibition opened on September 6 and was dedicated to the beginning of the operation of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation. As Yurii Savchuk, general director of the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War, noted, -most of the materials presented at the exhibition were introduced into scientific circulation for the first time. They were unknown not only to the general public, but also to a narrow circle of specialists. The catalog contains 72 documents and is self-sufficient and important, because these materials will forever remain in Ukrainian historiography, in the formation of our knowledge about this region.- SBU Major General Yulia Laputina, candidate of psychological sciences, emphasized: -Today is a significant event, because in the conditions of asymmetric war, where the parties are different in terms of resources, physical strength, and military strength, strategic communications are very important as a tool for countering asymmetric threats. For many centuries, Russia manipulated history, hid the true facts, and people did not know their identity for generations. And today we are talking about the fact that Ukraine, as a nation of free people, must convey the historical truth to the world. We do not manipulate - we prove real facts.- According to Doctor of Historical Sciences, Director of the Central State Archive of Higher Authorities and Administration of Ukraine Larisa Levchenko, all 72 documents from the catalog have been translated into English. This ensures their availability not only for Ukrainians, but also for a foreign audience, so that the world learns about the situation in which ethnic Ukrainians found themselves in these lands. The catalog, like the exhibition, consists of three sections. The first section covers the 17th-19th centuries and introduces the history of the Ukrainian colonization of the Kursk, Belgorod, and Voronezh regions from the second half of the 17th century. The head of the State Archives Service of Ukraine, Candidate of Historical Sciences, Anatoliy Khromov emphasized: -The story of this exposition of the exhibition should begin with the process of settlement of Ukrainians in these territories and the formation of a coherent, homogeneous ethnographic, cultural, economic and military region, which historically belonged to Ukraine. In addition to the modern Sumy and Kharkiv regions, it also included significant parts of Voronezh region, Kursk region and, in fact, all of Belgorod region. It was on this territory that five Cossack regiments were located - Sumy, Okhtyr, Kharkiv, Izyum and Ostrogoz, founded by immigrants from Dnipro Ukraine.- Documents show that in the middle of the 17th century, this area was settled by the natives of the Hetman region - Circassian Cossacks. They came to lands that were uninhabited before, which is also confirmed by Russian imperial documents. In particular, sub-ensign Bobovnikov reported in his report that -people from the Hetman region settle on the wild steppes and create cities there, and live separately from the Russians.- The exhibition presents census books, which testify that these cities were inhabited mainly by Ukrainians. In fact, Kurshchyna and north-eastern Slobozhanshchyna were Ukrainian lands. However, in the second half of the 17th century, after administrative reforms, despite the demands of the local population to join them to the Slobid-Ukrainian province, these cities were included in the Kursk Governorate under the leadership of Pyotr Rumyantsev-Zadunayskyi. Thus, the Ukrainian territories became part of the Russian Empire. Despite this, for more than two and a half centuries, Ukrainians preserved their national and cultural separateness and did not assimilate with Russians. During the Liberation Struggle, there were attempts to join these territories to the Ukrainian People's Republic, but they were unsuccessful. Therefore, the beginning of the operation of the Armed Forces in the Kursk region can be considered the restoration of historical justice. The incident in the city of Suja, where the Russian flag was shot down by a well-aimed shot, became symbolic. It was demonstrated during the press conference. This step is another confirmation that Kurshchyna is Ukrainian land, and the history of Ukrainians cannot be erased by the Kremlin's manipulations. As reported by ArmyInform, from August 2024 separate units of the 92nd Assault Brigade named after Ataman Ivan Sirk perform combat missions in the Kursk direction. And although the offensive of the Ukrainian defense forces was unexpected for the enemy, it is putting up strong resistance.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/u-kyyevi-prezentuvaly-dokumenty-shho-pidtverdzhuyut-ukrayinske-mynule-kurshhyny/	2025-01-30T08:15:30-08:00

In the 155 brigade, an investigation department was created, which deals with missing people	reported this on January 30 by the Commissioner of the President of Ukraine for Rights Protection servicemen Olga Reshetylova. -Now the -investigators- are actually minute by minute reconstructing the events during which contact with servicemen was lost, finding out what measures were used for evacuation, analyzing intelligence reports in order to understand what could have happened to the missing comrades. This is a good example of not a formal approach to conducting official investigations, but a real investigation of the circumstances, which should be implemented in other military units. However, such investigative departments should not be deployed after the fact, but in real time. In addition to high-quality conduct of official investigations, it is also a source of analytics for commanders and a subject for conclusions and work on mistakes,- said Olga Reshetylova. According to her, in the near future the families of the missing persons from the 155 brigade should be provided with comprehensive information about the situation with their relatives. Currently, the brigade is fighting heavy battles in the Pokrovsky direction. -While discussions were raging in Kyiv about the fate of the 155th brigade, its servicemen continued heroic battles: they went on assaults, fought back and held their positions,- recalled Olga Reshetylova.

The devastating consequences of the Russian shelling were recorded by ArmyInform. The ammunition hit the road surface, causing a hole more than 1 meter deep as a result of the explosion. Large and small fragments were scattered several tens of meters around. In the entrances of multi-story residential buildings located closer to the hole, not a single whole window remained, and in some places the frames were torn out. -There was an explosion - all the windows on the second floor flew out. Both in the bedroom and in the hall, the whole apartment was covered in sweat,- says a local resident. Her high-rise is one of at least six buildings affected. Lyudmila, a teacher of junior classes, who conducted the distance learning class, names the almost exact time of the explosion — at 11:05 a.m. To do this, she usually follows the lesson schedule: -I had the third lesson. He washes the window on the fifth floor. I did not hear the warning sirens - and here the explosion is very loud. I'm sitting by the window right now, there's a desk. Rama survived, only flowers from pots flew at me.- She was really lucky, because the glazing of the balcony of her apartment, as well as the windows of most of her neighbors' apartments, were broken. However, the double-glazed window survived, protecting the woman from glass fragments that could have been fatal. -I didn't want to scare the children,- Lyudmila continues, -but it turned out, of course, that I screamed.- I had to cancel the lesson, I asked the children not to worry, but I still can't calm down myself.- The woman does not understand why the Russian military is hitting civilian buildings where there are no military positions. Later, the same opinion will be repeated by an elderly man named Oleksandr: -The scariest thing is that we don't know when it will come and why. Why shoot at peaceful cities? We cannot understand what it is at all. What do we have here, the troops are standing?- Other residents of the affected buildings complain that many apartments, which now have no windows, have been empty for a long time - people left to escape the war. So it is not known how it will be possible to cover the windows in the abandoned houses with materials that will be provided by the local authorities and benefactors. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the number of wounded in Kramatorsk has increased to 13: Donetsk region under massive shelling.

Ice element: how special forces divers learn to work in extreme cold	Photos of the training of special forces divers were published on the unit's page. The training covered a wide range of disciplines, including diving, firefighting, engineering training, navigation and underwater navigation. Particular attention was paid to practical training of key elements, such as surveying the bottom with the help of a navigation system, searching for objects on the bottom, preparing and using pontoons to lift objects, as well as working underwater with descents and ascents. In addition, divers studied the theory of undermining underwater and surface objects. The commander of the group of divers of the CSP -Omega- with the call sign -Dart- said that the emphasis of the exercises was on practicing movement on watercraft. This included tasks such as convoy tracking and solo, convoy break-up, working out conventional signs, mooring to the shore, rushing to the coastline and reconnaissance from watercraft using unmanned aerial vehicles. Watercraft were also used to cover a group of divers during missions. Winter training has its own characteristics, because the work takes place in extreme weather conditions. Low air and water temperatures lead to rapid freezing of the equipment, which can lead to its breakdown. This, in turn, reduces the time of underwater reconnaissance and task execution. Dart also noted that the Omega diver group works on a wide range of tasks, including surveying water bodies, lifting cargo, demining coastal areas and shores, sabotage tasks, suppression of fire points on the shore and rescue operations. As reported by ArmiyaInform, throughout 2024, servicemen of the Omega Special Purpose Center performed tasks in the hottest areas of the front. Together with other Defense Forces, they took part in dozens of successful operations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/kryzhana-styhiya-yak-vodolazy-speczpryznachenczi-vchatsya-praczyuvaty-v-ekstremalnomu-holodi/	2025-01-30T03:37:18-08:00

If you imagine yourself in Volodymyr's memories, you can feel the hot air that burns like boiling water in a cup of coffee. In front of our eyes are tired soldiers digging trenches with their helmets, and the only source of water is a small lake, whose transparency and sweet taste will be etched in our memory forever. One of the most vivid episodes of those days was an ambush on an enemy column. -We were lying down in the shelters, when the combatant suddenly ordered: -Ah, silence, everyone! -. In a few minutes, we see a VAZ and a KamAZ drive past us, blocked by the military. And then our stocky cook says: -Boys, whore, not ours! -. He was the first to open fire, followed by all of us. Some units survived, including a lieutenant colonel of the Russian army whom we captured,- Volodymyr recalls. The next memory of Volodymyr is the defense of Makarov in March 2022.

Fast and successful: the British army's high-energy laser system is used for the first time to shoot...	As stated in the release published on the official website of the United Kingdom government, soldiers of the 16th Regiment of the Royal Artillery tracked and destroyed several UAVs in flight with a directed energy beam, having demonstrated the effectiveness of the system in real conditions, ArmiyaInform reports. The statement noted that the latest system, using a powerful infrared laser, was tested at Radnor Proving Ground in central Wales. In turn, equipment developer Raytheon UK, part of RTX (NYSE: RTX) Raytheon, emphasized that the tests were the latest phase of the MoD's Ground Laser Directed Energy Weapon (LDEW) demonstration program, in which British soldiers used Raytheon's HELWS, successfully tracking and neutralizing moving air goals -Our high-energy laser weapon system is used in operations around the world, and now the British Army is experimenting with this groundbreaking capability,- Raytheon UK chief executive James Gray said. -The success of this trial is the result of the skill, dedication and vision of our scientists and engineers who have worked with the British Army to help fulfill its commitment to remain at the forefront of technological innovation.- The experiment marks the first time the British Army has tested high-energy laser weapons mounted on armored vehicles, and trained soldiers in the weapons' targeting and tracking technologies. Separately, the British government recalled the fact that, unlike conventional munitions, laser weapons are practically unlimited in terms of ammunition stocks, which means that they can be a cost-effective alternative to some existing weapons. -This ground-breaking technology demonstrates the UK's commitment to remain at the forefront of military innovation,- said UK Defense Procurement and Industry Secretary Maria Eagle. -The successful test of this laser weapon system is a significant step forward in our development of a possible future defense capability and demonstrates British engineering excellence.- The laser was developed through a collaboration between the US Department of Defense, including the Defense Equipment and Sustainment (DE&S) and Defense Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), known as Team Hersa, and an industrial consortium led by Raytheon UK. The Raytheon High Energy Laser Weapon System (HELWS) was installed on the Wolfhound armored vehicle. Our editors spoke in detail about such a practical combination at the project level in one of -wolfhound-osnashhuyut-lazernoyu-zbroyeyu/->materials. This equipment has a command and control interface and can be integrated with wider combat control, radar and surveillance networks. It is adapted to be installed on different platforms according to different work requirements. However, according to the results of combat tests in Wales, for reasons of secrecy, it was not disclosed how long the beam of the HEL system must remain in contact with the target before it is hit. British officials stress that this development has ensured the implementation of the government's plan for change through the rapid development of technology and the creation of a strong national security foundation. Great Britain has tested a powerful new laser weapon from an armored vehicle. Video: HUF HACK Great Britain tested a powerful new laser weapon from an armored vehicle.

This was reported by the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration Artem Lysogor on his page . According to him, the occupation authorities have not paid the workers due funds since October 2015. This shameful fact affects not only those who currently work at these enterprises, but also those who were laid off during this period. People who conscientiously performed their duties found themselves without means of livelihood due to the criminal negligence of the occupiers. The fact that all these enterprises are in the so-called -state ownership- of the self-proclaimed -LNR- is especially cynical. This means that the occupying administration bears full responsibility for this situation. The specialists of the following enterprises were left without funding: -Luhansk Polymetals-, -Gipromashcoal beneficiation-, -Luhanskvougleremont-, -Vtorpromtorg-, -Chemical Government Association-, -Lutuginsky Scientific and Industrial Rolling Mill-, -Yunist-, and -Central Design Bureau of Mechanical Engineering- -Donets-.

Autocivilka for UBD: how to issue a policy	Since January 1, changes have taken place in the Law of Ukraine -On Compulsory Civil Liability Insurance of Land Vehicle Owners-. If previously combatants were exempted from mandatory civil liability insurance, now there is no longer such an option in the law. Therefore, the auto-civilian needs to be issued. Instead, combatants received a 50% discount at the legislative level. At the beginning of January, some motorists were faced with the fact that they could not find companies that would provide such a discount to combatants. However, now the market has already reacted to the changes and the corresponding offers have appeared. The easiest way to find is to use the services of online services that accumulate information from various insurance companies. They have online calculators. Including with an option for beneficiaries. It is necessary to enter information about the vehicle, the volume of the engine, the place of registration and the available benefit (somewhere it can be the item -veteran-, somewhere -combatant-). And the calculator will select program options offered by insurance companies. There are certain requirements and restrictions for receiving a discount, including: Another important point is that the discount is provided for only one vehicle of the insured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/avtoczyvilka-dlya-ubd-yak-oformyty-polis/	2025-01-29T21:04:09-08:00
A conductor in an anti-drone cloak: a senior technician of a separate infantry brigade revealed the ...	The serviceman is 35 years old and comes from the Rivne region. In civilian life (and by profession - ed.) - a teacher of playing wind instruments. At one time, he was also a member of the club and a conductor. Before joining the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, he also worked at a meat processing plant and was an operator of a smoking plant. At the beginning of October 2023, Oleg Targonskyi was already at the training ground, and in the middle of October he was sent to the BZVP in Estonia. Stayed there for 35 days. -Well&#8230; It was different. Another country, learning to survive (laughs - ed). As they say: fell into a wolf pack - you have to live like a wolf. Well, I did: I didn't expect that, without a foreign passport, you could get across the border,- he says with a smile. After his return, he took the position of driver-radiotelephone operator in the 456th battalion of the 141st brigade. Now he is a senior technician in the ranks of the 141st separate infantry brigade. Once, during a combat mission, he managed to occupy lost positions and destroy the enemy's manpower. Our interlocutor does not go into the details of this operation, but reasons as follows: -The assigned task had to be completed, no matter what it cost us. When you think about the fact that you have a wife and children waiting for you at home, there is no other option but to return, because they need you.- If we talk about the secret of success on the battlefield, Mr. Oleg, relying on his own experience, states: -On the battlefield, the skills he acquired from the instructors at the BZVP were very useful. It was not for nothing that I studied something, everything was needed at the right time.- To a traditional question to a military serviceman, whether he is afraid while performing combat missions and, if so, how he copes with fear, Mr. Oleg answers: -Everyone is afraid. But this is war, so there is no choice. Everyone has fear. And during combat sorties - even bigger. But you just put on an anti-drone cloak and you have to be careful: if you don't see the enemy, he will see you.- Victory for Oleg Targonsky will be the day when he wakes up in the morning and hears: -The war is over.- Mr. Oleg's two brothers are also in the army, fulfilling their constitutional duty.

40 soldiers in an armored taxi with a machine gun: the M113 armored personnel carrier showed what it...	ArmiaInform was told about the legendary -Emka- in the armament of the 33rd separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by the battalion's deputy armament commander with the call sign -Pasichnik-, the technical support platoon commander Oleksandr with the call sign -Tyson- and the mechanic-driver Anatoly with the call sign -Vozduh-. The M113 is primarily designed to provide front-line logistics — to bring fighters to and from positions, as well as to deliver everything necessary -to the front-. However, this armored -horse on tracks- can also provide landing and fire cover for infantry during assault operations. - We call them -taxi-. They are fast and reliable for quickly bringing in or picking up people, evacuating the wounded, transporting BC. They can also be used to storm some enemy positions and landings. We have 12.7 mm Browning and Canik machine guns on them. This is very good fire cover during an assault, says Alexander -Tyson-. In the place of the machine gunner in the basic modification of the M113, there are triplexes that allow you to survey the area, so that even before moving into a combat position, you know in which direction you should open fire. The view through them is quite safe and quite good, no worse than the view available from the driver's seat. — The machine gunner needs to climb up to fire. Therefore, he needs to see where we are going, from which side we are landing, in which direction he will have to work now. Thanks to this, when he opens his hatch and grabs the machine gun, he already knows where to shoot, explains the platoon commander. On some -emkas- in general, automated systems are installed that allow you to conduct machine gun fire without climbing up. Being inside the body of the armored car, the machine gunner can control the weapons located in a small turret and fire using the screen and two joysticks. — Now we have such tasks, when these cars go out purely for fire cover. If the Russians press very hard on our positions, our machine will run up, -scoot- with a machine gun on the landings, drive the enemy away and return, - explains Oleksandr. However, most often, M113s work as -workhorses-, delivering everything needed by mortars and infantry on the front lines. For this, their route is calculated in such a way as to cover several positions at once. — The machine can travel a maximum of 70-80 kilometers in one run. To do this, load the car to the maximum and let it go around the -ring- so that it visits several positions. For example, we have mortar units located deeper in the rear than infantrymen. Accordingly, first we go to the mortars and then we go further to the -front-, explains -Tyson-. One such trip usually lasts 1.5‒2 hours. During this time, up to 10 positions can be visited depending on the need. In order to avoid detection by the enemy, it is necessary to drive at night with a night vision device, move at the maximum possible speed and not stay in one place for more than 2-3 minutes. — They work promptly, as quickly as possible, because if the machine stands longer, the enemy will see it from drones. And if the -emka- stands there for a long time, it means that it is unloading and there are positions there, says the soldier. What is dangerous, he explains, is not so much the possibility of hitting the armored personnel carrier itself, which becomes a much more convenient target in its immobilized form, as the unmasking of the positions of the fighters to which the M113 arrived. — We put at risk those people who unload there. Because the machine will go, but the people will stay and then the artillery will start working on them. That is why, on average, there is a 2-3 minute stoppage: the equipment was dropped, unloaded - and on the move, Oleksandr explains the features of using the M113 on the front line. One of the M113 modifications is the so-called -mule-. Instead of an armored capsule, such an -emka- has a platform designed for the transportation of large-sized cargo, which cannot be placed inside a conventional armored personnel carrier. Also, this armored car is slightly longer than the usual one - it has six support wheels instead of five. Already in Ukraine, the -mule- has been improved for the transportation of logs necessary for the construction of dugouts. For this, a structure was installed on the platform, which allows very quickly, almost instantly, to unload the logs delivered to the construction site. — If you just stack the logs on the platform, it will take a few minutes to unload them. And this triangular design allows you to fasten 10 logs on each side with ties and additionally fasten them with wire. You fly to the position, click two screeds and the logs roll down, explains the deputy commander of the battalion with the call sign -Beekeeper-. - Unload lasts 15 seconds. And this can be done by one person - it is enough to jump out onto a platform that is comfortable to walk on. And then quickly the car flew back. Everything is quick, everything is fast. This allows you to minimize the time spent on the -front-, he adds. Clarification about the possibility of unloading the load by one fighter is important, because it will take at least two or even four people to dump logs stacked in the usual way. Such an interesting rationalization solution not only optimizes the process of delivering specific cargo to the front line, reducing unloading time and the efforts of fighters, but also literally helps save lives. After all, where 4-5 fighters (together with the mechvod) would have to take risks for a long time, one can quickly cope. A very important characteristic of the M113 is the speed of movement. The armored car easily moves at a speed of 45-50 km per hour on any terrain. And on a good road it can be accelerated up to 70 km/h. At the same time, the automatic gearbox installed on the armored vehicle allows you not to be distracted by shifting gears. — If there is a good straight road and there is no load on the gearbox, then I put the fourth position and drive. Then I only use the selector to switch - forward, neutral, backward or turn on the spot. There is a special provision for making a U-turn on the spot, says the platoon commander. Even an untrained fighter can learn to operate the M113 in just a few hours. But, of course, tractor drivers and mechanics with relevant experience in driving heavy agricultural or construction machinery are most likely to get into the driver's seat. They are offered to become M113 drivers in the first place. -Emki- are very convenient to manage. On newer modifications, control is carried out with the help of a rudder, on older models there are levers. On the command and staff modification, it is true that you should slow down before turning, on the other hand, on the combat one designed for amphibious landing, you can turn sharply at any speed. — When you turn the steering wheel, one -guitar- slows down, and the second adds more revolutions. On the combat modification, just turned the steering wheel - and the -emka- immediately makes a turn. On older versions, there are levers at all, so it is even easier there - which lever you clamp - in the other direction and turn. They must have caught the Vietnam War in 1967, -Tyson- jokes. In the command and staff modification of the M113, which is shown to the technical support platoon, turning is somewhat more difficult - for this, you need to slow down and only then start the maneuver. Therefore, driving it requires slightly better skills than -combat- modifications. — Everyone can learn to drive the M113, the main thing is that there is a desire. Automatic gearbox, gas, brake and steering wheel. Started the car and drove off. The most difficult task of the driver is to remember the road correctly - where to drive, where to turn, where you can and where you can't get off the road, because there may be mines there, - explains Oleksiy. Good orientation to the local area and the ability to remember the road is the main requirement for the professional suitability of the emka driver. If there are no problems with this most difficult task, then everything else can be taught gradually. — To teach a new mechanic-driver to navigate, he is first put in the machine gunner's seat and driven several times with him to the positions, showing the way. Where you should and can drive in, where you can't, what are the markings for orientation in the locality, -Tyson- continues. — In addition, drone reconnaissance is mandatory. Every day, drones fly over and inspect the roads, because there are, for example, remote mines and they need to be detected. Intelligence is working, a route is laid out on the map, landmarks are determined. Mehvod should be well versed in this, the military man emphasizes. All this information must be well remembered by the driver-mechanic. Also, he must interact well with the machine gunner and the landing group, pay attention to the information from the drone pilots, which comes via radio communication. - To skillfully manage the -emka- is the easiest task for a driver. The main thing is to turn in time between landings, smiles the driver-mechanic with the call sign -Air-. — After the 13th landing, there should be a -clearance- and you have to jump into it. You drive, you count: seven, eight - and here -arrive- next to -babah!-. And already gone astray. Then you don't start counting again, but just look closely at where that -clearance- will be. A special system of tactile commands was developed for communication inside the rather noisy armored vehicle. Hit on the right shoulder - turn right, on the left - left, on both at the same time or in the back - stop. - These are the main commands. When they leave, they agree among themselves in more detail how to communicate. Because it's hard to hear in the car and you can't shout at the driver - you need special signs. In addition, many people drive with headphones, because after 4-5 departures per night, the driver's head simply breaks, says -Tyson-. Inside the armored personnel carrier, it is practically impossible to really hear anything - tank laryngophones for normal communication are clearly lacking. This forces fighters to improvise, negotiating different ways to communicate. — For example, you can agree on some kind of signal to reset the speed before turning or stopping. Run the mechvoda with your hand from the head down to the back. Then he will know that the next signal - stop or turn - is coming soon, says -Air-. Fighters who are eagerly waiting at the positions for the arrival of the emka and listen carefully can hear its approach already 2-3 kilometers away, because the armored personnel carrier is quite loud. The roar of three armored vehicles moving nearby makes you speak quite loudly, and with the approach of one of them even raise your voice to a scream. -Emks- have reliable protection, capable of protecting the driver and the paratroopers from bullet damage from any small arms and debris from close-range explosions of mortar mines and artillery shells. — The armor here is made of aluminum alloy. If somewhere from the side -arrives- from a mortar or artillery, then it withstands shrapnel brilliantly. One of the driver-mechanics said that when he was driving for a landing assault, he saw a machine gunner hitting him from 50 meters away with a PKM, this is a 7.62 mm caliber. And he only heard something rattling on his armor, Oleksandr says. Then the M113 successfully landed the attack aircraft, covered the landing party with fire and calmly returned. In general, says -Tyson-, the armor of the -Emka- is designed to withstand hits from large-caliber machine guns and, most likely, will withstand a direct hit from a mortar mine. Anti-personnel or anti-vehicle mine protection is just as reliable. An anti-personnel mine is capable of causing some damage only to the tracks of an armored vehicle and will not cause any damage to the mechanized vehicle or the landing party, an anti-tank mine will at most partially disable the chassis. — If it hits an anti-tank mine, the crew will, of course, receive aquabarotrauma. And this is when the crew is sitting on that side where the -harp- catches the mine. We have a mine crew that has been blown up by mines four or five times - and everyone is alive, everyone is fine. -Compared to BMP or MTLB, it's -Mercedes- against -Zhiguls-, because there, if you fly into an anti-tank mine, it's a hook for both the machine and the crew,- Tyson M113 compares. The military man has experience working with Soviet armored vehicles, so he knows what he's talking about. Soviet-made armored vehicles are not only less comfortable and protected, but also, based on their design features, they are less suitable for combat missions in the conditions of modern warfare. One of the undoubted advantages over the Soviet armored fighting vehicles Tyson calls the aparel - an inclined plane that opens horizontally in the rear part of the machine. Lowering to the ground, it creates a convenient inclined bridge for landing fighters. — Soviet cars have doors instead. Now, if a normal person is in an outfit, it is difficult to move through those doors even slowly. Because if a normal infantryman goes out, he has a plate carrier or a body armor, RPS with all the results, a first aid kit, stores. Even for me, with my height and 60 kilograms, it is difficult to push through, - jokes Oleksandr. Instead, the armor allows two fighters to freely and very quickly leave the armored personnel carrier or enter it at the same time. To do this, they do not need to make any complicated movements or make special efforts - it is enough to bend a little so as not to hit their head. - You can walk through the wardrobe as if into a room - the door is wide. The man ducked down so as not to hit his head - and freely ran in and out. It is very convenient, the main thing is to shout to bend down. Because it's good that I didn't succeed in height, and there are people who are taller, so they can sometimes hit me with a helmet, -Tyson- smiles. Thanks to the apparatus, it is especially convenient to evacuate the wounded, who can be quickly brought in and taken out even lying down. - It's all time, and for us time is everything. The sooner, the more responsive you are, the better. And if you carry a wounded person through the door, he will get caught there, hit. It will be necessary to somehow return it, check it - this is all an unnecessary delay, - Oleksandr emphasizes the convenience of the device. As additional protection, the M113 is equipped with anti-cumulative screens, grills and superstructures of mostly artisanal production. According to Tyson, they have proven to be a fairly effective defense against enemy FPV kamikaze drones with cumulative charges. — We put this mainly because of FPV drones, because they hang such strong cumulative charges on these kamikazes that they pierce any armor. And this additional protection that we are now welding allows to dissipate the cumulative jet. The charge is triggered at a distance of 30-40 centimeters from the armor - and then it survives, he explains. The military tells how, from the powerful explosion of the FPV drone's screen-detained charge, the debris hit the triplex and almost pierced it through. If the blow came directly into the armor, then there would be no chance to withstand the blow. On the other hand, the deputy battalion commander with the callsign -Beekeeper- speaks less favorably about the protective superstructures on the M113, believing that they only add weight and can hinder the movement of the armored personnel carrier in dense forests. - The best protection is REB. And if the fiber optic works, it won't help either. What can we expect from this screen if there is a contact detonator on the charge of the FPV drone, and the cumulative jet still goes to the armor and can pierce it? he asks rhetorically. He says that in the past, protective lattice screens of rib-mounted steel strips were designed against RPG charges and were really effective. On the other hand, against the powerful cumulative charges of FPV drones, protective grids are powerless in the vast majority of cases. M113 are very convenient to repair, have easy access to the engine. Many minor breakdowns can be repaired in-house not far from the front lines with experienced mechanics, tools and equipment, and spare parts. And it is possible to pull a caterpillar that flew off the wheels from an anti-personnel mine explosion in the field. — If the edge of the -guisli- hits an anti-personnel mine, the explosion can knock out one of the mounts - we call them -binoculars-. When one -binoculars- flies off, the whole -fiddle- can fly off. But if there is a spare mount, then it is very easy to replace it. I installed it, hit it with a hammer, tightened it - and you can drive on,- says Oleksandr. Damage from anti-tank mine explosions is more difficult, as the explosion damages the rollers. -Emka- with such -wounds- has to be dragged 15-20 km away from the front line for stationary repairs. — If it is an anti-tank mine, then, accordingly, there will be some damage to the support rollers. But here, too, the replacement is quite elementary - drive up, unscrew, screw in a new one - and that's it. Everything is very simple, elementary - how to change a wheel on a car. The jack was placed, lifted, removed, placed and that's it, explains the technical support platoon commander. The biggest problem arises only with the availability of the necessary parts. He says that one of the armored personnel carriers damaged in the spring of 2024 could only be sent for repair in December due to the lack of spare parts. - They are very easy and practical to repair. But there is often a problem with spare parts, because you have to wait for the necessary parts from abroad. They are brought from Holland, Spain, America. Therefore, the whole problem is only with spare parts - if they are available, we will repair them quickly, - claims Oleksandr. The standard capacity of M113 - 8 landfill fighters, but if necessary, a armored personnel carrier can take on board and three times more people. Tyson recalls that there were 24 soldiers from the front of the Emca. - But 24 is when it is quite a battle. Although there were cases when even 40 fighters were exported on one car. Then, of course, not only inside, but also from the outside sat on the armor. They became and selected, because it is very difficult for people to go for many kilometers, especially on the marsh - when the big swamp and viscosity of the soil, - says Tyson. The Bagn -Emk- goes great, although there is some dependence on the type of caterpillars installed on a specific machine - with rubber pads or with the presence of special -soil- on both sides of Husley. This is noticed by the -beekeeper-, showing two neighboring M113 on the caterpillar. - This is where Guslya stands with rubber pillows without -soil-, so in the swamp it is worse controlled. And here are the lateral -soil-, which provide better clutch. Therefore, it is better to put such a -mud- caterpillar - the so -called -swamp- on a powerful machine, - he explains. Cuts with purely rubber lining, the military notes, very well show themselves on solid soil and on asphalt, instead, it is better to put such caterpillars with a soil with a soil with a soil or swampy area. In general, M113 armored personnel carriers, like Leopard tanks, proved to be very good. Fighters 33 of the separate mechanized brigade respond mainly to them. They point out that, if possible, good maintenance and spare parts are not new to foreign armored vehicles are quite capable of performing all the combat missions provided for them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/40-bijcziv-na-bronovanomu-taksi-z-kulemetom-bronetransporter-m113-pokazav-na-shho-zdatnyj-reportazh-z-peredovoyi/	2025-01-29T20:35:57-08:00
The Russian Federation invented a new fake about the mobilization of teenagers in Ukraine	the Russian -information troops- decided not to trifle and launched a spiel about a -pilot project- of mobilizing minors, supporting it with fabricated -documents- and panicked headlines in the style of -Zelensky sends children to the front-. It looks as if the Russian propagandists have finally lost themselves in their own lies. Because just yesterday they were talking about -empty military commissars- in Ukraine and -total evasion- of service. And today they are already drawing pictures of how -minors- in uniform are holding back the onslaught of the -second army of the world-. Official Ukrainian laws and realities smash this -throw-in- to the ground: So the only thing relevant to the -pilot project- is the Russians' failed attempts to launch fake -news- without fact-checking. While the Kremlin is inventing fairy tales about Ukraine, Russia itself is passing laws that allow recruiting prisoners into the army, forcing students to serve, and handing out summonses instead of diplomas. Not to mention the fact that 17-year-old boys there not only receive summonses, but if they refuse, they can end up behind bars. So if teenagers are being mobilized anywhere, it is in the Russian Federation, where they are desperately trying to plug the holes in the army for everyone who can still hold a weapon. Russian propaganda is once again trying to present Ukraine in the role of a -military dictatorship-, while it itself sends schoolchildren and prisoners to the front. Well, if you believe their logic, then the next fake will probably be about Ukraine mobilizing babies and arming them with Molotov cocktails. But taking into account the rate of degradation of the Russian IPSO, we will not have to wait long.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/v-rf-vygadaly-novyj-fejk-pro-mobilizacziyu-pidlitkiv-v-ukrayini/	2025-01-29T20:09:31-08:00

Hunting for the disloyal: Kremlin repression in the occupied territories	About this informs Center of National Resistance. It is noted that this -filtering- involves thorough checks of personal data, interrogations and searches. Its main goal is to identify persons associated with the Defense Forces of Ukraine and any manifestations of disloyalty to the occupation regime. Detainees are subjected to psychological pressure, arbitrary arrests and even torture. The occupiers use these methods as a tool of repression and try to establish complete control over local residents. Despite harsh measures, the Kremlin is unable to suppress Ukrainian resistance. On the contrary, the intensification of repressions only shows the occupiers' fear of the indomitability of the Ukrainian population on the TOT. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers in Kherson Oblast naselennya/->introduced new taxes that increase the pressure on the local population.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/polyuvannya-na-neloyalnyh-represiyi-kremlya-na-okupovanyh-terytoriyah/	2025-01-29T11:53:39-08:00
Enemy drones rained down from the sky — UAV hunters covered the Defense Forces in Kurshchyna	Stanislav Krasnov, commander, told about this on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- platoon of the 95th separate amphibious assault brigade. According to him, the Russians are attacking to the -accompaniment- of their artillery, air defense systems, missiles and drones. Each time they fail, and have huge losses, but they come back again and again. However, Krasnov notes, the number of enemy drones has decreased, because UAV hunters have appeared. -I know these guys. Very talented operators indeed. If at the beginning of the operation in the Kursk region, we constantly heard the sound of these wings above us, especially at night, then after such calculations began to work, both our brigade and our allies really became less of them. Artillery strikes are less accurate, anti-aircraft guns are less accurate,- Stanislav Krasnov said. As reported by /a> ArmyInform, Murena showed how he equips his FPV drones to turn Russians into jigsaw puzzles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/vorozhi-drony-posypalysya-z-neba-myslyvczi-na-bpla-prykryly-syly-oborony-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-29T11:49:03-08:00
A local resident who collaborated with the occupiers was exposed in the Kharkiv region	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. According to the investigation, during the occupation of the village An unemployed local resident of Strelecha, Kharkiv district, voluntarily worked for the enemy. In April 2022, during a meeting in a gymnasium, a serviceman of the Russian Federation informed those present that the -people's militia- would soon begin work. The suspect expressed a desire to head the occupying law enforcement agency. True, the -people's militia- was never created, but the person involved actively followed the instructions of the Russian curators. The traitor accepted statements about offenses. He also forcibly checked people's documents. This was necessary to identify the pro-Ukrainian population, ATO veterans, law enforcement officers or their relatives. The defendant performed his -work- in accordance with Russian legislation. Before the deoccupation of the village by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the person involved fled to the territory of the Russian Federation together with the Russian military. The issue of declaring a wanted suspect is being resolved. The pre-trial investigation is conducted by the Head of the SBU Department in the Kharkiv region.

President: Veteran hubs and business programs will grow	About this the head of state declared during the evening address. -I have already instructed to implement some key things with internal funds, as well as to conduct negotiations with European partners. These are programs in the field of energy — in particular, distributed generation and sustainability projects for Ukrainian communities. The second direction is veteran projects. Veteran hubs, support lines, help in creating your own business. The third is the checkpoints at the border, which were built in cooperation with international partners. New modern checkpoints are necessary to accelerate economic activity and increase the transparency of customs operations. This also applies to projects in ports that are directly related to the economic security of the country,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He also emphasized that the government is currently looking for additional internal resources for these programs. In addition, according to the president, there are questions regarding the financing of projects of the Ministry of Health and the field of cyber security. -Instructed to continue the audit of the suspended lines of aid from the US, in particular in the humanitarian, security and social sectors. Our and European activity should be strengthened to support the people while the new American policy continues to be worked out,- the President added. The President reported that the Minister of Energy's report on the state of the country's energy system, its restoration and development was held today. -I am grateful to everyone who works in the energy sector, who does everything possible so that Ukraine can live. Regarding our cooperation with the European Union and neighboring countries: it is important that we maintain a constructive position. We can help partners who need it, and we are grateful to everyone who supports Ukraine. Europeans need this feeling that the common energy market, integrated systems and projects bring real benefits. This is possible only thanks to unity,- the head of state emphasized. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also announced that he had a conversation with the Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen today. -They talked about global challenges and European issues. He thanked Denmark for its powerful support to Ukraine. We really appreciate it. We will develop bilateral cooperation that strengthens not only Ukraine, but also the whole of Europe,- he said.

Alumina embargo: assets of a Russian oligarch worth over 2 billion hryvnias were seized in Ukraine	About this informs the Security Service of Ukraine. This raw material was a key component for the production of aluminum at Deripaska's Russian Rusal plants, which work for the Russian military-industrial complex. Factories make components for Iskander missiles, combat drones and radar systems. The investigation established that the seized products belonged to Deripaska through a controlled company registered in the EU. This company acted as a formal customer of raw materials for further re-export to Russia. At the beginning of 2023, Ukrainian law enforcement officers blocked an attempt to export bauxite and alumina. In addition, in Ukraine, all the oligarch's plants that worked on the territory of the state have already been nationalized. The SBU informed Deripaska in absentia about the suspicion, in particular, of financing the war against Ukraine.

Ruins under new paint: the Russians imitate the reconstruction of Mariupol	About informs Center of National Resistance. However, the renovated housing turned out to be unfit for living. Due to a lack of funding, most renovation works are frozen, and in those apartments that are -officially handed over-, residents are forced to redo everything themselves. According to locals, the walls are made of low-quality material and resemble -paper partitions- that do not meet basic safety standards. The occupiers are trying to pass off these repair works as -help- to the people of Mariupol, although it was their shelling that destroyed the city and people's homes. The same situation is observed in other populated areas under occupation, where instead of real restoration, the Russians create only the illusion of care. As reported by ArmyInform, from March 1 in the temporarily occupied territory of the Luhansk region, the norms of Russian legislation come into force, which significantly simplify the procedure expropriation of land plots from individuals.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/ruyiny-pid-novoyu-farboyu-rosiyany-imituyut-vidbudovu-mariupolya/	2025-01-29T10:53:26-08:00

At one time, the outstanding commander and philosopher Sun Tzu in his treatise -The Art of War- wrote: -A general who knows military operations avoids an opponent with high morale and strikes when the opposing army is demoralized. This is a way to control the spirit,'' the military said. The brigade did not specify what exactly it is about, but the denial was made public against the background of the publication on pro-Russian propaganda resources of a video in which allegedly -fighters of the 155th OMBr of the Armed Forces- are being taken to the front in handcuffs. However, there is no confirmation that there are actually Ukrainian military personnel in the published footage. In addition, both in the video itself and in the credits to it, only the Russian language appears. What's more, even its author admitted that, in fact, soldiers of the 155th Separate Guards Marine Brigade of the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Federation were taken to the front in handcuffs. -The enemy is trying to sow panic and discord in the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine with such simple, but extremely provocative and manipulative plots. But our spirit is steely and strong, like our guns and tanks, with which we destroy the occupier every day and every night. And so it will always be - to our common Victory!

Maritime coalition: the IOU told how 18 states are helping Ukraine to strengthen its fleet	About the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informs. The issue of control over the Black and Azov seas is strategic for the security and economy of Ukraine, because the importance of maritime trade routes for a country that exports raw materials cannot be overestimated. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians work in industries such as metallurgy and agriculture that depend on these routes. Millions of people around the world are consumers of Ukrainian grain and food products. Control over rivers, which serve not only as convenient logistical routes, but also as natural borders between states, is also important. That is why in December 2023 Great Britain, Norway and Ukraine initiated the creation of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities. Its main tasks are to ensure the urgent needs and long-term development of the relevant capabilities of Ukraine, to ensure the freedom and safety of civil navigation, to deter and repel any aggression from the maritime direction. In addition to Ukraine, 18 other states have joined the -sea- coalition - in addition to the leaders, there are also Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Denmark, Estonia, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, the USA, France, Sweden, Portugal, Poland, Romania and Turkey. Finland, Iceland and Canada are contributing to the development of Ukraine's maritime capabilities, but they are not yet part of the Coalition. Australia and Japan are considering becoming members. Activities of the Maritime Capability Coalition are among the least public. At the same time, it is known that the member states of the Coalition provide Ukraine with, in particular: technical staff and technical support for operation and application. Among the things that can be confirmed publicly, the Netherlands and Belgium are handing over three Alkmaar-class mine countermeasures ships to Ukraine this year. Great Britain, in addition to other capabilities, has already transferred two mine countermeasures ships -Chernigiv- and -Cherkasy- in early 2023, which are currently based in British ports. The crews of these ships are currently undergoing intensive training to perform assigned tasks according to NATO standards. The specified set of anti-mine forces is the basis of the anti-mine tactical group, which will directly eliminate the mine threat in Ukrainian waters. The USA, the Netherlands, Canada, Sweden and Finland have transferred a certain number of boats of different classes and fields of application: for search and rescue operations, transportation, reconnaissance and special operations. In Romania, the Coalition created a naval training center for the training of marines of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. On January 9, 2025, the heads of the defense departments of 14 leading states and Ukraine agreed on the road maps of all coalitions. This happened during the meeting of the Group of Leaders of Capability Coalitions within the Contact Group on Defense of Ukraine (-Ramstein- format). As reported by ArmyInform, demining and anti-mine work in the Black Sea continues continuously. The security work of the Armed Forces Navy is at a consistently high level.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/morska-koalicziya-u-mou-rozpovily-yak-18-derzhav-dopomagayut-ukrayini-zmicznyty-flot/	2025-01-29T03:39:54-08:00

A warrior with a thousand faces: Khotabych's path from a peaceful life to the front	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Roman understood from his youth that war with Russia was inevitable. -While still in military service, the officers said: our enemy is not the West, but Russia,- he recalls. Therefore, when the aggression began in 2014, he immediately joined volunteer activities, and later - military service. In 2015, he joined the National Guard of Ukraine and became one of those who formed the -Spartan- rapid response brigade. But in 2021, something told him that it was time to return to the service. So he signed a contract with the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade, with which he repelled a full-scale enemy invasion. -For many, the war began in 2022, for me it was long before 2014,- he says. -Khotabych- went through fierce battles for Mariupol, Novotoshkivka, Kupyansk, Kreminna. The latter was especially etched in his memory: -We conducted combat reconnaissance for weeks, held the defense and stormed in terrible conditions. The most difficult thing was to pull out the dead comrades when the 23-year-old commander was dying before your eyes. When he was wounded, he was taken to a hospital in Dnipro. There he was impressed by an 18-year-old volunteer who, having lost his family in Mariupol, did not take up arms due to religious beliefs, but helped wounded fighters. -I saw real strength of spirit in him,- says Khotabych. After the hospital, he returned to the army because he could not leave the unit without technical support. Currently, he heads a workshop that repairs small arms, equipment and supplies the military with necessary materials. -Who but us?- he says. Thanks to his efforts, the military has an equipped repair base, which greatly increases the combat capability of the unit. -Khotabych- is an example of how a person from a peaceful life can become an indispensable warrior, not only holding a weapon, but also helping the front with his knowledge and skills. As reported by ArmyInform, 28-year-old Oleksandr with the call sign -German- is drona-bomber operator 128 separate mountain-assault Transcarpathian Brigade.

About the raids in the Belgorod Region, the liberation of the Aggregate Plant and the ideology of -M...	- Tell me, please, how the new chapter of your life in Ukraine began? -When I arrived in 2014, I immediately met the future management of Azov during the Euromaidan. In fact, then, right after him, I came to meet with them on behalf of the Russian nationalist underground. We held a meeting there with them, the guys represented -Right Sector-East-, and the meeting itself was at the KMDA. I remember those steps that were splattered with blood, because that was the headquarters of the Revolution. I was immediately surprised by the protesting-looking people, who were clearly armed with pistols on their belts. When I already moved to Ukraine, I immediately got into Azov. From that moment on, I was already active in the Azov Civilian Corps. This is such an organization, which later turned into the National Corps, so to speak, the civilian wing of the Azov Dvizh. I attended the first ideological training school, just as the corn service was created in the summer of 2014, and I joined the regiment on September 1. - Please tell me specifically about your military experience. -My real and serious military experience began in the Russian Volunteer Corps (Red . hereinafter RDC), because everything that happened before that proceeded somewhat differently. Since 2015, I have been in the -Azov- regiment as part of a sabotage and reconnaissance group. We organized ambushes and attacks on enemy strongholds during 2015-2016. At that time, combat clashes were of the order of three times. The rest of the time we were engaged in patrolling, mining, training. Then I ended up in the corporal service of the -Azov- regiment - this is such an educational ideological service that was built into the army system. In 2018, I resigned from -Azov- and started working in Azov youth organizations. These were national wives, which later turned into -Centuria- - an organization that works with youth. A 3rd separate assault brigade also appeared directly from there. I was there and participated in the operation to unblock Mariupol. Later, I took part in some more operations, but the way my service in the RDK took place is completely different. I became a mortar team commander there. It's one thing to fight as an infantryman, not understanding the overall plan, not taking part in certain planning actions. Already directly in the composition of the RDK, I commanded the calculation, and then the unit, understanding the scale, organizing and planning the combat work, because I had a clear picture in front of me of what was happening in the serious directions, where the enemy's losses from our fire amounted to tens and hundreds of 200 them Therefore, I believe that my military career began directly in the RDK. I joined them at the beginning of 2023. — From the moment you were released from the Azov regiment to the start of a large-scale operation, how has your life turned out? in the -National Wives- organization organized by him. Our tasks were to show Ukrainian nationalism with a human face in order to strive for elections and all those things -that are not available in Russia.- I was a lecturer there. A large number of guys who actually went to war from 2022 and became our friends passed through this organization. There we constantly organized trainings and various events, traveled to all the cities of Ukraine, held entertainment events related to shooting, knife fighting, and sports. In that format, I represented the pan-European component of the composition. That is, we had lecturers who spoke specifically about Ukrainian nationalism, and I was more detached from politics, leaning more towards European history. I came up with the -Scythian Power- seminar series, which talked about the Scythian past of Ukrainians and Scythians in general as a civilization that was unfairly forgotten, although it boldly takes its place among the greatest civilizations of the Ancient World. In general, we constantly came up with activities that nurtured the youth with the right values, which later became Centuria. And there I continued this work. As the year 2022 approached, we were already concentrating on the coming large-scale war, because everyone understood that it would happen after all. They conducted trainings and ideologically charged people, why it is necessary to fight and told about moments related to combat work. - Did you come to Ukraine for the first time in 2014? - No, I was in Ukraine for the first time at the end of 2011. Then they came with a concert to Kharkiv. In general, in the past, Kharkiv was the cultural center of Ukraine in our circle. First of all, this is the Kharkiv right-wing scene — a phenomenon known to the whole world, which was important not only for Ukraine, but also for European listeners. It is a beautiful city that was really nice to visit. In general, the bands from Kharkiv had quite a strong influence on me, including thanks to them I got to know the Ukrainian language back in 2004, because I listened to their music. - How did the large-scale invasion begin for you? -I woke up at 10 o'clock when the war was raging everywhere. Got together and immediately went to our base. It was difficult to get there, because there was a column of people fleeing from Kyiv at the exit. I parked the car, brought people who were also walking and were already ready. Then we moved to another building because we thought there might be shelling. Then they began to organize, and the formation of that unit, which later received the name -Azov-Kyiv-, actually began there. —Did you take a direct part in the battles for the Kyiv region? —I became the deputy commander in our unit and I did not take a direct part in the battles. We went to temporary bases and there I was engaged in organizational work. With a submachine gun in my hands, I went to the blockade of Mariupol. Unfortunately, our idea was not implemented, because already on the spot it was not possible to simply break through the first line. — There were moments in Kyiv when everyone was scared. Did you think that this could be your last day and you would die? —I was sure that I would die in Kyiv. Right at 90%. This is my favorite city and it would not be scary to die for it. There were thoughts that we would get out of it in an organized manner if it was surrounded and bombed. There was no direct fear, because my whole life consisted of a struggle, and I cannot devalue my life by giving up the struggle. Yes, no one was holding me, I could cross the border calmly and freely, but I could not do so. I don't see my life outside the Ukrainian dvizh. Yes, if the war goes to Russia, then of course I will continue to fight there. And in general, all my musical and ideological activities, they have always been in Ukraine. I motivated others to war, and then how could I refuse it myself? Did you ever think that we would all die here? Yes, but it is not scary to die for Kyiv, but the essence is primarily in the people. I think it's better to think in terms of people rather than territories. If I thought so, I would not have left Russia, where life is not like that at all. The people of Russia live like poor people: in hardship, bad conditions, injustice, but at the same time they listen to songs about the -great land-. Although that land is not theirs either, that's why people are important. I was with those who are valuable to me and with those ideas that I carried and realized in creativity. - How did the blockade of Mariupol take place? -It was planned for the moment when we had not yet become the 3rd separate assault brigade, but were still the Azov-Kyiv unit. It was early April 2022. We reached Zaporizhzhia, then further along the populated areas and advanced to the positions. I was with the commander of the Centuria. Together we were there on the second line, so we did not see the enemy. The first line was not able to break through and everyone already knows how the course of hostilities went. There was such a story that a tank was driving, in which was the Hero of Ukraine. He was hit, and he climbed out of it, climbed into another tank and went into battle again. this is a truly incredible story that touches the heart. We stayed there for a day, and then had to return to Kyiv, after which we already left for the Zaporizhia direction. At that time, I was working in the media service there. Closer to autumn, the RDK was formed and it became clear to me that I should move there, because all service opportunities will be in the ranks of this unit. Now I have a team with which we can do large tasks, especially when I am assigned calculations from other departments. - Why did you decide to join the RDK in particular? -First of all, the commander of the RDK-is my old friend who was able to do such a great thing and break through all the bureaucratic hurdles. To tell the truth, at first it seemed that this could not even happen. I thought so, because why was this not done back in 2014, after the Maidan. Then many Russian boys came and took part in it. Even then, we wanted to make a Russian corps in order to influence the politics of Russia. In general, the emergence of our organization is connected with specific tasks, which are primarily of a political nature. I know that this war is about the idea of ​​freedom and slavery, that is, people of different nationalities can take one or another position. And fighting for freedom means working with people who choose the position of good. Nothing in our world is static, people can change their views and opinions, it depends on what information field they live in. It is clear to me why they did not work with Russian nationalists before, because this story has always been stigmatized in the world. Nationalists have always been portrayed as stupid and evil people, but the situation has not changed at all. In fact -it is among the nationalists that the largest number of ideologically minded people, if we talk about volunteers. After talking with them, you immediately understand that these are people who are ready to give their lives for freedom. Nevertheless, in the mainstream world media, nationalists try to be portrayed as the guardians of slavery, but this is a mistake, because we stand for freedom, unlike those people who try to suppress this will. - Why did you join the mortar group? -When I came to RDK, a mortar group was being formed there. With my friend from -Azov-Kyiv- we discussed where to move next and it turned out that the transfer process to RDK went faster for him. I was held back by some circumstances that I was doing in the media service and then in recruiting. When I already officially transferred, I thought that it would be cool and logical to apply the knowledge that I once received at the military department, and at the same time, in an ironic way, thank the university and the department where I received the knowledge and the rank of artillery lieutenant. In general, the meaning of my life isfollowing the ideals of justice. By serving Ukraine, I feel that I am restoring at least a little of this justice. I thought it would be really cool to be the leader of a mortar group, because in reality, a mortar and a barrel art are not very different, and from a command point of view, the difference is very little. I came to a meeting of commanders in different directions and proposed my candidacy. - How did the battles take place in the Avdiiv direction? -That operation was the most vivid for me personally. That was exactly one year ago. Our group was standing there, firing from the same position. Then we killed more than 100 Russian soldiers, and there were also many wounded. A video where the entire landing was littered with enemy corpses made its way onto the Internet. This is exactly the landing on which we worked with calculations. In general, we controlled two landings and worked specifically on them. Then I understood that the stories about meat assaults are not fairy tales, because I saw them with my own eyes. Once (at that time I personally commanded a mortar unit at the position), we destroyed more than 30 enemy personnel in half an hour. Yes, there were still adjacent units helping us, but for the most part we repelled that assault. That is, a group of invaders just came, we eliminated them, but we were surprised by the fact that no one came after them. Maybe someone was running away. But the rest are wounded and killed. It was winter, we saw everything in the stream and literally in a few hours the wounded were also considered dead. —How did the enemy carry out their assaults in the Avdiiv direction and what tactics did they use? —At first they went in larger groups of 20-35 people. Then they began to walk by 10-15, and later generally by one or two. We understood that the enemy had deliberately reduced the number of infantry in this way, because it is impractical to shoot at one person with all types of weapons available to us. By the way, where we controlled the landings, the enemy did not break through until the decision was made to withdraw from Avdiivka. We also worked with neighboring units that gave us a picture of where to shoot. Not far from us was the 47th -Magura- brigade. We were constantly on the radio and once a fighter died there, so it was discussed there for half a day. That is, when someone from the Ukrainian side dies or is injured, it is a great grief that everyone experiences and starts to act to take the person away. And on the Russian side, it's just like a flowing river, where everyone doesn't care. This is commonplace for the Russian military. It was in that direction that the Avdiiv operation lasted for about two months, and then we went to provide the -Road of Life-. We also worked a lot there. I was appointed the battery commander not only of our comrades, but we also had defenders from other units. When we first got there, we had one dangerous place. I went there with a friend and we conducted reconnaissance there, set up positions. Then, in a few days, we equipped positions and set up mortars. After that, we went to the control post, where we had several sleepless days and managed the operation. In reality, everything was very shaky there, because there was only one road left, which the enemy had not blocked, and the boys were going out along it. If this operation had failed, then there would have been a tragedy and there could have been many prisoners from the Ukrainian side. - Tell us about your raids on the territory of Russia. -In fact, they were successful operations. We had a second event in the Grayvoron area. There we entered the village of Kozinka. It was our mortars that did not enter Russian territory, because they shoot forward for 5 km, but they stood at the very border. Then we were most surprised by the number of KABs, because the invaders themselves demolished half of the Russian village with them. I was personally pleased that these ruins are on the territory of Russia, because when we constantly sit in similar places, it happens on the territory of Ukraine and is quite painfully perceived by us. And such a moment became quite symbolic, because it is important that the war was on the territory of the enemy. With their KABs, they turned this village, which was considered quite elite and with expensive houses, into -moonscapes-, thereby warming our souls. There we also destroyed about 40 occupiers with our mines. — Then the RDK took part in the battles for Vovchansk and Aggregatny Zavod. What can you tell us about it? —Then we expected that there might be an attack and the encirclement of Kharkov, then it was all taken very seriously. But, when the whole Russian brigade -ran- towards Vovchansk, reaching the middle of the city, their last point was the Aggregate Plant, where they jumped. Before the battles in the city, we went to Vovchansk, when we conducted reconnaissance. In general, the city was quite lively. Literally in a week there was hell&#8230; Now it is empty, all the houses that were intact are now simply demolished to zero, there are not even the ruins of the first floor. This moment made the release of the Aggregate Plant quite difficult. In September, RDK and other units, with the help of a smoke screen (which we created with projectiles from mines), broke into the territory of the plant and advanced for several weeks. Later, the invaders who were there were captured. In total, there were about 30 soldiers of the Russian army there, and ours captured 15 occupiers. It was just an ordinary motorized rifle unit. Among them was one Russian GRUshnik. The capture of the plant was a highlight, as it was the first time a plant had been liberated. They usually have negative stories associated with them. The most interesting thing is that the enemy for quite a long time disbelieved, saying that they did not lose the Aggregate Plant. And just recently, propagandists wrote in one rather large Russian public that they left the factory, although 3.5 months have already passed. - Why is your call sign -Hammer-? -That's the name of my group and that's how the call sign came about. Moloch is actually a combination of the two words Molot and Moloch. In black metal, this is quite important in pronunciation itself, such an ending reminds of some barbaric and brutal names from the Lord of the Rings universe. - How often do people from Russia try to contact you to join the RDK? - Such situations happen all the time. I even remind that if people contact RDK, then they should write in the chatbot to those whom they respect. You can always write in private messages to Denis—the commander of the RDK. You can write to me or others who run social networks, but do not write comments, because fsb hunts such people. They work there: create lists of those who leave comments under similar posts and pages (although we, of course, are closed) and these commentators pass raids. I know the person to whom they were heated purely for leaving a comment. Dozens of people are included in the lists of FSBShniki and they go to them every month, checking correspondence and that they are happening at home in general, because they say immediately that they are the enemies of the country. Also, to get to us, people can contact the recruiting chatbot of RDC. - What events or people formed your view of creativity? culture Later, in my teens, I began to admire music and this is probably the main and key event in my life. After all, I write music, poems, I do the production of concerts, clips, albums, and all this is closely linked to the fine arts. In fact, it is a combination of all kinds of art in one such cultural phenomenon. I was influenced by heavy music, the most radical form of metal - Black metal. At first, I just liked, and then I realized that such music has certain magical properties and on the one hand is part of rock music, but at the same time similar to ritual shamanic music. The rhythms of extreme and heavy music are so accelerated or slow down that the idea of ​​rhythm is lost. Then the music becomes deeper and in this genre the quality of music is in the place of atmosphere. That is, tools can not be written specifically, but this will have a special sound. It is difficult to explain music in general. The idea of ​​creating music - is the idea of ​​creating magic among the world where nothing holy is left, so everything is so good. - How are your ideas born in creativity? Is it a long process or more spontaneous solution? - I think both. Creativity - develops well when a person has free time. When I was put in prison in Russia, I developed my work very much there and wrote many poems. When a person is busy, he has less time for creativity. However, there are also nuances here. Being at the exit (it was in the beginning of 2023), we sat in a landing in the Zaporozhye region, where I invented the topic for the track -MLA over Bakhmut-. Just then there were cruel battles and I thought it would be a cool comparison of events there with the atmosphere of Howard Lavraft's books. But there, just instead of ominous characters from the books of Lavraft, we had special forces from the Wagner PEC and Storm-St. The idea of ​​war generally awakens the other horrors that are people. I write music when the instrument gets into my hands. That is, I play the guitar, if I do not forget to write it on the video, then super. The lyrics are born less often because the volume of information that goes through me through the - is difficult to concentrate somewhere, but my time, because I have a lot of luggage of unfulfilled creativity. While the old is implemented, there will be a lot of space for the new one. The last album -Hammer-, for example, was recorded for 10 years, because in parallel with it were Singles and other projects. We are now working on Occult, which we started from 2017 until now. The war gives the basis for creativity, but at the same time gives the right to talk about high things. Singing about the war and not being a military, it is not a clear concept for me. It was important for me from childhood that creativity corresponded to the individual. - When the idea of ​​creating a band first came about? Then it was a punk rock. But we already wanted to have a band. It seemed to me in a clear way to express myself in the world. In general, it is easier to write songs than, for example, a book, but on the other hand, the song can crystallize their worldviews and the fact that people will sing them - will affect their spiritual development. At the age of 16, I studied and could not teach someone something, but when in 2004 we recorded our first solo album, it turned out that it was serious in content and even now is not ashamed to listen and perform it. I was interested in philosophy, history, art since childhood. The meanings I read and admired, I digested them through myself and poured into my work. Thanks to the musical taste and therefore the cultural background and the genre, we have such success in our circles. —What do you have projects except the band? It concentrates a bunch of different genres, which is why the public loves them. At the same time, I have a whispering run. It was created to create a semi -ethnic, folk, acoustic side of my creativity, but later became a year and a distinctive feature of this project is that the vocalist - is my wife and I sing a little. Although other vocalists also perform songs there. We wanted to first separate the whisper of the runes, but the project came out in another genre, the type of ethno-year. Just different albums always sound different. For our listeners, this has become a separate kind of art that harmoniously complement each other. I also have a project that, on the contrary, goes towards a radical blackout. The hammer has become more versatile. There is an Okultt project, which in heavy and dark metal. I have said that we have been writing an album since 2017, because there is one demo version and sings, but the album never came out, because we were constantly working on other projects. I also devoted a lot of time to working on my friend's project with the call sign -Nezhegol-. The last album we recorded him with musicians who work with the hammer band, and he sang, so everything happened so well. With it we are another project, one song was even recorded. Now and so many events, so I think that in February there will be another material in the style of punk rock. Those who love our creativity will appreciate. - your concerts have always been special energy. How did it take the stage for the first time after three years of widespread? - was the same as -to- - cool. There were many young people in the hall. We have created asgardsrei Festival to be lavier, which took place in Kiev every year. People from Europe even came there. At the end of 2024, this concert was better, because the youth was more charged, they sang the choir, because they understand the text, there is an exchange of energy. For our absence on stage, a new generation of listeners has grown over these three years, because working with young people allows you to look into the future. It is they who leave these particles in themselves, and it is actually an impact on the future. In general, our recent Yule Night concert - was a powerful and cool phenomenon. In fact, for 3 years of widespread, the Russians gave a concert in the center of Kiev, but everyone understands the nuance &#8230; It is like that during the Second World War, the Poles would come to a concert to the Germans. And here the question is that nationalism has changed. It is about freedom, not nationality, although propaganda dictates exactly. That is, the idea of ​​value dominates the idea of ​​origin. If you reach the ultimate sense, the ideas of spirit dominate the idea of ​​the flesh. We were born in Russia, but chose the side of good - of Ukraine. There are Ukrainians who were born here but went to the so -called -LNR- or -DNR-. That is, the old ideas of nationalism said that where you were born, you should be. Now it's not at all. The more the spirit wins, the more we are to achieve the right goals.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/pro-rejdy-na-byelgorodshhyni-zvilnennya-agregatnogo-zavodu-ta-ideologiyu-moloth-istoriya-komandyra-minometky-rdk-oleksiya-lovkina/	2025-01-29T01:30:09-08:00
We can use shells, we can use drones - our gunners destroyed several enemy guns	The video of the blows was published on January 29 on the brigade's channel. Our gunners used both traditional methods of destroying the enemy's artillery - with shells (the enemy's ammunition also exploded) and new methods, when the enemy's guns were hit by drones. Traditionally, our pilots damaged the muzzles of Russian guns, where it is most difficult to replace them. -To destroy the enemy's guns, we use both artillery fire and drone strikes. We can do everything,- the team commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, soldiers of 45 separate artillery brigade named after General Myron Tarnavsky destroyed enemy cannon in the eastern direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/mozhemo-snaryadamy-mozhemo-dronamy-nashi-artylerysty-znyshhyly-kilka-vorozhyh-garmat/	2025-01-29T01:17:06-08:00
The Ministry of Defense is introducing a new model of food supply for the Armed Forces	About informs Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The new contract has significant differences from the current supply model. From now on, the contracting functions of manufacturers go directly to the DOT, and the logistics operator remains only responsible for: completeness, timeliness and quality of transportation to the military units of food; warehouse operations at own facilities; coordination of processes of shipment of goods; documentation support and payment closing. This will make procurement processes more transparent and more manageable. The key goal of the project is to optimize the interaction between all participants of the supply chain, increase the efficiency of logistics and strengthen the quality control of products before their delivery to military units. -This is an important step to modernize the food system. The new format will make processes transparent, efficient and convenient for all parties. The separation of logistics and procurement functions will ensure the highest quality of products that will go to our military,- Hleb Kanevskyi, director of the Department of Procurement Policy of the Ministry of Defense, emphasized. The pilot project involves continuous monitoring of results for further improvement and scaling up to other regions. -We are already seeing significant interest from well-known Ukrainian brands. Thanks to the open selection of manufacturers, products familiar to them from civilian life will appear in the diet of the military,- added Halyna Litosh, director of the food program of the DOT. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine working on the development of lightweight women's body armor and conducting military (research) tests of windproof winter jackets and trousers for female servicemen.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/minoborony-zaprovadzhuye-novu-model-postachannya-harchuvannya-dlya-zsu/	2025-01-29T01:07:13-08:00

-Vampire- saving lives: how military transfusiologist Rostislav Zauralskyi saves the wounded on the ...	The story of the military transfusiologist was published on the page of the Medical Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Rostislav Zauralsky has been working with donor blood since 1997. His first experience was in the maternity hospital, where he was in charge of the blood service. Thanks to his innovative approach, the institution became one of the leading ones in the country, and the Department of Transfusion and Enzyme Therapy was unique in Ukraine. In 2014, when the war began, Rostislav could not stay away. He saw that the wounded were brought to the hospital grounds already dead. The cause is massive blood loss. Then he realized that it was necessary to transport not only soldiers to the hospital, but also blood to them. This is how the -Blood Saves Life- project was born. To ensure the prompt supply of blood to the area of ​​hostilities, Rostislav began to develop mobile transfusion stations - -blood trucks-. Today, this is already the sixth modification of the unique transport, which is equipped with everything necessary for collecting, checking, storing and transporting donor blood. The equipment of a full-fledged blood bank is located inside an ordinary-looking minibus: transfusion systems, test tubes, devices for thawing plasma and heating blood. Most importantly, this process can be done simply while driving to get the vital resource to its destination as quickly as possible. During the war, Rostislav Zauralskyi and his team saved thousands of lives. If during the ATO and OOS he transported half a ton of blood per year, now this volume is transported every month. The record is 176 blood transfusions per day, which is a phenomenal indicator. The use of fresh-frozen plasma at the pre-hospital level made it possible to improve the survival rate of seriously injured patients by 30%. Today, -Vampir- continues to improve the blood service system in the Armed Forces, extending it to all military units. Its goal is to provide each branch of the army with modern facilities for the collection, storage and transportation of blood, so that no soldier dies due to its lack. Every day, hundreds of Ukrainians in peaceful cities donate blood so that it reaches Rostislav and his team in time. It is thanks to such people that military doctors get a chance to save the lives of our defenders. Rostislav Zauralsky is not just a doctor. This is a person who found a way to restore the lives of those who risk their own for the sake of Ukraine. And while the battles continue at the front, -Vampire- continues its struggle - with blood loss, with time, with death. As ArmiyaInform reported, Ihor from Chutivsky district of Poltava region is one of those who bear the burden of war every day. He is a grenade launcher of the 16th separate motorized infantry battalion of the 58th brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. His job is defend positions and repel enemy attacks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/vampir-shho-ryatuye-zhyttya-yak-vijskovyj-transfuziolog-rostyslav-zauralskyj-ryatuye-poranenyh-na-peredovij/	2025-01-29T00:32:49-08:00
The Ministry of Defense has started its own production of FPV drones	This became known on January 29. . Within the framework of the pilot project that started in December last year under the general coordination of the Main Directorate of Defense Innovations of the Ministry of Defense, the state got the opportunity to produce codified FPV drones. As part of a tripartite agreement, a private developer granted a license for the production of UAVs on the basis of one of the state-owned enterprises belonging to the sphere of administration of the Ministry of Defense. It is foreseen that the produced products will be sent to units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. After working out the production technology and its scaling, the SOE will be able to independently participate in the tenders of the Defense Procurement Agency and other potential customers. -The experience is positive. Thanks to the integration of the state into production chains, we got a clear understanding of the cost of drone production and our competitive advantages in this market. This will make it possible to improve the quality of finished products at the expense of constant competition,- commented First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Lieutenant General Ivan Gavryliuk. Specialists of the Main Department of Defense Innovations of the Ministry of Defense worked out the road a map of the organization of similar productions together with other developers of unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Thanks to this, it is possible to significantly increase the production capacity for scaling the production of Victory means. -Ready to expand cooperation with private companies. We have a package of template documents and step-by-step instructions for launching similar lines for the production of BPAK at other state-owned enterprises,- said the head of the Main Department of Defense Innovations, Yuriy Taraniuk.

Enemy propagandists took over a village in the Luhansk region — the 10th Army Corps refutes the fake	announced this on January 29 10 Army Corps of the ZSU. According to his information, as early as January 26, a video was published on the enemy Telegram channel -Russian Kharkivskaia oblast-, which is actively distributed by pro-Russian channels of social networks, with the raising of the Russian flag on one of the buildings of the village of Novoyehorivka, Luhansk region, which proves the fact that this settlement was allegedly taken under control Russian occupation troops. -It has been established that this building is located in the settlement of Kovalivka. Based on the plot, the enemy is trying to spread a narrative about the rapid advance of his troops in this direction, to demoralize the personnel of the Defense Forces and the civilian population. And also to receive information about the placement of SOU units in this direction, to inflict fire damage,- said the message of the 10th Army Corps. During the reconnaissance, it was established that the informational operation to plant the flag was prepared in advance (on January 23), the object was chosen so that it was impossible to identify the location (population), as evidenced by data from radio interception. -After the spread of this plot, which was intended to hide the enemy's heavy losses during the assault without achieving success as such, probably the command of the -West- will raise a number of questions about misleading the top military and political leadership, commanders on the ground. Attention public and media! The settlement of Novoyehorivka is under the control of the Armed Forces,- the 10th Army Corps assured. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian propaganda machine was once again -reborn- with another fake. This time, the Kremlin dreamers report that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are supposed to -leave Kurshchyna- by Easter, and ensure peace by May 9.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/vorozhi-propagandysty-uzyaly-selo-na-luganshhyni-10-armijskyj-korpus-sprostovuye-fejk/	2025-01-29T00:17:19-08:00

Having met resistance, our fighter retreated a little, took out grenades from his shoulder bag, twisted the fuse and then threw it into the hole in which the enemy was hiding. It was liquidated. -This video is not a movie or a game. This is the reality in which Ukrainian infantrymen fight every day for every meter of our land.

The spokesperson of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine told about this in the air -Suspilne.Novyny- Dmytro Pletenchuk. According to him, Russian explosives are periodically thrown onto the coast, which is constantly responded to by anti-mine units. Mine -clogging- is also prevented in the area of ​​the grain corridor. -You see that there are no incidents with mine threats. Precisely because this is a work that is carried out by Ukrainian military sailors all the time,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. As for the global mine threat in the waters of the Black and Azov Seas, this, according to the spokesman of the Armed Forces Navy, is a deferred problem. It can be solved only by carrying out a full-scale operation. -But that will only be possible after this war is over. After reaching the appropriate level of security that will allow this operation. We are preparing for it. This is work for years, unfortunately,- said the spokesman of the Navy. ArmyInform told earlier that the terrorist country will continue the -ecological war- in the Black Sea, because it will not stop transporting oil on emergency vessels. The task for the Russians is simple - despite everything, sell resources, because money is needed for the war.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/peretvoryly-na-vybuhove-zvalyshhe-u-vms-zsu-rozpovily-pro-minnu-nebezpeku-vid-rosiyan-v-chornomu-mori/	2025-01-28T23:29:33-08:00
-This is war, everything is different here-: the story of a drone-bomber operator with the call sign...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Despite his chronic illness, Oleksandr repeatedly came to the TCC to mobilize, but was refused. However, a year ago, during a trip to Transcarpathia, he was served with a summons, and he became a soldier of the 128th OGSHBr. Due to health problems, the -German- had legal grounds to serve in the rear, but he asked for a combat unit. -I immediately said that if I'm going to serve, I don't want to wipe my pants in the rear,- says Oleksandr. - He asked where the brigade was now, and when he heard that it was in Zaporozhye, he asked me to be sent there, closer to home. They offered me a position in the drone division, and I agreed.- After undergoing thorough training, the -German- began to perform combat tasks. He is a universal soldier - he can be a navigator, a pilot, prepare a combat unit for a drone. -Ordinary infantry grenades for drones are not always effective, it is necessary to make specific explosive devices, and I periodically deal with this. But we also use classic ammunition,- Oleksandr says. According to him, the brigade has many productive sorties. In Robotyn, the -German- with his -Baba Yaga- drone chased the Russians, stopped the assaults, and destroyed armored vehicles. Once, having received information about two Russian MTLBs with infantry, which were moving towards Ukrainian positions, he changed course right in flight and successfully worked on them. -Relatives sometimes ask if I have come to terms with serving in the war. But I'm fine, it's not term service, everything is different here. I can't say that I am the master of my life, because at any moment a command may arrive for combat departure - this is war, - says the -German-. -It's dangerous here, of course, but it's much easier from a moral and psychological point of view.- Oleksandr's wife and daughter left for Germany after the start of the full-scale war. For the first time, the fighter was able to see his relatives only two and a half years later, when he received leave. -My wife and daughter came to Dnipropetrovsk region, and after my vacation they returned to Germany again. My daughter is not even 5 years old, we haven't seen her for two and a half years (only occasionally communicated via video link). But on vacation we had such a feeling as if we had not parted at all, and the thought did not even cross my mind that there was a stranger near me or that I did not know something about her. The wife and daughter settled down well abroad, but after the war they will return home, we talked about it many times. I also don't see myself anywhere except Ukraine, I don't even consider other options. - shares Oleksandr. As reported by ArmyInform, 25-year-old Oleksiy, a fighter of the 92nd brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, -svij-dosvid-na-vijni/->who controls the reconnaissance drone Shark, passed the infantry and does not know firsthand what war is. He was awarded the -Defender of the Fatherland- and -Cross of Ground Forces- medals, and was twice awarded the -Golden Cross- by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. With the modesty and sincerity of this guy, it is hard to imagine that he has met death on the battlefield more than once.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/cze-vijna-tut-use-po-inshomu-istoriya-operatora-drona-bombera-z-pozyvnym-nimecz/	2025-01-28T23:24:13-08:00

-The main thing is to keep your head on your shoulders-: the story of a grenade launcher from Poltav...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Every day, the Russian occupiers try to destroy it by all possible means: aerial bombs, artillery, mortars and drones. However, he remains steadfast and even finds the strength to joke. -It was much more difficult in Donbas, there were constant assaults, even phosphorous ammunition was used. It's also dangerous here, but the main thing is to be attentive and careful,- says Igor. Once, he and a comrade miraculously escaped fire when 82-mm mines filled their small dugout. -We were sitting in a 2×2 meter shelter, we realized that we would not survive there for a long time. They decided to run out - and in time, because the 120-mm mortars started working immediately,- the fighter recalls. Despite the danger, Igor confidently performs his work. The guy also talks about his experience using the RPG-7, which he considers reliable and effective: -You can make several shots if you don't hit right away. When you see the enemy running away after being shot, it's encouraging.- Thanks to his perseverance and professionalism, Ihor destroyed an enemy sabotage group, for which he received a state award - the Order -For Courage- III degree. His story is an example of the dedication and true fighting spirit of Ukrainian soldiers. -Work is work, however hard it is. The main thing is to keep your head on your shoulders,- concludes Igor.

VAB armored personnel carriers: how French equipment saves Ukrainian infantry on the front line. Arm...	ArmyInform visited one of the -Anna of Kyiv- mechanized battalions, which is equipped with French VAB armored personnel carriers. The crews of these combat vehicles talked about their capabilities and advantages, what tasks they perform on the front line, as well as the specifics of military training in France. -Basically, the French VAB armored personnel carrier is an armored vehicle of the front edge,- says Oleksandr, driver-mechanic. He comes from Volyn. In the brigade since August 2024. Combat vehicles arrived at the units of the brigade several months ago. -The VAB (Vehicule de I'avant blinde) armored personnel carrier is translated from French as 'front edge armored vehicle.' From this follows its main purpose - to deliver infantrymen to the battlefield under the cover of armor as quickly as possible. Our defenders also use vehicles to evacuate the wounded, transport provisions, water and even ammunition. By the way, up to 10 people can be accommodated in the landing compartment of the machine, not including the crew - the driver-mechanic and the machine gunner. The landing compartment is quite roomy inside, the seats are soft, so comfortable conditions have been created for the landing. The communication system with the crew and the landing party for communication is working. In general, the machine shows itself well during combat trips to the front, although the VAB was manufactured in the 70s of the last century. Among the advantages of the armored personnel carrier is good passability on wet fields and swamps. In addition, the car is able to overcome small water obstacles with the help of two controlled water jets. There were situations when the car overcame terrain soaked in -wire tangle-. Then the wheels, axle and gimbal were wound. But that didn't stop the undercarriage. What is interesting, the tanker boys said that once their tank was so wound up with wire that the car did not go any further. Automatic gearbox. Renault engine. Weight up to 13 tons. Power reserve up to 1000 km. The French car is maneuverable plus very fast, for example on the track it can develop a speed of up to 100 km/h. Even on the ground, the armored personnel carrier moves up to 80 km/h. These technical features actually greatly increase the chances of escaping an enemy FPV drone attack. The speed of the car is also important because it is necessary to deliver the wounded guys to the stabilization point. This should be done as quickly as possible, the lives of our fellow citizens are worth their weight in gold. The APC is equipped with a large-caliber Browning M2 machine gun, which is covered by an armor plate. The machine gun is installed in the front part of the armored personnel carrier above the machine control compartment. The hatch opens from the inside, the soldier stands at full height and can fire. The machine gun is quite effective against infantry, various fortifications, unarmored and lightly armored enemy targets. The effective firing range of the machine gun is up to 2000 meters. Combat sorties and the delivery of troops to the front line are always a danger. The enemy is waiting for us. Therefore, we use Browning for fire suppression of the enemy. From work experience, this is a rather serious weapon, which does a good job of -stitching- the positions of the Rashists. How we usually work: there is a team for departure, we leave almost at dawn, when the weather is still -gray-. At that moment, the enemy is just rotating his -fpvishok-, switching from televisions to daytime. Depending on the combat situation, weather conditions and areas in the area, we deliver infantry almost to the position. It can be a distance of even 200-500 meters to the enemy. The armored personnel carrier has a welded body made of armored steel sheets, which provides protection against small arms fire and projectile fragments. The VAB is additionally equipped with a deployable anti-drone net to counter Russian FPV drones. In addition, the car is equipped with an electronic device. Just the other day, a neighboring armored personnel carrier from our unit was attacked by mortar fire. It cut the armor on the sides, but the hull survived. The machine did not stop and completed the task to the end. The guys inside were a little muffled, but it's ok. Fortunately, it has not yet been necessary to test the durability of French armored personnel carriers against air strikes, in particular from drops from FPV drones and attacks from kamikaze drones. We include the EW as we advance into the area of ​​the front line. Interestingly, the VAB has a self-inflating wheel system. Also, each wheel of the armored personnel carrier is additionally equipped with rubber, which works according to the principle of a pillow. If the wheel is pierced by shrapnel, this cushion allows the vehicle to continue moving without stopping, which is very important during enemy fire. We had cases when one wheel was punctured, but the APC left its position on its own at the front edge. In fact, the car traveled 50 km with a flat tire, while moving at a speed of 40 km/h. This technical feature saved the crew of the car, and the paratroopers, and the armored personnel carrier itself. France became the first country to fully train and equip an entire brigade of the Armed Forces with weapons and military equipment. It became the 155th separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine -Anna Kyivska-. There is a lot of information and speculation on the Internet about our studies in France. It is necessary to tell people the truth. We were prepared very well. The training lasted 1.5 months in the eastern region of France - Grand Est. The training of driver mechanics was actually carried out from the basics. These are the tactical and technical characteristics, equipment and combat capabilities of the VAB armored personnel carrier. After the theory, there are practical lessons on driving cars on the road, difficult terrain, overcoming water obstacles, delivering and disembarking troops at high speed during the day and at night, loading and unloading BC. Learned to carry out easy -repair manipulations-. There are different situations, so you need to be able to fix the equipment. They studied the capabilities of the Browning M2 machine guns, fired from them at various targets, on the spot and while the vehicles were moving. Moving and non-moving tall figures, some shelters were impressive. I will say from myself, for better efficiency, you need more time to prepare. A month and a half is not much time, as it seems. Of course, the French instructors taught 100 percent. They explained everything on their fingers, tried to convey as much educational materials to us, the listeners, as possible. The French have everything clearly according to the plan and instructions. Dialogues on the subject of the Russian-Ukrainian war were held with them constantly, and sometimes they had to argue. They have a custom: their unit will never go into battle unless outnumbered by more than one to three. I explained to them: I say, in Ukraine, during the offensive of Russian troops, the Armed Forces do not have such a luxury and are unlikely to ever have it. It included a video and showed how the enemy infantry is advancing with mechanized equipment, how much equipment the enemy uses only on one section of the front, and so on. He explained that the Russians have much more manpower and combat equipment. In France, they lived in a modular town on a landfill. The sleeping quarters were divided into sectors. Residential block for 12 people, nearby house with toilet, shower, sinks and washing machines. The dining room was at the same distance from residential buildings of different sectors. Meals, gyms, opportunities for recreation, in short, the French organized simply excellent conditions for studying and leisure for Ukrainians. We thank them for everything!-, adds Oleksandr, the driver-mechanic.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/btr-vab-yak-franczuzka-tehnika-ryatuye-ukrayinsku-pihotu-na-peredovij-reportazh-armiyainform/	2025-01-28T22:15:51-08:00

Battle near Kruty: the story of a brilliant defensive operation	But the events that unfolded, both before and after the Battle of Kruty, did not inspire optimism. Proclaimed in the conditions of the war with Bolshevik Russia, the Ukrainian Republic gradually turned into an occupied territory&#8230; the Russians in 1918 brought to Ukraine the same as in 2014: robbery, rape, arrests, shootings&#8230; But the majority of residents of Ukraine at the beginning of 1918 behaved passively and aloof, not wanting to participate in the defense of their native land, like the residents of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk in 2014. One government, another - what difference does it make, what flags are there? As a result, Ukraine became part of the Bolshevik empire for 70 years. And everyone who had two legs had to fight. Those who did not fight for Ukraine were forcibly mobilized into the Red Army and died for the interests of Moscow. Stubborn ones were shot, others were imprisoned and sent to Siberia. The same thing is happening now in the territories occupied by Russia. Honoring our heroic predecessors, we remember the Battle of Kruty and know that only properly equipped and trained Armed Forces are the key to preserving statehood. Today ArmiyaInform reminds of what happened 107 years ago. The war between the RSFSR and the Ukrainian People's Republic began with the -Manifesto to the Ukrainian People with Ultimate Demands to the Ukrainian Rada- prepared by Vladimir Lenin. This official document of the Bolshevik Council of People's Commissars was adopted on December 16, 1917 at a meeting of the Soviet People's Committee in Petrograd and the next day telegraphed to the Central Rada in Kyiv. The document demanded unconditional support and assistance from the Ukrainian government to the Bolsheviks in Ukraine. For the answer, Lenin gave 48 hours: -in the event of not receiving a satisfactory answer to these questions, the Council of People's Commissars will consider the Council to be in a state of open war against Soviet power in Russia and Ukraine.- This happened after the unsuccessful Bolshevik uprisings in Kyiv and Odesa, as well as the release from the control of the UNR of parts of the Donbas Revolutionary Committees. On December 19, 1917, the Minister of War of the Ukrainian People's Republic Simon Petliura made a stunning statement at the Central Rada congress: -A campaign is being prepared for us! The Bolsheviks are concentrating their army to defeat the Ukrainian Republic&#8230; The first echelons from Gomel are approaching Bahmach!-. On December 21, Bolshevik Red Guard units led by Volodymyr Antonov-Ovsienko entered Kharkiv. On the night of December 22, they took possession of the city. On December 25, the Bolsheviks held the so-called All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets in Kharkiv, at which they announced the creation of the -Soviet UNR- with the capital in Kharkiv. The Ukrainian People's Republic headed by the Central Council was declared illegitimate. The next day, Russian-Bolshevik troops began to advance from Kharkiv deep into Ukraine. On December 31, Soviet Russia captured and controlled part of modern Kharkiv region, Luhansk region, and Donetsk region. Also, Bolshevik units occupied the Zhmerinka district on the right bank within the Ukrainian People's Republic. The Bolshevik horde was rapidly advancing towards Kyiv. At the time of the proclamation of the Fourth Universal (January 22), the troops of the Ukrainian People's Republic lost Kharkiv Oblast, Poltava Oblast, Katerynoslav Oblast, and eastern Chernihiv Oblast. The headquarters of the Kyiv Military District expected that the main blow of the enemy would come from the side of Poltava (it was there that the freshest and most combat-capable units of the Army of the Ukrainian People's Republic were directed: the 1st hundred Sich riflemen, the combat regiment of black haidamaks of the 2nd Ukrainian military school, the Serdyutsky detachment named after P. .The head of the regiment is a total of 500 soldiers). But Muravyov went on the offensive in the Bakhma direction. About 400 cadets - senior officers and cadets of the First Ukrainian Military School named after Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, who at that time already had combat experience (some of them even went to the fronts of the First World War), as well as the fighters of Kurenya Smerti, a volunteer unit formed from soldiers who returned from the First World War, and free Cossacks from the city of Glukhova. older people who had combat experience. The battle lasted about six hours. Only in the evening, the Krut defenders were forced to retreat in an organized manner, mainly because they were running out of ammunition. Losses wounded and killed, according to the testimony of the commander of the units at the positions, centurion Averkiy Honcharenko, amounted to 10 officers and about 250 soldiers - mostly wounded young men of the 1st Ukrainian Military School. The dead, according to various sources, were from 70 to 100 soldiers, while the losses of the Bolsheviks, according to one of the reports, reached up to 300 people killed. The most tragic episode of the battle near Kruty was the death of a group of students who got lost during the retreat and went to the station, which at that time was already occupied by the Bolsheviks. Enraged Red Army soldiers the next day shot all the prisoners with explosive bullets. On their way out, the Krutyans dismantled the railway track, which delayed Muravyov's advance on Kyiv for several days. These days became decisive in the negotiations that were ongoing at that time in Brest, and provided an opportunity to conclude the Brest Peace Treaty with the countries of the Quadruple Alliance, one of the main points of which was the international recognition of the Ukrainian People's Republic. However, at that time perhaps the most formidable enemy was the Bolshevik agitation. As Simon Petliura wrote: -Criminal agitation against the Ukrainian People's Republic is mainly carried out by people who are not citizens of our Republic and who came from Great Russia and other countries of the former Russia. These people, instead of thanking our Ukraine for the bread they eat here, commit various rebellions, sow anarchy, rob the civilian population, engage in sabotage, provocation and speculation.- It was Bolshevik propaganda that turned some Ukrainized regiments from allies into potential opponents, as happened with Kuren. T. Shevchenko, who stood in Nizhyn and, having declared neutrality, was a threat to the defenders of Krut. It was she who pulled reinforcements from important areas of the front. So, 300 soldiers of the 3rd Haydamatsky Regiment, led by Simon Petliura, were supposed to come to the aid of the Krut defenders, but they had to return to Kyiv to suppress the Bolshevik rebellion at the Arsenal plant. The riot at Arsenal lasted 7 days and was subdued only on February 4, at the cost of extraordinary efforts. The armed action in Kyiv greatly facilitated the advance of the Bolshevik troops, because the way to Kyiv actually remained open. The Ukrainian military, tired of street battles, were unable to resist Muravyov's army, which at that time approached the outskirts of the city. On February 4, in Darnytsia near Kyiv, Muravyov issued an order for the -merciless destruction of all officers, Haydamaks, monarchists and all enemies of the Russian revolution.- During the storming of Kyiv, poisonous gases were used, massive artillery shelling was carried out (up to 15,000 shells). The population of Kyiv, which at that time reached 430,000 people (of which up to 20,000 were military personnel, soldiers and officers of the old imperial army), was generally indifferent to the struggle of independent Ukrainians against Soviet revolutionary formations. Moreover, the Kyiv pro-Russian public (in modern parlance - -Zhduns-) initially even sympathized with the Bolsheviks, but later paid dearly for their spineless position. Muravyov recalled: -I occupied the garden, hit palaces and churches- beat, showing no mercy to anyone! The Duma (Kiev) asked for a truce. In response, I ordered to suffocate them with gases. Hundreds of generals, and maybe even thousands, were mercilessly killed&#8230; So we got our revenge. We could stop the wrath of revenge, but we didn't, because our slogan is to be merciless!- In occupied Kyiv, the Bolsheviks organized the -Red Terror.- There were robberies, violence, and murders. Representatives of the intelligentsia, soldiers and civilians were shot. Up to 5,000 people were victims of the massacre, including Metropolitan of Kyiv and Halytskyi Volodymyr Bogoyavlenskyi, General Secretary of Land Affairs of the Ukrainian People's Republic Oleksandr Zarudnyi, and Central Rada member Isak Pugach. About a thousand officers and generals were also executed - B. Bobrovsky, A. Acceleration, Ya. Safonov, N. Ivanov, Ya. Handziuk and others. In general, terror and violence, including mass confiscation (looting) of private property, arrests, executions, forced labor, forced mobilization, the organization of famine, etc., was a typical Bolshevik practice in all the territories they occupied. The UNR was saved from being absorbed by Bolshevik Russia in 1918 by the Treaty of Berestei with the countries of the Quadruple Union, signed on February 9. On March 1, Bolshevik troops were forced to leave the capital of the Ukrainian People's Republic, and a week later, the government of the Central Rada returned to the city.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/bij-pid-krutamy-istoriya-blyskuchoyi-oboronnoyi-operacziyi/	2025-01-28T22:06:27-08:00
-He chooses Moscow- — The President of Ukraine commented on the statements of the Prime Minister of ...	The head of the Ukrainian state wrote about this in social networks. Earlier, information began to spread among Slovak publications that the Prime Minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico, during a meeting of the parliamentary committee on economic issues, continued the conversation about the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine, calling the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, an -enemy- of Slovakia. -To the knowledge of the current Prime Minister of Slovakia. A few days ago, President Trump made a strong decision that will make it possible to significantly increase US LNG exports, particularly to Europe. This is what is needed for security and stability - more energy resources from partners for Europe,- the President of Ukraine noted. According to him, you have to pay for American LNG with money, but for Russian gas you have to pay not only with money, but also with independence and sovereignty. -Many people in Europe have already gone through this and chose to preserve their independence and sovereignty. But not Mr. Fitso. He chooses Moscow over America and other partners who can provide his country with gas on commercial terms. This is his mistake,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi emphasized. He noted that everyone in Europe needs to be forward-looking and develop relationships that strengthen our peoples. At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine declared that the Prime Minister of Slovakia Robert Fico against the background of falling confidence among the Slovak society and protests against his pro-Russian course, resorted to looking for enemies and found them in Ukraine. -We regard these yet another absurd statements as an attempt to shift the responsibility for our own failures in domestic policy onto foreign states and leaders. We advise you to look not over the border, but in the mirror,- the message says. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs noted that the Ukrainian side has repeatedly warned about the danger of the pro-Russian policy of Slovakia's leadership. -The result is obvious: Robert Fico and individual members of Slovakia's parliament have been poisoned by Russian propaganda, have stopped distinguishing between black and white, and have already begun to call the leaders of neighboring friendly democracies -enemies.- We are sure that such a position and policy of Robert Fico goes against the choice of the people of Slovakia to be an integral part of the European Community,- the Ministry of Foreign Affairs assured. As reported by ArmyInform, previously Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Putin instructed Fico to open a second energy front against Ukraine at the expense of the interests of the people of Slovakia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/vin-obyraye-moskvu-prezydent-ukrayiny-prokomentuvav-zayavy-prem%ca%bcyer-ministr-slovachchyny-shhodo-rosijskogo-gazu/	2025-01-28T21:56:06-08:00

-Stingers- will be enough for everyone, the formula for finalizing the war and 200 -Hraks-: an exper...	How has the number of enemy airstrikes in this direction changed? But why did the infantry assaults of the enemy decrease? This was told by military expert Petro Chernyk. -The number of aerial bombings by the Russian Federation on Kurshchyna has increased. If at the beginning of January they used heavy bombs of the caliber FAB-100, FAB-250, because they are the most massive, somewhere between 3 and 24 per day, now this indicator has increased. the Russians raised it to almost forty strokes. Why does this happen? As we always analyze in two planes. The first and most important is geopolitical. There is already a lot of information that, they say, in this year's cycle of dry weather, the formula to finalize this war will be found. For the Russians, both in terms of prestige and purely in the military component, it is extremely important to get our troops out of Kurshchyna before the start of the negotiation process. This is very important. Because if the Defense Forces of Ukraine will still be there at the moment of finalization, it means that we will have the right to change Kurshchyna&#8230; Let's say I'm a big supporter of what's called the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant&#8230; Therefore, this is a tell-tale sign that the finalization process has in fact acquired new qualitative features and is moving towards its completion. We must remember that the use of heavy aerial bombs means exposing our aviation, first of all, to the work of portable anti-aircraft missile systems. For example, we are the second country in the world to stock FIM-92 Stinger. At most, it was this portable anti-aircraft missile system that the Americans restored and put on the assembly line, because at the beginning of the zeros this system was removed from the arsenal. Do the Russians have a margin of safety, primarily in tactical aviation? Their most massive attack aircraft is the Su-25 Hrak. Russians use it quite often. They have some: before the start of the large-scale invasion, there were up to 200 machines in the line-up, and they still have about 200 machines in storage and have begun to de-conserve it. And the stockpile of bombs, in fact, is not counted in thousands, but in tens of thousands of units. That's quite a lot of potential. Plus, a very important detail is that the Russians managed to improve the quality of their bombs as part of the universal planning and correction module. Some bombs have managed to integrate this module already even with a small engine and declare that from the moment of reset to the point of impact, they have increased this distance to somewhere up to 80, even up to 100 kilometers. The general conclusion is as follows: the increase in rocket-bombing in Kurshchyna is a strategic sign that it is essential for the Russians to knock out our contingent, and not to get it out. Another very interesting cut in Kurshchyna is the reduction of large infantry ramparts. If there were about 50 of them per day, now they have decreased to 13-14. What does that mean? The first point is the so-called anticipatory extermination. the Russians can put no more than 40-45 thousand personnel into service for a month, because otherwise they have to announce a large mobilization. According to the results of December, the total loss of their personnel is more than 48,000. These are anticipatory actions on the march. Why did we manage to show such huge figures in Kurshchyna? First of all, thanks to the operation of our rocket salvo systems and simply unique cluster ammunition. And another phenomenal piece of work, especially over the past year, is our FPV drones. There are cases of aiming not just at a person, but at a separate part of the body, say, at the knee or at the head. In general, when it comes to FPV drones, we are delivering unprecedented results. So the lack of infantry - the North Korean contingent did not justify itself at all - and the very high-quality use of cluster munitions explains for the moment the decrease in the number of infantry assaults as such. But this does not mean that the Russians will not return to them. Let's not forget that they have up to three million mobilization resources, and at one time they produced more than 100 million Kalashnikov assault rifles of all types and varieties. Of course, there are not 100 million in warehouses, but what is there is quite a large stock.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/stingeriv-vystachyt-na-vsih-formula-finalizacziyi-vijny-ta-200-grakiv-ekspert-pro-kilkist-shturmiv-ta-aviaudariv-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-28T20:45:57-08:00
U-2S Dragon Lady: America's spy plane protecting global security	As stated in the profile article of the world-renowned encyclopedia Britannica, the U-2 is a single-seat high-altitude jet aircraft that was used by the United States for intelligence gathering, surveillance and reconnaissance, according to ArmyInform. Perhaps the most famous reconnaissance aircraft ever created by engineers, the U-2, also known as the Dragon Lady, has been in service with the US Air Force since 1956. The prototype aircraft made its first flight back in 1955, and the last aircraft in the series was built in 1989. Experts of the Dutch defense portal Army Recognition emphasize the fact that from the moment of creation to the continuous evolution of the U- 2S demonstrates not only technological resilience, but also adaptability, making it a key tool for ensuring information superiority in an era where data dominance is key to operational success Known for its exceptional ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) capabilities, the U-2S Dragon Lady has been a cornerstone of global security since its introduction into service with the United States Air Force in 1956. Developed during the Cold War era, the U-2 has undergone significant upgrades, with the current U-2S variant introduced in 1994. Over the decades, this aircraft has adapted to changing mission requirements, consistently integrating advanced technologies to stay at the forefront of modern defense needs. It is expected to remain in service until at least the 2040s, continuing its legacy as a vital ISR platform. The U-2S has an advanced set of technical capabilities designed to operate at extreme altitudes, thanks to the General Electric F118-GE-101 turbofan engine, which allows it to maintain flight above 70,000 feet (21,336 meters). Such a high operational ceiling allows it to perform missions that are far beyond the reach of most air defense systems. The aircraft's impressive wingspan of approximately 104 feet (31.7 meters) increases its lift and endurance, allowing it to fly missions lasting more than 12 hours with a range of more than 7,000 miles (11,265 kilometers). Equipped with a payload capacity of 5,000 pounds (2,268 kilograms), the U-2S can integrate advanced ISR systems, including electro-optical and infrared instrumentation, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and signals intelligence (SIGINT) equipment tailored to a variety of mission requirements. The key to the success of the U-2S Dragon Lady is its modular design with an open architecture that allows for rapid integration and demonstration of advanced technologies. While traditional platforms require years of development to incorporate new advances, the U-2S can do so in a matter of weeks thanks to improved size, weight, power and cooling (SWAP-C) features. These features not only make it a flexible ISR platform, but also a testing ground for next-generation capabilities, ensuring that it is always one step ahead of emerging threats. SWAP-C stands for an optimized balance between size, weight, power and cooling, which ensures that the aircraft can carry extended payloads without compromising performance. The platform's Open Mission Systems (OMS)-compatible avionics system exemplifies the versatility of the U-2S. OMS is a modular architecture standard that supports a plug-and-play approach, enabling seamless integration of new mission-specific payloads, sensors, and capabilities. This adaptability ensures that the U-2S is not only relevant today, but also ready for the increasingly complex requirements of tomorrow's battlespace. The U-2S is ideally suited to meet the demands of future warfare, where dominance depends on the ability to collect, process and share data at unprecedented speeds. Its advanced data processing capabilities give warfighters access to operational intelligence, reducing the time from data collection to decision-making. Using machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, the U-2S provides seamless data transmission at the tactical, operational and strategic levels, improving coordination across the board. M2M communication involves the automated exchange of data between systems without human intervention, which enables faster and more accurate decision-making. This capability is particularly important in the context of Joint All Domain Operations (JADO), a military concept that emphasizes the integration of capabilities in the land, sea, air, space and cyber domains. The U-2S fills this gap with robust networking capabilities, enabling interoperability and providing a decisive advantage in complex multi-domain environments. Recently implemented program The Avionics Tech Refresh further strengthened the U-2S's position as an ISR platform. With advanced electronics and OMS compatibility, the aircraft now supports the rapid adoption of advanced technologies. This upgrade makes the U-2S the first fully OMS-compatible fleet, significantly reducing integration costs and timelines while providing unparalleled flexibility in adopting new mission capabilities. This technological leap not only expands its existing ISR capabilities, but also positions the U-2S as a tool for future combat operations where speed, flexibility and adaptability will be key determinants of success. The U-2S is operated by a single pilot in a fully sealed cockpit. The aircraft routinely flies at altitudes in excess of 70,000 feet, well above commercial air traffic and the operating ceiling of most other aircraft. U-2 Dragon Lady pilots undergo rigorous training and wear specialized full-pressure suits similar to those used by astronauts to withstand the extreme conditions at such altitudes. A team of ground personnel, including mission planners and technicians, support each flight to ensure the aircraft operates efficiently and safely. During the decades of their service, the U-2 planes wrote many significant pages not only in the history of aviation, but also in international politics. The same profile article about this device in the Britannica encyclopedia reminds us that this particular plane, while performing a secret mission, was shot down by an air defense missile over the Soviet Union on May 1, 1960, which led to -Affairs U-2-. And in 1962 during -Cuban missile crisis- U-2 took photos that confirmed the placement of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba. As the US military continues to adapt to a more complex global environment, the U-2S Dragon Lady remains at the forefront of providing information superiority. Its ability to work hard at high altitudes, its modular design and advanced avionics make it an invaluable asset for today's missions and tomorrow's tasks. The U-2S is not just an airplane. It is a symbol of innovation and adaptability in the pursuit of global security. From its unrivaled ISR capabilities to its role in shaping the future of multi-domain operations, Dragon Lady is a testament to the power of combining proven performance with cutting-edge technology. As the battlespace evolves, one thing is clear: the U-2S Dragon Lady will continue to soar, protecting the skies and providing warfighters with the critical information they need to win the battles of the future.

Peace before Easter and May parades: Russian fantasies in Kurshchyna	This myth is a typical example of how propagandists try to keep their own population in the illusion of -control over the situation.- Imposing the idea that Ukraine has some -secret agreements- to withdraw from Kurshchyna is a way to quell panic among the Russian population, which in recent months has actively felt the approach of war in their own homes. Try to explain to the residents of the Kursk region why after every air raid signal they have to run to the basements, even though -everything is going according to plan.- Kurshchyna is a strategically important region bordering the northern part of Ukraine. The tasks of our units here are clear and multifaceted: So while Russian propaganda invents the next -graphs- of Ukraine's defeats, our soldiers are already systematically crossing out all the enemy's plans. Russia, losing on the battlefield, bets on information warfare. The goal of such fakes is to demoralize Ukrainian society and inspire its own. But here they are waiting for another failure. Ukrainians have long learned to distinguish truth from lies, and sarcastic memes on the topic of -ensuring peace by Easter- have already spread faster than Russian methods. The Armed Forces of Ukraine will not only leave Kurshchyna, but will also continue to destroy the enemy where it is necessary for the defense of Ukraine. And as for -May 9-, it is better for the Russian command to prepare not parades, but evacuation routes. The Ukrainian army has already shown that it knows how to work in advance. So let Russian propaganda continue to paint its scenarios of -peaceful life-, but we know that real peace will come only when the last occupier leaves our land. And no -holy date- will prevent this.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/myr-do-velykodnya-i-travnevi-parady-rosijski-fantaziyi-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-28T20:12:12-08:00

During this time, -Monaco- together with its sister company installed thousands of mines and hundreds of kilometers of engineering barriers. On one occasion, they successfully destroyed a platoon of invaders by blocking their path with anti-personnel mines. -All the 'gifts' worked,- recalls Monaco. Of course, the work of a miner is associated with constant risk and stress. -There are moments of uncertainty and fear. But you understand: you have to make the task of the infantry as easy as possible. You always have to have a cool head to control the situation,- says Monaco. He also admits that he once experienced burnout and a panic attack, but thanks to the support of the commander, he was able to cope with it. The war changed the life of -Monaco-. The circle of his friends has narrowed, because many are now far away. -My morning starts with breakfast and sleep. Because I'm at work at night,- he says. -Monaco- has a girlfriend, but he does not want to talk about her publicly. However, he readily talks about his future children. -When they ask me who the Russians are, the answer is simple - the ones who wanted to kill your father,- Monaco says. As reported by ArmyInform, a machine gun with the call sign -Patron- from the 141st separate mechanized brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine became a real nightmare for Russian drones.

-24/7 we live in victory-: the commander of the UAV calculation about her front-line experience	The defender's story was made public on the brigade's page. -The most important thing in war is cohesion, mutual support and readiness for any challenges,- Anastasia says. Anastasia started her military career back in 2014 in the border troops, when she was 18 years old. Later, she signed a contract and served in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. With the full-scale invasion beginning in February 2022, she returned from overseas with no doubts about her duty. -Returning to the service was an obvious choice for me. The main thing is that the closest person in my life - my mother - supported me in this,- Anastasia recalls. Currently, Anastasia heads the all-male unit and works on the modern Poseidon unmanned aerial vehicle complex, carrying out reconnaissance missions. The main goal is to identify the enemy's heavy equipment, weapons and manpower. To effectively manage the complex, Anastasia and her team have undergone specialized training. -At first it was difficult to imagine how to lead a unit where most of the men are much older than me. But in practice, everything turned out to be simpler. We have achieved excellent interaction, we understand each other from the bottom of a word,- says Anastasia. Anastasia is sure that the role of a woman in the army has become an integral part of the modern army. Her own example demonstrates that women can perform the most difficult tasks and make key decisions in wartime on an equal footing with men. -I don't feel any difference in the way I am treated as a woman. The main thing is to know your responsibilities and perform them at the highest level,- she says. She is sure that the modern Ukrainian army is no longer possible without women, who not only perform tasks, but also make key decisions. Despite all the difficulties, Anastasia maintains strength of spirit. -What motivates me is that 24/7 we live in victory. We have to drive the enemy out of our land so that no one ever wants to do it again,- she says.

The spokesman of the Navy, Dmytro, told about this in the broadcast of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- Pletenchuk According to him, Russian sloppiness has not gone anywhere and -maybe- just as no new ships have appeared. Therefore, they will continue to use what is available, despite the fact that Russian old ships are breaking down en masse at sea. -This is about sanctions, which are only beneficial. Their funds continue to melt, which they created there, supposedly, in order to support the population and promise various social benefits. But all this is thrown into the furnace of war and, accordingly, they are not going to stop before environmental problems, of course. They are already playing all-in, in fact,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk.

The spokesman of the 33rd separate mechanized brigade told about this on the -Social News- broadcast. Nazar Voytenkov. In general, according to him, the situation is consistently the same — the occupiers are trying to move in small groups, which is now a typical Russian tactic. No armored assaults, instead — attacks by forces of one, two or three. -These attacks have to be repelled every day. Conduct reconnaissance in the air and adjust artillery fire, aim mortars, and tell our infantrymen what is happening several hundred meters ahead. Their main task is to find positions in which they can gain a foothold. Then they use such -shuttles- to drop new personnel there,- said the spokesman of the 33rd separate mechanized brigade. The main thing in this tactic, as Nazar Voytenkov said, is to move constantly. Use a truly inexhaustible number of personnel. So the Russians move and die en masse. -Despite the fact that we mine the areas, and they come across our mined areas, despite the fact that the FPV constantly destroys them from the sky, they leave. It really feels like it's just a mass of meat. It's really a resource, it's not people,- he said. As reported by ArmyInform, the situation in the Pokrovsky direction remains quite complicated.

ATACMS replacement: Pentagon eyeing PrSM Inc's new missile weapon 5	As noted by portal of the Army Times magazine, American generals said that development of a promising modification is underway at an early stage missiles PrSM conditionally the fifth version, which could significantly expand the army's strike capabilities, ArmiyaInform reports. -We are in the science and technology stage of what we may eventually call Increment 5,- said Brigadier General Rory Crooks, director of the Long-Range Cross-Functional Precision Fires Group. According to the plans of the developers, Increment 5 should have significantly larger dimensions than its predecessors. First of all, the length, which will probably allow combining a range of more than 1,000 km with a fairly powerful warhead. However, a kind of payback will be the refusal to use the existing MLRS/HIMARS launchers. They want to use unmanned launchers for launch, and precisely due to the abandonment of the cabin with the same dimensions (perhaps using the same chassis as in HIMARS, at least such an unmanned vehicle has been tested for some time) it will be possible to place a longer transport-launch container. In general, we can say that these are plans for the development of a separate new missile complex with only partial use of common components. Rory Crooks separately explained that initial work on a fifth option is already underway. And the initiative to implement scientific ideas and developed technologies will begin in fiscal year 2026. The idea, he said, is to develop a missile that can be launched from an autonomous vehicle. According to the implementation plan of the PrSM project: PrSM missiles of the first four versions have a length of approximately 4 m, limited by the dimensions of the launcher. Case diameter is 430mm. The increase in flight range, compared to the previous family of missiles, was obtained due to the introduction of a new solid fuel engine, a lighter warhead and other solutions. Now the relevant service of the Pentagon is in the process of using the first Increment 1 projectiles from Lockheed Martin, declared as a way to hit targets at a distance of at least 500 km. Over the past few years, the US Army has been developing four other PrSM missiles, designed to replace the Army's MGM-140 Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and to be launched from both the M142 High Mobility Artillery Missile System (HIMARS) and the M270A2 MLRS. According to analysts of the Dutch portal for researching defense strategies Army Recognition, the development of Increment 5 is a key step towards the integration of autonomous technologies for advanced military operations. Despite significant technical challenges, this initiative underscores the United States military's desire to push the boundaries of long-range precision strikes. If successful, PrSM Increment 5 could offer significant strategic advantages in future military scenarios. Although the PrSM Increment 5 project remains conceptual, it reflects the Pentagon's clear desire to modernize its arsenal with the help of innovative technologies. The program's trajectory will depend on progress made in the coming years, with potential implications for future warfare. Development of the PrSM Increment project for the US Army.

Zatrofeev -Vintorez-: the story of an airsoft player -Andrew-, who became a paratrooper	The military heroism is confirmed by high awards - he is a Knight of the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi and the owner of the -Silver Cross- of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the -Cross of Airborne Assault Troops- and the -Path of Honor- of the 46th Separate Airmobile Brigade of the Russian Air Force, awarded with a brigade ring and an award-winning weapon . -Andrew- is from Shostka in Sumshchyna, but has been living in Kyiv for a long time. In civilian life, he was the head of the sales department of a large international company that traded rolled metal. -Trumpets are everywhere,- jokes the soldier, recalling that he also had to be a mortar gunner during his service. The future officer first joined the Armed Forces in 2004 as a conscript soldier, studied at the Zhytomyr Military Institute named after S. P. Korolyova, majoring in electronic warfare. However, a military career did not attract the young man, so after the end of the -line- he returned to civilian life. The armed aggression of the Russian Federation forced them to join forces again. In 2015‒2016, the man served in the State Border Service, protecting the northern border of Ukraine in the Sumy region. -Then I didn't get into the real war, but now I'm raking it in full,- smiles the officer. The call sign -Andrew- is a tribute to the civilian hobby of playing airsoft, in which the future officer acquired and improved his combat skills. The service experience convinced the man of the need to always be ready to stand up for the defense of Ukraine, and the desire to independently acquire and improve the skills of shooting combat led him to this team military game. -The knowledge that was given in the army was not enough for me. Therefore, I decided to take up airsoft to improve my tactical skills. Later, a lot of gaming experience was really needed in the army,- says the soldier. The annual training sessions, which he regularly attended as a reservist in the 95th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Polish Army, became just as useful. So, before the start of a large-scale invasion, -Andrew- had good military training. -Andrew- remembers the 2017‒2021 Annual Meeting of Reservists with respect and gratitude. He emphasizes that it was they who made it possible for Ukraine to have a sufficient number of trained fighters to withstand the first months and throughout the year after the beginning of the large-scale Russian invasion. -By February 2022, we had a sufficient number of trained reservists who had passed through the combat zone and had combat experience. Preparation was established, attention was paid to the formation of territorial defense, training meetings were held regularly. Reservists dragged out the war in 2022,- he says. So when the Russian Federation launched a large-scale attack on Ukraine, first of all, those who already had combat experience and regularly underwent retraining during military meetings were recruited into the Armed Forces. This explains the frequent stories of TCC rejections to inexperienced volunteers in the first months of the 2022 invasion. Since -Andrew- was a reservist of the 95th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Polish Brigade, he met the first weeks of the invasion as part of this unit. Took part in the defense of Boryspil airport. And already in April 2022, together with other fighters, he was transferred to the 46th separate aeromobile brigade of the Russian Armed Forces. At the beginning, the soldier recalls with a smile, he had a different call sign - -Grudnichok-. Once one of the commanders saw that, after a hard day of combat, the man was sleeping as calmly and calmly as a baby, and jokingly called the soldier -Breast-. In memory of this old call sign, -Andrew- wears a patch on his forearm with the image of a baby in camouflage with a machine gun. -From April to June, we had a battalion reconciliation. Then they went to the south, fought in the Kherson region. He took part in the battles for Biloghirka, Davidiv Brid, Velika and Mala Oleksandrivka, Trifonivka. Then I reached Dudchan,- the officer recalls. On October 25, 2022, near Dudchany in the Kherson region, -Andrew- received two bullet wounds - one in the back, the other in the hand. The soldier was being hunted by an enemy sniper, but he was saved by a high-quality bulletproof vest. -That bulletproof vest saved me,- the officer shows the bullet mark. He now wears the bullet, which the armor protected, around his neck as a pendant. He was able to return to action after treatment and rehabilitation in March 2023. With a higher education - at one time -Andrew- graduated from the Interregional Academy of Personnel Management - the soldier could apply for the primary rank of officer. The command was happy to meet the desire of a capable, experienced and responsible fighter. -Officer courses in Odessa lasted two months. Plus I was lucky - I got to study in Germany for a month. They have a very good material base, high-quality training protocols. I really liked that they put a lot of emphasis on storming trenches and buildings. -Not everything we were taught works the same way in our war, but they laid a very good foundation,- recalls -Andrew- gratefully. After completing his training and returning to Ukraine, -Andrew- was given the rank of junior lieutenant and, as an educated and experienced man, was appointed to the position of deputy company commander. At this time, he had to take part in offensive actions in the South in the area of ​​the Robotynsky Salient. -There we encountered the Russian special forces of the 45th separate special purpose brigade of the airborne troops. This is considered elite among them, but we showed them that we are better,- says the officer. It was there that he managed to capture a unique trophy - the Russian Vintorez silent-shooting sniper rifle. -My photo with her has been around the Internet for a long time, so I can brag a little,- smiles -Andrew-. From December 2023, -Andrew- became an acting company commander, and soon after, a company commander. He fought in one of the most difficult areas of the front - the Marinsky and Kurakhiv directions. I watched how the nature of hostilities was rapidly changing. -The war has changed a lot. It began to change already in 2023 during the battles on the Robotynsky ledge. The mass use of FPV drones began, they radically changed the war. There used to be artillery, infantry, aviation, and now there are also drones,- notes -Andrew-. Being able to move covertly and camouflage in the terrain, counter drones with the help of EW and shoot down enemy drones with sniper fire is what determines the ability of fighters to survive on the battlefield and complete the combat mission. -Andrew- believes that this is what infantrymen should be taught first of all. -If you are struggling, if you are being pressed by the enemy, it means that you are a key point in a big defense mechanism. You are important in this place and at this time. Everyone needs to be where they need to be and do their job as efficiently as possible,- emphasizes Andrew. Addressing men who are hesitating about mobilization, the officer emphasizes: everyone is actually afraid of war, even the most experienced soldiers who have been fighting on the front lines for more than a year do not avoid this fear. The main thing is to overcome fear and not follow the coward's path of shame, but the warrior's path of honor. -Fear is a natural thing. If a person is not afraid of anything, then he is just stupid. You just need to be able to control your fear. It should be overcome, listen to commanders, believe in yourself and make the right choice,- the officer is confident. Because the -Path of Honor- is not only a high award of the 46th separate airborne brigade of the Airborne Assault Forces. This is primarily the choice of every defender of Ukraine.

Tactics -The Walking Dead-, or How to stop the enemy near Pokrovsk. ArmiyaInform report from Donetsk...	Oleksandr from Vinnytsia region. Already more than 5 years in the army. In the brigade, he started as a scout in a regular infantry unit. During the operation of the Joint Forces, he performed tasks on drones. With the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the brigade repelled the offensive of the invaders in the south of Ukraine, in the Kherson region. He has extensive experience in piloting and striking the enemy from various UAVs in different areas of the Russian-Ukrainian war front. Now the enemy is destroying Donbass. -The use of Maviks on the front is an extremely urgent need today, primarily in matters of situational awareness and control over the situation on the battlefield. This is reconnaissance of the enemy's positions on the front edge plus the depth of his battle formations up to 12 km. With the help of drones, the locations of manpower and firepower are determined, artillery fire is adjusted and the enemy is struck by drops of combat units. The command determines priority targets for destruction and gives instructions for combat use, for example, brigade artillery: calculations of guns, self-propelled artillery installations and mortars. It can also be FPV drone crews. We destroy the enemy depending on the type of targets and the distance to them. The drone has a good optical camera that allows you to shoot high-quality video from a height of up to 6 km and transmit it to the operator's console, and a thermal imager can monitor the situation at night. Optimally, -Mavik- can carry 600 grams of a warhead, maybe more, of course. Everything above is difficult for him. The motor overheats and sometimes it can just fall. At a discount. We cling to everything that can kill the invaders. Currently, the format of ammunition is very diverse: grenades, VOGs, combinative resets, thermobars, -ignitors-, explosives and high-explosive fragmentation bombs. Usually, we use fragmentation projectiles against the enemy's manpower, and high-explosive and cumulative drops for other purposes. Everything depends on the combat mission and the characteristics of the targets to be hit. If we need to stop small assault groups of the enemy, then, of course, we use shrapnel drops. To inflict maximum damage on the enemy and prevent his further attack. If there is a shelter, you can dismantle it with explosives. The dugout is covered with some kind of wood, then you can bring in a -lighter-. And if you find an enemy field warehouse with ammunition, you can drop a cumulative charge, a -lighter- or a high explosive to blow it up. A combat unit must be prepared in advance for each combat mission. In the Pokrovsky direction, the Rashists use the tactics of small assault groups. Every day, the occupiers gather at some point in the locality, the first to go is a group of 5-7 people, armed with assault rifles without BC. They are trying to advance to the afforestation to take advantageous positions for themselves. We see all this, we monitor them. At the stage of gathering the enemy, we strike at them. Half of the raschits are destroyed immediately, others with injuries flee to the sides and are shot. But not for long. Very often the Rashists themselves kill themselves with grenades, other -walkers- with injuries crawl and die from massive bleeding. It reminds us of the story pictures from the top American post-apocalyptic TV series The Walking Dead. That is why we sometimes compare rashists with -walkers- from this series, who wander aimlessly around the area and -ultimately- die from the bullets of the main character, policeman Rick Grimes and his men. Interestingly, another assault group of Rashists steps on the corpses of their own men. No one helps the wounded, and even more so no one evacuates them from the battlefield. The kamikaze mortals climb further, and we continue to -ground- the invaders. There are days when the Mavik crew performs only reconnaissance tasks. We -cut- a specific area of ​​the terrain, fly out and conduct observations. In today's conditions, it is important to increase the duration of the flight task. For this, we additionally attach a battery. Usually, we stand in for 4 days on combat duty. This is optimal for intensive combat work, and during these days another shift can sleep, deal with current issues and recover. Our positions are relatively close to the front line, in camouflaged shelters. So that the enemy does not discover our location. We are great prey for the Rashists, so they are looking for us 24 hours a day. Likewise, we are looking for the positions of their FPV drone crews and Maviks. It's a -counter-drone fight- of sorts. On days of combat work, when we work with Maviks with drops, we manage to destroy (hit) up to 60 occupants. This is with the wounded, who, of course, do not survive. It is about only one Mavik crew. There are other UAVs of the -Height Predators- unmanned systems battalion. They also -slice- rashits daily. When it comes to FPV drone crews, they usually manage to destroy the enemy more. After all, their functionality is only striking the enemy. Our crew is engaged in aerial reconnaissance in parallel. Plus, if we talk about the comprehensive defeat of the enemy by all means of defeat of the -Predators of the Heights- battalion, together with the artillery and infantry units of the brigade, approximately 300-400 enemy personnel are quite realistically destroyed. And this is just for four days on duty. It is in -lite- mode of operation, without any particular stress. Tanks, artillery systems, other heavy armored vehicles of the enemy are affected. One night they flew deep into the battle formations of the Rashists, somewhere up to 3-4 km. The tank was discovered, it was well camouflaged. They -burned- his cannon, which looked. The coordinates of the target were reset to our gunners and that was it. A little later, in the morning, they flew over the area again and noticed that this tank was burning. Or we give the coordinates to our -night bomber-. -Baba Yaga- is already attacking enemy equipment with drops. Interesting work within the limits of counter-battery. The enemy strikes with artillery, our -barriers- are activated. Art systems have been detected in some area of ​​the terrain, -Mavik-, which performs tasks in the air, goes to the given area and transmits the exact coordinates of the enemy's artillery. It can be a self-propelled gun, mortars, towed artillery of the Russian Federation. That is, the coordination of efforts and interaction between different units in the war is a key point. EW is a problem for us. But not always. I will tell one story. Once near the front edge of the enemy, a column of armored vehicles was discovered. the Rashists planned to storm our positions with the help of the MTLB. Our task is to destroy the first piece of machinery. We flew a little closer, visually saw a EW device standing on the -motorcycle-. We fly even closer, observe: the EW is either not working, or they simply did not turn it on. Then the first reset passed near MTLB, the second was already a direct hit. The car caught fire, the occupants ran out of it. Then our FPV drones joined, which finished off the enemy and the equipment. Other enemy vehicles turned around and rushed back. Our -fpvishkas- on the move there -took apart- them, it is much easier for them to attack targets while moving. And if the EW radar works, then you need to quickly fly up, -take- a picture, so that the enemy does not have time to turn on the signal suppression and get to a safe distance from him. Or we just bypass it, any EW device has a range, it can be 300 or 400 meters. The hardest part of the Mavik crew's job is to find well-disguised infantry positions, mortar or artillery nests. The adversary learns and improves as well. There is an understanding that not destroyed in time enemy equipment or accumulations of manpower are possible potential losses of our units. Therefore, only vigilance, concentration and experience. The crew must constantly develop and learn to -precede- the logic of the occupiers. To be more cunning, to come up with new tactical ways of defeating the enemy. If the rain is very heavy, we don't work, because the board can be trivially flooded. He is simply in the sky -short- and that's all - there will be no combat drone. If it's fog, some kind of haze, then we're definitely flying. But in these conditions it is difficult to navigate, you can't see where you are flying, you navigate along the -front-.

- Parachutist robbers: how Russian propagandists created a fake about the 95th ODSHBr	The 95th ODSHBr is a legendary unit of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which deservedly has the reputation of being invincible. In recent years, the paratroopers of this brigade have performed so many feats that the Russians can only look for a way to blacken them. And, as always, instead of the truth, we got a portion of fantasy, which can be described by the phrase: -When you can't win, create a stupid myth.- The essence of the fiction is simple: alleged Ukrainian paratroopers go to the homes of the elderly in the liberated territories and&#8230; robbing them. Propagandists do not specify what exactly they -take- from pensioners. Maybe beets from the cellar or an old TV? But the most interesting thing is that the Russian Telegram channels that promoted this -masterpiece- never even showed photos or videos of the -robbers- - because they themselves understand how ridiculous it sounds. In the liberated territories, on the contrary, the fighters of the 95th help the locals to survive. There are numerous testimonies from residents of Kherson region, Donetsk region, and Kharkiv region about how paratroopers took people out of dangerous zones, brought them food, medicine, and even evacuated their pets. One of these cases happened in Donetsk region: the paratroopers carried an elderly woman who could not move on her own, and carried her several kilometers to a safe zone. Russian propagandists are silent about this, because they do not need the truth - they need a picture that is easy to -sell- to their audience. This is a classic scheme of discrediting: to denigrate those who are models of courage and honor. Russian propaganda tries to -invert- reality, showing the liberators as criminals and their occupiers as -saviors-. However, when in one plot they say that Ukrainians do not have an army, and in another - that the Ukrainian army is so strong that it -bothers- the Russians, a cognitive dissonance arises. If you believe the Russian fakes, then the 95th brigade is not just paratroopers, but universal soldiers. At the same time, they manage to heroically destroy Russian units at the front, rob pensioners and, probably, also launch some -secret drones- in order to interfere with Skabeeva's work. What is there to say? Such a fantasy can only be compared with the scenarios of cheap action movies. Fakes like this are part of the Russian information war aimed at discrediting Ukrainian defenders. But the truth is always stronger than a lie. So while the propagandists paint their myths, the paratroopers of the 95th continue to do their job: to liberate the Ukrainian land and to help the people to whom they gave a chance to live.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/28/grabizhnyky-parashutysty-yak-rosijski-propagandysty-zlipyly-fejk-pro-95-tu-odshbr/	2025-01-27T20:02:21-08:00

Under the new rules, the residents of the region are forced to comply with the illegal tax demands of the occupiers. This creates additional financial pressure, especially on small businesses that are already suffering from repression and lawlessness. The real goal of these so-called reforms is to establish complete financial control over the region's economy. The occupying power optimizes taxation processes, effectively destroying the economic potential of the region and bringing residents to the limit of survival. The National Resistance Center emphasizes that the return of peaceful life and economic justice is possible only after the complete de-occupation of the territory.

The dodger-corrector - in the dark - used his roommate to transmit data to Russia	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. The new suspect turned out to be a 46-year-old local resident who avoided mobilization and at the same time fulfilled the tasks of the FSB. The man was collecting coordinates for air attacks on the positions of the Defense Forces in the Dnipro. To avoid suspicion, the agent involved his roommate in intelligence activities. The woman went around the places designated by him, recorded the geolocations of military objects and transmitted them in the form of marks on Google maps. The attacker explained to her that it was necessary for -work-, although in fact he was unemployed and transferred the collected data to the Russian intelligence services. SBU counter-intelligence detained the traitor in his apartment. A mobile phone with evidence of cooperation with the occupiers was seized from him.

Communal collapse at TOT: the occupiers destroyed the housing and communal sphere	About informs Center of National Resistance. According to the so-called -head of Makiiv district- Vladyslav Klyucharyov, communal services are only 50% staffed. At least 1,500 workers are needed for the stable operation of the water and heat supply systems, but only about 700 people are currently employed. The root of the problem is the criminal mobilization of the male population of conscription age by the occupiers. This led to a significant reduction in labor resources. A similar situation is observed in occupied Luhansk, where only a third of the required public transport drivers go to work. The rest were forcibly mobilized into the Russian army. Currently, the occupiers cannot find even 300 drivers to ensure the minimum functioning of city routes. The National Resistance Center emphasizes that the forced mobilization of the civilian population in the occupied territories is a violation of Articles 49 and 51 of the Geneva Convention on the Protection of the Civilian Population in Time of War. According to these norms, the occupying power does not have the right to compel civilians to serve in its armed forces or to participate in hostilities. Ukraine emphasizes that sooner or later all those involved in these crimes will be brought to justice before the law and the Ukrainian people. As reported by ArmyInform, the Kremlin is trying to consolidate control over temporarily occupied territories, despite the opposition of the local population.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/komunalnyj-kolaps-na-tot-okupanty-zrujnuvaly-zhytlovo-komunalnu-sferu/	2025-01-27T10:50:12-08:00

In Kharkiv, a banker-spy and a speechwriter of Russian propaganda received long terms	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on January 27. One of the convicts is a Russian spy - a 56-year-old citizen of Russia, who simultaneously worked in a local bank and performed the tasks of military intelligence of the Russian Federation (better known as GRU). It was established that he was preparing the coordinates for the aggressor's rocket-bomb attacks on the storage locations of technical documentation, which is necessary for the restoration of industrial facilities in the region. In order to obtain geolocations of potential targets, the Russian -darkly- tried to use his acquaintance - a local official who has access to secret information. In addition, the attacker drove around the city in his own car and recorded on a hidden video recorder the location of the defenders of Kharkiv. The counterintelligence of the SBU timely exposed the Russian spy and detained him in 2024. Taking into account his cooperation with the investigation, the court sentenced him to 10 years of imprisonment with confiscation of property. Another convict is a 42-year-old resident of Kharkiv, who prepared theses for the public speeches of the Russian -military corps-.

Consequences of Russian occupation: what will happen if the enemy enters our homes. The experience o...	Among many examples, one of the most revealing is the division of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which took place at the end of the 18th century. Until recently, the powerful Poland lost its statehood and was absorbed by the Russian Empire for more than a century. And now the Kremlin dictator says that it was created thanks to -comrade Stalin-. ArmiyaInform reminds us of the historical lessons of such events, of what the Russian occupation was and what it led to. It is this example that clearly demonstrates what the capture of Kyiv can be like and what will happen to Ukrainians and Ukraine in the event of capitulation. And it all started with the Northern War of 1700-1721. It was during this armed conflict that, entering into an alliance against Sweden with the Muscovite kingdom, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth allowed the -protectorate- of Moscow to be imposed on itself. At the beginning, the Treaty of Narva, which was signed on August 30, 1704, stipulated that the eastern ally would support King Augustus II with a 12,000-strong auxiliary army corps and annual financial assistance of 200,000 rubles. After the victory of the Muscovites in the Northern War and the proclamation of the All-Russian Empire, its influence and appetites are growing rapidly. Throughout the 18th century, Russian soldiers went to Poland -like dogs to the kitchen.- And with each of their -special military operations-, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth became more and more dependent on its -eternal ally-. The culmination was the coup d'état of 1764 carried out -on Russian bayonets- and the -appointment- of Catherine II's lover, Stanislav-August Poniatovsky, by the king of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, who pursued a pro-Russian policy until the end of his 30-year reign. A weak Poland was beneficial to all its neighbors, and especially to the Russian Empire. Catherine II sought to preserve the -protectorate- over the entire Polish territory and further limit her sovereign rights. Despite this, in 1768 it even provided the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth with guarantees of territorial integrity! But already in a few years, as expected, she violated her obligations. the Russian army, which was constantly on the territory of the Commonwealth of Independent States, severely punished any attempts at anti-Russian demonstrations. She drowned the Bar confederation, Koliiv region, Šiauliai uprising in blood, took control of the church, the Diet, and forced a small crown army to carry out her orders. Turkey, which supported the barbarian confederates, began to demand from Russia to stop interfering in the internal affairs of the Commonwealth of Independent States and to withdraw its troops. Finally, without waiting for any reaction, in October 1768 The Ottoman Empire declared war on Russia. For Russia, the costs of maintaining the -Polish protectorate- against the armed resistance of the Confederates and the Ottomans turned out to be too high. And in Petersburg they did not invent anything better, like&#8230; division of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth between its neighbors. Prussia and Austria also took part in the partition, because it was important to -preserve the balance of power-&#8230; On August 5, 1772, authorized representatives of the -balance-forming- countries signed a treaty in St. Petersburg, according to which the so-called -sanitary strips- were annexed, i.e., the territories along the perimeter of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Kingdom of Prussia took Pomorie, Kuyavia and part of Greater Poland with a total area of ​​36,000. km² with a population of 580,000 persons Habsburg Monarchy - Lesser Poland and Galicia with Rus, Belz and the western outskirts of Volyn and Podil Voivodeships, a territory of 83,000 km² with 2,650,000 residents (since then, the Austrian period of the history of Lviv and the region began, which lasted until November 1, 1918). And the Russian Empire - East Belarusian lands with Polotsk, Vitebsk and Mstislavl, as well as part of Livland (Latvia), a total of 92 thousand. km² with 1,300,000 population. On September 30, 1773, the Russian-controlled Sejm ratified the agreement on the division of the lands of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which gave -legitimacy- to these annexations. During the years 1773–1792, supporters of reforms tried in vain to save the remnants of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and to strengthen the state. The four-year Sejm (1788–1792), initiated by a group of patriotic reformers led by Hugo Collontaiy, adopted a Constitution on May 3, 1791, which introduced a hereditary monarchy (instead of an elected one that existed before that) and personal liberties and equal rights for all citizens. The restriction of status privileges caused dissatisfaction among a part of the magnates and nobility, who formed a separatist confederation in 1792 in the town of Torgovytsa (on the then Russian border), and called for the help of Catherine II. As expected, Catherine II reacted quickly. She ordered General Kachowski's troops to enter Poland, and General Krechetnikov's to Lithuania. Fighting broke out. Catherine II was supported by the Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm II in the invasion of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. For about three months, the Polish army put up a desperate resistance. But under the pressure of forces that had a significant advantage, King Stanislav Augustus was forced to capitulate and submit to the demands of the invaders. The new, completely pro-Russian Diet, convened in the city of Grodno, announced the abolition of the -May 3- Constitution. Garrisons of Russian and Prussian troops were stationed in major cities of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, including its capital, Warsaw. The Polish army was to be significantly reduced, many units were supposed to be disbanded. In December 1792, Catherine II and Friedrich Wilhelm II agreed on a new, second division of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. On April 9, 1793, its conditions were announced: Prussia received Greater Poland with the cities of Poznań, Toruń, and Gdansk, and Russia received Eastern Belarus and Right-Bank Ukraine. In September 1793, the terms of partition were adopted by the Polish Sejm, which was controlled by separatist merchants and occupiers. At the end of 1793, the situation was as follows. Russian troops committed numerous robberies combined with political repression. There was an economic and financial collapse of the state - the seven largest banks in Warsaw went bankrupt, food prices rose. The new government introduced censorship, banning criticism of the Diet, Catherine II, her military and civil servants. A significant amount of the press was liquidated, banned books were removed from bookstores. Cultural contacts with Western Europe were interrupted - the country was artificially fenced off with an -iron curtain-. Despite this, far from all Poles came to terms with the actual occupation of what was left of their state, society carried out a social boycott of Russians. Secret societies were organized everywhere, which set themselves the goal of preparing a general uprising. The leader of this movement was General Tadeusz Kosciuszko, a participant in the American Revolution, who was in exile, the center of which was Saxony (Dresden and Leipzig). It was recognized that it was necessary to establish a military dictatorship in Poland and entrust it to Kosciuszko. It was the last chance to save independence&#8230; The rebellion began on 12 March 1794 with the mutiny of General Antony Madalinsky's cavalry brigade, which refused to obey the decision to disband it. Other parts of the army of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth began to join the rebels. A few days later, Madalinski's cavalry took control of Kraków, which became the center of the uprising. On March 24, the Act was published there, which proclaimed the slogans of the full restoration of Polish sovereignty, the return of the territories rejected in 1772 and 1793, the continuation of the reforms initiated by the Four-Year Sejm, granted Kosciuszko the title of supreme commander of the national armed forces, and transferred all power to his hands. The movement was supported by broad sections of the population, the formation and arming of insurgent units began everywhere. April 4, 1794 in the battle near Roslavice, the Poles managed to inflict the first tangible defeat on the Russians and believed in the possibility of victory. The focus of the struggle quickly spread to other regions: Warsaw was liberated on April 17-18, and Vilna on April 22-23. Kosciuszko announced a general mobilization. The quantitative composition of the rebel army was brought to 70 thousand, but a significant part of it was armed with spears and scythes. Despite this, by May the rebels had established control over most of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Soon after recovering, Prussia, Austria and Russia decided to suppress the uprising by armed means and force the Poles to recognize the partition of Poland. They began to invade the territory of the country from five directions. Since July 13, 1794, the siege of Warsaw by Russian and Prussian troops continued. On October 9, the Russian corps of General Ivan Ferzen defeated the main forces of the rebel forces in the Battle of Maciewovice near the town of Siedlce in eastern Poland. Tadeusz Kosciuszko was seriously wounded and captured. Of the 10,000 rebels who took part in the battle, only two thousand managed to reach Warsaw. The news about the disaster near Maceiovytsi caused panic in the capital. The main strategic point of the city's defense against Russian troops was Prague, the right-bank part of Warsaw. On November 6, 1794, Suvorov's troops launched an assault and, breaking the resistance of the defenders, began to destroy the civilian population with barbaric cruelty. Up to 20,000 people died as a result of the wave of killings that lasted several hours. This act finally broke the rebellion and led its leaders to surrender. The defeat of Tadeusz Kosciuszko's rebellion led to the third partition of Poland in 1795 and the complete liquidation of Polish statehood. This example demonstrates that everyone must fight to prevent what happened to Poland in 1794. Or even worse, because over time, the Russians' methods of warfare become even more barbaric. Everyone will have to fight: only now for the Motherland, or later on the side of the invader. And when Russian troops occupy our country and prepare a further offensive -on NATO-, forced mobilization by field -military commissars- of the Russian Federation will begin. Hardly anyone will speak against this then, because the alternative will be executions, repression, torture, forced labor in the -permafrost-&#8230; So do we want to live under Russian occupation, in eternal fear? The Poles did not want either, but they resisted for only eight months and lost their statehood for 123 years. We are now much stronger, more numerous and more motivated than they were then. We have been resisting for much longer and know very well that victory depends on each of us.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/naslidky-rosokupacziyi-shho-bude-yakshho-vorog-zajde-v-nashi-domivky-dosvid-polshhi/	2025-01-27T09:18:26-08:00

Earlier, ArmiyaInform showed how fighters of the 73rd SSO center in Kurshchyna kurshhyni/->hit the enemy's personnel and equipment by all available means.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/svoyih-vse-taky-kydayut-dron-speczpryznachencziv-zahopyv-u-polon-pokynutogo-vijskamy-rf-rosiyanyna/	2025-01-27T03:01:01-08:00
10 days under heavy fire: how Air Force fighters restrained the enemy in Kurshchyna	About how the fighters held a strategically important position, told in the Command of the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Enemy reconnaissance drones and FPV drones monitored almost every step, the artillery was relentless, and there were mines and unexploded ordnance everywhere. Explosions rang out almost every second. A group of servicemen from the Combined Rifle Brigade was tasked with occupying and holding a designated sector until reinforcements arrived. The senior of the group was 28-year-old junior sergeant Ruslan, the oldest among his brothers. The night before going to the position was extremely stressful. The enemy met the aircraft with fire, the KAB destroyed a nearby building. Some were checking weapons, some were joking about -finally over the border- to hide their anxiety. -If everything goes well, we will return in 7-10 days,- Ruslan tried to reassure his brothers. But -if- was the key word here. Getting to the position was extremely dangerous. The soldiers walked for several kilometers in full ammunition, with ammunition and provisions. They didn't even walk, but ran and crawled, moving past ruins, burned equipment and bodies — a familiar picture for our military, but this time on the territory of Russia. -Each action has its consequences&#8230; As they say, you can play this game together,- the fighters commented on what they saw. Daily enemy assaults awaited them ahead. -Right now the fate of the country is being decided,- everyone understood. The first shooting battle lasted more than two hours. The Russians pressed with weapons and psychologically, shouting: -Get out! Let's take it in a circle!-. Ruslan supported his people: -Sectors, we hold! Let's knock them down!-. The second battle began in a few hours and continued for ten days: endless anti-aircraft guns, artillery, drones, airdrops, DRGs, assault groups. -Each bush could respond with an automatic queue.- The enemy tried to storm the position several times a day. With incredible efforts, the soldiers of the Combined Rifle Brigade held the sector until problems with ammunition arose. Exiting the position became a separate difficult operation, because the evacuation groups were always a target for the enemy. Unfortunately, one of the soldiers of the brigade, Serhii, who had previously served in the search and rescue service, died during the departure from the UAV. -Is it difficult to coordinate the actions of people who have no prior experience of ground combat?- Ruslan was asked. -No, because these are really motivated young guys. They were worthy specialists in the Air Force and became cool infantrymen! More than once, we experienced real hell together, when the enemy tried to destroy us every minute, and we, in return, tried to prevent him from doing it by all the means known to us,- he answered. Ruslan and his comrades have been fighting side by side in the eastern direction for more than nine months, they have seen heavy losses, kilometers of scorched earth and treachery of the enemy. -Here, in the infantry, we do our best!- - he emphasized. Ruslan, who started serving in the Air Force in 2016 and participated in ATO/OS, understood what he was getting into. After his release in 2020, he briefly returned to civilian life. Now he, although a junior sergeant, commands a platoon and is ready for new challenges. The only thing he regrets is that his two-year-old daughter only sees her dad via video link. But he is sure that one day she will understand what he is fighting for - for her future. As reported by ArmyInform, the officer of the Air Force -Major- told how the soldiers of the Air Force protect the country from the invaders, what tasks they perform on the front lines as part of the ground component of the troops and how they take the enemy prisoner.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/10-dniv-pid-shkvalnym-vognem-yak-bijczi-povitryanyh-syl-strymuvaly-voroga-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-27T02:52:02-08:00
Mission planning of UAV crews: the Mission Control module has become available to all DELTA users	About informs on January 27, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Mission Control also collects and analyzes data from missions, reduces the risks of -friendly fire- and helps to establish more accurate interaction between units. To date, the module has been used by more than 300 units. Every day, thanks to Mission Control, 900 missions were carried out, and over 200,000 during the entire existence of the module. -Mission Control is an important step forward in the development of the DELTA ecosystem and modern military technologies,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Digitalization. According to her, this module not only provides a high level of digitalization and decision-making support in complex combat conditions, but also opens up opportunities for the introduction of new management processes in the army. Mission Control interacts with DELTA's other tools, namely the Monitor situational awareness module and the Vezha battlefield video analysis platform. This creates a unified information picture for the effective use of UAVs, the successful completion of missions and the destruction of the enemy.

One against ten: how -Kipish- repelled the attack of the Wagnerites who surrounded his position	The soldier's story was published on page 33 of a separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Kipish- went to the front with a firm conviction: -Everything is simple - to chase the enemy who is encroaching on our territory. And in the trenches, and in the landings, and in the cities. We don't need him here.- His combat path ran through the Kherson region, where he was always ahead, in intelligence. Then there were Bakhmut and Klishchiivka, Zaporizhzhia, and now he is defending Ukraine near Kurakhovo. One of the fiercest episodes occurred during a clash with the fighters of the -Wagner- PMK. The Russian attack aircraft operated tactically, in small groups of 10, trying to surround the position. Armed only with an assault rifle, a few magazines, grenades and equipment, Kipish was able to repel the attack. The enemies died one by one, because they advanced wave after wave, without counting their own losses and without taking away their dead. -They don't care. They went and did not pick up their corpses. For them, the main thing is to fight back and keep moving, moving, moving. Assault, assault, assault. So, when the enemy sneaks up, you need to shoot accurately, keep on the defensive, and don't panic. Panic is contagious. Or you will have to leave,- Kipish shares his experience. Friend -Kipish- is convinced: the only way to Victory is to destroy the enemy without stopping, giving no chance to consolidate. His battle credo sounds simple and resolute: -Cover them all with concrete.- Destroy the Russians. This will bring us closer to Victory.- As reported by ArmiyaInform, a fighter of the 9th border detachment named after Sich Riflemen under the pseudonym -RE.K.S.- came to the defense of Ukraine in the first hours after the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, despite the fact that he was born in Leningrad and is a Russian by nationality.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/odyn-proty-desyaty-yak-kipish-vidbyv-ataku-vagnerivcziv-shho-otochyly-jogo-pozycziyu/	2025-01-27T01:44:35-08:00

An enemy gunner was detained: he worked for the Russian Federation in the Kramatorsk district	This was reported on January 27 by the Prosecutor General's Office. According to the investigation, a native of Slovyansk, who had been living in Moscow for a long time, returned to Donetsk region two weeks before the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into the territory of Ukraine. In 2024, he was contacted in the Telegram messenger by an acquaintance - a military officer of the DNR. He asked to send him information of a military nature, which he planned to use during the offensive in the Kramatorsk direction.

Danylo Borysenko, head of reconnaissance of the anti-aircraft missile and artillery division of the -Rubizh- brigade. According to him, the enemy's tactics differ in different areas of the front, because different units use personal composition and equipment. However, in general, the main trend is clear — attacks by small infantry groups without the use of armored vehicles. -They are trying to infiltrate the landings, into some separate buildings and accumulate personnel there for further advancement. A group of four or five people is put forward, two get to land, because three have already been hit by FPV drones from our side. If they manage to survive for some time, then the next group is put forward to join them, and then the next,- said Dmytro Borysenko. According to him, the main task is to have time to work on the enemy and inflict maximum losses on him while still on the way to the front line. -They invent anything: they try to jump in on motorcycles and buggies. There was a case when two Zhiguli tried to reach us from the enemy's side. The first model of the Zhiguli and the second is a station wagon. All of them were impressed by our FPV,- said the intelligence chief of the anti-aircraft missile and artillery division of the Rubizh brigade. As reported AmriyaInform, in the Lyman direction, the enemy practically does not resort to mechanized assaults on the positions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. However, he sends small assault groups of 2-3 people to attack almost around the clock.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/rozmah-na-karbovanecz-a-udar-kopijkoyu-rosiyany-atakuvaly-nashi-pozycziyi-dvoma-stareznymy-zhygulyamy/	2025-01-27T00:48:34-08:00
The motorcycle blitzkrieg failed: the Armed Forces of Ukraine repelled the Russian attack in the Kra...	The video of combat work was published on the brigade's page. Russian troops involved a motorcycle group consisting of four crossbikes in the assault. Counting on the speed and maneuverability of the motorcycles, the enemy planned to imperceptibly bypass the positions of the Ukrainian defenders and strike from an unexpected direction. However, thanks to the timely work of the aerial reconnaissance of the 5th assault brigade, the plans of the occupiers were thwarted. Ukrainian drones detected the enemy group in time and coordinated fire to destroy it. At first, artillery with cluster ammunition worked on motorcyclists. And for the final elimination of the enemy group, FPV drones were used. A Russian attack aircraft was destroyed by a well-aimed strike from one of the drones, which forced the rest of the motorcyclists to stop and seek shelter. The enemy's attempts to break through the defense did not end there. The occupiers sent an additional motorcycle group and even a tank for reinforcements. However, even these forces successfully struck the Ukrainian defenders. As reported by ArmyInform, operators of the Phoenix 5 unit of the Kyiv assault brigade showed a series of blows on the enemy's hiding places.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/motoczykletnyj-bliczkryg-ne-vdavsya-zsu-vidbyly-ataku-rosiyan-na-kramatorskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-27T00:39:45-08:00

Sergei and his anti-aircraft gun: how a fighter turns hatred of the enemy into action	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -Kobzariv's -wide field deer- have always been something sacred to me. I loved my job, but the feeling that our land is under threat became unbearable,- says the fighter. Despite his Azerbaijani surname, Serhiy grew up in independent Ukraine under the blue and yellow flag. His grandfather is from the Caucasus, but his father is Ukrainian, who raised him with love for his native land. -I don't understand those who are afraid to take up arms. I went to war not to die for Ukraine, but to kill its enemies,- Serhii shares frankly. During two years of service, Serhiy gained a lot of combat experience. His 23 mm anti-aircraft system successfully shot down enemy drones, including the Lancet and Zala, and worked on the positions of the occupiers. -When our work was recognized, it was very motivating. You understand that you are not just following orders, but actually changing the course of the war,- he says. Serhiy feels a deep hatred for the enemy, especially after Buchi, Mariupol and the attacks on peaceful cities. -Every day the occupiers give even more reasons to hate them. We want not just to stop this evil, but to pay back for all our losses,- says the soldier. Today Serhiy wears a sergeant's epaulettes and trains his brothers in a new infantry unit. -The boys are still a little skeptical about my drill, but I hope they will understand later: all this is to survive and return home. We must be able to use every minute on the training ground for training and training,- he is convinced. Despite the war, Serhiy dreams of the future of a free and peaceful Ukraine. He wants to start a family and raise children in a country where sirens will not be heard. His strength of spirit, love for the Motherland and responsibility for the future make him an example for everyone who fights for the freedom of Ukraine. -Our future is in our hands.

The hottest border in the north — Sumyshchyna is under attack by enemy drones and saboteurs	The spokesperson of the State Border Service told about this on the broadcast of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- Andriy Demchenko of Ukraine. According to Demchenko, the length of the border with a terrorist country allows the enemy to constantly look for new routes by which he launches his UAVs. But most of these routes pass through the Sumy region. As well as the ways of enemy sabotage and intelligence groups. -The enemy did not give up conducting sabotage activities on this stretch. Again, the enemy is most actively trying to enter our territory through the Sumy region. At the same time, the threat from enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups does not disappear for Chernihiv Oblast and Kharkiv Oblast,- said the spokesperson of the State Border Service of Ukraine.

Weeds as an excuse for looting: the occupiers simplify the expropriation of land from residents of t...	This was reported by the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, Artem Lysogor. According to the new rules, it will be enough for the inspectors to identify the so-called unused plot in order to start the process of its -nationalization-. At the same time, the criteria of -non-use- are extremely vague and create a wide field for abuse by the occupation authorities. According to the head of the Luhansk OVA, land can be lost even due to ordinary clutter or the presence of weeds over one meter high. -If the inspectors see an unused plot, they can issue a fine and start the procedure of its so-called nationalization. The land can be lost, for example, due to its littering with garbage and the presence of weeds over 1 m high,- the report says. In effect, this means that the occupying power receives practically unlimited powers to seize private property from the inhabitants of the occupied territories. Vague wording allows any plot to be interpreted as -unused-, creating a constant threat of property loss for the local population. This step is another example of violation of human rights and norms of international law by the occupying power. The simplified -nationalization- procedure is actually a legalized robbery under the guise of -fighting mismanagement.- The situation raises serious concerns about the fate of the residents of the occupied Luhansk Region, who are at risk of losing not only their homes, but also their land, which is often their only source of livelihood. It may also lead to an even greater humanitarian crisis in the territory, which is already suffering from the consequences of Russian aggression.

In Ukraine, a course was held on the training of specialists of escort services for military personn...	During the training, they told how to organize interaction and support of wounded servicemen during their treatment and rehabilitation. It was explained how family members of the deceased are accompanied when they apply for the benefits specified by the law. -The Ministry of Defense, together with the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, introduced the service of escorting servicemen. This service should become an institution that will help military personnel and their families to solve key issues related to receiving medical, psychological, legal and social assistance. The training project started in 10 combat brigades. Specialized training for the first group has already been conducted,- Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Brigadier General of Justice Serhii Melnyk noted. As volunteer Olena Sherzhukova, co-founder of Help Army, said, -the issue of training such specialists is extremely urgent. We prepared such a training program, the necessary lecturers and trainers and worked with existing teams, where there are really enthusiasts for this business, where there are people who are involved not by orders, but also by the call of the heart.- Colonel Oleksandr Kutkov, the head of the Central Security Service of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, noted that -conducting such courses is extremely necessary and important for the exchange of experience and the acquisition of opportunities by our support services, which will allow us to perform tasks as effectively as possible within the framework of social support and provide assistance to servicemen who are undergoing treatment, rehabilitation, and members of their families, including including the families of missing, captured, and deceased servicemen.- The officer added that during the training he talked with the present representatives from combat military units: -The course was very useful for them. We revealed the concept of general communication, general information within the framework of providing assistance to servicemen, how to improve interaction between escort services within the military unit and external service providers that are relevant to the organization of escorting our servicemen.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/v-ukrayini-provedeno-kurs-z-pidgotovky-fahivcziv-sluzhb-suprovodu-vijskovosluzhbovcziv-ta-chleniv-yihnih-simej/	2025-01-26T22:25:25-08:00
In Dnipro, as a result of the Russian attack, three high-rise buildings were damaged	informs the head of Dnipropetrovsk OVA Serhiy Lysak about this. -In the evening and during the night, units of the East Air Force destroyed 13 drones in the Dnipropetrovsk region. However, the enemy attack did not pass without consequences. Infrastructure is damaged in the Samarivsky district. There was a fire. Three private houses and an outbuilding were also damaged,- the report said. Three high-rise buildings were also damaged in Dnipro. One of them caught fire, but it was extinguished by rescuers. In addition, the occupiers hit Nikopol region with Grad anti-aircraft guns and heavy artillery. We kissed around the district center and the Marganets community. There is destruction on the territory of the industrial enterprise. As reported by ArmyInform, during the day, the occupiers inflicted 263 blows on in 11 settlements of the Zaporizhzhia region, as a result of which 18 reports were received about damage to private houses and apartments.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/u-dnipri-vnaslidok-rosijskoyi-ataky-pobyti-try-bagatopoverhivky/	2025-01-26T22:21:08-08:00
In the Pokrovsky direction, the occupiers intensified the use of armored vehicles	On January 25, the officer of the information and communication service 14 told about this on the ArmyTV stream on January 25. Maksym Bakulin of the operational assignment brigade named after Ivan Bohun -Red viburnum- of the National Guard. -Now in the Pokrovsky direction, there are constant battles, around the clock the enemy is trying to advance, using various tactics,- Maksym Bakulin noted. He paid special attention to the change in the approach of the occupiers to the use of manpower and equipment. If earlier the enemy relied more often on infantry, now there is a tendency to increase the use of heavy and all-terrain vehicles. -Their assaults became more frequent precisely with the help of technology. They use less manpower than before, and use more heavy and off-road vehicles,- the press officer emphasized. This information is important because, as the presenter noted, many speakers from other units in the Pokrovsky direction rarely reported a significant amount of enemy equipment. Maxim Bakulin explained this by the features of the terrain in his brigade's area of ​​responsibility: the presence of paths suitable for vehicles. -In the area of ​​responsibility of my brigade, in those settlements, it is currently possible to pass by vehicles, there is a lot of traffic. They began to bring personnel as close as possible. Earlier, they sent them more often on foot, now in most cases they bring them as close as possible, drop them off and try to fight under the cover of barrel artillery and volley fire systems,- the officer explained. Regarding the size of enemy vehicle columns, Maxim Bakulin clarified that these are usually small columns consisting of two tanks, such as T-72 and T-90, which lead the column, drop off personnel, shoot back and leave. However, as the officer noted, they do not always manage to withdraw completely, as the Ukrainian defenders put up a decent fightback, and some equipment remains on the battlefield. Thus, the situation in the Pokrovsky direction remains tense. The enemy is constantly looking for new ways to break through defenses, changing tactics and increasing the use of equipment. However, the Ukrainian military continues to courageously defend its positions, inflicting significant losses on the occupiers. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupying forces are trying to najgaryachishomu-napryamku/->bypass Pokrovsk from the west to cut important routes and force Ukrainian troops to retreat.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-okupanty-aktyvizuvaly-vykorystannya-bronetehniky/	2025-01-26T22:16:59-08:00

What to expect from the enemy in 2025: an expert on Russia's capabilities in the Black Sea and Crime...	About the combat potential of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation and enemy groups in the Crimea, the available combat capabilities of the enemy in the Azov-Black Sea region as of the beginning of 2025, military expert, retired captain 1st rank, candidate of military sciences, associate professor Stepan Yakymyak told ArmyInform in an interview . —How will the enemy operate at sea in 2025? Does it have sufficient capabilities to seize the initiative and change the nature of actions in maritime spaces to its advantage? What exactly can the enemy oppose to the strikes of the Defense Forces in the Black Sea and will its actions be successful? — The development of the situation in military operations at sea in 2025 will be influenced, first of all, by the consequences of the actions of the parties in the previous period, in particular in 2024. Considering the results of the previous year, it is important to emphasize that in 2024 the Defense Forces of Ukraine achieved a new large-scale success at sea. They forced the enemy to withdraw from the Crimea to the eastern part of the sea the entire combat composition of the surface and underwater forces of the Black Sea Fleet. But at the end of the year, Ukraine surprised the whole world with new unique military operations at sea. Let us briefly recall them. From December 6 to 7, the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, for the first time in world practice, carried out a combined attack with the simultaneous use of at least four different types of air and sea drones, one of which was an FPV-type UAV carrier, and destroyed enemy objects and manpower on gas production platforms near the coast of Crimea. From December 5 to 6, the Security Service of Ukraine, using unmanned surface vehicles equipped with large-caliber machine guns, damaged enemy helicopters in the Kerch Strait region during the battle, in which, in addition to helicopters, enemy aircraft and patrol boats also participated. On December 31, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine destroyed two and damaged one enemy helicopter near Cape Tarkhankut, located on the western coast of Crimea, using missiles from unmanned surface vehicles for the first time in the world. With these robotic operations, the Defense Forces of Ukraine proved their superiority over the enemy and the possibility of destroying any of his forces deployed at sea. In fact, the enemy's capabilities remain very limited. Most likely, the enemy will not conduct active operations at sea in 2025. The exception will be strikes by sea-based Kalibr cruise missiles from coastal areas near Novorossiysk. He will also try to involve naval aviation and coastal missile forces in actions for the defense of Crimea and defend the areas of the base of forces against strikes from the sea and from the air. In the end, it should be emphasized that in 2025, the enemy will not be able to seize the initiative or at least somehow change the nature of actions at sea in their favor. — Not only recognized foreign experts, but also representatives of the military and political leadership of the leading countries of the world are talking about the successes achieved by Ukraine in the war at sea in 2022-2024 and the revolutionary innovations in military affairs demonstrated at the same time. In your opinion, do and how exactly can the already achieved results of military operations at sea affect the military-political situation around Ukraine in 2025 and the possibilities for a just end to the war? - Of course, changes in the situation at various strategic directions, or in other words, on different fronts, can worsen or improve the general the situation regarding the defense of the state in the war. Now we can clearly state that the successful actions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine at sea are a factor contributing to the state's defense capability and its support from our foreign partners. And it is not only about moral and psychological or image factors. First, the achieved advantage over the enemy at sea forces it to redistribute its own strategic defense resources, including financial, material, change priority and distribution along strategic directions. Secondly, in the military context, the loss of control over the maritime spaces around Crimea, in the Kerch Strait and near the Black Sea coast of the Krasnodar Territory of the Russian Federation necessitates the strengthening of comprehensive defense, primarily anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft, as well as counterintelligence, economic and other measures in these territories. At the same time, this is a diversion of significant resources from other areas of action. Thirdly, the successful actions of the Defense Forces at sea can lead to the complete isolation of the temporarily occupied Crimea from the sea, and the cutting of communications with the mainland - to its liberation and the Russian Federation losing its center of gravity in operations in southern Ukraine. In addition, some experts are inclined to believe that in the event of negotiations to end the war, Ukraine's superiority at sea could be an important counter-argument in the discussion on territorial control. Similar to the situation regarding the control over the territories in the Kursk Oblast of the Russian Federation, the control by the Defense Forces of Ukraine of the maritime spaces within the territorial sea of ​​both Ukraine and the Russian Federation and their exclusive (maritime) economic zones in the Black Sea is, of course, a factor that strengthens the position of Ukraine . Summing up, it can be confidently asserted that Ukraine's successes in operations at sea are an important component of the future victory over the enemy in war. After all, the Russians have practically nothing to oppose the Defense Forces of Ukraine in a war at sea. - What capabilities do the adversary have from performing the tasks listed above in military operations at sea? - First of all, let's consider the adversary's strike capabilities at sea. The conducted analysis testifies to a 25% reduction in the ability to strike sea-based cruise missiles with a range of up to 1,500 km against ground targets. As it is known, this happened as a result of the destruction of two small missile ships -Zyklon- and -Askold-, as well as significant damage to the large submarine -Rostov-on-Don-. There was also a decrease in the striking capabilities of surface ships with anti-ship missile damage by 38%. This was facilitated by the destruction of a missile cruiser and a missile boat. At the same time, there was no reduction in the strike capabilities of the enemy's coastal missile forces, which include two coastal missile brigades located in Crimea and near Novorossiysk, which are capable of simultaneously launching 112 anti-ship missiles. Of these, 48 missiles have a firing range of 800 km and 64 missiles have a firing range of 260 km. Also, the enemy has almost completely preserved the strike capabilities of naval aviation. However, it should be emphasized that due to the current lack of large warships in the Black Sea fleet of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the enemy's ability to strike with anti-ship missiles by the forces of missile ships and coastal missile units remains unused and does not affect the course and results of actions on the sea - And how do you assess the enemy's naval amphibious capabilities, especially taking into account that they can be used for enemy sea transport? - Analysis of the enemy's naval amphibious capabilities shows critical losses in amphibious ships and boats and the enemy's loss of the ability to landings of operational and tactical marine landings. Based on the real conditions that have developed as a result of the successful strikes of the Defense Forces of Ukraine at sea, it can be argued that the Russians do not have the opportunity to conduct any naval amphibious operations and significant sea transportation. To be specific, according to the results of actions at sea, as of now, the enemy's naval amphibious capabilities are characterized by a decrease in the number of amphibious ships and boats - by 61%. 7 units were destroyed, including 4 large amphibious ships, 3 amphibious boats. In addition, 3 large amphibious ships were significantly damaged and are currently undergoing long-term repairs. The combined capacity to transport landing troops decreased by more than 54%. It is important to emphasize the significant reduction of the enemy's ability to prepare and use the marines as an advanced detachment of marine landing forces intended to capture the landing bridgehead. After all, it is known that as a result of the constant involvement of the 810th Marine Infantry Brigade of the Russian Federation in the capacity of mechanized units in the composition of ground groups of troops and significant losses in the personnel of the brigade, in particular in Kurshchyna, this unit is not suitable for operations as intended. In general, as a result of the strikes of the Defense Forces of Ukraine against the enemy's shock and naval landing forces, the loss of combat capability of four main units of the Russian Armed Forces was achieved. Added to this were losses due to the closure of the Bosphorus to warships with the start of a full-scale military invasion. Because of this, as is known, only one frigate, one small missile ship and two large submarines remained from the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation in the Mediterranean Sea. Thus, in total, 30 divisions of surface ships, 41 brigades of missile ships and boats, 4 brigades of submarines, 197 brigades of amphibious ships lost at least 30% of their combat personnel. In addition, and this is very important, the enemy suffered losses in special, supply and management capabilities. After all, they directly or indirectly affect the results of the use of forces at sea! - Can you give some detail about which additional capabilities of the enemy in sea operations were reduced in the previous period? - In the course of military operations at sea, in particular in 2022, the enemy actively engaged in sabotage and reconnaissance activities. Using Snake Island and gas production platforms as advanced minibases, the enemy made almost daily attempts to land sabotage and reconnaissance groups on the Ukrainian coast. It is natural that in the subsequent actions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, efforts were focused on the fight against these units and the special capabilities of the enemy were reduced. Thus, as a result of the strikes, a significant number of personnel of special units and more than 10 special purpose boats were destroyed, including the boats of projects: 03160 of the -Raptor- type, 21980 of the -Grachenok- type, 12150 of the -Mongoose- type, 02800 of the -Tavr- type, KS -701 of the -Tuna- type. - How do you assess the enemy's logistical and management capabilities in the Black Sea? Kerch Strait. As a result of these strikes, the transportation of personnel and material, including heavy military equipment, was restricted for a long time by the road and rail parts of the bridge, and the operation of the ferry crossing was suspended due to the damage to two ferries, one of which sank. Attention should also be paid to the use of the Crimean Peninsula as a logistics hub, i.e. a set of logistics hubs and centers, for the comprehensive support of Russian military groups (forces) in the Black Sea region, in particular those based in Crimea. Also, this logistics ensures the actions of enemy troops in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. So influencing her is essential. At the same time, it can be asserted that as a result of the strikes of the Defense Forces of Ukraine on the missile cruiser -Moskva-, the command post of the Russian Armed Forces in the village of Verkhnyosadove and the headquarters of the Russian Armed Forces in Sevastopol, other important facilities in Crimea significantly reduced the ability to control enemy forces at sea and in Crimea. After all, at least three main control points of the operational link were destroyed or damaged, and the control points of the Sevastopol and Crimean naval bases are probably not in use due to the withdrawal of forces to Novorossiysk. Losses in trained management personnel should also be taken into account. After all, in the course of destroying and damaging control points of the operational-strategic and operational levels, the enemy suffered certain losses in the operative composition of these control points. Any replacements in the leadership of the fleet also have a negative impact, which has also happened several times with the command of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation! —Recently, we have been observing systematic strikes by missile weapons and strike drones on targets in Crimea and the Krasnodar Territory of the Russian Federation. Could you share your assessment of the capabilities of the enemy's military groups operating in the Crimea? - Of course, in order to provide a more complete assessment of the enemy's capabilities for operations at sea and from the sea, its capabilities to defend the Crimean peninsula should be taken into account. After the occupation of Crimea in 2014, the Russian Federation formed the 126th Coastal Defense Brigade as part of the Russian Armed Forces, and later the 32nd Army Corps. Also, a number of units of the Russian Guard, other security agencies of the Russian Federation and types of armed forces were deployed in Crimea. It is clear that an echeloned system of enemy defense has been created in both areas that connect Crimea with the southern regions of Ukraine (Perekop and Chongar) with the aim of preventing the breakthrough of Ukrainian army groups to Crimea. In addition to what we often see in the photos in the Telegram channels, elements of the anti-aircraft defense system of the peninsula have been created in the amphibious areas on the coast of Crimea, designated beach areas and other areas. However, in my opinion, conducted in 2022-2024 Sea raids by the special operations forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and units of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine in several areas of the Crimean Peninsula have shown the presence of weak points in the defense system of Crimea created by the enemy. These facts are also confirmed by the actions of the resistance forces in the temporarily occupied territory of Crimea in conducting reconnaissance, exposing the enemy's facilities and the actions of his forces (troops). It should also be emphasized the constant reduction in the capabilities of air defense forces, which are engaged by the enemy to protect the Air Force, other forces and troops, important facilities in Crimea, as a result of systematic strikes by the Defense Forces of Ukraine. Although the military leadership of the Russian Federation regularly conducts measures to restore the air defense system of Crimea, the number of sets of forces and air defense vehicles detached from other directions will probably decrease with each subsequent time. Summing up this brief analysis of the enemy's capabilities to defend Crimea, it should be noted that this direction is most likely one of the key priorities of the Russian leadership in the war against Ukraine and the implementation of its own expansionist neo-imperial policy in the Mediterranean region. — What do you think are the possible directions for strengthening the enemy's capabilities in the Black Sea? How realistic are his plans for the creation and use of marine unmanned surface and underwater complexes? Can the capabilities of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation be increased at the expense of forces from outside the Black Sea? — It is clear that the enemy is trying to draw conclusions from failures in combat operations at sea, learn and take into account lessons from the experience gained. After the defeat by the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine of enemy units on gas production platforms near the coast of Crimea with the use of aircraft carrier unmanned surface complexes in December 2024, the enemy, I hope, begins to understand new threats and the scale of future losses. Attacking by unmanned units of the SBU and GUR of the enemy's aircraft over the sea nullifies its superiority over the sea and opens access for these forces to the enemy's facilities in the coastal zone and on the coast. At the same time, with what own successes and achievements can the enemy react to this? There is no clear answer. Currently, the successes declared by him in the creation of marine unmanned surface and underwater complexes are not visible in concrete tests or the application of such equipment in combat operations at sea. Renewal of the enemy's strike capabilities at sea is delayed indefinitely. Moreover, the enemy tends to hide its newly built ships from the strikes of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, as happened with the small Tucha missile ship, which was being completed on the Black Sea, but was accepted into the Black Sea Fleet as far as Caspiansk, which is located in the Caspian Sea. Can the enemy strengthen its strikes from the sea by using forces from outside the Black Sea? Currently, this possibility is assessed as not feasible. The fact is that when some media outlets, as breaking news, report the number of missile-carrying ships in the Mediterranean, it is surprising, to put it mildly. After all, everyone knows that according to the Montreux Convention, no military ship of the Russian Federation, as well as of Ukraine, can be transported from the Mediterranean Sea to the Black Sea under the current conditions. In addition, such a ship cannot use its missile weapons, because it must obtain permission to use aircraft in Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania. Flea over other states is also unrealistic due to a significant increase in the rocket. That is, from the Mediterranean rocket strikes of the Russian Federation in Ukraine are impossible. If you adhere to another logic, it is also necessary to provide Ukrainian society as daily -hot- new information about Muscovite Krakhetnos ships, for example, in the Baltic Sea. Regarding the possibility of involvement in rocket strokes of Krakhetnosi ships from the Caspian Fleet of the Russian Federation from certain areas of the Caspian Sea, it should be noted that this is unlikely. It should be borne in mind that the missile of the Caliber complex at normal equipment insufficient capacity for firing range. It is known that their maximum range - up to 1500 km, and the distance in the straight line to Odessa is 1500 km, to Kiev - 1600 km, to Lviv, Rivne, Uzhgorod - more than 2000 km. For comparison - in the present conditions, the Muscovites strike the caliber missiles from the Novorossiysk district, from what distance to Ukrainian cities are: to Odessa - about 650 km, to Kiev - 800, to Lviv, Rivne, Uzhgorod - 1200. Thus. , to attract Caspian Fleet Ships, they need to be carried out Volgodonian channel to Azov and then to the Black Sea. With this Muscovites, as we have mentioned above, they do not rush. Summarizing, it can be predicted that there is no significant strengthening of any capacity of the Russian Federation to conduct actions on the Black Sea. Ukraine confidently prevails at sea. First of all, this will certainly happen due to the constant increase of efforts of Ukraine's defense forces, their intellectual and technological advantage over the enemy. The strikes, which took place recently, in January 2025, at the military and logistics centers in the depths of the territory of Russia and on the coast of the Krasnodar Territory, in particular on the objects of marine oil and gas infrastructure, give confidence in the success of Ukraine in the fight against the aggressor.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/chogo-ochikuvaty-vid-voroga-u-2025-roczi-ekspert-pro-spromozhnosti-rf-u-chornomu-mori-ta-v-krymu/	2025-01-26T20:50:28-08:00
No longer -limitedly suitable-: how to pass VLK in one day	This is required by the Law of Ukraine dated March 21, 2024 No. 3621-IX -On amendments to some laws of Ukraine on ensuring the rights of servicemen and police officers to social protection-. The demand of the Law is not a caprice: I will go, and I will not. Failure to comply with the rule on timely passing of the VLK is a violation of the rules of military accounting, defense legislation, mobilization training and mobilization, for which a fine in the amount of 17,000 to 25,500 UAH can be imposed. Although the Ministry of Defense assures that if a person with the status of -Limited Suitability- does not undergo a re-examination by February 5, the electronic military registration document in Reserve+ will remain unchanged, it is still not worth taking a risk - it is better to comply with the requirements of the Law and protect yourself from fines. I want to tell you about my personal experience of passing the VLC in January 2025 in one of the district TCCs and joint ventures in the city of Kyiv. Therefore, the observations and advice made cannot in any case be extrapolated to all recruitment and social support centers in Ukraine. It is possible to appear at the TCC and SP to pass the VLK in order to determine suitability for military service as -limited suitability- in the morning any day - there is still time. A summons is not required for this. It is not necessary, but it is better to be registered for this day in the electronic queue. In the TCC, you will receive a referral for a medical examination, a bypass letter and an algorithm for further actions. If the VLK works simply in the building of the TCC and SP, as in my case, then conscripts who have all the necessary up-to-date medical reports on their illnesses can pass the commission in one day. But when you go to the TCC, it is better not to plan anything else for that day, because the process can be unexpectedly long, and you will not be able to leave the premises until the necessary procedures are completed. However, the VLK can work in a separate room or in general in one of the civil hospitals. Enrollment on the VLK in civil medical institutions is done through the medical application. You can go to the required page of this application using the QR code that will be provided by TCC and SP. Then the process due to objective reasons (signing up and arriving at the medical facility) will take more time. Currently, the Ministry of Defense is implementing the VLK reform and soon it should be possible to send a request for a VLK referral through the Reserve+ mobile application, receive a notification with details and go to the health care facility specified in the referral without the need to visit the TCC. If you have illnesses due to which at one time you were recognized as -limited fitness for military service- or -unfit for military service in peacetime, limited fitness in wartime-, then you should not appear at the VLK without any medical documents at all . It is necessary to have at least some statement with a diagnosis. A recent one is better. If the medical conclusions were made a long time ago (during the previous VLC examination or before), you will most likely be sent for an examination to a specialized specialist with an electronic referral and a summons to continue the VLC examination in a few days. An additional examination should update data on your health status. And this is where the real quest begins, because electronic appointment to doctors in public hospitals is a lottery. And the examination may include the need to visit several specialists or do tests. Queues for some specialists are filled a month in advance and are already here - as luck would have it. Perhaps, in order not to wait, you will have to go to a paid appointment. I was lucky enough to make an appointment with an electronic referral to a state institution outside the waiting list due to the fact that I constantly consult a doctor and had a summons from the TCC in my hands. In general, a summons to undergo a VLC is a strong argument for any civilian hospital, because military personnel and mobilized people are served there outside the queue (even during a VLC) and it can really help to speed up additional examination. But, unfortunately, it does not always work, so it is not worth waiting for reception outside the queue everywhere. When the doctor's conclusion about your current state of health is in your hands, you can go again to the VLK doctor who referred you for additional examination. It is he who will record the diagnosis, according to which the head of the VLK will determine the degree of suitability for military service. In the end, the whole process with additional examinations took me 10 days. For comparison, when I passed the VLK 2021, it lasted almost 1.5 months. So, the progress is obvious. There is no longer a definition of -restricted fit- in the Conscription and Military Service Act. Currently, in the majority of cases, regarding persons with serious illnesses, resolutions -fit for service in military support units, TCC and SP, VVNIZ, educational centers, institutions (institutions), medical units, units of logistics, communication, operational support, security- (at least this is the conclusion suggested after conversations in the queue of several dozen conscripts who went through the VLK together with me, both the first and second day). After all, this is exactly the work of the VLK: to find out and record the medically established facts, on the basis of which to make a conclusion about fitness and make the appropriate decision.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/vzhe-ne-obmezheno-prydatnyj-yak-projty-vlk-za-odyn-den/	2025-01-26T20:40:42-08:00
From -Google, help!- to a mine-explosive training instructor: about the symbol of faith of a princip...	The fighter told ArmyInform about what his personal symbol of faith and inviolable principles are. Evgeny received his nickname -Monk- because of his beard and the calm demeanor of a prudent, responsible and confident man in his words and actions. — It was a bit funny such a situation. When our brigade was formed, a boy with such a big beard, who was nicknamed -Chaplain-, served with me. I have a smaller beard, so they started calling me -Batyushka-. I then said that I would not aspire to a high rank and would be a modest -Monk,- Yevgeny says. The warrior says that he likes to be alone to collect his thoughts. In his spare time, he often reads the Bible, which he always keeps with him. — During the formation of the brigade, there were guys from different regions, it was necessary to somehow remember each other, that's how it caught on — first as a joke, and then seriously, — he explains. In civilian life, Yevgeny was an industrial climber, he worked at high altitudes for many years, so he had good physical training. During the formation of the brigade in March 2022, -Monakh- was assigned to the intelligence company. — We thought we would get into the regular part, but our part was formed from the reserve. All from scratch, all mobilized. The officers are young guys who have not yet finished their studies. And so we passed the formation in less than a month and entered the combat zone in the Severodonetsk region, says the soldier. The experience of military service came in handy for Yevgeny, however, the man emphasizes, the level of training then was not too high and clearly insufficient for a major war. — It was 2004, there was such devastation in the army&#8230; Then I got into -Desna-, an educational center. Then he served in Bakhmut - then it was still called Artemivsk. They shot a little, threw grenades, but that was not enough, even if you were taught to shoot with aim - you need to learn tactics, train, - the -Monk- is convinced. — The enemy was more ready for war. And at first it was difficult for me, because when you are engaged in your profession all your life, you have invested a certain period of years in one thing, and here you have to fight, you have to defend yourself, you have to kill - it was difficult for a civilian, Yevgeny says. In the -Monk- reconnaissance group, he was a machine gunner, he worked with the RPK - a Kalashnikov manual machine gun. Later, he mastered the Swedish AT4 grenade launcher. Yevhen also has a funny story related to this, because in order to master a new weapon, he had to search for instructions with the help of Google. - RPK is the same Kalashnikov assault rifle, only bigger, so there were no problems with it. But NATO weapons were mastered with the help of the Internet. We even had such a joke in the section: -Google, help!-. -We went on the Internet and looked for videos on YouTube that explained the basics of using weapons,- recalls the -Monk-. The military characterizes the Swedish AT4 grenade launcher as a very high-quality and effective weapon, significantly better than Soviet hand grenade launchers. Although I had to work with the RPG-18 Mukha and RPG-22 Netto, which performed quite well. -Monk- and his brothers mastered the new weapon extremely carefully, because they understood that the performance of the combat mission and their own lives depended on it. Went to the headquarters, asked to connect them to the Starlink signal in order to be able to watch the necessary videos. - Tried to be very serious about it - practiced, practiced, practiced all the time. Because our lives and our combat mission depended on it. If you are killed or wounded, you will no longer be able to complete the task that the command set for you. And I was in the reconnaissance of our brigade, and we had difficult tasks, - says -Monk-. It was often necessary to work on identifying the positions of enemy artillery with the purpose of counter-battery combat. At that time, scouts went into the so-called -gray zone- and calculated where the enemy was firing artillery or mortar fire. — You may not shoot a single cartridge in a week, but bring a lot of useful information. The same -counter-battery-: you sit in a shelter and, with the help of a tablet and a compass, calculate the sound of enemy artillery or mortars. Then you give the coordinates and our artillery works according to them. Then the infantry is easier. And the infantry always have the hardest time - they need to be helped first of all, Evgeny is convinced. While resting and recuperating between rotations, Monks and their brothers were always studying. Together with his comrades, he thoroughly mastered engineering - first at courses organized by volunteers in Kharkiv, and later with the receipt of an official certificate in Kamianets-Podilskyi. - In Kharkiv, they taught the basics - how to detect a mine and understand what kind of mine it is and what damage it can cause. What can be done with it to neutralize it and what can not be done in any case. I learned all the theory on these courses, and the practice was good on the educational materials, Yevgeny recalls with gratitude. The training in Kharkiv lasted three weeks, but since the courses were voluntary, it was not possible to get an official certificate of advanced training and mastery of the new VOS. Therefore, later -Monakh- continued his studies in Kamianets-Podilskyi, where the courses lasted for a month and a half. — I really liked Kamianets-Podilskyi - very qualified, serious teachers. The material base they have for training is excellent - I am very satisfied. The program is very full for 45 days, but you cannot allocate more time during the war, says Yevhen about training in mine and explosives. Thanks to previous training in Kharkiv, it was easier for Monk to acquire knowledge than for guys from other brigades who did not have such experience. However, under the guidance of experienced specialists, they also successfully coped with the training and received the relevant certificates. — It was scary at first, but under the supervision of teachers, all this was done calmly. And when you have made the first or second blow, you somehow calm down, you become confident in your actions. You can, when you know how, it's already a favorite job, -Monk- smiles. After the second serious injury, the soldier was transferred to a group of instructors due to his health, so now he imparts knowledge to less experienced comrades. The military is convinced that teaching well and learning well is necessary for everyone who wants to survive on the battlefield, successfully complete a combat mission and win. — When you teach people, it is a big responsibility. If you neglected a person, behaved carelessly, then he may die. What if suddenly the very training exercise you failed to teach cost a soldier his life? Therefore, we try to give 100%, to the maximum. Other people's lives also depend on us, Yevhen emphasizes. A serious wound in the hand does not allow the soldier to work at full strength, but he is glad that he was not discharged and was allowed to pass on knowledge and skills to his comrades. - I can show you how to neutralize the stretcher placed by the enemy. Explain how to work with it so that it does not explode. I have enough strength for this. I believe that I can still serve the brigade, bring benefit, contribute to our victory, which we are very much looking forward to, says the soldier. In the time since Evgeny became an instructor about a year ago, he has already trained hundreds of fighters. He remembers everyone and tries to help them even after graduation. — Here we always do everything to ensure that a person remains alive, does not get injured and completes a combat mission. We try to work so that the students know everything no worse than the teachers and even surpass us, - smiles Yevhen. This is what the -Monk- creed is all about - learning yourself and teaching others to survive on the battlefield and win. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/vid-google-dopomozhy-do-instruktora-z-minno-vybuhovoyi-pidgotovky-pro-symvol-viry-prynczypovogo-monaha/	2025-01-26T20:29:21-08:00
- Escape of a female sniper to Europe-: a fairy tale of the Russian Federation for an audience in sl...	So, according to the script of the Kremlin directors, the -sniper from Ukraine- after several years of service realized that the -Ukrainian army is doomed-, took off her camouflage and disappeared somewhere in cozy Europe. Up to this point, the story sounds more or less familiar for Russian fakes: no names, evidence or photos - just fantasy and loud headlines. And now some facts. Firstly, none of the Ukrainian snipers confirmed the existence of such a situation. The Armed Forces is not a chaotic gathering of random people, but a professional army where every soldier is part of a single system. Of course, there are occasional losses or transfers to another service, but there is nowhere near a mass exodus. Secondly, if someone actually decided to leave the service, it is unlikely that he would choose the high-profile route with -dramatic statements-. This looks like an attempt to give his fiction a dramatic color for the Russian audience. Ukrainian snipers are the elite of the army. They are not just trained, but are formed into real professionals for whom service is not just a job, but a vocation. The stories we see every day only confirm: even in the most difficult conditions, they remain true to their oath. So, the idea that one of the snipers suddenly -freaked out- looks, to put it mildly, unrealistic. As always, this fake is aimed at two types of audience. Let's imagine what the -escape- of this mythical female sniper looks like. Does she take off her uniform, pick up a guitar and go on a European tour with songs about lost home? Or does she record a video message on Tik Tok, where she tells how she is -disappointed- in her own country? I wonder why everything is always so dramatic in Russian fiction? With the same success, one could invent that all Ukrainian snipers took a vacation at the same time to go shopping in Istanbul. Because it is probably as realistic as their escape. The reality is that the Armed Forces continue to hold the front. There is no collapse or panic. On the contrary, the Ukrainian army is becoming stronger thanks to the support of its partners and the resilience of its own people. While Russian propaganda creates myths about fictional -desertive snipers-, real Ukrainian soldiers continue to defend their land. And no fake will change that fact.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/vtecha-snajperky-do-yevropy-kazka-rf-dlya-audytoriyi-v-tapochkah/	2025-01-26T20:05:19-08:00
The President of Ukraine introduced the new Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of...	He informed about this during an evening address to the citizens of Ukraine. -Today I want to celebrate the heroic actions of our soldiers in different areas. I especially thank the 95th separate brigade for the efficiency in Kurshchyna, the 25th separate airborne and the 68th separate hunting brigades for the successes in the Pokrovsky direction. Special thanks to the soldiers of the 24th and 100th separate mechanized brigades for their heroism in the battles for Chasiv Yar and Toretsk,- the President noted. Significant personnel changes took place in the command. Major General Andriy Hnatov was appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Its main task is to improve the quality of training of operational staffs and to establish better interaction between command structures and the front. The president also thanked Ukrainian developers and manufacturers of long-range drones and missiles, which effectively reduce Russia's military potential. -Our weapons bring results: unrest in Russia, falling oil prices, limiting the enemy's capabilities - all this brings peace closer,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. According to him, the year 2025 should be decisive in the struggle for Ukraine's independence. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy decided to strengthen the command staff at the hottest areas of the front in the Donetsk region. Major General Mykhailo Drapaty was appointed head of operational- of the Khortytsia strategic group of troops.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/prezydent-ukrayiny-predstavyv-novogo-zastupnyka-nachalnyka-genshtabu-zsu/	2025-01-26T11:48:39-08:00
Key appointment in the East: Mykhailo Drapaty will head OSUV -Khortytsia-	He informed about this during an evening address to the citizens of Ukraine. Major General Mykhailo Drapaty was appointed the head of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops. This group operates in the areas where the fiercest fighting is going on. The head of state also noted that Mykhailo Drapaty will retain the post of commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is the largest component of the army. The combination of these two roles will contribute to the coordination of combat missions with the proper training of brigades. The president added that it is the needs of the front that will determine the standards of staffing and training of military units.

OSUV - Khortytsia - explained the change in tactics of the Soviet Union in the Pokrovsky direction	On Sunday, January 26, told on the broadcast of the telethon, the spokesperson promptly- Major Viktor Tregubov of the strategic group of troops -Khortytsia-. -They don't have an unlimited number of personnel, which they used to throw at the city in wave after wave, until it began to cling to some suburbs, then enter the city, then destroy buildings closer to the center, and so on. They have already used this tactic on Pokrovsk. And this indicates that they simply do not have the people to use such tactics,- he said, commenting on the situation in this direction. According to the speaker of the -Khortytsia- OSUV, all this was the result of Ukrainian efforts to contain the enemy. -The goal of the Ukrainian troops is to slow down and destroy the Russian troops. To knock down the moment that allows them to advance now. It is partly successful, and we can see it on the example of Pokrovsk, where the Russians do not go forward, as they used to go straight to all the cities, but try to cover it,- Viktor Tregubov noted. As reported by ArmiyaInform, previously OSUV -Khortytsia- hortyczya/->denied rumors about the alleged encirclement of Ukrainian troops in Velika Novosilka.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/v-osuv-hortyczya-poyasnyly-zminu-taktyky-zs-rf-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-26T10:53:23-08:00
No wonder the city was bombed, but water was brought: weekdays in occupied Popasnaya	About reports Center of National Resistance. It is noted that the occupation -administration- announced its intention to organize a -regular- delivery of drinking water to the destroyed city of Popasna. Popasna, which was virtually wiped off the face of the earth by Russian troops, still has no public utilities, and promises of water supply remain unfulfilled. In the town, where about 250 people now live, water used to be delivered only periodically in bottled form. As before, the pickup schedule and water quality are not reported. According to the occupiers, water delivery is carried out together with Russian -volunteers- and the so-called -municipal district administration- of the city of Sokologhirsk, to which the remnants of Popasnaya were formally annexed. However, even these plans do not address key humanitarian issues such as the lack of electricity, communications and other basic living conditions. A similar situation is observed in other occupied settlements of Luhansk Region. For example, residents of Novopskov and Bilovodsk have been waiting for the promised Internet connection for more than a year. The Center of National Resistance emphasizes that the occupiers are not able to provide even the minimum needs of the population. Only the de-occupation of the territories can put an end to the humanitarian catastrophe that has been going on for years. As reported by ArmyInform, locals are leaving, migrants are coming: Kremlin is changing the face of occupied communities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/darma-shho-misto-rozbomblene-zate-vodu-pryvezly-budni-okupovanoyi-popasnoyi/	2025-01-26T10:31:20-08:00
The defense forces destroyed warehouses with UAVs of the Russians in the Oryol region	This was reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Sunday, January 26. -The concrete structures where the thermobaric warheads used for drones were stored were hit. There is information about a strong secondary detonation,- the message reads. As noted, it is already known about the destruction of about two hundred enemy kamikaze drones. -The results and extent of damage are being clarified, but it is known in advance that more than 200 -shaheeds- will no longer be used against our country. Combat work on important objects involved in the destruction of the civilian infrastructure of Ukraine and the terror of the civilian population will continue,- the General Staff of the Armed Forces emphasized.

At the same time, Viktor Tregubov noted that the situation in Velyka Novosilka is currently quite dynamic and the battles for it continue. He also added that the Ukrainian military is still present there and continues to destroy the Russians and their equipment. -I can't clarify where exactly they are and where the Russians are trying to maneuver, simply because it would jeopardize the operation itself,- explained the speaker of the Khortytsia OSU. As reported by ArmyInform, earlier in the 110th separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, they announced that after entering Velika Novosilka, the Russian occupiers got there in -fire bag-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/okupantam-ne-vdalosya-otochyty-ukrayinski-vijska-u-velykij-novosilczi-osuv-hortyczya/	2025-01-26T09:51:54-08:00

Because they didn't sign the contract. They are mobilized. Tears and swords. There is nothing at all. You also know what happens in hospitals,- one of the Russians whines about this. In turn, his interlocutor, in response to this, notes that the same fate, most likely, awaits him.

In particular, there were clashes between assault groups of the occupation army and fighters of a separate brigade of territorial defense, border guards and hunters,- the message states. According to the -Khortytsia- OSUV, the losses of the enemy during the unsuccessful assault amounted to several dozen people.

A video with another such case was published in their Telegram channel by fighters of the -KHYZHAK- brigade at Department of patrol police. It shows that after being dropped from the Ukrainian drone, the occupant, who was still alive, decided not to wait for what would happen next, but immediately shortened his life by using his own grenade. -I will break for Rus'. Predators carried out a drop near an enemy infantryman, after which the injuries received forced the occupier to detonate a grenade under him. Probably, this is the first (and last) right decision in his life,- the patrolmen said, commenting on the Russian's choice. As reported ArmyInform, the DPSU told the story of a soldier who during the battle with the occupiers received wounded in the head, but continued his service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/za-rus-vzirvus-dron-patrulnoyi-policziyi-sponukav-okupanta-vkorotyty-sobi-viku/	2025-01-26T08:20:03-08:00
- I was considered 200-th. A flamethrower of the Armed Forces spent the day in a trench with the Rus...	He told his extraordinary story to the journalists of Suspilny. According to the fighter, who is currently serving in the 704th regiment of radiation, chemical and biological protection, everything happened last year, during a combat mission in the village of Robotyne, Zaporizhzhia region, when his commander was seriously wounded. -He immediately told me to take responsibility, then lead the group. He told the boys to retreat in twos, because this was their first battle. I thought that they should retreat, and I would stay with him and help,- the fighter recalls. However, when he was helping the wounded commander, the Russians threw a grenade at them, as a result of which he died. -I still managed to go in and clear the hole, climb in and be there. I thought I would stay until the shelling was over. Fortunately, Muscovites did not see that I was there, because later, as it turned out from our drone footage, it was clear that I died there together with my brother, I was considered the 200th. I woke up somewhere at 6 in the morning&#8230; I didn't know what to do, whether to go out or not, I had already come to terms with the fact that I had died,- Vasyl admits. Suddenly he heard the voice of one of the Russians nearby. -Falled next to me, got up, limped. I see that he has a red bandage on his leg, I think, well, that's it, they arrived. I take out a grenade, I think, if anything, I will blow it up.- Here he says: -Who are you?- I say: -My-. I don't know how the head generated it. He: -Move, I'll come to you, after the injury, after the assault in Robotyn.- They got nuts there. I say: -No, go further, there is one of our people further away, go to him, there is still a place.- And he left,- says the Ukrainian defender. However, later the occupier did return, so Vasyl had to continue pretending to be a -Russian-. In the end, he left his shelter, telling an enemy soldier that he was going to get water, and when he met four more invaders, who also did not realize that he was Ukrainian, the fighter decided to find a new shelter. -I was sitting under a metal sheet, I was dying of a drone, because I didn't know at that time whose drone it was. The soldier got on the drone, I see the drone flashing, giving a signal. I did not understand anything, my head hurt so much. Probably recognized.

The occupiers on boats in the fog: our military explained why the occupiers are trying to force Oski...	Ruslan Piddubny, the commander of the battalion of unmanned systems -Antares- of the 4th brigade of NSU -Rubizh-, announced this on the air of the telethon. According to him, due to the fact that the river has not frozen, the occupiers cannot carry out a full-scale forcing using, for example, heavy equipment. Instead, they use small watercraft at night, or in foggy weather, to move in small groups of 5-8 people. After crossing, these groups try to hide in the forest plantations, waiting for reinforcements. -If they are not detected in advance, this reinforcement will number up to 20 people. And the first group to advance already knows our weaknesses. Therefore, it is even easier for subsequent groups to advance. In principle, the enemy's advance across the Oskil River took place in foggy weather,- said Ruslan Piddubny. This advance is not significant, says the commander of the Antares unmanned systems battalion. In addition, it is a very difficult area to arrange logistics. -If you take our experience, when we held a bridgehead in Makiivka, Luhansk region, it was very difficult for the enemy to cross the river there. Therefore, the bridgehead wedged into the defense. The enemy could not advance further. And in the few places where he was able to advance, he was unable to provide logistics. And was forced to retreat. Accordingly, using the terrain, we can stop such advances in advance,- added Ruslan Piddubny. As reported by ArmyInform, since the beginning of the day, the total number of combat clashes along the entire front line increased to 99.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/okupanty-na-chovnah-v-tumani-nashi-vijskovi-poyasnyly-chomu-okupanty-namagayutsya-forsuvaty-oskil-unochi/	2025-01-26T07:08:53-08:00

Locals are leaving, migrants are coming: the Kremlin is changing the face of occupied communities	About informs Center of National Resistance. Local residents continue to refuse to work for the occupation administrations or leave the cities where terrorists brought the -Russian measure- in the form of destroyed communities and death. In 2024 alone, almost 12,000 foreign citizens and stateless persons were placed on the migration register in the occupied Luhansk region. For comparison: at the end of 2023, there were approximately 3,800 such persons. In addition, according to the Eastern Human Rights Group, in 11 months of 2024, 109 applications for invitations to enter the Russian Federation were accepted, 101 visas of various categories were issued and extended, and also satisfied 516 applications for obtaining a residence permit. However, even such actions do not solve the region's key problems, such as distrust of the occupation authorities, lack of infrastructure, and the personnel crisis. In fact, knowing that the local population will continue to resist, the occupiers are carrying out ethnic replacement in the region. Instead of Ukrainians who leave or are deported by the Russian Federation, terrorists bring migrants from Central Asian countries or Russians from depressed regions of the Russian Federation. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers in Siverskodonetsk require residents to empty their apartments of furniture during repair works, which are carried out on a forced basis.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/misczevi-vyyizhdzhayut-migranty-pryyizhdzhayut-kreml-zminyuye-oblychchya-okupovanyh-gromad/	2025-01-26T06:12:02-08:00

In general, the situation in the Chasiv Yaru region is difficult, says a representative of the 24th separate mechanized brigade. The enemy conducts assaults every day. For the most part, uses tactics of small groups, when a small number of people try to penetrate into the rear of our positions. At the same time, it bears great losses. -This week it was possible to capture several Russians from the 98th Airborne Division. They came very close to our positions,- Andrii Polukhin said.

-Sniper rifle- with weak armor? We talk with the crew about how the Leopard 1A5 performed in combat	Already in the early autumn of the same year, their saw ArmyInform, and later Army TV showed how 44 OMBr fires at these vehicles. A year after that, we visited the 44th Separate Mechanized Brigade and asked the Leopard 1A5 tank crew about how the machine performed on the battlefield. The guys, in particular, responded to common criticisms about weak armor and outdated equipment. Read about combat capabilities, additional protection, maneuverability and comparison with Soviet analogues in the ArmyInform report from positions in the northeast. The material was recorded in late autumn: the crew had just returned from a combat mission; was on recovery, the gunner was preparing for vacation. Although the fighters had been at their positions for quite a long time and were tired, they still spoke very lively about their machine. We begin our conversation about what expectations were from this tank. We will remind that immediately after it became known about Germany's decision to transfer Leopard 1A5 tanks to Ukraine, a wave of skepticism was observed in the network - they say that we are being transferred outdated equipment that is not suitable for the realities of the modern Russian-Ukrainian war. Indeed, at that time, dissatisfaction was caused by the fact that Ukraine was supposedly being handed over machines that are at least 50 years old, and not modern Leopard 2. The first German tank after the Second World War was also criticized for its weak armor. Gena, a charger from Sumy Oblast, and Volodymyr, a mechanic-driver from Cherkasy Oblast, tell us about their tank. We immediately ask what the guys think about the numerous comments about the fact that this is an outdated car. We have him for at least a year. There are downsides, but there are big pluses. Well, yes, an old man, but he does his job. Easy to maintain. All equipment breaks, but we were taught how to look and how to repair it. That's why nothing so critical happened to him this year, says Gena. Vladimir shares his opinion: - She is old, but she justifies herself. Nothing to add here, it's 100%. The main thing is the proper care of her and the harmony of the crew. I drove the T-72, and I can say that the Leopard 1A5 is better. The boys remember that they were taught everything in Germany - how to take care, and how to maneuver, and how to shoot. Everything was practiced there, because the tank was being prepared for maneuver warfare, so that it could reach anywhere, overcoming all possible obstacles. — The Germans were cheerful, they tried. As far as I remember, soups were not given away there. And I wanted borscht. But every weekend they have a tradition of making a barbecue. They did a particularly nice farewell - they roasted a lot of their sausages, brought various non-alcoholic beers, - recalls Gena. Volodymyr adds that they were taught by instructors who were over 50, because the younger Germans had already learned on the Leopard 2. It happened that one of the former instructors left his business for a certain time and returned to the training ground to teach Ukrainians. Volodymyr has been in the war since 2014, when he volunteered. He served for more than a year in the 30 OMBr as an infantryman, then resigned. He fought in Debaltseve. In 2022, he was also in the ranks of the Defense Forces from the first days. Gena says that in the first days of the large-scale invasion, he went to the Military Commissariat, passed the VLK and waited. The summons came five months ago. — He did not immediately want to join the tank battalion, because he had not previously been associated with equipment. He even asked to be sent back to study as an infantryman. But, as you can see, they are still here, they worked with the boys, - he laughs. Volodymyr says that at first he was also in the infantry, fought in Severodonetsk. But the unit was disbanded, and he became a tank driver. - I was not afraid. I know that a tank is a tank, when it moves to a position, the enemy is afraid in any case. When the dance works, it's something. It cannot be compared with anything. He simply leaves, disassembles trenches and dugouts for spare parts, and so on, - confidently explains the mechvod. He emphasizes that it was easy for the crew to master this machine. This is especially noticeable when compared with Soviet tanks - in the Leopard 1A5 everything is accurate, understandable, everything is done faster than on -our- analogues. To become a tanker driver, he says, the main thing is to have the desire. And don't be afraid to sit inside. Sometimes, fighters are afraid, because a tank, no matter what, is a priority target for the enemy. The worst was the first time. But in general, fear is present every time you leave. Gena remembers how once on a combat tour he had to spend the night in a tent: it started to get cold, something was already falling, damp, rain, mud all around. A stove that can be turned on without starting the machine comes to the rescue here. And in summer, in such situations, the air conditioner saves. - We sat in the dance floor, hid, and could not get out. When the sky is dirty, you have to lie in wait and wait for the command. When we are delayed in such cases, canned goods come to the rescue, the charger recalls. By the way, it has the most space inside the tank. We climb onto the tank with the boys so that they can show the place where the engine is located. It can be replaced here in 40 minutes. -It's fantastic, but it's true,- says the driver, adding that the car is very easy to maintain, and that's its advantage. The tank of the Leopard 1A5 holds 970 liters - this, taking into account its additional protection, is enough for 400 and a half kilometers of travel. The tank can develop a considerable speed for driving in reverse - 55 km per hour. This is very telling, as compared to Soviet tanks, which can barely go 5 km/h backwards, says the mechvod and clarifies that the Leopard 1A5 primer can go up to 65 km/h. The charger adds that he really likes the quiet operation of the machine. The mechvod agrees with him, calling it a great advantage over Soviet machines. Both praise the thermal imager in their work, because they work mostly in the dark or -in the dark-. They mainly work in dugouts and other fortified positions of the enemy. I also had to work on technology. -You can sneak into ravines and do a good job,- the guys say about the Leopard 1A5's advantages. Then we climb inside together with the crew. - The car is very sensitive, it is extremely easy to control, - Vladimir climbs into the driver's seat and demonstrates a small steering wheel that responds very smoothly to his hands. - There is no need to pull anything here. Everything is clear and effortless. Automatic gearbox. It -quickly-, easily works like that. Sitting in the place of the loader, we conclude that maneuverability is one of the main advantages of the Leopard 1A5. It also has a -chip- when the left and right tracks rotate in different directions, so the tank can turn right on the spot. - These are all great advantages in it. There is no such maneuverability and speed in the T-64 or T-72. This -Leopard- only drives in reverse as the T-64 drives forward. And maybe even faster, - says Vladimir. The gunner probably has the least space in this spacious cabin. However, he is in direct contact with the tank commander. We ask what are the disadvantages of this car. Mehvod immediately says that he does not like the fact that the tracks are on rubber pads: - Often, Western machinery has such pads on the tracks so as not to spoil the roads. If it weren't for them, the tank would go even faster. They can be replaced manually, but this is a very time-consuming process, because each thing must be removed separately with a special tool. We sit in the seat of the tank commander and talk to the loader. He shows what his job is and mentions that he has the most space in the cabin. And also shows the twin 7.62 mm machine gun that this machine is equipped with. Gena emphasizes that the tank has a modern fire control system, which is why it has the A5 prefix. Also shows the place where he stores shells - they are different, depending on the type of tasks, but you can't talk about them. A mechvod crawls through the place of the loader to us and confirms that the fire control system is very good, works effectively both day and night: - If we received the exact coordinates from the adjuster, then this tank works like a sniper rifle. I can't tell you all the details, but we have the power and the means to know in real time where we hit. This system significantly helps in correcting the shot, how many corrections to take, azimuth and level. The guys say that Leopard 1A5 shells fall very accurately, and sometimes the enemy did not even have time to understand what exactly was flying at it, confusing the Leopard with a mortar, and they note that it hits very accurately, how to compare with Soviet counterparts is like heaven and earth. Separately, we dwell on the dynamic protection, which was recently installed on this tank. It helps not only against cluster bombs, but also against RPGs, LNG, grenade launchers and drones. Footage of the training of its crews on the Leopard 1A5 with such armor was already shown by the Ground Forces . The guys say that this is not a fundamentally new decision, because the command is constantly thinking about how to protect personnel and equipment. Therefore, such tanks in the 44th OMBr have been fighting with dynamic defense for quite some time. By the way, on Sukhoutka video you can see what the Leopard 1A5 looks like with the -barbecue- installed. Mehvod is not ready to say that the tank is somehow very different from Soviet tanks: -It's no secret, this tank has homogeneous armor. But, thank God, it was not necessary to check its strength. Our advantage is that the command uses this machine very competently.- Although it is mentioned that it was this Leopard 1A5 that was once hit by an enemy FPV, and also received shrapnel from the Lancet. Vladimir shows the mark left on the armor and says that it did not affect the tank in any way, he drove on and worked. The guys say that they are given vacation according to the rules, they are able to recover minimally, but still 30 days is not enough. At the same time, the tankers claim that they are here to win. -I don't want my children to be under the invaders,- adds Gena. We are talking about the fact that there are not enough people to replace those who have been fighting for the third year. - There is enough of everything here - equipment, clothes, and normal food. The team is cool, everyone is adequate. Whoever comes will be supported here, will be shown everything. It doesn't matter how he gets here, says the mechvod. — Our crew is like clockwork. All are interconnected. It's like a family. Only in a tank,- adds Gena with a slight smile. Finally, we say that the fighters on the front lines, especially those who have been fighting for three years or longer, are tired: -When someone says that we are running out, it is not necessarily irreversible losses. People get tired physically and mentally, they need to be replaced.- - We need to get involved, because we are not here forever. And don't be afraid. Yes, war is scary, but there is no need to be afraid. Someone has to do this work. Everything has its resource. Just because we're not eternal doesn't mean we're gone and dead. This means that people are getting tired, and the army needs fresh strength, - adds Gena.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/snajperska-gvyntivka-zi-slabkoyu-broneyu-govorymo-z-ekipazhem-pro-te-yak-leopard-1a5-pokazav-sebe-v-boyu/	2025-01-25T21:09:50-08:00
It took a while, now he is a double elite. The story of a paratrooper and a sniper -Gryni-	Oleksiy told ArmiyaInform about his life choices and combat path, as well as the importance of sergeants in the Armed Forces. — All my life I wanted to join the Air Force, because it is a real elite. True, half a year later the Airborne Forces were renamed to the Airborne Forces, but we still remained paratroopers, - smiles -Grynya-. Over time, service in the Armed Forces became for a military man not only an episode in his biography, but also a vocation and a final life choice, and the Airborne Assault Forces was the place where Alexei found the most sincere and loyal friends. — I was thinking of signing a contract for three years, and after it ended, go -for a civilian.- But then it dragged on - even when there was a calmer phase of the war during the time of the ATO / OOS, so I serve until today, - he recalls. Oleksiy began his service as a soldier, gradually acquiring the knowledge and experience necessary to attain the rank of sergeant. — I spent three years in the soldiers, because then everyone said: a clean shoulder is a clean conscience. But then I realized myself, and the commanders saw that I already had the experience to move on, says the senior sergeant. As a skillful and skilled shooter, Oleksiy was sent to study at a sniper school, where he completed the basic courses and received the appropriate certificate. — Then for a year and a half, I ran in snipers - in a line company, but as a sniper. Dual elite - a paratrooper and a sniper - jokes a military man. It was as a sniper that -Grynya- met a large-scale invasion, taking part in high-intensity battles with the enemy. — During the first month of the full-scale war, I had eight -minuses- (confirmed liquidated Russian occupiers - ed.). Then it was a lot, but now it is, of course, little things, - modestly informs the soldier. Soon, responsibility, leadership qualities and many years of service experience allowed Oleksiy to become a unit commander, and later a platoon commander. The soldier was given the rank of sergeant. - Those who could organize people and carry out a combat mission were appointed as commanders. I believe that a sergeant, from junior sergeant to unit commander, is an extremely important rank in the Armed Forces. Everything rests on it, a confident military man. He is convinced that sergeants are the main backbone of the Ukrainian army and play the role of a connecting link from the soldier to the highest levels of command. — A sergeant can hold positions from a department commander to a platoon commander — and that's all a sergeant. It is the backbone of our Armed Forces. Without a sergeant there is no army, without a sergeant there are no normal troops. A professional military sergeant, a universal warrior, characterizes Oleksiy the importance of sergeants in the Armed Forces. In the 199th training center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Oleksiy serves as an instructor of the Sergeant Training Center, so he is well aware of the requirements for the -universal warrior- of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - from the performance characteristics of any weapon available in the army to making combat decisions and giving orders. — The sergeant must have leadership and commanding qualities. So that he is not afraid to make a decision and is not afraid of responsibility, and also has a good understanding of any weapon from a machine gun and above - up to MANPADS or some kind of equipment. A sergeant must know all the weapons of his unit and be able to replace any of the soldiers, the soldier explains. However, the most important quality of a sergeant, Oleksiy calls humanity and attention to each of the soldiers. Because if a sergeant knows how to work with people of different backgrounds and ages, with different life experiences and education, he will be able to gradually master everything else and become a real leader in the team he will lead in his position. - When I commanded a platoon, soldiers could turn to me with any questions. Or I myself approached them and talked, if they did not go to contact. Because a sergeant is a person who must do everything possible for his soldiers, the instructor is convinced. At the training center, Oleksiy and his colleagues are training precisely such sergeants who are capable of becoming not only commanders, but also representatives of fighters in the teams they lead. There are not many such people, but the best ones get here, the instructor is convinced. — Military personnel with combat experience and command experience come to us. They already have the rank of sergeant and strive to develop and improve. Therefore, there are no problems with motivation - they themselves strive to rise to the next level, to become even better than they were, - explains the senior sergeant. Graduates of the Sergeant Training Center of the 199th Training Center of the Military Intelligence Service really become the real combat elite of their units. The most valuable achievement in training and communication with brothers and fellow sergeants is called mutual assistance and strong friendship. — What I really like in the army is brotherhood. This is such a strong friendship that I would never have met -in a civilian life-. It is this friendship in the army that keeps and does not want to let go. As if I could have -written off- by now, but I made friends here with the boys - and I don't want to go anywhere, I want to be with them and help them, - concludes our conversation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/zatyagnulo-teper-vin-podvijna-elita-istoriya-desantnyka-i-snajpera-gryni/	2025-01-25T20:37:35-08:00
Two million mines: -undermining- reality in Russian	The first question that arises is how much does it all weigh? For those who don't know, one antipersonnel mine weighs 2-4 kilograms on average. If we take only two million such mines (and this is -only- what Russian -experts- tell us), then the total weight of the -arsenal- that we allegedly buried is 4-8 thousand tons. Yes, it is several echelons or a colossal convoy of trucks. And where is all this -evidence-? Or maybe they are also mined? In modern warfare, mining the rear is not only illogical, but also technically difficult. Mines of this scale would take a colossal amount of resources, time and manpower, which are simply not available during active hostilities on the front. At most, Ukraine receives weapons from partners mainly for offensive or defensive purposes, and not for building a mine museum somewhere in the rear. However, Russian propagandists lack logic. For them, the main thing is to come up with something shocking, preferably such that even an old grandmother from Kursk would have her blood pressure raised. Here everything is simpler than it seems. Firstly, through fake statements, they are trying to discredit the Armed Forces of Ukraine, to create an image of -cruel and inhumane Ukrainians- who -do not count for anything.- Secondly, they divert the attention of their own citizens from the fact that their own mobilized people continue to get into -cotton shows- in the rear and on the front lines. And most importantly: this is an attempt to justify his own crimes. For every detonation of a civilian object or mass death of civilians, they already have an alibi ready: -it's not us, it's Ukrainian mines.- Let's imagine that we really -mined- the rear. What's next? Shall we put up -Caution, Russians not allowed- signs along these mines? Or maybe we will sign each mine: -Made in Ukraine, but only for fakes-? It seems that the Russian propagandists were so engrossed in their lying scenarios that they themselves began to believe in this movie. But the reality is this: their fictions are more like a poorly staged play for jaded audiences than anything worthwhile. Real evidence? None. No satellite images, no reports, no photos, no videos. Nothing. the Russian mass media once again created a myth on an equal footing, because inventing horror stories about Ukraine is their way of life. In fact, Ukraine fights honestly, in accordance with international norms, while Russian troops are famous for their minefields, which remain after their retreats. The next time you are told about another -sensation- from Russian propagandists, just think about who benefits from it. And remember: Ukraine is fighting for life, freedom and security, while Russia is fighting for -Olgino ratings-. The reality is simple: Two million mines is not about us. It is about those who undermine themselves on their own inventions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/dva-miljony-min-pidryv-realnosti-po-rosijsky/	2025-01-25T20:15:15-08:00

Hands up, bayonets in the ground — in the Zaporozhye direction, drones continue to capture Russians	This was reported by the head of the communications department of the 118th separate mechanized brigade, Dmytro Pelikh, on the broadcast of the -Yedini Novyni- telethon. According to Pelikh, along with conventional FPV drones, the enemy is now more actively using fiber-optic drones. For their part, the Defense Forces also actively use drones. In particular, in order to capture Russians. -By the way, this week we also captured an occupier who decided to surrender to our drone. That is, after weighing his strength and his physical condition, he raised his hands and followed our drone. After all, they know very well that they are disposable and there is no way for them. They confirm this to us,- said Dmytro Pelikh. As reported > ArmyInform, the Ukrainian military decided to encourage the Russian occupier, who chose captivity instead of a senseless death, by treating him to a tangerine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/ruky-vgoru-bagnety-v-zemlyu-na-zaporizkomu-napryamku-drony-prodovzhuyut-polonyty-rosiyan/	2025-01-25T09:49:02-08:00
They climbed into a gap, got into a coffin - the Russian attack aircraft did not reach our positions	The video of the combat operation was published on January 25 on the channel of the battalion, which is now being reformed into a regiment. The attack of the invaders was met with fire. Some of the disorganized Russians remained to spend the night in holes after realizing that their plan had failed, and the lifeless bodies of their comrades had already littered the battlefield. -We do not know for sure whether the Russian attack aircraft understood the inevitability of the moment. However, we know that our UAV operators clearly understood that the enemy must be destroyed to the end so that no occupier comes close to our infantrymen,- the brigade commented on the video. Therefore, the capture and destruction of Russians continued the next day. The enemy tried to continue his pressure from two directions, trying to infiltrate the adjacent positions of our comrades from the 118th Territorial Defense Brigade, as well as our positions of the 54th Brigade nearby. However, the coordinated work of the armored group, artillery and drone operators again broke their plans. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the battalion K- 2 54 of the mechanized brigade named after Hetman Ivan Mazepa appreciated the courage of the occupier, who was able to come closest to our positions. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/lizly-v-shhilynu-potrapyly-u-trunu-rosijsku-shturmovyky-ne-dijshly-do-nashyh-pozyczij/	2025-01-25T09:29:59-08:00

However, the Ukrainian army remains within the borders of the city, restraining the assaults in which the enemy is sending such -pickles- of unqualified soldiers. -They perform the function of bait. That is, they are blindly directed. Their task is to infiltrate past us, or expose our fire ambushes or fire positions. Run as deep as possible, hide in some kind of shelter, and wait for further orders or carry out demining measures,- said the commander of the 49th separate assault battalion -Karpatska Sich-.

The super two - -the Witch- and the chaplain go to help the wounded paratroopers	A video about this work was released on January 25 on the brigade channel. -Witch- until recently performed tasks in an assault company, and now helps wounded soldiers. -Supporting our wounded soldiers in hospitals and other medical facilities is an important part of paratroopers' rehabilitation. Every kind word is a small step towards their recovery. Now, visiting soldiers in hospitals, she talks with them, laughs, recalls various life moments, because it is easier for soldiers to speak out, to share what is on their hearts,- the brigade's message said. The path to the recovery of wounded fighters is a difficult process. Physical rehabilitation is only part of this path. Equally important is psychological and heart support, which heals wounds that cannot be seen and restores the motivation to move on. As reported by ArmyInform, since the beginning of the Kursk operation, 80 brigades managed to destroy over 5 thousand people personnel composition of the enemy, taking into account the killed and wounded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/superdvijka-vidma-ta-kapelan-idut-na-dopomogu-poranenym-desantnykam/	2025-01-25T08:15:52-08:00

Oleg Romanov, commander, told about this on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- anti-tank battalion of the Third Assault Brigade. According to him, the enemy is trying to capture the settlement of Kopanka directly in the lane of the Third Assault Brigade. The positions of the brigade are under constant assaults. -Because of this, we have to send assault groups to clear different areas every day. Also, the combined fire support of the brigade is currently working at full capacity. This also helps our infantry with FPV drones, artillery and mortars. By all means available to the brigade,- said the commander of the anti-tank battalion of the Third Assault Brigade. The enemy storms with great force. This is not surprising, because according to intelligence, the composition of the Russian First Tank Army and 20 Armies, which oppose the Third Assault Army, is approximately 80% full. And the motivation to fight the enemy is very simple. -Prisoners during interrogations say that when they go to the position, and this path is about 10 kilometers on foot, they see about 100 killed Russians in the landings. Some said that up to 300 were counted. And they go forward anyway, because if they turn back, they will be shot. They have only one way - to go forward, as during the Second World War,- said Oleg Romanov. ArmyInform already reported about a mass attack by -mangals- in the Kharkiv region - then the Defense Forces repelled the assault that the Russians had been preparing for a month.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/sto-mercziv-na-desyat-kilometriv-jduchy-na-shturm-rosijski-shturmovyky-rahuyut-poperednykiv/	2025-01-25T07:49:02-08:00

Theoretical training will be integrated into the curriculum as a separate discipline. Practical classes will be held during the holidays, which will avoid a conflict with the main study. Who conducts the training? Experienced retired military personnel, veterans of war and military service will be involved in the teaching of BZVP. Mandatory requirements are fluency in the Ukrainian language, an appropriate level of higher education, as well as good health and physical fitness. What practical skills do the students get?

70 thousand photos of the war for two: about the escape from the FPV drone, unpublished photos of Da...	Famous Ukrainian documentary photographers Kostya and Vlada Liberovy told the correspondent of ArmiyaInfrom about how their work has changed, what emotions are the most difficult to show in the shots, as well as about photos that are perceived personally and moments when it seemed that this would be the last shot. - How did the war affect you and your perception of life? - Everything has changed completely, starting from the circle of our communication, values ​​and ending with the style of clothing. From people who were not aware, not involved, we began to live a war. It's a real shame the way it used to be and would like to do a lot more now to balance it all out. If you look at what we shot before the wide scale, it is a photo where people are hugging, kissing, where people are smiling. Now, yes, we still have the main colors in photography, the search for our favorite light, that is, visually our language has not changed, but what the photos are about has changed. It took us half a year to get a feel for filming war. At first, we just duplicated what we knew before as photographers, but this is a completely different field of photography, it didn't turn out well, but some part of this experience remained, and you can say that this is some of our individuality in it. Speaking of colors, I don't know about Kosta, but I hate the blue sky in war, Vlada says and continues. — It hurts me so much. The sky is always so happy, right, just imagine: the blue boundless sky above the battered landing where our best men are dying and wounded&#8230; It creates a very strong dissonance for me, because under such a magical blue sky there must be something beautiful, and you find yourself where terrible things happen. Personally, I feel more comfortable filming the war under cloudy skies: in the rain, under the snow, when the weather is bad, then it is logical, I don't expect anything good. We work a lot in Donetsk region, and there are incredible dawns. In Kherson Oblast, there are unsurpassed sunsets, when nature begins to give you something super beautiful, and against the background of all this horror, for some reason I even feel anger inside. - Has your perception of death in the war changed over time? - We have lost many good friends and acquaintances, some of them even before our eyes were injured and died&#8230; Death used to be scary, now it's a habit. It's actually terrifying. Thinking about death, I always have a story in contrast, it was before the large-scale invasion, where we lived in Odessa. A person fell out of a window and died. It so happened that at that moment I was leaving the entrance: I see something covered with a bag, doctors are standing, people are gathering. It knocked me off track for more than a week, then I even dreamed of that situation. I didn't know this person, I didn't see anything, but Kostya knows that it almost became a nervous breakdown for me. Now, like, a lot of things are happening before your eyes and you just keep silent. It's scary that things like this are becoming commonplace. Even for the most sensual people, it is perceived that way, because there is no other way. This is how the human psyche is arranged - we get used to everything and there is no other way. These experiences remain, the pain remains, but it is somehow more dulled. The pain is throbbing, but you can live with it. But, it can last much longer than the sharp pain. - When you return from a war zone, are there any rituals to return to a more calm and peaceful life? - For both of us, it's just sitting at home and doing nothing, but at some point we feel acute the need to go back and do your thing again. We always emphasize that we are not in the army, we are not mobilized, but it so happened that all our social circle is military and it is difficult for us to find ourselves in ordinary civilian life in Kyiv. The government begins to prepare, because it found itself in this. -These are absolutely simple things, but this process, when you cut something, it cooks there, it calms me down and becomes a meditative element. Kostya Pravda then washes the dishes, and he doesn't like it,- Vlada says with a laugh. Kostya looks at his wife with a tender look and says: -She cooks perfectly and it's all very good. We started going to the hall when we are in Kyiv. It is more related to work, we found our coach, to whom we want to return. — When you work on the front lines lately, it's a constant load, you walk around in ammunition, fully equipped. During the time of Vovchansk, I completely changed my protection, I now have Kevlar everywhere: on my sides, neck, lower back, a large striker. I first encountered an FPV drone there, from which I was running away, says Kostya and continues. — When you run away from a drone that is chasing you with one goal: to kill or maim you, you draw a model in your head, where you imagine how the debris will fly into your body, and you think about how best to hold your hands so that less debris will fly. It is generally a weapon against humanity. And it turns out that you already want to take with you some equipment, provisions, and all this is additional weight on you, constant marches of 5-10 km, so sports are in fact an investment in your health and life. We tell all our friends not to neglect protection, so for the New Year holidays, for those who serve, we have updated the armor to be with the attackers. - What are the most difficult emotions for you to show in your works? - You can actually just open our Instagram page and see all the photos we took from the last to the first of the war. Every photo is pain and emotion. The most painful are the burials. This is simply the worst thing that can happen in this life. If these are your good friends, then this is just some surreal plot. We hate shootings like this, but at the same time we understand their importance because we have been thinking a lot lately about the importance of how future generations will remember and remember this war. There is such a persistent feeling that quite often Ukrainians find themselves defenseless before the enemy, because from generation to generation we forget who our enemy is. There is a feeling that the Russians have a background hatred for Ukrainians, and we do not have a background hatred for them. When the acute phase of the conflict, which has been going on for centuries, stops, we forget and begin to build relations with them again, we draw culture and language to us. We want to make it so (this idea was planted by Iryna Tsybukh - ed.) that future generations remember what happened in detail. The burial itself is the plot that best shows what kind of pain the Russians cause us in this period, because we show how painful it is to lose relatives and friends. - You constantly work together in quite difficult and stressful situations. Has the war changed your relationship? - Fortunately, no. Even from the beginning of our relationship, when we were not married, we worked together. All our lives, starting from the moment of meeting, we do everything together. Kostya says: -I love spending time with my wife and I wouldn't trade it for anything.- Vlada, thinking for a moment, proudly answers: -My perception of the person next to me has changed. I never knew Kostya was brave. There were simply no such cases when he was not a person who, for example, gets into a fight, because he is calm. I was surprised that he could work in such conditions. I can't do that, so I haven't been to the infantry for a year. All this year, Kostya actively worked with the infantry and went on assaults. It was a trait of his that I didn't know about. -Are there any stories that you have documented and would like to see them adapted? - An incredible number of stories that we see are actually ready-made plots for some very good cinema. Any infantryman and what happens in the positions is worthy of a screenplay. There is simply an incredible heat of passion. The horrors we saw there, the boys live them day by day. Sometimes when we watch some movies about the war, it seems that everything is much simplified there than what the military tells you, which is 11 years into this war. And we would very much like as many ordinary people and infantrymen as possible to go down in history, to save them and their faces, because they deserve it. - What was the most risky moment for you during filming, when you thought: -This could be my last shot-? - The first time it happened was when Vlada was injured. We were driving the car, not thinking about anything, and here the -Gradiv- packages are opening in front of us. You are muffled, everything is ringing in your ears, you don't even have time to be scared at this moment, but just think how stupid it is to die like that. We had the same thoughts, although we sat on different sides of the car. -I thought that's it, this must be it. I didn't have time to be scared at the moment, only then I was terribly scared for Vlada when she said that she had something wet in her side. I couldn't even open the car door because I was so scared. Then I had a real panic, although I usually tolerate everything very calmly and just shoot it. At that moment I was just confused, Vlada was given first aid, she told me to film this process,- Kostya recalled. -I understood that it was a minor injury, I was not dying and I was not in a panic. I had another moment. At that time, we worked with the -Azov- brigade. The shelling started, we started running and it's all about physical fitness and why it's so important. I had a very heavy armored car, I was not physically ready, and at a certain point I just fell on the shot bridge, because my body simply refused to run any further. I lie on it and think that's it, now the next projectile is in me. Then I got up, crawled, it wasn't scary, I was very angry with myself for putting people near me in danger. I can't move at their pace, everyone slows down because of me and it was a feeling of anger. And there was a second in the moment when I was lying down and thinking about everything: I felt sick,- Vlada shared her memory. - Do you have a -border of fear- that you do not cross? , when you don't physically pull, superimposed on fear after being wounded. When my husband works at zero, I shoot medical evacuation or art. - How do you feel about the fact that your photos can be used for Russian propaganda or manipulation? At most, it was one thing when it was their usual propaganda, but when it was those who tried to position themselves as an independent Russian mass media and could have access to a bank of photo agencies, where they officially buy them, put them on websites, and then write: -Here , again the Armed Forces failed to storm: losses of 500,000 people for today.- However, over time, they got used to it, because they understood that this is a Russian base - to lie. - How do you feel about the fact that your photos may be in history textbooks in the future? - Our close friend told us that there is a teacher in one Odesa school who shows our photos to the children and it really bothers us. moved It just feels like a dream come true that you've done something important. There is a new generation and they are shown our works, and it is an honor for us. Feeling like you've won an Oscar at the same time. It's not about the physical reward, it's much more weighty and meaningful. If our photos will one day be in the history books, it is not for nothing that we lived and did something valuable for future generations. - What are the most unexpected emotions you had to show in a frame? - Burial of Kosti Yuzvuk. He left a will as to how he would like his funeral to be conducted. Honestly, it looked like a party and everyone got into it. It was sweet and brought tears to my eyes. Taken out of context, this may seem strange to the average viewer. We edited a certain part of the photos and did not give them to the agency, because these photos could be taken out of context and propaganda could use this to their advantage. That is, the fact that today, following the will of the deceased, friends and relatives find the courage to smile precisely at the moment of farewell, because this person wanted it, is super cool, because this is the strength of the Ukrainian people. We give these photos to relatives, but do not publish them. - What good emotions did you have to convey in the frame? - There are also a lot of good emotions, despite the pain. In contrast, there are many such bright moments, such as love and sincerity, which are very powerfully felt. We've shot a lot of weddings on the front and it's always so real. When shooting a lot of weddings before 2022, it didn't always feel like it was on the front. People get married for different reasons and you don't always feel such sincerity in them at the moment. It is also the birth of children, brotherhood, the feeling of a strong shoulder and support. By the age of 30, of course, we had friends, but it was somehow sterile. Like okay, like a proper friendship from the TV series, sometimes we visited each other. And here it is completely different. Maybe you see this person 2-3 times, but he becomes so dear to you that you are ready to give everything for this person and this person gives you back. Such feelings are difficult to compare with anything at all. This is possible only during the war, and I hope that we will carry it further after the war. —After the end of the war, don't you plan to create your own museum or space where the personnel will speak for themselves? — On the one hand, this can be related to memory, because we really want to be a part of making sure that our actions do not forget all the horrors of war. We didn't think specifically about a museum or a space, but we don't have the resources now or ever to do something this big. But we do hope that there will be a resource for creating a photo book. Every year we say that we should start doing, but then we think that it is too early. Over the last month, we started working on our archive. These are about 70,000 photos that need to be re-examined, reconsidered and tried to assemble into something unified and harmonious. We hope to do so one day. - What is the most personal shot, even though the viewer doesn't know it? - Personal is an unpublished story that we haven't shown anywhere about the dead Da Vinci. We don't know if these photos will ever see the world, but his story and how he died are very personal to us. In general, it is all personal, it is difficult to single out one or several stories. All our work is with some involvement and emotionality, it cannot be otherwise. There are stories that make their way to the very heart and you can't do anything about it. It happens that we take a picture, and then relatives contact us and ask for a photo. They say that this was the last shot of this soldier and they ask to send a photo in good quality and it also becomes personal. These are quite painful moments. - How often are there moments when you cry after filming? - There is no such thing right away, because no nervous system could withstand that. But all the delayed emotions, Vlada personally catches up in the form of tears or in the form of aggression. That is, everything accumulated comes out later. - Will you return to filming peaceful life after the end of the war? - We will definitely shoot peaceful life, but we do not know in what format. This will definitely not be a love shoot, that is, everything that was done before the large scale. When peace comes, we will look for ourselves in it, but we will remain in documentary photography. We fell in love with this genre, because before we had an influence on the plot and everything that happened in the frame, and now our task is to catch the moment, because we don't have such influence, and that's why we fell in love with documentary photography as a genre. - Do you have a photographic dream that you have not yet realized or are you on your way to it? - When we were just starting out, the dream was to take, as probably every military photographer has, a photo that would stop a war . But the more you take such photos that should have stopped the war, the more you realize that it is not in the power of photographers and photos. We dream of shooting Victory. When we filmed the de-occupation of Kherson, it felt like a small celebration of Victory Day, but in the context of a separate city. And this dream that this day will come. However, now it seems that we will not celebrate it like that, but will remember those who gave their lives for her. We will be given the official casualty figure that day. And we will all go home in silence to think about this number. The best photos are the ones you were able to post, so you're alive.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/70-tysyach-foto-vijny-na-dvoh-pro-vtechu-vid-fpv-dronu-neopublikovani-foto-da-vinchi-ta-shho-czinnishe-za-oskar-intervyu-z-liberovymy/	2025-01-24T21:10:00-08:00
-I have never seen so much FPV in my life-: the story of a rugby player, and now a company officer, ...	Senior lieutenant, commander of the countersabotage company in the ranks of the 241st separate brigade of the Territorial Defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In civilian life, he was professionally engaged in rugby (since 1993), played for the Aviator club in the capital. He also had a private business. An active participant of two revolutions (Orange and Euromaidan), he has a stable and unyielding position regarding the future of Ukraine, its sovereignty and territorial integrity. -When I graduated from the ninth grade, in my graduation album, I was the only one with a blue-yellow badge on my school uniform,- recalls Viktor Baranov with pride. He says that after the end of the Revolution of Dignity, in the spring of 2013, he was in the center of Kyiv near the tent where volunteers were being recruited for the ranks of the -Donbas- battalion and thought about joining this unit. -I'll be honest: I didn't have enough courage. I justified myself by the fact that I have a 4-year-old daughter and I need to raise her. But he started volunteering. When the marine units left the Crimea for Mykolaiv, I visited them. Later, in Mariupol, he also worked under Debaltsev, Shchasti on the Svitlodar arc as a volunteer.- He admits that he did not expect a large-scale Russian invasion, and on February 24, 2022, he was in Transcarpathia, at a sports meeting with the Ukrainian rugby league team. -When I was told -Kep, war- - I immediately jumped into the car and drove to Kyiv. It is remembered that a lot of cars drove from the capital, and only a few cars went to Kyiv. When I entered the South Bridge, a rocket exploded overhead,- he says. In order to get into the ranks of the Defense Forces in the first days of the large-scale, says, laughing, -Cap-, it was necessary to resort to -corruption-: the queues at the military checkpoints were crazy, and those who wanted it were in the dark. In the end, Viktor Baranov as a soldier joined the ranks of the Territorial Defense Rifle Battalion (3rd Rifle Company). Got into -my- environment: out of 7 people in the department, 5 are athletes. In June 2022, during the battles for Dementiivka in Kharkiv Oblast, he received an injury. -&#8230; And I -escaped- from the hospital in order to, together with my brothers, with the whole platoon, plan an operation to remove the bodies of our dead, among them was the fallen company commander with the call sign -Sherman-. When everything was successful and we returned with the body, everyone just looked at us with wide-open eyes, speechless. After this incident, everyone respected us very much.- The career growth of an ambitious military man with good physical training was rapid and well-deserved: in March 2022, Viktor Baranov headed a department, in September 2022, a platoon (and, accordingly, already had the rank of junior lieutenant). And in 2023, he became a company commander. I ask which of these command positions was the most difficult for a military man. He says he's a mouthful. -It's a terrible position. The most difficult thing in it is to inform relatives about the death of their husband, son, brother in the war. Or when they call and ask about the circumstances of the death or why the body was not evacuated from the battlefield. It's incredibly difficult. As a company member, I know all the callsigns and year of birth of my soldiers. For example, -Duke-, born in 1999. He died. I know that he is the only son of his parents. And I realize that my son is the same age. I remember talking to him for 30 minutes. And I understood how important this conversation was for him, and my task during this communication was to provide information and support as much as possible. Although I understand for myself that parents do not need all the heroic deeds of their children - they need their child alive. The second most difficult thing in the position of a company commander, continues -Cap-, is to send his subordinates on a combat mission. -And my boys were born in 2003-2005. And the most difficult thing is to give them an order and send them on a mission. But when they return, then the best thing happens in the commander's life: I hug them, thank them for their work, and see how their eyes light up. We always discuss everything. And I always emphasize: any task can be done. Even burning Moscow is possible. But: not today, not by our strength, and not by our means. That is why we discuss each and every task in detail, chewing it down to the smallest nuances. And I am very nervous and very nervous at such moments,- shares the mouthpiece, smiling. And the most valuable thing in the life of a commander, says the interlocutor, is to hear from subordinates words like: -I trust you, commander, and that's why I will do it.- -These are the best people. And they are the best because we, the commanders, make them so.- In his mouth, -Kep- promotes a healthy lifestyle: -Our laws are -wild- - they don't even drink beer. And the chief sergeant of the company, by the way, has 536 jumps with a parachute, before the war he was engaged in parachuting.- &#8230; December 1, 2024 was one of the harsh combat episodes in the life of Comrade Viktor Baranov and his comrades. The place of action is Donetsk region, Velika Novosilka district. Then, according to the command, during the execution of combat missions, he skillfully built defenses in the settlement entrusted to him and thus blocked the enemy breakthrough of 40 infantrymen and eight units of Russian armored vehicles. -We predicted what sort of landings the Russians were planning to take, brought our BMP-2 into position there, it was 5 o'clock in the morning. Among the weapons was also -Fagot- and RPG. I myself was driving a pickup truck. And it so happened that we&#8230; drove into the flank of the Pod*rska column. She was 600 meters from us. We simply did not see them because of the peculiarities of the terrain there. To say that I was scared then is an understatement. If the Russians had seen us then and turned their -cannon- on us, we would be gone, I'm honest. I have never seen as much FPV as December 1st in my life! Three enemy UAVs flew into our pick-up truck, and they also worked on us with anti-aircraft missiles. In total, there were about 20 FPVs - in three years, we have not received such attention,- says -Kep-. The military calls the success of this combat sortie the good strategic position of the Ukrainian units in relation to the enemy; a good, well-camouflaged attack position, etc. During these events, the officer received a second concussion. But this whole story is summed up succinctly: -They crossed each other and left.- All this lasted from approximately 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. In conclusion: 10 Russians were eliminated, about 10 were wounded and 15, unfortunately, survived. Traditionally, we ask military personnel from the Defense Forces about how civilians can overcome their fear of the army, mobilization, and war. -Cap- replies, -I always tell my guys that I'm scared every time, every time I go out. Because only an idiot or a person under the influence of some substances is not afraid. For a normal person, fear is a normal phenomenon. And I explain that no matter how they feel about the word courage, courage is the ability to do what we have when we are afraid. That is, you are afraid - but you have to do it. That's what the concept of -courage- is. And to our second traditional question about what will be the end of the Russian-Ukrainian war for him, -Kep- answers as follows: -&#8230; But what is victory?.. Crossing the borders of 1991?.. I understand that it will be difficult to return Crimea now - but I would really like to. Perhaps some sanctions, exchanges, etc. will help. We would categorically not want a freeze on hostilities. Because the enemy will only accumulate armored vehicles, artillery, rockets, increase the army - and again deliver a massive blow. I don't trust the Russians&#8230; But do you know what I dream about? So that the shelling would stop, a kind of -buffer zone- of at least 1 kilometer would be formed on the contact line, and so that we would have at least half a year to take the bodies of our dead brothers from the battlefield. And the bastards took their own, if they need them, of course. After all, I very often talk with the relatives of those soldiers whose bodies have not yet been evacuated. And this is the only thing they ask me as a commander: -Take away at least the body - he wanted to go home so badly.- But I cannot expose my subordinates to such risks and dangers, because now the enemy has a lot of drones. But it is important for me to posthumously award these soldiers. After all, without a body, they are considered -400-, if there is a body - -200-. And only then will I be able to submit them for an award, and for me as a commander, this is very important.- And then, after thinking, the officer adds: -And I would also really like a big fence, about six meters high, on the state border of Ukraine - so that the Great Wall of China would envy us- Or that there was a North Sea on the eastern border of Ukraine, from Vovchansk to the Urals, with beluga and a lot of caviar. Or that we border the Arctic Ocean.- Photo from Viktor Baranov's personal archive	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/stilky-fpv-ya-shhe-ne-bachyv-nikoly-u-svoyemu-zhytti-istoriya-regbista-a-nyni-rotnogo-viktora-baranova/	2025-01-24T20:50:22-08:00
-Houston, we've got a problem-: How the International Legion Intelligence Control Point 2 works	Pavlo, commander of the special purpose company, deputy commander of the battalion tactical group, told ArmiyaInform about the combat work of the intelligence control point of the 2nd International Defense Legion. — Previously, when we worked in the Serebryansk Forest, we called such a point TSUP — the Flight Control Center. Now we call it PUR - Intelligence Control Point. Our main task is to coordinate combat work. Everything that can be obtained from radio-electronic intelligence, intelligence reports, and messages from neighbors flows here. We analyze radio-electronic intelligence - the report of our PEP arrives here - and draw conclusions about what the enemy's actions will be in our area of ​​responsibility, Pavlo explains. He notes that the enemy works on both analog and digital radios. The available PEP equipment allows you to listen to all analog communication. As for the -digit-, the keys to it are selected by hardware and also allow radio interception. - We learn the enemy's conventional marking grid - how they mark this or that landing and the points in it. Thanks to this, a layer is created in -Kropyva-, on which we fix points with the conventional markings of the enemy, which he uses in radio intercepts, says the officer. It is possible to find out the conventional signs of the enemy from the testimonies of prisoners and thanks to analytical work. For example, by listening to radio intercepts and observing the events on the battlefield, it is possible to determine how the occupiers mark this or that point on the site. — When shelling occurs, the enemy corrects it. We hear how they mark the point where they are shooting and record it on the map. Or when we inflict fire damage on them, certain assault or counter-assault actions take place, then through interception we also understand how the enemy marks this or that area. Then we put it on the map and report to the management for consideration in further work, says Pavlo. Thanks to such analytical work, it is possible to find out the vast majority of conditional marks used by enemies in the area already in a week. This makes it possible to understand which areas the intercepted messages are talking about and to react accordingly to the actions of the enemy. — When there is some accumulation, some movement, we intercept it all and report it. Because of this, we know and understand what the enemy is going to do, some time before the assaults, or the movement, or the massing, or other movements of the enemy. This is a simple linear analysis, there are no complex systems here. There is just an interception, in which callsigns and some dots sound. This is normal analytical work, there is nothing extraordinary here, he adds. The enemy's radio-electronic intelligence works in a similar way - the occupiers listen to the air and try to intercept and analyze the messages of the Ukrainian military. To prevent eavesdropping, countermeasures are used to effectively counter these hostile attempts. — There are algorithms according to which the encryption system in the radio air changes with a certain periodicity. For example, we change code-plugs on digital radio stations every week. Therefore, even if the enemies decoded our frequencies by hardware and can somehow eavesdrop, very quickly, after changing the encryption codes, they lose this opportunity, says Pavlo. He notes that the ethics of using radio stations, when speaking as little as possible on the air, also plays an important role. Another advantage is the Ukrainian language, because Russians understand Ukrainian much worse than Ukrainians understand Russian. And when it comes to foreign volunteers of the International Legion who communicate in their own languages, it becomes even more difficult for the enemy. — But still the most important are the encryption table, the ethics of communication in the radio air, and the most frequent change of the coding system. This is the only way we can prevent the enemy's PEP from working, the military man emphasizes. — The most important thing now is not to miss the movement of small groups. A year and a half ago, the Russians moved in groups of 4-6 servicemen, and now they are walking in groups of two. I think that in three months there will be one at all. It is much more difficult to -catch- the movement of one serviceman than to see a group of four or six, Pavlo tells about the features of modern military operations in Donetsk region. The movement of such doubles of the enemy is very dangerous, because if they are not detected and eliminated in time, they accumulate at the front edge and assemble into assault groups capable of attacking the positions of the Defense Forces. — Let's say two servicemen passed by and we didn't notice them. And they have already settled somewhere, taken some kind of shelter, buried themselves in a hole and are waiting for the next two. This is how accumulation occurs gradually. It's been three days, and they could already have a whole assault group there, the soldier explains. It is for this reason that surveillance of the area and listening to radio broadcasts must be round-the-clock and as thorough as possible, because even one enemy infantryman who has reached the accumulation point without hindrance is already a problem for the Ukrainian defenders on the front line. Soon, the officer speculates, the Russians will be moving near the front lines all alone, because intelligence can see them from drones at a depth of up to 5 kilometers. — Progress along the front is now measured by population centers. But it is very difficult to hold a settlement if there are no high-rise buildings there. The village is one-story houses, there is no shelter. It's fine to have some utility basement, but it usually can't withstand artillery or even mortars, let alone targeted strikes by FPV drones or UAVs. Instead, the forest or plantation can be maintained much more efficiently, the military officer emphasizes. In order to destroy a small village, he notes, it is enough to drop 6-8 KABs on it. After that, it will be almost impossible to hold it, because there will not be any suitable shelter left there. Such fortifications can be built in the forest or on the plantation, which will be very difficult to destroy with artillery fire or even aerial bombardment. — In order to demolish a fortified area in the forest, it needs to be -plowed- with tens of thousands of shells. Destroying a village is much easier. Therefore, hiding from artillery and drones is much better in thick plantations and forests. Therefore, in my subjective opinion, success should be measured and tasks should be set not by population centers, but by dense forests and forest strips. Because it is much easier to keep them, it is much easier to fight in them than in the village. Because in the village there is nothing to hold on to and we lose it very easily. Instead, we can keep the planting for a month or three, and the forest for six months, Pavlo explains his opinion. In view of this, the loss or retention of small villages should not be considered as much as key, defensible locations outside the population centers. It is by them that the successes and failures of the Defense Forces should be measured. — The relief here is very interesting, because there are folds of the terrain, differences in heights. This all defines the radio horizons for UAV flight. Now you need to maintain altitude not so much in order to put a gun there, as in order to put an antenna there and be able to fly 10 kilometers to the rear of the enemy, the officer explains. This is why it is important to maintain control over dominant heights, because their loss takes away important advantages in the use of drones. Instead, their capture by the enemy opens up significant opportunities for him to inflict damage deep into the Defense Forces' positions. — If I am pushed into some hole, then I cannot take off from there, because I do not have a radio horizon. Or I will be forced to fly at a high altitude, then the image quality will be low and, accordingly, the data quality will be low. In the same way, FPVs, if they are launched from a pit, they fly at a certain height, but when they reach the target, it may not be possible to control them, Pavlo notes. Artillery, having high-quality intelligence and targeting, can shoot from anywhere - it is not so much a high position that is important for it, but reliable shelter and high-quality camouflage, so that it is difficult to detect and hit during a counter-battery fight. The International Legion Intelligence Control Post 2 is a communications hub. Information flows here from intelligence, from strike drones, from REP. It is needed in order to collect information about the enemy, analyze it and bring it to the command. The task of the PUR is to provide the most objective and complete information so that the commander can make the right decision. - Intelligence is always the most progressive guys and girls in every unit. It is they who have the most operational information not only about the enemy, but also about their own. And when there is normal communication between the intelligence control points on this lower horizon, then the plus-minus units cooperate normally. Management is then given information on which to make objective decisions. That is, the quality of decision-making by commanders depends on how well the PURs work in the units, the officer is convinced. In order to be able to qualitatively process all the information that flows to the PUR, at least two military personnel who are able to engage, monitor and organize several processes at the same time must be on duty at the point. - The main problem with operators on the PUR is immersion in several processes at the same time. Information is processed in several - more than four - parallel processes. The thing about -standard- military is linearity. In general, our army is mostly straight linear processes, and where there is branching, there is some parallelism, problems immediately arise. Therefore, we first of all need managers - people who managed or were involved in the work of several parallel processes at the same time. The more a person can process parallel processes at the same time, the better he is an operative on duty at the PUR, the military officer notes. You can learn the technical component of work at the intelligence control post in a month. Instead, civilian experience as a project manager will be a significant advantage, because a person with the appropriate skills and abilities will be able to easily join the organization and management of several processes at the same time. It is the operative on duty who brings together a group of several servicemen needed to perform a certain task within the limits of a separate -myth- - an online meeting. This can be, for example, the pilot and drone operator, who adjust the direction of artillery fire, and the battery commander, who conducts fire damage to the enemy. At the same time, several people scattered many kilometers from each other can be within the -myth-. However, during a mission, they work as a single military body, receiving information, making decisions and executing tasks in real time. — Our intelligence control point is needed to keep a balance between desires and capabilities. In order to identify the enemy and choose the best way to defeat him. In order to constantly keep a hand on the pulse of hostilities, Pavlo emphasizes the importance of PUR 2 of the International Legion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/gyustone-u-nas-problema-yak-praczyuye-punkt-upravlinnya-rozvidky-2-internaczionalnogo-legionu/	2025-01-24T20:33:46-08:00
-Digital defender- for France: the American company will build new planes for the Navy of the countr...	As emphasized in the text of the official release published by the company's management on this occasion, aircraft builders from the United States have signed a contract for the production of of the French Armed Forces three E-2D Advanced Hawkeyes, the delivery of the first of which is expected in 2027, according to ArmyInform. Grumman casually announced that the E-2D -Advanced Hawkeye- aircraft will replace the E-2C Hawkeye 2000 aircraft of the French fleet, which served for more than 25 years. -Our partnership with France has been going on for over 25 years. We are proud to have supported the French Navy with the Hawkeye 2000, and we look forward to the leap in aircraft generations with the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye,- said Northrop Grumman Vice President Janice Zilch. Since entering service with the French Navy in 1998, the E-2C Hawkeye 2000 has been a critical component of the French air defense system, supporting the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier strike group. The new AVACS (Airborne Warning And Control System) aircraft has the ability to refuel in the air, which significantly increases its operational flexibility. Currently, France remains the only country other than the US to operate these aircraft from an aircraft carrier. If we recall the history of the creation of this aircraft, at the beginning of 2007, the Northrop Grumman company demonstrated at its plant in St. Augustine (Florida) the first E-2D -Advanced Hawkeye- radar long-range surveillance (RLDS) board. Its first flight took place on August 3 of the same year. The E-2D is equipped with Lockheed Martin's AN/APY-9 electronic scanning radar, which provides enhanced search capabilities and combat applications as an airborne combat control system. The APY-9 radar has an electronically scanned active phased array. The new radar will be able to detect aircraft equipped with stealth technologies, such as the Russian Su-57 and the Chinese Chengdu J-20. According to the concept of the Navy NIFC-CA, the E-2D aircraft can direct the missile weapons of the fleet (such as missiles AIM-120 AMRAAM and missiles SM-6, which our editors talked about in their materials) on a target beyond the detection range or capabilities of the launch platform. Demonstrated in 2007, the experimental aircraft was the first of two to be built during the $2 billion System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase of the E-2D aircraft program (a contract with the US Navy for work on the SDD phase was awarded in 2001). The US Navy has said it plans to build 75 of these aircraft over two decades. Unlike previous options, the new Advanced Hawkeye aircraft can coordinate air strikes against air, ground and sea surface targets. According to Northrop Grumman, -the E-2D aircraft will allow the armed forces to take a large amount of information from various sources and synthesize this data for active intelligence.- Along with the fact that the appearance of the new aircraft is similar to the E-2C aerial reconnaissance aircraft, the systems and capabilities presented on the E-2D aircraft have been completely improved. The aircraft's mushroom-shaped rotating radar antenna fairing, designed by L-3 Communications, features continuous scanning with a 360° field of view, along with an electronically scanning grating antenna. The system allows operators to focus radar on selected areas of interest. Operators of the E-2D also have new radar workstations, satellite communications capabilities and other tools to provide their units with enhanced situational awareness, according to Northrop Grumman. Another new feature is a modern crew cabin with increased glazing and computerized graphic displays that have replaced the previous generation's indicators and on-board radio electronics. One of the advantages is that pilots can also act as weapons system operators. In November 2007, the flight tests of the E-2D aircraft were completed in the USA. The machine spent about 600 hours in the air. Half of them were dedicated to testing the functionality of radar systems. And during the tests, no significant deficiencies were found in the aircraft's systems. The E-2D Advanced Hawkeye DRLO aircraft is equipped with Allison T56 turboprop engines (more than 4,000 hp) and a rotating radar dome with a diameter of 7.3 meters, which is mounted above its fuselage and wings. Spanning more than sixty years of history, the E-2 family has performed early warning and airborne surveillance functions in several countries around the world. Equipped with advanced radar and advanced combat control systems, the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye is considered the global benchmark for carrier-based early warning aircraft. With an active production line and a track record of just-in-time delivery, E-2D ensures operators stay ahead of rapidly evolving threats. By adopting the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, the French Navy reaffirms its commitment to remain at the forefront of maritime operations, using state-of-the-art technology and long-standing partnerships to protect its national interests and effectively contribute to international security.

- Sensation of the year-: Russian fake about a Ukrainian military man who became a maniac	Let's dive into this -sensation- and analyze why it causes more laughter than fear. First, it is worth noting that the sources of this information remain very mysterious. The primary sources of such -news- often come from fringe news sites or anonymous Telegram channels known for their wild accusations and horrific -scenarios-. We are reminded of the seriousness of the situation, but mostly forget to point out that there are no verified facts and, on top of that, these stories are fantasy. Could it be such an interesting fiction, as in the old youth novels? Apparently, this is definitely not for a documentary film. The appearance of such fakes is part of a wider propaganda campaign designed to discredit the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to the scenario, Russian propagandists are trying to present the Ukrainian military as unpredictable, who instead of protecting the country are trying to organize -cleanses- in their homes. Here is the perfect picture of a Russian propagandist: a soldier who has learned the horrors of war, is unable to control himself and turns to crime. But let's look at the reality. Most of the Ukrainian military on the front lines are distinguished by a high level of discipline and professionalism, defending the country from the aggressor every day. And think about it, do the Russians really believe that one made-up story can destroy this reputation? Disinformation of this kind is not just a fake, but a psychological game aimed at creating hatred and fear. By releasing such -news-, the Russian mass media hope not only for emotional resonance, but also for destabilization of society. In real life, of course, no one has recorded such a case, but in a moment of impasse, readers think it is better to believe spectacular headlines than to analyze reality. Returning to our -sensation-, the real question is not whether to believe this story, but how many more fakes will be invented to create the necessary image. Each new fake only confirms the statement about the unsubstantiated nature of Russian propaganda. The real challenge is to get information that seeks factual confirmation of what is happening on the front, and not to succumb to provocation. So, the next time you come across a news story about a mysterious military maniac, remember that it's most likely just another piece of the disinformation game.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/sensacziya-roku-rosfejk-pro-ukrayinskogo-vijskovogo-yakyj-stav-maniyakom/	2025-01-24T20:10:49-08:00
Europe for $10,000 — two salesmen -tours- for evasion were exposed in Prykarpattia	This was reported on January 24 by the special prosecutor's office of the Western region. According to the investigation, a 47-year-old ex-military man and a 52-year-old local resident were looking for conscripts who wanted to go abroad during the war. For the money, the men promised to produce the necessary permission documents: certificates from the military medical commission on unfitness for army service and fictitious temporary certificates that would exclude -clients- from the register. They valued their services at $10,000 per person. The suspects were detained during an attempt to ferry the man to one of the EU countries. Currently, preventive measures have been chosen for them in the form of detention with the right to post bail. In the course of authorized searches, mobile phones with correspondence and other physical evidence were found, which confirm the illegal activities of accomplices. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/yevropa-za-10-tysyach-na-prykarpatti-vykryly-dvoh-prodavcziv-turiv-dlya-uhylyantiv/	2025-01-24T11:59:42-08:00

Every -shakhed-, like every Russian missile, is made on the basis of foreign components — President	Volodymyr Zelenskiy said this in his evening address on January 24. -At first, Iran transferred ready-made Shaheds to Russia, then their own production was mastered in Tatarstan, one of the national territories that Moscow still controls. And although these -shaheds- are actually Russian, they still could not have been made there without foreign supplies. Each such -shahed-, like each Russian missile, is made on the basis of foreign components - critical components, without which Russian terror would be impossible in general. -Thirty-one Shaheds last night are approximately 2,635 components from other countries: microcircuits, switches, transceivers,- the President said. In his opinion, all supply of any components for terror to Russia should be blocked in order to stop this terror. -And this applies not only to the protection of life in Ukraine. Now the Russian -shaheds- are hitting the houses of our people, our infrastructure, but at any moment the Russians can transfer terror to any other country - wherever they are ordered,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine presented the intelligence officers with state awards.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/kozhen-shahed-yak-i-kozhna-rosijska-raketa-robytsya-na-osnovi-inozemnyh-komponentiv-prezydent/	2025-01-24T11:46:11-08:00
They accumulated -armor- and waited for the fogs - the enemy tried to attack Chasiv Yar	Andrii Polukhin, a representative of the press service of the 24th mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, told about this on the ArmyTV stream on January 24. -The 98th airborne division of the Russian army has been fighting against us since November. They also tried to carry out mechanized assaults before, but failed. We destroyed a similar group of armored vehicles at the beginning of November. There was also a case in mid-December when they were destroyed thanks to our remote mining. Now they were able to land a landing party, this is their goal. But technology does not go back. The staff, too,- said Andriy Polukhin. According to him, the landing party was shot down by drones of the 18th brigade of the National Guard. Andriy Polukhin linked the intensification of the assaults to the foggy weather, which impairs the operation of our drones. This is what the Russians decided to take advantage of. The brigade collects for drones and invites them to contribute financially to the destruction of the enemy. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukrainian defenders broke the mechanized assault of the Russian landing force, destroying four BMDs.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/nakopychyly-bronyu-i-dochekalysya-tumaniv-vorog-sprobuvav-atakuvaty-chasiv-yar/	2025-01-24T11:24:10-08:00
For $10 thousand promised - to resolve the issue - with the TCC: a suspect in bribery was detained i...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. According to the investigation, at the beginning of 2025, an unemployed man from Kharkiv, flaunting his alleged connections with TCC and VLK officials, offered an acquaintance for 10,000 US dollars to organize a -package of services- to avoid mobilization. It was about issuing a military ticket to a comrade and medical documents from the military medical commission, which will be the basis for exclusion from military registration. While receiving the specified amount, the law enforcement officers detained the dealer in accordance with Art. 208 of the Communist Party of Ukraine in the center of Kharkiv. The issue of selecting a preventive measure in the form of detention for the suspect is being resolved. As part of the criminal proceedings, investigative actions are being conducted, the involvement of TCC, VLK employees in the commission of this criminal offense is being checked. The pre-trial investigation is being carried out by the SE police department No. 2 of the Kharkiv RUP No. 1 of the National Security Service of Ukraine in the Kharkiv region.

-Work, teach, fight, and most importantly - do not break-: the story of a marine -Gif-, who returned...	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the 38th Separate Brigade of Marines. Before the full-scale invasion, Denys worked in the collection service of one of the Ukrainian banks. He met the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation in Donetsk region as part of the 1st separate battalion of marines, where he gained valuable combat experience, in particular, during the defense of the city of Bakhmut. In the winter of 2023, while performing a combat mission near the village of Vodyane, -Gif- blew up on a mine and lost a leg. This became a serious test, but it did not break his spirit. After undergoing treatment and rehabilitation, as soon as he put on a prosthesis, Denys returned to service, but already to the 38th separate brigade of marines, where he became a tactical combat instructor. In difficult situations, -Gif- always keeps the situation under control. -You have to work, study, fight, and the main thing is not to break down. Despair, insecurity and discouragement are what prevent you from becoming a true warrior,- he says. Currently, -Gif- is transferring its invaluable combat experience to recruits in the Pokrovsky direction, preparing them for the defense of Ukraine.

From the seller of equipment to the chief sergeant of the platoon: the story of a fighter with the c...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. At the age of 28, Igor decided to join a newly created brigade equipped with modern weapons. His military journey began with a two-month basic training - the first steps to understanding army life. After training, he got into the mortar unit, where the work was difficult but interesting. Later, Igor took the opportunity to learn how to fly drones. He quickly mastered the Mavic, and later, albeit with more effort, the Vector UAV. So he became part of a new battalion of unmanned systems. -Plut- now spends most of its time in the war zone, performing reconnaissance and adjusting artillery fire. He recalls two episodes that are particularly memorable to him. Once near Chasovoy Yar, Igor's crew discovered an enemy armored car hiding in the landing. The artillery strike was accurate, but the explosion revealed another piece of enemy equipment that had not been seen before. Another case happened in Ocheretino. On a relatively calm day, when the enemy almost did not move, -Plut- and his brothers noticed a moving object 5 km from the observation zone. Additional intelligence established that it was the Russian Solntsepok. Igor promptly transmitted the information to the dispatcher, other units joined the broadcast, and with joint efforts the enemy equipment was destroyed. For Igor, as well as for many other defenders, such moments are not just the performance of official duties, but also a real opportunity to contribute to victory. His story is an example of how war can dramatically change lives, opening up new talents and opportunities to serve one's country. As reported by ArmyInform, Cheka's life until February 24, 2022 was calm and measured. He worked as a programmer in an international company, often visited abroad. However, the first Russian missile strikes changed everything. -Cheka- without hesitation decided to become for the protection of the Motherland.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/vid-prodavczya-tehniky-do-golovnogo-serzhanta-vzvodu-istoriya-bijczya-z-pozyvnym-plut/	2025-01-24T09:51:57-08:00
Fire on BMP — in Kurshchyna, our pilots hunted down 5 armored vehicles	The video of combat work was released on January 24 on the brigade's channel. The enemy tried to hide some of his equipment in landings, but it did not help much. If it was not possible to hit the BMP the first time, our pilots flew in again. As a result, it was possible to achieve damage with the detonation of the ammunition. They did not forget to pay tribute (death) to the enemy infantry. -The hunt for lovers of the Ruskavian mira also continues. Two will not return home. We work not only against enemy equipment - we destroy myths about the enemy's invincibility,- the brigade commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, another massive assault of Russian troops failed thanks to the coordinated work of units of the 47th Mechanized Brigade -Magura- and the 82nd Assault Bukovinskaya brigades	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/vogon-po-bmp-na-kurshhyni-nashi-piloty-vpolyuvaly-5-bronemashyn/	2025-01-24T09:40:59-08:00
-Sniping is a science and an art-: a special officer of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense spoke abo...	This is discussed in publication on the page of the Artan special unit. -Any military specialty is difficult, but sniper is like the pinnacle,- says the -Korean-. He talked about some elements of sniper training, in particular, photographic memory training. -How we train photographic memory: in the morning, 10 objects are laid out in front of us, and after some time and after physical exertion, you have to describe and draw them with accuracy to the smallest detail,- says the fighter. - We work in the same way in the area - we need to identify and accurately describe objects hidden and disguised in the forest. Or note the smallest changes that have occurred around the position during the absence.- The Korean described the process of memory and observation training in more detail: Separately, the Korean talked about the training for detecting camouflaged positions: -One of the tasks is to detect camouflaged positions or something unusual or non-standard for a certain area. We lay out various objects in the area, for example, canisters or something else, and from a certain distance we are told: -Here we disguised or hid 10 keys.- Our task is to find all the objects and describe them within a certain time, depending on the difficulty of the task. We can use optical instruments of low power to search. It's a difficult task, but we have to do it.- He also talked about terrain change detection training: -During another training session, we look at a certain area of ​​the area, memorize it, then turn away or walk away for a while, during which certain changes occur in the area. After that, we go back and have to determine what exactly has changed. This is necessary because a sniper is, first of all, an observer. He must clearly understand what is standard for the area and what is non-standard, which may have appeared during his absence from the position. In this way, we practice the necessary skills.- According to the Korean, a sniper should be as attentive to details as possible, be able to quickly analyze the situation and notice even minor changes in the area. It is these skills, along with accurate shooting, that make a sniper an effective fighter. In the -Artan- special unit, they emphasize that sniping is a real combination of science and art.

-Hobby — shooting down drones-: the Patron machine gun has already destroyed 70 enemy UAVs	The story of the soldier was made public on the page of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Patron- comes from Transcarpathia, Tyachiv district. His decision to join the army was inspired by the tragic events he saw on TV: -I watched TV, saw that peaceful victims, small children, were being killed there. I decided to go to protect them, so I joined the ranks of the Armed Forces,- the soldier says. He became defensive and participated in front-line battles, where he showed remarkable accuracy and endurance even in the hottest spots. During his service, Patron has repeatedly proven that MAVIC or FPV drones have little chance against his watchful eye and steady hand. He even developed his own method of -hunting- for UAVs. -They call me a sniper because I shoot down drones. About 70 drones, definitely shot down. When Mavik works for us, I already know the principle of how it works. He flies and drops two VOGs, we are already sitting, hidden. I run out when I dropped two VOGs, and I'm working on it. He still hangs a little, looks where he got and if he got there at all. And it is so easy to knock it down, it hangs very low,- Patron shares his experience. Patron considers the greatest value in his work to be the gratitude of his brothers whose lives he saved from enemy drones. The story of -Patron- is an example of courage and dedication to one's work. He not only carries out combat missions, but also saves the lives of his comrades by effectively countering enemy drones.

Rustem Umyerov announced the appointment of a new head of the Defense Procurement Agency and the dis...	Rustem Umyerov wrote about this on Facebook on the evening of January 24. -This is the first and last post on the topic of arms procurement. The only criterion that the Ministry of Defense sets before the Defense Procurement Agency is to provide the front with all the necessary weapons on time and in full. Unfortunately, over the past six months, instead of providing the army with ammunition in a timely manner, we have received political games, -drains- of contracts, -drains- of information (law enforcement officers will definitely check these facts), PR inaction and non-fulfillment of the CRI by the subordinate enterprise of the MoU. Arms purchases, which should be closed during martial law and a full-scale war with Russia, somehow turned into an -Amazon-, where every Internet user can see in real time who is buying what and in what quantities and from which manufacturers. And the scale of these purchases, which would have been at least commensurate with PR in the mass media, were never felt by our defenders at the front. Therefore, I made a decision to suspend all those who failed this work: The Ministry of Defense also recalls two representatives of the state from the Supervisory Board. This will become a precedent in the history of state corporate governance, when two independent representatives of the Supervisory Board supported the state's position, and the state-authorized representative of state interests ignored the recommendations of the governing body. The restart of the Supervisory Board will take place in the near future. Arsena Zhumadilov will be appointed as the director of AOZ. This year, AOZ and DOT had the same conditions. One agency got the job done, the other just created media hype. There is a lot of talk about the purchase of weapons for the army, but the result is unsatisfactory. We are changing the system so that the result is at the front, not in the news,- wrote Rustem Umyerov. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense congratulated of the military, who ensure the security of Ukraine from the shadows.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/rustem-umyerov-povidomyv-pro-pryznachennya-novogo-kerivnyka-agencziyi-oboronnyh-zakupivel-i-zvilnennya-odnogo-iz-zastupnykiv/	2025-01-24T08:31:46-08:00

According to Mysnyk, the enemy mostly fights with small infantry groups and mortars. For the past few days, OTU -Siversk- has not recorded shelling from MSWs, because they do not approach the border. The defense forces continue to strengthen the defense — they mine the territories and improve the fortifications. -Accordingly, the enemy, taking into account that they have the syndrome of the Kursk operation, they are also changing approaches from their side, strengthening fortifications. But we don't let them do it freely there. Because we capture both combat equipment and specialized equipment and try to destroy it as much as possible,- said the spokesman of the Seversk OTU.

Luhansk is drowning in garbage and filth: the occupation authorities ignore communal problems	The head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, Artem Lysogor, reported this on his page. According to him, at the local waste disposal center, about 40% of the positions of garbage truck drivers remain vacant. There is also a shortage of garbage collectors — 30% of staff units are vacant. In addition, there is a shortage of garbage trucks themselves. Due to a lack of personnel and equipment, utility workers are forced to work overtime, even on weekends. The situation is worsened by the fact that the occupation authorities have been promising to build six new landfills for garbage on the territory of the LPR for the third year, but the promises remain only in words. Instead, waste continues to be transported from neighboring regions of Russia to already existing, long-overflowing and emergency landfills, which creates an additional burden on the ecological situation in the region.

Ukrainian fighters hone their weapon skills: from the Belgian FN Minimi to -Pokémon-	A selection of photos from combat exercises was made public on the page of the Land Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. A tense atmosphere prevails at the training ground, which is broken by the loud sounds of gunshots. Special attention is drawn to the Belgian FN Minimi machine gun of 7.62 mm caliber. This weapon is known for its feature — an almost imperceptible flame when firing. As noted in the message, a bright flash in one of the pictures is more the exception than the rule for this machine gun. Along with the modern FN Minimi, fighters practice with weapons that have a much longer history. A machine gun, which the military jokingly calls -Pokémon-, got into the frame. This name arose from the combination of the Soviet abbreviation -PKM- (Kalashnikov machine gun modernized) and the name of a popular children's character. Such a combination is a cruel irony that combined a weapon designed to destroy the enemy with a favorite children's toy. The photos show how a machine gun belt confidently slides through the fingers of a soldier preparing his weapon for battle. Nearby, another fighter stands and fires a Pokémon, demonstrating mastery of a weapon that is over 40 years old. Another duo of machine gunners practice together, directing fire deep into the range. They get used to the loud sound of gunshots and practice marksmanship for educational purposes. The message emphasizes that fire training is not just practicing shooting techniques. It is also work on psychological stability, stamina and confidence in yourself and your weapon. This is the ability to act effectively even in the most difficult conditions, when life is at stake. And this preparation is an important step on the way to the main goal of Ukraine's victory.

Stream and waterfall tactics: how different are the actions of the enemy in the Limansky direction	Maksym Bilousov, head of the communications branch of the 60th Separate Mechanized Brigade. According to Bilousov, the enemy has now found a tactic that is more or less successful for him. However, it is accompanied by crazy losses. We are talking about infantry assaults in small groups - a maximum of four people. Such attack aircraft are constantly destroyed, but the attacks do not stop. -You have to understand that they go around the clock, and we work around the clock. However, one way or another, someone manages to slip through. They have absolutely no instinct for self-preservation. They know - the group went ahead, they have not returned and there is no radio signal from them. But the next group comes out after that and moves forward in the same way,- said the head of the communications department of the 60th separate mechanized brigade. According to Bilousov, the difficulty of such assaults lies precisely in the fact that they are permanent. The enemy attacks practically non-stop. -If a mechanized assault is like a waterfall, then the mechanics of such infantry assaults is more like a small stream, but which flows and flows. And that's why it's more difficult than a waterfall. Because you can withstand the impact of the waterfall, fight it off and then rest a little. And here we don't even have time to relax,- Maksym Bilousov said. As reported by ArmyInform , the occupiers continue active offensive actions in the Lyman direction, however, the Defense Forces of Ukraine restrain enemy assaults and regain positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/taktyka-strumka-ta-vodospadu-yak-vidriznyayutsya-diyi-voroga-na-lymanskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-24T02:32:45-08:00

A massive attack by the Mangals in the Kharkiv region — the defense forces repelled the assault that...	Oleksandr Borodin, spokesman for the Third assault brigade. According to Oleksandr Borodin, most likely, the enemy had an order to try to advance in the area of ​​responsibility of the Third Assault Division. They attacked with more forces than companies, and the operation was very seriously prepared. The enemy formed a mechanized fist of 30 pieces of equipment. -The equipment there was neither T-62 nor &#8220;mess&#8221; (BRDM. — Ed.). These were relatively recent samples, such as the modernized T-80. They were all prepared for battles against FPV. That is, they had all the so-called braziers and other self-made defense systems there,- said the spokesman of the Third Assault Brigade. Borodin suggests that the Russians have been preparing such an operation for more than a month. However, in the end, they did not succeed. Fighters of the Third Assault Division repulsed the attack. As reported by /a> ArmyInform, an operation is underway in Kharkiv Oblast, which aims to -push- the enemy away from the regional center as much as possible.

-Guaranteed unhindered crossing of the border-: a bribe-taking lawyer was detained in Dnipro	This was reported by the State Bureau of Investigation. SBU employees, in cooperation with the SBU, detained a lawyer from Dnipro while he was receiving payment for helping a local resident avoid mobilization and leave the border. Flaunting his connections with TCC officials and law enforcement officers, the lawyer offered a local resident $12,000 to organize a -package of services- for him to avoid mobilization and travel abroad. He promised to help the man receive fictitious treatment in one of the medical facilities, after which he would agree on the necessary documents with representatives of the TCC. Also, the amount of payment included assistance for the transfer of the conscript outside the state. The lawyer guaranteed that when crossing the border he would be let through and no -unnecessary questions- would be asked. While receiving $12,000, the lawyer was caught red-handed. In his car, in addition to the bribe, military registration documents for three other conscripts with resolutions and seals of one of the local TCCs were found and seized. As reported by ArmyInform, law enforcement agencies detained a traitorous official who, during the occupation of Kherson Oblast, -vtechi-zs-rf-hovavsya-u-hmelnyczkomu/->cooperated with the army invaders, and after their escape, he hid in the territory controlled by Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/garantuvav-bezpereshkodnyj-peretyn-kordonu-u-dnipri-zatrymaly-advokata-habarnyka/	2025-01-24T01:37:07-08:00
Reform of physical support of the Armed Forces: from formal inspections to a culture of quality	About this in the ArmyInform interview told the head of the Central Department of Material Quality Control support of the Armed Forces Colonel Ihor Leshchenko. Moving away from formal inspections to a comprehensive approach that includes laboratory testing, field control and video recording encourages manufacturers to continuously improve and increase responsibility. Before the reform, as Colonel Ihor Leshchenko notes, the acceptance system was often reduced to a formal inspection of the quality of things. This created conditions for the supply of products that outwardly met the standards, but were made of low-quality materials. In fact, quality control was focused on the appearance rather than the actual characteristics and properties of the materials. The reform changed this approach radically. The introduction of mandatory laboratory tests, the transfer of the acceptance process to the supply bases and the video recording system became elements of a comprehensive system aimed at ensuring real, not formal, quality. An important aspect of the reform is its impact on manufacturers. Initially, as mentioned earlier, some companies resisted the new requirements. However, over time it became clear that strict control is not an obstacle, but an incentive for development. Manufacturers began to invest in new technologies, improve production processes and improve the skills of personnel. In fact, the reform catalyzed the transition to a new culture of quality, where quality is not a formal indicator but a key priority. Colonel Leshchenko emphasizes that the goal of the reform was not only to identify and reject low-quality products, but also to create conditions for continuous improvement. The feedback system, when manufacturers receive information about detected defects and have the opportunity to correct them, contributes to the formation of a responsible attitude to quality. As reported by ArmyInform, material support quality of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is critical important for the effectiveness and safety of our military in active combat conditions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/reforma-rechovogo-zabezpechennya-zsu-vid-formalnyh-perevirok-do-kultury-yakosti/	2025-01-24T01:26:37-08:00

About the superiority of Stugna over Kornet and the dream of punching Putin: the junior sergeant tol...	Why did he learn to work with anti-tank missiles while working as a driver? But what does Valery dream of hitting, apart from enemy armored vehicles? He told the correspondent of ArmiyaInform about this. -Before the large-scale invasion, I already served in the army, retired in 2019. Since April 2022, he has returned to the army. At first, my wife was in shock, she was afraid for me. But then she pulled herself together and supported me. Of course, it was difficult to leave my family, but I knew that I had a reliable back at home. &#8230;It is so established in our mouth that each person must know everything so that we can replace each other. Therefore, in the position of a driver, I mastered the work of ATGM. Of all ATGMs, my favorites are -Stugna- and -Cornet-. -Stugna- is better because you shoot from the dugout, you are in cover, in safety. Even when fire is being fired at you in response, you are calmer, you can concentrate. I can remember one day when we destroyed the enemy with a lot of equipment. It was in the Lyman direction. It was the second day of the enemy assault. On the first day, another shift worked, and we changed them for the next two days. When we arrived at the position with the boys, we saw that our comrades had done a good job: there were no rockets left, the boys had used them all. Therefore, there was an urgent delivery of ammunition for us. After the first defeat of enemy equipment, then, of course, there was great euphoria, joy! I dreamed about this for a long time, I was very pleased. Well, then everything went smoothly. You just have to keep a cool head: we just left and worked out. I shot both from Stugna and Kornet that day. &#8230;So, that day, I remember, the first group of the enemy left. We wanted to hit him immediately so that he would shoot less at the infantry positions, because the infantry is covering us, standing in front of us, and we want to secure it. This tank gave off smoke, it was difficult to see. The boys and I spent about a minute, or even one and a half, healing him for a long time, but then we saw flashes in the smoke when he was shooting, fired at the flash and hit. We worked it out with -Stugna-. When I worked with -Cornet-, then the enemy Tanchik and -Bekha- left. I shot at the tank, because it is a priority, it is a -fatter- target. And Vitaly worked on the -devil- with the call sign -Elephant-. An assistant with the call sign -Acapulco- was with me. This is his first combat outing, and he was pleasantly surprised when he heard how it was firing, how everything was happening, he was pleased as well as I was. &#8230;What target do I still dream of hitting? Of course, you want to punch Putin. Well, at least hit the helicopter. In general, in order to effectively destroy enemy equipment with the help of ATGMs, you need to be patient, attentive, and cool-headed. So that your calculation works as one whole, as one team. When the calculation works well, then everything will be fine. In terms of knowledge and skills, of course local knowledge is required. You need to be able to use -nettle- and maps so that you can orient yourself to the locality: what is the distance to the landing or the road so that you can calculate correctly. Because when you make a launch, so that you can count in your head how far to the target, so that when you -lead-, you better understand where you will hit.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/pro-perevagu-stugny-pered-kornetom-ta-mriyu-vlupyty-v-putina-molodshyj-serzhant-rozpoviv-yak-nyshhyt-vorozhi-tanky-z-ptrk/	2025-01-23T21:05:07-08:00
Reach sky-high speed: The Pentagon conducted a key test of a hypersonic missile demonstrator	As DF-17, which are capable of carrying both nuclear and conventional payloads. The Chinese military is also investing in advanced launch platforms and testing mechanisms, focusing on increasing the speed and range of its hypersonic systems. Russia under Putin has been aggressively developing hypersonic weapons as part of its military modernization program. The country has already deployed hypersonic missiles such as the Avangard, which, as reported Reuters, apparently capable of speeds up to Mach 27. In addition, Russia has developed the Zircon missile, a sea-based hypersonic weapon designed to target both sea and land targets. Both China and the Russian Federation have demonstrated their capabilities through successful test flights, causing, according to Dutch experts, a sense of urgency in the US military to advance its own hypersonic development programs. In addition to China and Russia, countries such as India, France and Australia are also developing hypersonic technologies, each working to integrate these systems into their defense strategies. For the US military and its allies, hypersonic weapons represent a paradigm shift in the way war is waged. The strategic advantages they offer are obvious. Hypersonic weapons allow for near-instantaneous strikes, significantly reducing response times to new threats and providing a new tool for rapid deployment of military power. It can also penetrate traditional anti-missile defense systems. Systems such as those developed by the US Aegis or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), about which our editors previously told, optimized to intercept slower ballistic missiles. But hypersonic weapons, because of their high speed and unpredictable flight paths, present a much more difficult challenge for these systems to defend against. In addition, hypersonic systems can be adapted to various platforms, from land-based launchers to submarines and aircraft, allowing military forces to deploy these weapons in various operational scenarios. Given their speed and range, hypersonic weapons can be used in a variety of theaters of operations, from deterring regional conflicts to countering more complex threats from adversaries with advanced air defense systems. Thus, the US military is focused on hypersonics not only to keep up with China and Russia, but also to maintain a technological edge that will be crucial in future conflicts. The MACH-TB test is one of the most important steps in this ongoing race to develop and deploy hypersonic weapons, which will become a staple of the US military arsenal in the coming years. The success of the MACH-TB flight test is a major achievement in the Pentagon's efforts to accelerate the development of hypersonic technologies. By using commercial launch services, the US Department of Defense is laying the groundwork for more frequent and cost-effective testing, which will ultimately lead to faster deployment of these advanced weapons. With global competitors such as China and the Russian Federation ramping up their own hypersonic development programs, the need for US leadership in this field has never been greater. Hypersonic weapons are poised to revolutionize military strategies around the world, and initiatives like MACH-TB are critical to ensuring that the United States remains at the forefront of this technological revolution.

Without - schematics - and with equal conditions for manufacturers: how the new material quality con...	How was it possible to restore laboratory control during the acceptance of tangible property and eliminate corruption risks in the supply system? What results did the reform of the property acceptance algorithm bring, and how did it affect Ukrainian manufacturers? Colonel Ihor Leshchenko, head of the Central Department of Quality Control of Material Support of the Armed Forces, told about this in an interview with an ArmyInform correspondent. —What key changes took place in the system of receiving tangible property, and what did this process look like before the reforms? — As a result of a detailed analysis, it became clear that the old system did not meet modern requirements, especially in wartime conditions. Previously, the processes were mostly formal: manufacturers brought samples of goods from large batches, and only they were inspected. However, the real assessment of the quality of materials and raw materials was often ignored because the necessary laboratory examination was not carried out. This made it possible to supply products that outwardly met the standards, but were made of low-quality materials. Such an approach was unacceptable, because we are talking about the provision of our military. Thanks to the comprehensive approach of the team under the leadership of Deputy Minister of Defense Dmytro Klimenkov, it was possible to reform this process. — One of the first changes was the introduction of mandatory laboratory tests, which allow checking not only the appearance of the product, but also the quality of the materials, their resistance to wear, water resistance and other important parameters. However, after that, we encountered a new problem: some manufacturers, having received a contract for large batches of goods, divided them into several smaller ones, successfully passed laboratory tests on the first samples, and the rest of the products were made from inferior materials. This became possible due to the existence of a procedure, according to which, after signing the act of acceptance of the goods, the suppliers independently delivered the goods to the warehouses of the Armed Forces. — To remedy the situation, we decided to transfer the process of accepting tangible property directly to the Armed Forces supply bases. Now all batches of goods are checked immediately on the spot, and those that do not meet the standards are returned to the manufacturer for revision. This approach allows you to reduce the risks of product substitution and to ensure the high quality of materials supplied to the military. —What results have been achieved thanks to the recent changes in the system of acceptance of tangible property, and have these changes affected the work of Ukrainian manufacturing enterprises? — To evaluate the results, it is worth referring to specific figures. Initially, in 2023, the share of property returned due to non-compliance with standards was only 6%, which was due to the low quality of the inspection. However, after we improved the reception system and strengthened control, this share increased significantly to 30-35%. This was because we were able to identify a number of manufacturers whose products did not meet the requirements. — However, over time, it was possible to significantly reduce this indicator to 10%, which is a good trend and indicates positive changes. Such a result proves that the market has adapted to the new standards, and the quality of supply has improved significantly. In addition, an important achievement is the absence of media information incidents or complaints about the poor quality of goods that we received during 2024. This indicates that the control system works effectively and ensures a high level of product compliance with all requirements, which is a key factor for the safety of our military. — As for the impact on the work of Ukrainian manufacturing enterprises, a high level of control stimulates them to improve. Manufacturers who discover defects in their products have the opportunity to correct them and resubmit the product for inspection. This contributes to the improvement of quality and the improvement of production technologies. National companies that are able to quickly respond to such requirements have a competitive advantage over foreign suppliers who, due to logistical constraints, cannot resolve problems as quickly. This makes Ukrainian manufacturers more competitive. —How do you react to attempts at pressure or manipulation by unscrupulous manufacturers? Have you faced biased accusations from companies whose products did not meet the standards in the largest volumes? - Unfortunately, yes. Unprecedented pressure began as soon as we implemented changes to the system of receiving tangible property. Some manufacturers immediately began to accuse us of biased assessment of the quality of their products. There were even funny cases when, during briefings where we discussed problematic issues, company representatives brought samples of their products, trying to visually demonstrate their -compliance- with the standards, in order to cast doubt on the results of our inspections. — In response to such attempts, we implemented a video recording system of quality violations during property reception. Now, when we find products that do not meet the requirements, all defects are recorded and the information is immediately sent to the company management. During the first months of operation of this system, we have collected a large amount of video material, and we plan to make it available to the public after the end of martial law. This is currently not possible for security reasons. — At the beginning, many perceived increased control as an attempt to discredit certain companies or to establish a monopoly on the market. However, over time, even the fiercest critics began to support our initiative. The new system not only made it possible to exclude -schematists-, but also created a level playing field for honest manufacturers, giving them a competitive advantage. As a result, we have achieved significant improvements in product quality and support for our military. - What steps do you plan to further improve the supply system, and are there any plans to extend new approaches to other types of logistics? - Our main task is to maintain high quality standards and constantly improve the supply system. We have already started work on improving the verification procedures not only for tangible property, but also for other categories such as food, fuel and other logistics. Our efforts are aimed at providing the Ukrainian military with high-quality and reliable equipment, as well as food that meets the most modern standards. — Now we are actively studying existing problems in these systems and are starting to create effective algorithms to improve quality in these areas. Our main priority is to adapt new approaches to all categories of provision, so that not only tangible property, but also other resources critical to our army meet the highest quality and safety requirements.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/bez-shematoznykiv-ta-z-rivnymy-umovamy-dlya-vyrobnykiv-yak-praczyuye-nova-systema-kontrolyu-yakosti-rechovogo-majna-u-zsu/	2025-01-23T20:28:35-08:00
US sanctions against the Zaporizhzhia NPP: Kremlin-style absurdity	According to the information disseminated by the Russian media (and it is more like an old anecdote than news), the United States of America for some reason decided to impose sanctions on the Ukrainian nuclear plant, which, moreover, is under Russian occupation. It seems that inventing such stories has already become a hobby in the Kremlin. If earlier they stated that Ukraine, apparently, has no right to its independence, now they invented another incredible theory: the USA, they say, imposed sanctions on the Zaporizhia NPP, which&#8230; suppose, for some reason, it became a target for America, not even taking into account the fact that Russian troops are now stationed on the territory where it is located. Of course, the Kremlin cannot forget its mission in the world of disinformation, and this is its favorite tactic: the more fiction, the harder it is to find out where the truth lies. But let's not forget a few obvious facts. First, the USA has long publicly declared its support for Ukraine, in particular, in the matter of energy security. The Zaporizhia NPP is an important facility for the entire energy infrastructure of Ukraine, and imposing sanctions on such an institution, which is an important part of the infrastructure of another country, looks not only illogical, but also frankly absurd. Secondly, if we have already talked about sanctions, we cannot fail to mention who exactly is under sanctions: not Ukraine, not Zaporizhia NPP, but Russia itself. And it is she who is to blame for the fact that the Zaporizhia NPP is under occupation. It is Russia that seized the station and its troops that forced local workers to act on the instructions of others. But the Kremlin does not seem to understand this absurdity and continues to invent new fairy tales. Perhaps the next fake will be the claim that the USA has imposed sanctions against Crimean donuts, but in fact it is just part of the American plan to support the Ukrainian pie. This fake news about sanctions is not only another confirmation that Russian propaganda knows no bounds, but also a reminder of how easily facts can be manipulated when reality becomes too difficult to grasp. But the truth will still win, and even the Kremlin understands this. Isn't that right?	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/sankcziyi-ssha-proty-zaporizkoyi-aes-absurd-u-styli-kremlya/	2025-01-23T20:13:05-08:00
The deputy from Transcarpathia, who led the evaders across the border, went to trial	reported this on January 23 by the special prosecutor's office of the Western region. The investigation established that four residents of Transcarpathia, including a deputy of the district council, provided conscripts who wanted to avoid mobilization to cross the border through the so-called -green corridor-. They were gathered in a designated place and settled near the border. Then people who were oriented on the terrain led them through the forest past checkpoints. From there, the men walked to Romania. The cost of such a service was $8,000 from one -client-. During the searches, over $16,000 dollars, 500 euros and 30,000 hryvnias in cash, GPS devices and other physical evidence were seized from the accused. The men were detained and preventive measures were taken. The smugglers face up to 9 years in prison.

The footage shows the complicated process of evacuating a wounded soldier. Doctors act quickly, coherently and professionally, demonstrating a high level of training and dedication to their work. The evacuation process consists of two main stages: casevac - urgent evacuation from the line of fire, and medevac - transportation of the wounded in a medical vehicle to a stabilization point. From the conversations of medics on the video of the evacuation process, it becomes clear that they are primarily concerned with the safety and comfort of the wounded. While moving the fighter, medics give clear commands: -Brother, take me by the neck. Nephew, now move a little. Come on, yourself,- while cheering him on, -That’s it, well done.- Doctors constantly monitor the condition of the injured, discussing the nature of injuries and vital signs, as well as discussing the localization of injuries. Their actions are clear and coordinated, everyone knows their role and performs it flawlessly. Psychological support of the wounded is also an important component of the work of military medics. They encourage the fighters, find time for jokes and kind words, which helps relieve tension and maintain morale. The work of the Algiz evacuation team is a daily act of heroism that deserves the highest respect.

Therefore, our gunners are working, covering the infantry, trying to prevent the enemy from getting closer. But the situation is getting worse every day,- said Ivan Sekach. When asked about the situation in Velika Novosilka, he answered: -The fighting continues in the city, our guys are holding their positions, fighting like lions.- The brigade is collecting for an excavator, which will help make hiding places for American self-propelled guns. As reported by ArmyInform, the operators of the unmanned systems battalion of the 110th mechanized brigade named after Colonel-General Mark Bezruchka we hit two Russian BMPs that tried to go to our positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/pid-velykoyu-novosilkoyu-nashi-artylerysty-zmusheni-perejty-na-czilodobovu-robotu/	2025-01-23T11:27:24-08:00
The first graduates of the anti-drone course are already working with shotguns at the front	On January 23 ArmiyaTV, the head of the media group of the 413th battalion, Sergeant Oleksiy Godzenko, told about this. -We launched a course against FPV drones (both radio-controlled and fiber-optic) with the use of a shotgun. Because in many videos you can see how in the last seconds of their lives, katsaps try to shoot down our drones with a machine gun. However, it is very difficult to hit a small and very fast target even with a fast rate of fire. But a shotgun that shoots across the square is now almost the only way to fight fiber-optic drones and ordinary ones,- Oleksiy Godzenko said. In the video, which was provided by the battalion, it can be seen that the courses teach how to hit drones, both on the ground and from the body of a pickup truck while driving at speed. According to Oleksiy Godzenko, the first graduates of the course are already working at the front and have good results. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 413th battalion of unmanned systems -Raid- of the SBS of the Armed Forces of Ukraine showed frames of damage by missiles of the command post of the Russians in the eastern in the vicinity of the village of Maryine in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/pershi-vypusknyky-antydronovogo-kursu-vzhe-praczyuyut-z-drobovykamy-na-fronti/	2025-01-23T11:18:51-08:00
All are destroyers: the Russians launch their soldiers in one direction towards our positions	The video was released on January 23 on the battalion channel. Our FPV drone, which flew to meet the suicide bombers, managed to record that the occupier was running to attack with a mine in his right hand. -The new tactic of the occupiers is a Russian kamikaze! That kamikaze takes an anti-tank mine and tries to come close to our position to blow it up, because there is no other way to take our position! So, a kamikaze caught a kamikaze,- the battalion commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the 4th mechanized battalion of the Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi recorded the attack attack aircraft on your drone.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/vsi-minonosczi-rosiyany-zapuskayut-svoyih-soldativ-v-odyn-kinecz-do-nashyh-pozyczij/	2025-01-23T11:13:53-08:00
He got there and burned down - hunters repelled the assault of a defiant enemy armored personnel car...	The video of the fight was released on January 23 on the brigade's channel. The enemy armored personnel carrier with the landing party inside and on the armor moved at high speed towards our positions. Artillery and drones began to work on it, which little by little removed the armor of the enemy landing party. But only our mine could stop the Russian armored car. When the armored personnel carrier caught fire, Russian attack aircraft began to climb out of it, but our FPV drones were already waiting for them. As reported by ArmyInform, the fighters of the 68th hunting brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush removed the work of one of the shifts on the -holidays- of the brigade, the center for making the most important decisions, where the management of the battlefield on the approaches to Pokrovsk takes place.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/doyihav-i-zgoriv-yegeri-vidbyly-shturm-zuhvalogo-vorozhogo-btra/	2025-01-23T10:57:14-08:00
Dangerous flights -Movie-: journeys through fire and fear	The story of the fighter was published on the page of the 58th separate motorized infantry brigade named after the Hetman. Ivan Vyhovskyi. Before the full-scale invasion, Anton from Kyiv worked as a truck driver, but since 2022, his profession has taken on a completely different, deadly meaning. Moving from a MAN truck to a regular civilian pickup, Anton performs vital tasks on the front lines: delivering and picking up infantry, delivering ammunition, food, water and fuel for generators. All this without any reservations, under constant threat from the sky. According to Kino, the biggest danger to him and his machines is FPV drones, which are now literally saturated in the sky above the front line. When asked about -driving hacks- to protect against drones, Anton frankly answers: the only way is speed. But it is not always a panacea either, because there are very few places on the front line where you can safely accelerate. -Recently, in just one week, we 'caught' two drones,- recalls Anton. — It's good that the REBka worked, and the -birds- got close to the car. The wheels were cut a little, but the people are all alive and well.- The fighter adds that the means of electronic warfare are not always effective, so to minimize risks, drivers try to drive in the -darkness- - at dusk, when it is not yet completely dark or just beginning to dawn. Unlike many drivers, Anton does not have any omens, superstitions or rituals. Before each trip, he only prays and begins to perform tasks that bring our victory closer. As reported by ArmyInform, a fighter of the -Hart- brigade Vasyl Ilyus with the call sign -Faithful- -prykordonnyka-vasylya-virnogo/->received five bullet wounds during fierce battles for Bachmut. One of the bullets remained in his body forever.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/nebezpechni-rejsy-kino-poyizdky-kriz-vogon-ta-strah/	2025-01-23T10:42:41-08:00

Ukraine insists on increasing international pressure on Russia to end the war	The head of state told about this in an evening address to the citizens of Ukraine. The President stated: -Peace is possible through strength, we are absolutely sure of that. The main thing is not to lose momentum and pressure. To put pressure on Russia, on the only entity that wants this war, that is guilty of this war.- According to him, Russia is deliberately trying to prolong the aggression and occupation, so countering its actions should be coordinated as much as possible. One of the main directions of international efforts is the issue of energy security. The President emphasized that energy resources, particularly oil, remain one of the most important keys to peace. He called on Europe to work more actively with America and other global partners in the energy sphere to reduce dependence on Russia and its influence. -Europe needs to work more with America and other partners in the world, and not with Russia regarding energy resources,- the head of state said. The President expressed deep gratitude to all those who are fighting for the independence of Ukraine, in particular in the hottest spots - in Donetsk region, Kharkiv region, South and Kursk region.

In Odesa, racketeers beat out a military serviceman for his father's funeral	reported this on January 23 Odesa Regional Prosecutor's Office. According to the investigation, the direct leadership of the group was carried out by a resident of Podilsk, who has been repeatedly convicted of self-interested crimes and is in the pre-trial detention center in the status of a -watcher-. The members of the group specialized in -knocking out- non-existent debts. If they did not agree to give the money, they persecuted the victims, resorted to beatings and psychological pressure. They also threatened physical violence. It is documented that the suspects demanded a -debt- from a soldier of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from Podilsk. After learning that he had received a large amount of financial aid from the state for his father's death during a combat mission in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the perpetrators began to call and demand a non-existent debt. Fearing for his life and health, the victim paid them 70,000. UAH But this was not enough for the attackers, they wanted another 850 US dollars, which he allegedly owed them. When the money was not received, their accomplice, who was at large, organized a meeting with the victim and, using physical force and psychological pressure, forcibly took 5,000 hryvnias. The perpetrators were unable to complete their criminal plan because they were exposed by law enforcement officers. The suspects are currently in custody. The involvement of the members of the criminal group in the commission of other similar crimes on the territory of Odesa is also being checked.

-It's scary, but it's necessary-: how the crew of the 2C1 self-propelled guns works on the front lin...	The video with the story of the gunners was published on the brigade's official page. -The composition of the crew of the 2C1 self-propelled guns has practically not changed since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. And the one who joined the team adapts quite quickly. The main secret is mutual support and humor,- the message says. One of the soldiers responsible for the technical condition of the car talks about his duties: -My task is to maintain, to see that everything is clear, so that the car does not fail. Oil check, filter replacement, engine, gearbox, levels. Check to see if there are any trains, nothing. Look at the air system. And the goose must be pulled out there. One pull to tighten, and she was more stretched, and so that, suddenly, she did not swell. He adds that the Gvozdyka engine is reliable and easy to maintain: -The Yandzor engine is good. There is nothing complicated.- The biggest test, according to the fighter, is entering the positions under fire: -Entering under fire is the most difficult. Very scary. Well, I have to.- Before the war, he worked as a miner and an electrical fitter, and in 2019 he signed a contract and entered the service of this self-propelled gun. Another gunner, mobilized in the summer, talks about the PG-2 sighting device, designed to point the gun at the target: -I think that anyone with hands and a head can do this job.- It also demonstrates the process of loading the cannon and sending the gunpowder. The third crew member acts as a signalman and is responsible for orienting the firing machine using a compass. Fighters emphasize the importance of mutual assistance and cohesion in the crew. -If the machine broke down or there were any problems in the machine, we all tried to solve this problem. The sooner the better. Our guys are very kind and everyone can help. If something is not clear, they will tell you right away. Everyone stands for each other, as without this,- they say. Despite fatigue and difficult conditions, the gunners maintain optimism and faith in victory. -There are moments when morally, honestly, it is difficult. We are motivated by the fact that your family is here. We just do our job and hope it benefits our state and we win. Either you are wanted and in hiding, or you come and work together with everyone, protecting, fighting for your country,- the fighters conclude. As reported by ArmyInform, Roman is a junior sergeant of the 45th separate artillery brigade named after General Myron Tarnavskyi, who, despite the risks to his life, delivers ammunition on firing positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/strashno-ale-treba-yak-praczyuye-ekipazh-sau-2s1-na-peredovij-rozpovid-garmashiv-92-yi-brygady/	2025-01-23T08:41:48-08:00

The Armed Forces refuted the fake story about the so-called million-dollar bonuses of commanders	They published a corresponding statement on their channel. -Some media, referring to the post of People's Deputy Marjana Bezuglai, spread a fake about the so-called -million dollar prizes-. The statements made public by the deputy do not correspond to reality and only help the enemy to bring discord and mistrust into Ukrainian society,- the message reads. The StratCom of the Armed Forces drew the attention of the media that the military command is ready to provide the necessary clarifications for the dissemination of true information. -Yes, Article 15 of Chapter II of the Law of Ukraine -On the Disciplinary Statute of the Armed Forces of Ukraine- provides for an exhaustive list of incentives that apply to military personnel. Among them, in particular, there are also cash prizes - in addition to valuable gifts, badges and awards, diplomas, thanks, etc., -said the StratCom of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is noted that in order to provide such bonuses and valuable gifts, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine issues a separate mandate every year within the limits of the amounts provided for by the Law -On the State Budget of Ukraine-. Therefore, the commanders and leaders of the Armed Forces, their types and separate branches of troops (forces) receive an annual bonus fund to encourage personnel with monetary bonuses — for additional motivation of the best servicemen, within the limits of the implementation of the laws on the State Budget and the Disciplinary Statute of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Yes, the discretionary fund of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2024 amounted to UAH 19 million. Incentive bonuses were paid to 426 servicemen of all categories (soldiers, sergeants, officers),- the Armed Forces StratCom reported. The Main Directorate of Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine added that the incentive fund of the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine last year amounted to UAH 1.8 million, but in general, a much smaller amount was used to reward 22 servicemen. Personnel and other leaders of the Defense Forces of Ukraine were rewarded within the framework of the specified funds. -Without the material incentives of a serviceman, both a common soldier and an officer, no combat-ready army can function. And even more so is the country's army, which is repelling a full-scale invasion. Please be guided by verified information and do not spread fakes that discredit the defenders of Ukraine and fuel enemy propaganda,- the Armed Forces StratCom stressed. As reported by ArmyInform, the Commander of the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Vice Admiral Oleksiy Neizhpapa, told about mechanisms of encouraging servicemen using the annual bonus fund.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/u-zsu-sprostuvaly-fejk-pro-tak-zvani-miljonni-premiyi-komanduvachiv/	2025-01-23T08:01:50-08:00

The MOU explained the rules for granting deferment for students and teachers	About this informsthe Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The granting of a deferment to those obtaining professional, professional pre-university and higher education, interns and doctoral students, as well as to teachers is regulated by the Law of Ukraine -On Mobilization Training and Mobilization- and the Procedure for Awarding Citizens for Military Service During Mobilization, for a Special Period, Approved by Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine from May 16, 2024 No. 560 (hereinafter referred to as the Order). It is noted that the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine from December 31, 2024 No. 1558 introduced important changes to the Order. Now the rules for granting deferment for education seekers and teaching staff are clearly defined. In particular, students of professional and technical, professional pre-university and higher education institutions, interns and doctoral students will receive a postponement for the whole semester, but not more than six months (September-February and March-August). Scientific and pedagogical workers who have a scientific degree, as well as pedagogical workers of various educational institutions, will have a deferment until the end of the academic year (if they are in a permanent job - lasting 12 months a year). -The principle innovation is that now education seekers do not need to confirm their status every three months in the territorial recruitment and social support centers (TCC and SP). Previously, this was exactly the requirement of the legislation during the legal regime of martial law and general mobilization,- the MOU said. Information about students is contained in the Unified State Electronic Database of Education (SEDEB). As long as the register states that a citizen is getting an education, he is guaranteed the right to a deferral. Currently, students can apply for a deferment in connection with their studies in the Reserve+ application. -Thanks to the constant exchange of data between the EDEBO and the registers of the Ministry of Defense, the extension of the postponement takes place online. This means that an education seeker does not need to apply to the TCC and SP every six months (previously every three months), the message says. A separate procedure is provided for students who do not have the opportunity or desire to use Reserve+. They have to get an extract from the EDEBO once every six months at their educational institution and apply to the TCC and SP for an extension of the deferral. The Ministry of Education and Culture noted that the conditions for receiving a deferment for teachers have not changed. They must be employed at a rate not lower than 0.75, which is confirmed by the educational plans for the academic year, which lasts from September 1 to August 31 (including vacations and holidays), unless otherwise established by the Regulations on the organization of the educational process of the relevant institution. The Ministry of Defense is currently working on the integration of registers with the Ministry of Education and Culture for the automatic exchange of information and the granting of deferrals to scientific, scientific-pedagogical and teaching staff. This will greatly simplify the procedure and reduce paper bureaucracy. -Fundamentally important: vacations and the end of the academic year are not grounds for losing the right to postponement. Changes to the resolution are aimed at simplifying the procedure and reducing the burden on TCC and joint venture employees, who previously had to process a huge number of documents every three months,- the MOU assured. The Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Education and Science urged to trust only official sources. -Vacations and the end of the school year are not grounds for losing the right to postponement,- the MOU summarized.

The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces explained the issue of redeployment of troops and plannin...	This was told by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi in an interview project BAZA on Radio Bayraktar. -If you read in the news that someone has been removed from somewhere and moved, it does not mean that there is some betrayal or something else. This means, more than anything, that there is a certain plan, and it will work if someone was transferred somewhere just for this,- the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces emphasized. He emphasized that the success of operations often depends on surprise for the enemy. Disclosing information about troop movements can harm mission performance and lead to casualties. -Of course, unsuccessful actions when both the enemy and society know. If everyone knows, they will take adequate and appropriate measures. When it happens quietly or people do not know the intentions, why it is being done, then there is success,- explained Oleksandr Syrskyi. The Commander-in-Chief also addressed the citizens, urging them to trust the military leadership. -Most people understand that if something is done by command, it is done for a purpose, not just like that. Some really start to raise and disperse panic, completely not understanding why this is being done,- the Commander-in-Chief noted. Oleksandr Syrskyi emphasized that information from the Ukrainian mass media is monitored not only by Ukrainian, but also by enemy experts who use it to make decisions. Dissemination of such information can cause significant damage and lead to loss of personnel. -Each of our soldiers is worth their weight in gold, I will repeat this many times,- the Commander-in-Chief emphasized. Regarding the planning of operations, Oleksandr Syrsky said that this process is continuous and takes place around the clock. Decisions are made based on the analysis of information coming from various sources. -The decision is made on the basis of the analysis of this information. This process is continuous, it is constant, it is carried out around the clock, day and night. This is the work of all management bodies, that they must adequately respond to all changes in the situation, take into account and constantly monitor the state and level of combat readiness of their troops and the enemy's troops, monitor all the actions of the enemy, the state of his reserves and everything that happens to him in the rear,- he explained. As reported by ArmyInform, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrskyi v-155-brygadi/->visited command posts in the Pokrovsky direction, where the enemy concentrates the main efforts and conducts active offensive actions, and listened to the brigade commanders regarding the specifics of combat operations, problematic issues and took all measures to solve them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/golovnokomanduvach-zsu-rozyasnyv-pytannya-peredyslokacziyi-vijsk-ta-planuvannya-operaczij/	2025-01-23T06:52:23-08:00
-Service in the rear is not for me-: a 56-year-old fighter -Rubezhu- with the call sign -Batya- has ...	The story of the fighter was published on the page of the 4th brigade of operational assignment -Rubizh-. -It was easier then. Walked around positions without armor. Now the war has become different,- -Batya- recalls. After 2017, the fighter took a break, but with the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Russia in 2022, he did not hesitate to return to the army. At first, he got to the rear, but later transferred to the -Rubizh- brigade, because, according to him, -sitting and guarding- was not to his liking. Now, despite his age, -Batya- repels enemy attacks on par with his younger brothers. He recalls a heavy assault that took place before the New Year. Then the enemy attacked in small groups, trying to break through the Ukrainian positions. However, thanks to the coordinated work of the Ukrainian defenders, the enemy did not succeed - 36 invaders remained on the battlefield. -There is no fear. Not only our battalion worked, we were also helped by drops from drones, but the main thing is coordinated work,- says the fighter. The actions of the Russian occupiers during the so-called -meat assaults- surprise even such an experienced warrior as -Batya-: -They are either crazy or -stuffed- with some substances. They reach our ego, someone specially lies on it so that others will step on it. But this tactic is not stupid - it's just that they fight with drones, and people are worthless to them.- -Batya- frankly admits that during enemy attacks everyone, even the most experienced soldiers, feels fear. However, the most important thing in such a situation is to support and encourage your brothers in time. -We pretend that we ourselves are not afraid, we joke. Somehow there were gas dumps - we put on gas masks, took out our phones and started playing games. Those who were afraid saw this and also calmed down,- he shares. After the end of the war, -Father- dreams of a quiet life in retirement. -Rather, peace would come so that the children would not see this,- he says, adding that he is ready to defend his native land as long as he has enough strength.

-I am their eyes-: aerial scout -Samsung- about escorting infantry and evacuating the wounded under ...	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the 141st separate mechanized brigade. According to Samsung, its main task is to constantly conduct reconnaissance and monitor the enemy. -My job consists in constant reconnaissance, monitoring the enemy, his possible movement, assault attempts, infiltration to our positions,- the aerial scout shares. The enemy often fires at the positions of Ukrainian drones, they are one of the priorities for him. -If they know approximately where our positions are, they use everything to destroy them. From the beginning to the end, the landing is constantly fired at by artillery and mortars,- says Samsung. In addition, the occupiers actively use drones of various types, trying to detect his positions. -Often the enemy searches for us, enemy drones, enemy FPVs, wings, kamikazes fly in. We constantly have to leave the shelter, the dugout, to take the drone out, pick it up, and so on,- he adds. One of the episodes shared by Samsung demonstrates the effectiveness of using drones to destroy enemy manpower. Having discovered an enemy soldier without weapons and protection, aerial reconnaissance began surveillance. After the occupant tried to hide under the downed equipment, he was struck by an FPV drone. As a result, first three, then six occupants who tried to escape ran out of the shelter. -There was no longer even a queue, as it works here. Just all there, a series of fpvshocks, resets and so on. In total, we disassembled nine -catsaps-, which simply ran in a crowd in a friendly manner along the landing,- recalls -Samsung-. An important aspect of Samsung's work is the support and security of Ukrainian infantry during night operations. -Because all the movement takes place more often at night, for greater security. Well, they walk almost blindly, they don't see anything, and I am their eyes, I show them the way, how it is safer for them to enter, when it is better for them to hide,- he explains. The aerial scout also helps evacuate wounded soldiers by dropping water and medical supplies on them. Training on how to control Samsung drones was completed quite quickly - in two weeks. However, he acquired the main skills directly during combat missions. Now, in winter, when daylight hours are short, the work of an aerial scout becomes even more intense, because he has to work mainly at night, resting only for a few hours. As reported by ArmyInform, 38-year-old Bogdan, call sign -Voron-, platoon commander of the mortar battery of the 128th separate mountain assault brigade, has combat experience actions since 2014.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/ya-yihni-ochi-aerorozvidnyk-samsung-pro-suprovid-pihoty-ta-evakuacziyu-poranenyh-pid-pokrovom-nochi/	2025-01-23T05:27:20-08:00

About this on Thursday, January 23, notified the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umerov. -Today, conscripts are forced to receive paper referrals at the TCC, wasting time in queues. Thanks to the reform, this process will become much simpler and more convenient,- he wrote on Facebook. According to the head of the Ministry of Defense, this will be -the first step towards digitalization of the VLK.- How the new service works: -First of all, referrals will be able to be generated by citizens who wish to pass the VLK themselves. But later this opportunity will appear for people who have received a paper summons to pass the VLK. The goal of beta testing is to check the operation of the new service together with Rezerv+ users and to improve it until the moment of its full launch,- said Rustem Umyerov. He also noted that the next step will be the integration of the information systems of the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Health. -As early as the fall of 2025, it will be possible to independently choose a medical institution that has a contract with the National Health Service in Rezer+ to undergo a suitability review. Digitization is a transparent, fair and convenient system that simplifies the lives of our citizens. We are changing the approach to the work of the VLK step by step, creating comfortable conditions for all Ukrainians,- the minister added.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/pershyj-krok-do-czyfrovizacziyi-vlk-rustem-umyerov-rozpoviv-pro-testuvannya-novogo-servisu-u-zastosunku-rezerv/	2025-01-23T05:15:24-08:00
The Defense Forces announced a hostile information operation surrounding the battles for Velika Novo...	The statement of OSUV -Khortytsia- about this was made public in the afternoon of January 23. -The information is provided objectively, taking into account that the enemy also carefully studies the messages of the Defense Forces - knowledge from open sources helps the enemy to plan and adjust his further offensive actions. The defense forces of Ukraine are fighting grueling battles with the superior enemy at the respective positions and lines. The actions of the soldiers are aimed at inflicting maximum losses on the enemy, preventing defense breakthroughs and encirclements. The command is taking measures to strengthen the units, provide them with the necessary means for fighting, and strengthen and secure the flanks. Measures are also planned for actions in the event of an aggravation of the tactical situation and possible options for its development. The conduct of hostilities is accompanied by information operations. Against the background of heavy battles, losses in personnel, and the frantic dynamics of the war, the enemy is intensifying its psychological influence both directly on the personnel in front-line positions and on Ukrainian society as a whole. The main goal of Russian propagandists is to shake public sentiment, disorient and undermine confidence in the military leadership and the Defense Forces. As a result, the stability of Ukraine's defenders is reduced and their offensive operations are facilitated. The enemy uses information as a weapon, skillfully hiding behind the sources of its supply. Soldiers of the Defense Forces of Ukraine are fighting hard and defending every position. Please observe information hygiene, carefully assess the situation and continue to support your Armed Forces. The life of the state rests on them,- said the report of the Khortytsya State Security Service. As reported by ArmyInform, the Defense Forces commented on the situation around Velika Novosilka. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/v-sylah-oborony-zayavyly-pro-vorozhu-informaczijnu-operacziyu-navkolo-boyiv-za-velyku-novosilku/	2025-01-23T05:03:28-08:00

It was established that at the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the suspect, who was working at the time in the Black Sea Biosphere Reserve, using his knowledge and expertise, helped the invaders navigate the area. In addition, he provided them with information about the state of water bodies, the depth of the coastal zone and possible places for launching ships. -The figurehead collected and transferred data about his colleagues to the enemy and reported their readiness to cooperate with the occupation authorities. For loyalty and assistance to the invaders, the man expected to receive a position from them. However, when he realized that his hopes would not come true, he left for the territory controlled by Ukraine,- said the SBI. A collaborator was detained in Khmelnytskyi. Criminal proceedings have been initiated against him under Part 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.

In Odesa, they wanted to spend millions on the development of Zmiiny Island	reported this on January 23 Odesa Regional Prosecutor's Office. Due to the intervention of the prosecutors of the Kyiv District Prosecutor's Office of Odesa, contracts for the purchase of works, the value of which exceeded 69 million hryvnias, were terminated. This decision was the result of an inspection that revealed the inconsistency of the signed contracts with modern realities. It has been established that in 2020-2021, the Public Enterprise -Maritime Search and Rescue Service- held open tenders, as a result of which it signed contracts with contractors for the construction of the Zmiiny base station on the island of the same name. The project provided for the creation of a facility to ensure the safety of navigation and communications during emergency situations. Financing was to be carried out from the state budget through the Ministry of Development of Communities, Territories and Infrastructure of Ukraine. However, since the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, Zmiiny Island has been included in the list of territories of active hostilities. This made it impossible to carry out the planned works. Despite this, the customer extended the term of the contract to 2023 and 2024, which created a risk of unjustified spending of state funds. Therefore, in view of the damages caused as a result of the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, it is unreasonable to spend funds on goals that do not correspond to state interests. State funds should primarily be directed to the financing of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, the reconstruction of destroyed infrastructure facilities, the support of temporarily displaced persons, etc. In connection with the above, prosecutors, pursuant to Art. 23 of the Law of Ukraine -On the Prosecutor's Office-, the supervisory authorities informed about the detected violations and noted that if they are not eliminated on their own, the prosecutor's office will file a lawsuit in the interests of the state to terminate contracts for the purchase of works. Due to the reaction of the prosecutor's office, the parties eliminated the violation by terminating the above-mentioned contracts. As reported by ArmyInform, a man was found in Odesa who > traded -armor- for conscripts.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/na-odeshhyni-hotily-pylyaty-miljony-na-zabudovi-ostrova-zmiyinyj/	2025-01-23T04:47:10-08:00

Generals of the Russian Federation, involved in the attack on Sumy Oblast with a super-heavy bomb in...	This is reported by the SBU on January 23. The evidence base has been collected on the war criminals of the Russian Federation, who in May 2022 gave the order to strike the civilian infrastructure of the Sumy region with a guided aerial bomb of the UPAB-1500B type. This was the first time when the Rashists used such a powerful munition to fire at peaceful objects in the Sumy region. Then this super-heavy bomb hit the agricultural complex on the territory of the Putivl community, destroyed several buildings of the local agricultural company and damaged the buildings of two colleges. According to the SBU investigation, the initiator of this bombing was the commander of the Western Military District of the Russian Federation, Colonel-General Oleksandr Zhuravlev. It was he and his first deputy, Lieutenant General Oleksiy Zavizyon, who planned the air attack on the local agricultural enterprise. Subsequently, the commander of the Russian Air Force, Lieutenant General Serhii Dronov, received a request to carry out an air strike from Zhuravlev and gave his consent. Then, on his order, the occupiers launched a Su-34 bomber from the airfield in Akhtubinsk and launched an attack on the Ukrainian enterprise. The investigation also established the identities of four more Russian officials who were involved in the preparation and execution of the enemy air attack. All of them are Dronov's subordinates: On the basis of the evidence collected, the investigators of the Security Service informed the seven Rashists in absentia about the suspicion for h. 2 Art. 28, ch. 1 Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (violation of the laws and customs of war, committed by a group of persons following a prior conspiracy). Comprehensive measures are underway to punish the guilty. The investigation was conducted by SBU employees in Sumy region under the procedural guidance of the regional prosecutor's office. As reported by ArmyInform, law enforcement officers detained in Zhytomyr suspects of cooperation with Russian special services, what were preparing a terrorist attack against employees of the National Police.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/vykryto-generaliv-rf-prychetnyh-do-udaru-po-sumshhyni-nadvazhkoyu-bomboyu-u-2022-roczi-sbu/	2025-01-23T04:16:01-08:00
They saved money on evacuation — near Chasov Yar, the Russians burned about a hundred of their dead	About this January 23 on the channel -We-Ukraine- the representative reported operational-tactical group -Luhansk- lieutenant colonel Dmytro Zaporozhets. According to him, on January 4-8, the Defense Forces detected the enemy in the area of ​​the -Siverskyi Donets-Donbas- canal.

And on January 21, an incomprehensible situation arose for us, when we saw on the streams that the enemy had organized an arson in the collector, probably with the aim of hiding the traces of the destruction of such a large number of personnel and avoiding evacuation measures. The fire lasted for 5 hours,- said Dmytro Zaporozhets.

When asked about the risk of encirclement of Ukrainian units in Velika Novosilka, Tregubov explained: -At the moment, our troops are not completely encircled, but there is a risk of operational encirclement. We do everything possible to prevent this from happening. The Russians are trying to take the approaches to the village under fire control, which complicates the situation. Special difficulties are created by the geographical location of Velika Novosilka - the river that crosses the village limits maneuvers. However, this has been taken into account and we are developing action plans to address these difficulties.- The spokesman also added that in this direction, as well as in many others, Russian forces have a numerical advantage, particularly in terms of manpower. According to Major Viktor Tregubov, fierce fighting continues in the settlements of Novy Trud and Zelene near Pokrovsk, and at the moment they remain in the so-called -gray zone-. -These villages are small in size and are completely covered with small arms, which complicates the situation. It will be possible to talk about control over them only when one of the parties takes a position there, arranges defensive fortifications and takes control of these positions. So far, this has not happened,- explained the spokesperson of the Khortytsia group. The situation in the area remains dynamic, and Ukrainian forces continue to resist the enemy's attempts to establish full control over this direction of the front.

His house, as well as several neighboring ones next to the breach, has been completely destroyed, it is completely unfit for living or repair. Another 15 or so buildings around are a little more fortunate - they still have roofs to fix and windows to cover. Opposite Boris's house lives an elderly woman named Olga. About three months ago, she left Chasovoy Yar and now it is not the first time she is forced to look for a new shelter - before that she had to move several times. -Lived on the Canal, moved to the Second Workshop. They broke up the Second Shop, then came here, she recalls the local toponyms of Chasovoy Yar. - Three months have passed - and on you. The house was beautiful, warm. And they just received firewood yesterday, they gave us 21,000 for it.- Relatives and neighbors are helping the victims to remove the surviving property from the ruins, trying to find new housing. Olga gratefully remembers the owner of the now-destroyed house in which she lived for three months and is worried about whether she will be able to find a new home. It seems that, thanks to the caring neighbors, she is lucky - the local residents, who have been taking care of the victim since the morning, find a woman who has the ability to let the old woman into an abandoned but habitable house. Electricians and gas workers have been working at the scene since the morning, eliminating the consequences of shelling and repairing power lines. Residents are waiting for help from local authorities and charitable foundations to temporarily repair the relatively unscathed houses and to find housing for those whose homes are beyond repair.

This will be a much higher price than what is currently spent on modernization and increasing defense production,- Mark Rutte said. He added that by the time the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi decides that it is necessary to start negotiations with the Russian Federation, Ukraine should be in the strongest position. -The main issue is for it to be a permanent peace, so that there is no repetition of the situation as with the Minsk agreements, when we thought we had a permanent peace, but in fact Putin continued the seizure of Ukraine in 2022,- Mark Rutte said. The NATO Secretary General emphasized that for sustainable peace it is necessary to ensure that Putin never again occupies a single square meter of Ukrainian territory. -We must strengthen support for Ukraine. We have to change the trajectory of the war. The front line is currently moving in the wrong direction. The focus should be on Ukraine being in the strongest position, especially at the beginning of the negotiations. And when they will be completed, so that the achieved peace will be permanent. Ukraine's full membership in NATO would be the easiest way to ensure peace in the future. But whatever the outcome of the negotiations, Putin should have no say or influence over who joins or doesn't join NATO,- he concluded. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi said that Europe should preserve unity, increase defense spending, ensure energy independence and be able to guarantee security. The President emphasized that Ukraine has created models of defense cooperation that can make the whole of Europe stronger. It is about the joint production of artillery and drones, including unique ones that have no analogues in the world.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/gensek-nato-neobhidno-posylyuvaty-pidtrymku-ukrayiny-ta-zminyty-trayektoriyu-vijny/	2025-01-22T23:19:21-08:00

In Russian they say: You have a couple of dicks over there. What are we? We sit quietly. They are to us: Fuck you, give up. We sit quietly. I see, the distance is far, I can't reach it. Let me come closer. He runs up, clack-clack, everything, nothing. There was no fear. Just on adrenaline. You are 100% sure of yourself. And you know that the brothers have support from the side. If something happens, they will cover it up,- the -Chemist- recalls. According to the volunteer, one of the fiercest battles for him was during which he eliminated five invaders at once. -It happened that they stormed us all day. From 8 in the morning to 9-10 in the evening until it gets dark. We hit once or twice. We put them there - both art and our FPV helped us. And they climb and climb. They run up to SPshka. Five in a row, as they ran in a line, five and everyone got hit. Don't be afraid. The task was set for you - run,- advises the -Chemist-.

A fantastic target for FPV drones, 5 km to the front line and an old GAZ-66: a cog expert that can d...	&#8220;Ukrainians show simply phenomenal success in the part of exterminating Russian vehicles. Compared to January of last year, these indicators have tripled, and even quadrupled. If in January 2024, Russians experienced losses in the automotive industry of about 10-30 units per day, now these indicators reach 100-120. A simple and logical question arises, why did this happen? In fact, this question should be considered in the mandatory reference to their armored vehicles, both tanks and armored fighting vehicles. Because that's the only way it really looks. What is the point of the question? During this war, we destroyed almost 10,000 tanks. Is it a lot? It's unbelievable, fantastic! Nothing like this has happened since the Second World War. I would like to remind you that at the beginning of the war, the Russian Federation's official tank fleet was 3,400 units. So, at this minute, we have destroyed almost two and a half state parks. And armored fighting vehicles of all types, starting from the old BTR-60PB, including the most massive BTR-80, and ending with BMP-1, BMP-2 and a small number of BMP-3 machines - that's almost 20,000. And their full-time fleet was 14,000. One important detail should be considered here. Russia can no longer produce full-fledged, high-quality armored vehicles. First of all, this applies to tanks. If the Soviet Union at the time of its collapse had six large armored tank factories, at the moment the Russian Federation has only one: Uralvagonzavod. And it can produce only one tank - T-90. They say that, they say, we put up to 1,500 tanks in service per month. But there is a nuance. This is not a new technique, it is a restored technique from conservation. Yes, the warehouse is still quite large. At the beginning of the war, it was estimated at up to 20,000 units of various types and types of armored vehicles. And it is no secret that the Russians have begun very serious and scrupulous work on returning their own equipment from Third World countries. Because since the mid-60s of the last century, the Soviet Union exported a huge amount of various equipment to a large number of countries. And because of this, the Russians still have a certain margin of safety. However, again, the same T-90s can produce a maximum of 25 tanks per month. This is the top bar. It's just two mouthpieces. We will remind that a full-time tank company is 10-11 units, no more. This is what their potential looks like. This also applies to their modern armored vehicles. So, in view of this, the Russians are forced to compensate for transporting their personnel by car to the front line. As for the cars themselves: what are the main workhorses and what is their margin of safety? The most popular military vehicles are the KAMAZ 4310, the Ural 4320, and probably their most successful medium-class truck, the GAZ 66, which has already been discontinued. It was discontinued in 1999, and for the entire time it has been produced since the 60s, produced almost a million units. These main corporations — KAMAZ and Ural — can collectively produce, as they themselves declare, up to 55,000 units of a wide variety of equipment of all modifications per year. But there is a nuance. Let's not forget that the Russian industry is a resource industry, and it is also an agricultural industry. Russians are still among the top five producers of agricultural products, primarily legumes, oil, and the like. The economy also needs a huge amount of auto equipment. And in view of the fact that the main two corporations (KAMAZ and Ural - ed.) have come under international sanctions, there are very big problems with the components. Even the Soviet Union could not fully provide all production cycles on its own, especially in the bearing part. Therefore, the Russians will not be able to produce such a large amount of automotive equipment that would be able to cover all the necessary moments for transporting personnel. And not only that. And, let's say, the delivery of standard ammunition to the artillery. And there is one more nuance. Automotive is just a fantastic target for our FPV drones. And in terms of the quality of the use of FPV drones for such purposes, we are now showing perhaps the best indicators not only in terms of our war, but in general, in a global sense. So why are car scrapping rates so high? Because Russia has serious problems with the production of tanks, serious problems with the production of the entire line of armored personnel carriers. And this problem will only increase: about the bearing, I reminded. Not to mention, say, aiming systems. At one time, even before the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the best configuration of the T-72B3 was provided exclusively by French thermal imaging systems. Sanctions are increasing and will continue to increase. This problem will grow and, not surprisingly, it is in automotive technology that a phenomenal thing can happen, when a small cog can destroy the whole car. the Russians are not giving up on the strategic task of seizing the eastern bridgehead. A soldier cannot run 5 km to the front line on the attack line. Let's say, at least one and a half kilometers, it has to be transported by automobile. And if the indicators continue to grow, it may happen that the Russians will be forced to redistribute this automotive equipment from the national economy. And in view of the colossal sanctions pressure on this economy, the moment may come when entire industries may stop due to the fact that there will not be enough trucks, say, to deliver the required amount of coal to a thermal power plant. Such is the phenomenal state of affairs in the field of destruction of automotive equipment. We hope that our soldiers will soon raise this figure to 120-130, or even up to 200 units per day (destruction of enemy vehicles - ed.). We wish them success in this.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/fantastychna-czil-dlya-fpv-droniv-5-km-do-peredovoyi-ta-starenkyj-gaz-66-ekspert-pro-gvyntyk-yakyj-mozhe-zrujnuvaty-usyu-impersku-mashynu/	2025-01-22T21:02:31-08:00
With a gun and a prayer - on foot and at night: how the rotation of infantrymen at -zero-	ArmyInform tells how the rotation of fighters takes place on the front line in the 2nd International Defense Legion of Ukraine. Before moving forward in the direction of forward positions, fighters arrive from rest at a common assembly point. It is here that they can get the most up-to-date information about the advance, listen to orders and advice from commanders, check weapons and -equipment-, set up -radioks-. — In connection with the dynamics and active assault actions of the enemy, every rotation now happens in manual mode. Previously, we had planned rotations, which were prescribed in the morning or the day before and were carried out clearly according to the script. Currently, due to the active assault actions of the enemy, everything needs to be adjusted and plans are changing dynamically. That's why rotation is difficult, - says the company commander Oleksandr. Advancing further can be fast, but sometimes you also have to wait until it is safe to continue moving further towards the positions. Depending on the situation, the wait can last from several tens of minutes to several hours. During their stay at the assembly point, the fighters have the opportunity to rest or have a snack. Located several kilometers from the drop-off point, the shelter where they stay is quite safe, well camouflaged and comfortable. It is possible to get comfortable here to lie down or drink hot tea. — Here we are waiting for the team to leave. One of the rotation algorithms provides for the movement of the group leaving the positions to the disembarkation point in such a way that the new group arrives there at the same time as them. Therefore, we are now waiting for the command to load into the car and drive towards the front line, - explains the second commander of the company, Yuriy. If everyone is replaced, there is no need to wait for the exit of the previous group, because it will start exiting only when the new shift enters the position. At this time, the transport returns to the assembly point and will go to the loading point in such a way as to immediately pick up those who leave and rush to the rear without any waiting. — We try to change the position completely, but due to a number of circumstances, not always it works. Therefore, we find out who is more tired and try to pick them up. We have to hold those who can still stand in their positions for another day or two. But we usually try to change people in the positions completely, - assures Oleksandr. - During the rotation, you can experience even greater losses than during the rotation of the positions. Because it is much more difficult and dangerous to bring people to -zero- than to be there. Therefore, we constantly change the landing points so that they cannot be detected by the enemy, and we -crush- enemy drones with EW. Brigade EWs work very well, - says Oleksandr. In addition to suppressing enemy UAVs with EWs, fighters also have additional active protection from drones - there are hunting rifles in each of the groups and at each of the positions. With their help, a trained fighter can shoot down a detected drone at a safe distance. —A hunting rifle was purchased for each position, which destroys enemy drones with gunpowder. This is quite an effective tool. A fighter who knows how to use her stands out for her. He practices how to load it correctly, how to shoot at a drone. That is, his additional task is the destruction of drones, - says Yuriy. - The average distance of a pedestrian crossing is one and a half or two kilometers, but it can be 3 or even 4. If there is a danger of fire damage to the unloading point, then it is transferred deeper to the rear. Because of this, soldiers have to go to positions further and longer, and with a very significant load, - says Oleksandr. In addition to weapons, body armor and other ammunition, soldiers additionally carry up to 30 kilograms of cargo. First of all, these are ammunition, water, food, means of communication, a backpack or trench EW, additional batteries and many other necessary trinkets. The task of the commander is to check that the fighter does not forget the necessary things and does not collect extra. - When the fighters go back, they take only personal belongings, weapons and protective equipment. Heavy weapons - machine guns or RPGs, as well as sleeping bags and similar things remain in place, because all this is additional weight, - explains Yuriy. The rotation now takes place exclusively at night, because the nearest rear is closely watched by numerous enemy drones. However, even darkness is not a sufficient guarantee of security — the Russians have enough UAVs with thermal imaging capabilities. If the shelling begins, because the rotation is -drawn- by the enemy, then it is either paused, or the group is camouflaged. The average rotation time is 2‒3 hours. This is enough to withdraw and start a group, or vice versa - first start and then withdraw. But if we don't go according to plan, it can drag on for the whole night, says Oleksandr. While he is talking, the fighters inspect their equipment. Someone has already managed to doze off, others are happy to listen to the story about the Ukrainian Antarctic station -Akademik Vernadskyi- and the research vessel -Noosphere-. Quiet and focused, they are happy to distract themselves with an interesting story before a dangerous task. Everyone who is currently in the forefront is not doing it for the first time. According to the established tradition of the 2nd International Legion, the unit's sleeve insignia should feature a stylized antique helmet and spear and the motto in Latin -Viribus unitis- - -With united effort-. This chevron is a combat chevron and should be earned. The arm badge is issued to soldiers who have completed their first combat mission, so those who wear it are no longer newcomers to the Legion and have passed the baptism of fire on the front lines. task. Company commander Yuriy congratulates the soldiers and personally fastens a chevron on each shoulder. This is the combat green and black version of the arm badge, the soldiers will receive the ceremonial red, gray and black version after returning. A blessing from the military chaplain and a joint prayer are mandatory before going to the position. This is part of the tradition and a tribute to the brothers, for whom faith is the strongest support that strengthens the spirit in a difficult hour. The military chaplain of the 2nd International Legion, Father Makarii, conducts a short service. While taking the soldiers of the unit from different countries of the world on vacation, he not only instructs and strengthens them in the Christian faith, but also tells them about Ukraine and Ukrainians, introduces them more deeply to the culture and history of our people. — My dear friends, my dear brothers in Christ, you are here together for a very clear mission. Don't think this is an easy mission. You have a special calling from God because we cannot do anything without God's will. If you are here, it is because God called you to come here - he addresses the soldiers and asks God to protect them from Russian bullets, shells and bombs. The machines will soon arrive and the rotation will follow the usual planned algorithm - an expensive disembarkation at the point and a few kilometers of walking to the positions with a heavy load and under the constant danger of detection by the enemy. The group that the fighters are supposed to replace has already advanced to meet and will soon arrive at the place, which is only 10-15 minutes away from here.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/z-rushnyczeyu-ta-molytvoyu-pishky-ta-ponochi-yak-vidbuvayetsya-rotacziya-pihotyncziv-na-nuli/	2025-01-22T20:48:40-08:00

Imitating the Ukrainians: American marines are actively using TRV heavy drones	In October of this year, Combat Logistics Battalion 8 (CLB-8), part of the 2nd Logistics Group of the US Marine Corps, demonstrated the capabilities of the British-made Tactical Resupply Vehicle 150 (TRV-150) cargo drone during maneuvers Bold Quest 24. Actually, drones from Malloy Aeronautics are well known in the Defense Forces of Ukraine. About the fact that the leadership of the United Kingdom transferred to our state flying products from this company, ArmyInform reported last September. Characterizing their UAV TRV-150, its developers stated: -Thanks to the ability to reliably lift 68 kg in any weather, you can trust the T150 to get your loads anywhere!-. And talking about the course of multinational military exercises Bold Quest 24, reviewers of the defense portal Army Recognition noted that under frequent field school at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, aimed at to improve interoperability between air, ground, sea, space and cyber units, the TRV-150 drone operationally delivered 38.5 kilograms of medical supplies, including donated blood. In April 2023, the US Navy signed an $8.4 million contract with the British company Malloy Aeronautics and its American reseller Service Engineering for 21 units of these unmanned aircraft systems. This decision was made after the TRV-150 took first place in the PMA-263 Tactical Resupply UAS Challenge in 2019. On 27 October 2023, the Marine Corps announced an initial operational capability (IOC) for the TRV-150C at Marine Corps Base Hawaii, equipping and training the Third Maritime Logistics Battalion (LLB-3) to operate the system. The US Marine Corps plans to deploy the Tactical Unmanned Aerial Supply System (TRUAS) to all logistics battalions by 2028, with each unit expected to receive between three and six drones. The development of the TRV-150 stems from Malloy Aeronautics' previous work on hovercraft concepts in 2012, which evolved into more practical unmanned cargo delivery systems. The TRV-150, an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) cargo drone, can transport up to 68 kilograms of cargo over a distance of 70 kilometers at a cruising speed of 108 kilometers per hour. It has a flight time of 36 minutes and uses waypoint navigation for autonomous mission planning. The TRV-150 features eight electric motors that drive the propellers, removable batteries for quick replacement, and modular components, including foldable propeller booms and a fixed chassis for compact storage and easy transport. The device is designed to be deployed by one person and is capable of operating in a variety of weather conditions, including rain, wind, desert and arctic environments. The drone is capable of delivering cargo both by landing and dropping it from the air. The demonstration of the TRV-150 at Bold Quest 24 underscores a broader trend in military logistics where armed forces are increasingly relying on autonomous drones to solve problems in battlefield supply operations. These unmanned systems can transport critical items such as ammunition, food and medical supplies, reducing reliance on manned convoys in high-risk areas. The US Army is implementing similar initiatives, developing autonomous air supply systems for infantry brigade combat teams. Advances in battery technology are expected to increase the payload, range and speed of these systems, as well as potential plans for in-flight wireless charging. Drones like the TRV-150 are especially valuable in medical resupply missions, where sensitive materials like blood must be transported in difficult environments. The US Army's Project Crimson uses the FVR-90 drone, which has the ability to take off and land vertically, to deliver whole blood to combat medics. During the Convergence project, 22 drones transported simulated blood packages in the Mojave Desert, demonstrating their effectiveness in scenarios involving mass casualty of service members. These initiatives are aimed at improving the logistics of medical supply in contested airspace and rough terrain, potentially increasing the survival rate of the wounded.

Russian air defense repelled an attack on Smolensk: this had never happened before	It seems that every day the Russian mass media is becoming more and more like scenarios from thrillers, in which the main character always manages to stop the disaster at the last moment. And here's a new story for you: the Ukrainian attack on Smolensk region, which was repulsed by Russian anti-aircraft defense so quickly that even in fantasy films, they don't have time to show all the tension. But there are a few things you should pay attention to before accepting this as the truth. First, let's look at the concept itself: the presence of active attacks by Ukrainian forces on the territory of Russia indicates that the front has long ceased to be limited only to Ukrainian lands. However, for Kremlin propagandists, it looks as if the protected city of Smolensk is one of the last bastions worth defending to the last breath. And now, they are presenting it as a battle that took place with the invincible Russian air defense. But isn't it strange that at this time official sources have not confirmed any evidence of this miraculous reflection? Secondly, the Russian sources themselves limit themselves to statements that the anti-aircraft missile system successfully destroyed all targets. But there are no videos or photos anywhere to confirm this -heroic- moment. Doesn't that seem a little suspicious? After all, as we know, if anything happens in Russia, even similar to the lightning flight of a rocket, the video is already in all social networks. And now about the fictional -reflection- itself. Doesn't it seem strange to you that even in the most difficult conditions of the war in Smolensk, no one noticed that parts of Ukrainian drones or missiles disappeared from the air defense system, which could confirm this statement? Maybe because no attacks actually happened? The Kremlin is well aware that if they want to support the morale of their army and population, it is necessary to create stories about an indomitable power that seemingly continuously protects the country from all troubles. However, reality does not always correspond to such stories. Especially when it comes to actual results: the situation at the front is actually quite different. If we put everything together, we can only laugh at how the Kremlin is trying to create a new victory with the help of fantasy. And if the anti-aircraft defense really destroyed many targets, then most likely, these -targets- existed only in the fiction of Moscow propagandists. Isn't that right? This is another vivid example of how manipulation and fake news are becoming a tool for waging war, not on the front, but in the information space. But who believes all this? But only those for whom it is important to remain in the dark, without access to the truth.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/rosijska-ppo-vidbyla-ataku-na-smolensk-takogo-shhe-ne-bulo/	2025-01-22T20:16:01-08:00

Half a million dollars and 100 -clients-: a mobilization evasion scheme was exposed in Kharkiv	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. Under the procedural guidance of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office, four persons were notified of the suspicion of obstructing the lawful activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations in a special period, committed by a group of persons based on a prior conspiracy, and of assisting in the illegal transportation of persons across the state border of Ukraine by removing obstacles (Part 2 of Article 28, Part 1 of Article 114-1, Part 2 of Article 332 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). According to the investigation, a 54-year-old man from Kharkiv, who was previously convicted and was serving a sentence for intentional murder, developed a device to -help- men evade mobilization. He involved his acquaintances in the -plan-: a lawyer and two retired women. The lawyer was looking for men of draft age who wanted to avoid mobilization and planned to go abroad. The women, through their own connections in the medical facilities of the region, arranged for clients to receive fictitious disabilities.

- Fart or experience? - how a Ukrainian mortar destroyed an enemy tank with one shot	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Bohdan has experience working with different types of mortars and can compare their effectiveness. In 2014, he worked with the Soviet 2B11 mortar, later he used the Ukrainian Hammers and the American M120 mortars, which he considers the most convenient due to their design features. Bohdan mentions two cases that are particularly memorable due to the effectiveness of mortar weapons. The first occurred in the Kherson region, where he managed to destroy an enemy MTLB carrying ammunition for the Russian infantry. And the second in Zaporizhzhia, when one of the mines hit the hatch of a Russian T-72 tank that was moving to support the infantry. Although this shot was accidental, it turned out to be fatal for enemy equipment. In addition, Bohdan notes that the mortar has repeatedly confirmed its effectiveness in destroying enemy fortifications and equipment. -Our calculation worked on the enemy infantry, but it so happened that at the moment of one of the shots, a Russian tank approached with open hatches (the ventilation of the tower in the T-72 is bad, so tankmen during intensive firing often open the hatches in order not to be poisoned by powder gases ). And our mine hit directly into the open hatch of the moving tank. It happened by accident, we were just lucky, but the fact remains that we destroyed the tank with one shot from a mortar,- says Bohdan. However, not all stories turn out the way you want them to. Bohdan recalls the case when, a few months ago, his unit came under fire from Russian artillery and aircraft. An enemy drone detected their positions, and 152 mm artillery began to work on them, covering them with 17 shells. One of the shells hit the shelter where four fighters were hiding. Bohdan was wounded, but after treatment he returned to the army. Despite the difficult tests, Bohdan firmly believes in the victory of Ukraine. -We must be prepared that the war may last longer than we hope. On the other hand, there is no other choice - we will definitely win,- he concludes. As ArmiyaInform reported, sailor Vasyl with the call sign -Robbiynyk- served in the 38th separate brigade of marines, where he heroically defended Ukraine in the Pokrovsky direction. In close combat he neutralized the enemy, took a prisoner and became an example of courage for his brothers.

Occupiers on rubber boats swim across Oskil, but they are met by our drones	Major Viktor Tregubov, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, stated this on January 22 on the air of -Suspilne Novosti-. To the presenter's question, thanks to which the Russian military manages to advance towards the village of Dvorichna, he answered that this is due to the infiltration of the occupiers through the Oskil River. -They are constantly seeping there through Oskil. Usually at night, usually on small watercraft. Every day we register the destruction of a certain number of Russian watercraft, but these are rubber boat-class watercraft,- Viktor Tregubov said. For example, according to him, six occupants can get into a rubber boat to swim across Oskil at night or during fog and hide in a forest strip. The spokesman of the -Khortytsia- OSUV noted that Ukrainian drones hunt them both when the Russians try to cross the river and in the forest strips. -When they have already accumulated a certain number of people there, they try to carry out assault actions. Our people catch and destroy them in the forests. That's why the map always looks like it's constantly flickering. They are sometimes in Dvorichnaya, sometimes not in Dvorichnaya. They have a favorite crossing point there,- he explained. Viktor Tregubov said that the main problem for the Russians is that the Oskil River has not frozen over. -If the river had frozen over, they could have more or less fixed the logistics there. And the river is not frozen, you can't throw a pontoon across it, because there is fire control of Ukrainian troops there, which will simply destroy it instantly, and that's why they have to go in small groups like that,- he said. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian troops changed the offensive tactics in the Pokrovsky direction, in particular, the Russians -use-myasom-yak-zminylas-taktyka-rosiyan-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/->reduced the number of yes so-called -meat- assaults and began to manage personnel more economically.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/22/okupanty-na-gumovyh-chovnah-pereplyvayut-oskil-ale-yih-zustrichayut-nashi-dronari/	2025-01-22T03:38:10-08:00

Today is Sobornosti Day: what Ukrainians celebrate on this day	Since the end of the 17th century, our lands have been divided between different empires, so their confederation (i.e. unification into a single state entity) has become the pinnacle of social life aspirations for Ukrainians. The Ukrainian national movement presented a political program unification during the -Spring of Nations- - a series of revolutions of 1848-1849 that swept across Europe. The main Russian Rada (the first Ukrainian political organization that appeared in Lviv at the time) in the manifesto of May 10, 1848 declared its desire for the unity of the Ukrainian lands. Among the preserved materials of the Main Russian Council is an anonymous article in which it is noted: -From the Tisza behind the Carpathians, on both sides of the Dniester and Dnieper to the banks of the Don, there are settlements of one Slavic people, the number of which reaches 15 million. Therefore, the purpose of such a great nation cannot be to occupy a secondary position in Europe, to be subordinated to another-. After 1865, in a song to the words of Pavlo Chubynskyi from Dnieper and music by Mykhailo Verbytskyi from Galicia (it was this song that became the basis of the national anthem of Ukraine ) the following words appeared: -Let's stand up, brothers, in a bloody battle from the Xiang to the Don, We will not let anyone rule in our native land.- The Tarasiv Brotherhood, a secret student organization created in Poltava in 1891, proclaimed in its program: -Independent, sovereign Ukraine: cathedral and indivisible, from the Syan to the Kuban, from the Carpathians to the Caucasus.- The slogan -One, unified, indivisible, free, independent Ukraine from the Carpathians to the Caucasus- was also used by Mykola Mikhnovsky in the brochure -Independent Ukraine- (1900). The First World War, national revolutionary movements and the collapse of empires brought the realization of the dream of cathedral unity. The Ukrainian Central Rada was established in Kyiv in 1917, and on January 22, 1918, it proclaimed the independence of the Ukrainian People's Republic from Russia. And in Galicia, on the ruins of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the West Ukrainian People's Republic emerged on November 1, 1918, after the November Revolution. Its leaders initiated negotiations on the unification of Transnistrian Ukraine with Transnistrian Ukraine. On December 1, 1918, at the -Fastiv- railway station, representatives of the ZUNR and the UNR signed the -Pre-Accession Treaty- (that is, preliminary or preliminary). The agreement stated the unwavering intention of ZUNR -to merge into one large state with the Ukrainian People's Republic in the shortest possible time.- For its part, the Ukrainian National People's Republic announced its agreement -to accept the entire territory and population of the Western Ukrainian People's Republic as an integral part of the state integrity of the Ukrainian People's Republic.- The contract was signed by: Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Simon Petliura, Fedir Shvets, Panas Andrievskyi from the Ukrainian National People's Republic of Ukraine, Longyn Tsegelskyi and Dmytro Levytskyi from the National People's Republic of Ukraine. The pre-accession treaty was ratified on January 3, 1919, at the first meeting of the Ukrainian National Council, the governing body of the Ukrainian People's Republic. On January 18, a joint meeting of the Directorate and the Council of People's Ministers of the Ukrainian People's Republic was held with the participation of a delegation from Galicia, Bukovyna, and Transcarpathia. It was about the promulgation of the Act of Unification of the UNR and the ZUNR and the celebration on this occasion. The Council of Ministers instructed the Minister of National Education Ivan Ohienko to write the script of the events and personally lead all the ceremonies. It was he who proposed to organize a national holiday on the anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Ukrainian People's Republic. On January 22, 1919, on Sofia Square in Kyiv, on the first anniversary of the independence of the Ukrainian People's Republic, in a festive atmosphere the proclamation of the -Universal Directory of the Ukrainian People's Republic- (which we symbolically called the Act of Zluka). Buildings in the central part of the city were decorated with national flags, the entrance to Sofia Maidan was decorated with a triumphal arch with the coats of arms of the UNR and ZUNR. Tens of thousands of capital residents and numerous guests flocked to the central streets to the music. The choir led by Kyryll Stetsenko, accompanied by the orchestra, sang -Ukraine is not dead yet-. And the historic moment came - the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the ZUNR Longyn Tsegelskyi announced the letter, the resolution of the UNRada, and handed it over to the head of the Directorate Volodymyr Vinnychenko. In response, a member of the Directory Fedir Shvets read Universal: -&lt;&#8230;&gt; From now on, the West Ukrainian People's Republic (Galichyna, Bukovyna, and Hungarian Rus) and Trans-Dnieper Great Ukraine, separated from each other for centuries, will merge into one. The age-old dreams that the best sons of Ukraine lived and died for came true. From now on there is a single independent Ukrainian People's Republic &lt;&#8230;&gt;-. The holiday ended with a solemn prayer and a parade. The columns of Sich riflemen and Colonel Yevhen Konovalts were greeted with special enthusiasm. The next day, January 23, 1919, in the premises of the Kyiv Opera House (modern National Opera of Ukraine), the Labor Congress of Ukraine discussed the mentioned documents and approved them. By thus ratifying the Universal Directory of the UNR, the Congress gave it a legitimate legal character. The President of the UN Rada, Yevhen Petrushevich, was soon elected to the Directory. ZUNR, after merging with UNR, changed its name to Western Oblast of the Ukrainian People's Republic (ZO UNR). Unfortunately, due to the ongoing war with the Russians, the unification of UNR and ZUNR into one state was not completed . However, the Act of Zluka became a symbol and legend for subsequent generations of fighters for a free Ukraine. Yulian Bachynskyi's old slogan -from Syan to the Caucasus- was included in the words of the March of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN anthem), written in 1929 by Oleksa Babii. On August 24, 2018, a version of the song adapted to modern Ukrainian conditions became the March of the Ukrainian Army: -Our glory leads us into battle. For us, the law is the highest order! The cathedral Ukrainian is a state - one for the ages, from the Syan to the Caucasus!-. The memory of one's own state in 1917-1921 became one of the cornerstones of the formation of the modern national identity of Ukrainians, inspired the continuation of the liberation struggle . In 1990, on the occasion of the 71st anniversary of the proclamation of the separation of the UNR and ZUNR, the Ukrainian patriotic the public formed a living chain of unity from Ivano-Frankivsk to Kyiv. An example of that -Ukrainian wave- was the -Baltic Way- action by residents of the Baltic countries. How many participants came to the commemoration of the events of the Ukrainian Revolution is not known for sure: various sources say from 500 thousand to three million people who joined hands and created a continuous chain from Kyiv through Lviv to Ivano-Frankivsk. The action became a harbinger of the future fall of the USSR and the emergence of Ukraine's independence. The idea of ​​territorial integrity of the country is combined with ideas of spiritual cohesion. In the conditions of the modern Russian-Ukrainian war, sobrality acquires greater symbolism and poignancy, because now, more than ever, Ukrainians need to unite for the sake of the future. A united nation that sees its own future will certainly restore the unity of the territory. This will happen after the de-occupation of Crimea, as well as our territories in Donetsk and Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson, Mykolaiv and Kharkiv regions.

A robot to replace a sniper: American gunsmiths offered a technological rotation on the battlefield ...	As state in a post on the official website of the manufacturer, representatives of the American weapons company SWORD Defense Systems, their development ensures safe and reliable deployment of the weapon system, giving the operator the ability to load and safely use the weapon at a distance, according to ArmyInform. These features also allow the operator to troubleshoot and safely unload the platform for recovery. 6.5 Creedmoor cartridges allow accurate fire up to 1200 m. SPUR can also use the 7.62×51 NATO cartridge if suitable ammunition is available. Thanks to its powerful SPUR sensors can work in various conditions, both day and night. The development was called -Special Purpose Unmanned Rifle- (SPUR) and was made in the form of a detachable module. At one time, the SPUR self-propelled gun made its debut on the exhibition floor of the main annual convention of the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) in Washington, DC. The rifle was cooperated with the development of the Ghost Robotics company, the Vision-60 robot dog. Such four-legged robotic devices are actively being introduced to the defense market by companies from various countries and are equipped with a variety of weapons. In particular, our editorial office earlier spyni/-> told about the Thermonator robot dog, on which a compact ARC flamethrower with an electric drive is mounted. Speaking of weapon details, the SPUR is based on a semi-automatic rifle that uses a proven short-stroke piston design. The model is available in two calibers, which makes it versatile for tasks that require high accuracy at medium and long distances. For flexibility, the rifle is equipped with the following key components: Optics and sensors: — High definition day sight. — Thermal imaging module for night operations. These systems allow effective use of the rifle at any time of the day and in difficult weather conditions. Actuators are perhaps the most important part of the SPUR, turning it into an autonomous combat unit. Executive mechanisms provide: Remote charging of weapons. — Installation and removal of the fuse. - Shooting process. — Discharge and eliminate major delays. A standard magazine has a capacity of 10 rounds. This may seem like a limitation, but this choice is driven by point-use missions, not mass fire. Management is carried out remotely over a secure communication channel. The automatic ballistic system ensures accurate calculation of the trajectory of the shot, minimizing the human factor. SPUR is not just a rifle, but a system that can be integrated into different carriers. At the NDIA Future Force Capabilities Expo arms show, the rifle was demonstrated on a robot dog, which caused quite a stir. Platforms such as quadpods are highly mobile and can be used in urban environments, difficult terrain or even indoors. This demonstration highlighted SPUR's conceptual flexibility: it can be installed not only on ground robots, but also on unmanned aerial vehicles or stationary systems. Robotic systems with weapons, such as SPUR, can be used in various scenarios: - Defense of strategic assets: installed on a stationary platform, the rifle is able to monitor the area around the clock and automatically respond to threats. — Targeted military operations: SPUR use on drones or ground operations minimizes risks to the lives of operators. — Suppression of sabotage groups: thanks to the autonomous system of ballistic calculations and the capabilities of thermal imaging, SPUR becomes an effective tool for detecting and eliminating the enemy. The SPUR includes a thermal imaging camera with 30x magnification, which means that in the middle of the night, a remote operator can easily detect living and breathing targets. The Vision-60 and SPUR tandem is designed to allow soldiers to approach the target at close range without exposing themselves to danger. A new US Army robot dog with a sniper rifle.

-He screamed with joy-: the story of -Multa- from the 23rd OMBR, who burned a Russian on a quad bike	The senior soldier of the 23rd separate mechanized brigade Volodymyr with the call sign -Mult- is the master of the unmanned aerial systems battalion of the unmanned systems battalion. Until 2015, he worked as a dispatcher of -Poltavaoblenergo- in the Kobelyak branch. This was his home field for the last 17 years. In 2015-2018, served in the ranks of the 27th reactive artillery brigade (senior mechanic-driver on BMP-1 and BMP-2 and Uragan BM). Then he served in the Military Commissariat for another 6 months, and then went abroad. He worked as an electrician in the Czech Republic, Poland and Germany. He states that he earned less than he could earn in a similar position in Kyiv. -In the capital - 50 thousand hryvnias, and in Europe, the work of an electrician is paid at the level of 35-40 thousand hryvnias,- says the military man. However, with the large-scale invasion, -Mult- returned to Ukraine with his wife - she then left for Europe again with her two daughters, and our interlocutor began, as it often happened, to -storm- the Military Commissariat - the same, native one where he once served. -I went to them for two weeks and asked to be accepted into the army. It was a pike(laughs - ed.). Somehow they call and ask if I am ready to leave at 6 in the morning. I agreed, packed my bag, took a pack of cigarettes. We were brought to Cherkassy in the 93rd Brigade. Then there were two busloads of people, about a hundred people, and only 13 of us were taken. I was among them. In my military ticket it was written that I was a senior mechanic-driver. I was asked if I would go to the APC. I replied that I could go even to BRDM. To which I was answered: -Well, then you will be a grenade launcher,- -Mult- recalls his story. A month of training followed, and the trooper became a proficient user of both the Needle and the Stinger. In 2022, he recalls, just in time for Easter, the brigade went on combat missions in the Raisin direction, in Barvinkovo. Then our units managed to pass and clear 30 kilometers of territory. -Once, my partner and I dug a 2-person dugout for ourselves - but we never spent the night there. An urgent telegram came for the rotation, and three days later we were in Bahmut.- They held the defense and fought for the city for 2 months. In the battles for this city, -Mult- was wounded - -Uragan- served in the positions of the Armed Forces. -The shells fell 2 meters from us. My brother was burned, I was thrown 7 meters.- After that, he served in the Kharkiv Military Commissariat for 5 months. From October 31, 2024, -Mult- is in the ranks of the 23rd separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in the battalion of unmanned systems. -Back in 2022, in the 93rd Brigade, I bought myself a drone. Two pieces. I am self-taught in general, I love technology. I used to solder phones (laughs - ed.). That's how I became the master of the BPAK shock unit,- the army man shares. On November 24, 2024, there was a particularly tasty exercise against the enemy. This combat episode is described in the -Khortytsia- OSUV as follows: during the performance of combat missions to detect and identify enemy ground and air targets, UAV strikes by dropping weapons from the UAV on enemy targets, senior soldier Volodymyr Kononenko discovered two enemy BBMs, ATV and 47 enemy manpower. -Thanks to his skillful and decisive actions, nine servicemen of the USSR were killed, 28 were wounded, an ATV and an anti-aircraft vehicle were damaged,- the command emphasizes. -Mult- describes this episode succinctly, but emotionally: -I was flying, and I see a quadric.- I took it and threw it at him. And this was my first shot like this! I was screaming with joy!-, the serviceman does not hide his emotions. When we ask whether, with all his baggage of experience, he still had to go through a course of basic general military training, the army man laughs heartily, nods in the affirmative, and asks us to guess in which year. It turns out that in 2024. But notes that it was interesting. -As a MANPADSman, I have never conducted assaults. And during the BZVP, we practiced the skills of assault and trenches, and buildings.- Success on the battlefield, in the words of -Multa-, now depends largely on technology. -The more drones, the better,- he succinctly emphasizes. &#8230; On Thursday, December 12, 2024, there was a big Russian offensive in the direction of Kurakhovo. -And on Friday, the 13th, my circle -smashed-. Tore off the fingers on the right hand.- So far, the military has already carried out five operations. Treatment is ongoing. When asked the traditional question about how he would advise civilians to overcome their fear and join the Defense Forces, Mult says: -Just get over that fear. During my time in the army, I must have been up there 10 times already. I want to get a tattoo: the number -10- with wings, with the face of a ragdoll doll.- Photo is from the personal archive of a serviceman	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/22/azh-vereshhav-vid-radoshhiv-istoriya-multa-iz-23-ombr-yakyj-spalyv-rosiyan-na-kvadroczykli/	2025-01-21T20:31:17-08:00
Fake about -energy catastrophe in the EU-: how many lies in one gas pipe	The first wave of disinformation began back in 2022, when the EU announced a reduction in dependence on Russian energy carriers. the Kremlin launched the thesis: -Europe will not survive the winter without our gas.- Then, when the winter passed, and Europeans still did not freeze in their apartments, the dark people changed: now the emphasis was on the -long-term damage- to the economy. It was a classic approach: first to intimidate, then to push to the conclusion that -without Russia, there is nowhere.- Only the script did not work. In reality, the Russian economy is suffering from sanctions, and the Europeans are just wondering how long they endured energy blackmail. Europe is confidently walking the path of energy independence, building its strategy on real achievements and not on propaganda myths. Meanwhile, Russia is still trying to sell the world the fiction that -everything is lost- without it. Perhaps the Kremlin should apply to Hollywood - screenwriters are valued there. True, only the talentless are not hired - so the chances are small. The lie that Europe cannot survive without Russian energy carriers is an attempt to save face in a situation where Russia has lost on all fronts. The EU is alive and developing, but the Kremlin has to sit on the -gas needle-, no longer having anyone to supply its raw materials to.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/22/fejk-pro-energetychnu-katastrofu-v-yes-skilky-brehni-v-odnij-gazovij-trubi/	2025-01-21T20:07:01-08:00

Local -authorities- have repeatedly demonstrated their inability to quickly respond to emergency situations, which only worsens the humanitarian crisis in the region.

People are forced to look for alternative sources of water supply or wait for the occupation authorities to fulfill their promises, which may be delayed indefinitely. Accidents at infrastructural facilities and the lack of a timely response from the occupation administration have become characteristic of the temporarily occupied territories. People left in these conditions face a lack not only of water, but also of other basic services, which makes their lives even more difficult.

Often this becomes critical, as the operator loses the ability to see the route,- he notes. The technician with the call sign -Fin- is responsible for the repair of all types of reconnaissance and attack drones. According to him, the most common malfunctions are body damage, gimbal failure and loss of drone beams. -Engine failure is less common, but it also needs attention. The success of combat missions depends on the quality of repairs,- he explains. According to French, UAV operators play an important role in protecting infantry. They accompany military units, monitor possible threats and even mine approaches to positions. -We are doing everything possible to keep the infantrymen safe. We understand how difficult the positions are, so we try to make their work easier,- the operator emphasizes. The experience of the fighters of the -Forpost- brigade confirms that effective aerial reconnaissance is the coordinated work of operators, technicians and the entire unit. As reported by ArmyInform, Oleg Gerva with the call sign -Gera-, commander of the mortar battery of the 67th separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, ten years ago heroically held the defense Donetsk Airport (DAP).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/21/yak-prykordonnyky-brygady-forpost-vykorystovuyut-drony-mavic-dosvid-franczuza-neksusa-i-fina/	2025-01-21T09:08:37-08:00
30,000 kits of poor quality: the Kyiv company was exposed in a supply scam	This is reported by the SBU. In Kyiv, the Security Service exposed two founders of a private company that supplied wholesale batches of low-quality military uniforms to National Guard units. It is documented that between March and October 2023, those involved shipped 30,000 units of clothing for Ukrainian defenders with a total cost of UAH 28.7 million. The examination initiated by the Security Service showed that the military uniform purchased with state funds was sewn using hardware that did not meet the technical conditions. In particular, the materials used have a lower class of wear resistance, so a serviceman will not be able to reliably fix protective ammunition and weapons with ammunition on such clothing. Accordingly, this may pose a real threat to the life and health of Ukrainian soldiers on the front line. According to the case materials, the defendants deliberately -saved- on quality materials in order to buy cheaper components and thus make more profit. During the searches, commercial documentation and a hard drive with evidence of embezzlement were found in the residences of the participants. So far, the SBU investigators have informed both founders of the enterprise about the suspicion for h. 2 Art. 28, ch. 5th century 191 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (possession of property by abuse of official position, committed on a particularly large scale by prior conspiracy by a group of persons under martial law). Offenders face up to 12 years in prison with confiscation of property. An investigation is underway to bring all those responsible to justice. Comprehensive measures were carried out under the procedural guidance of the Specialized Prosecutor's Office in the sphere of defense of the Central region.

The President of Ukraine called on Europe to increase defense spending and jointly create air defens...	About this he said during a speech to the participants of the World Economic Forum in Davos. The head of state noted that despite the fact that Russia's overall economic potential is much smaller than Europe's, the Russian Federation produces several times more ammunition and military equipment than all of Europe combined. In addition, Russia is increasing cooperation with Iran and North Korea. That is why it is important to maintain unity in Europe. -We need a common European policy in the field of security and defense, and all European countries should be ready to spend on security as much as is really necessary, and not as much as they have become accustomed to through years of neglect. If defense requires 5% of GDP, then it should be 5%,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President emphasized that Ukraine has created models of defense cooperation that can make the whole of Europe stronger. It is about the joint production of artillery and drones, including unique ones that have no analogues in the world. In addition, the head of state called to jointly create air defense systems that can deal with all types of cruise and ballistic missiles. -Europe needs its own Iron Dome capable of resisting any threats. We cannot rely on the goodwill of a few capitals when it comes to Europe's security,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He also emphasized that no European country should depend on one energy supplier, especially Russia, and the policy of US President Donald Trump can help in this matter. Separately, the head of state noted that Europe must be able to guarantee peace and security for itself and for others. -Europe deserves to be strong. And for this, Europe needs the EU and NATO. Is it possible without Ukraine and without a fair end to Russia's war against Ukraine? I'm sure not. Only real security guarantees for us will be real security guarantees for everyone in Europe. And we must ensure that America also considers us necessary,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy concluded. As reported by ArmyInform, President Volodymyr Zelensky held a meeting with a delegation of the Seimas of Lithuania headed by Speaker Saulius Skvernyalis, who first arrived in Ukraine after being elected to the post.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/21/prezydent-ukrayiny-zaklykav-yevropu-naroshhuvaty-vytraty-na-oboronu-ta-razom-stvoryuvaty-systemy-ppo/	2025-01-21T07:37:11-08:00

Soldiers of the Armed Forces told how a captured North Korean soldier tried to kill himself against ...	The fighters told about how it turned out for them in the story, which published on Tuesday, January 21, by the Command of the Defense Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -It's no secret that military personnel from North Korea do not surrender to captivity, they are ready to lay hands on themselves in order not to fall into the hands of Ukrainian soldiers. However, Polish paratroopers managed to capture such a militant,- the military said. According to them, the prisoner fell into their hands after another assault on Ukrainian positions, when the enemy realized that it would not be possible to break through and began to retreat. -Then they were chased away by mortars, skirmishes. Towards the end of the assaults, one of the drones said that a body was moving. They said to check who it is. We got together and ran out. We were corrected by drones where to go to see it. When they approached, they saw a green scarf-pipe on top of their heads, they thought it was ours. They asked if he needed help, he did not answer. When they came closer, they saw narrow eyes. They saw that the armor is not ours&#8230; Gestures showed what he had to do. He had a grenade and a knife on his armor. They told him to throw it all away,- shared one of the Ukrainian soldiers. The fighters also recall that when they searched the prisoner, in one of his summaries, they unexpectedly discovered a sausage that the soldier from the DPRK had taken with him on the assault for some reason. -We showed him the direction to follow us. They kept their distance. The task was to deliver it to the point where the car was supposed to arrive. When the box was approaching&#8230; Before that he was very calm. A box came up, he was already getting scared or something. We almost took him out by force. When the box was already approaching, there were concrete pillars under the road, and he hit the pillar with his head from all the acceleration. It hit very hard and turned off. The guys got out of the car, packed it up and took it away. Our task is accomplished,- the paratroopers said.

The enemy tried 16 times to penetrate the Ukrainian defense in the Toretsk direction	This is reported in the operational information of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as of 22 :00 January 20. On the Kharkiv direction there were two combat clashes with the Russian invaders in the Vovchansk region. In the Kupyansk direction the enemy tried eight times to dislodge our units from their positions near Petropavlivka, Kolisnikivka, Lozova and Zagryzovo. One battle is ongoing. Fifteen times the enemy attacked in the Lyman direction near Nadiya, Novoehorivka, Makiivka, Kopanok, Nevsky, Terni and in the direction of Zarichny. Two clashes continue until now.

In the Kramatorsk direction Defense forces repelled nine enemy attempts to advance near the settlement of Chasiv Yar and in the direction of Stupochky. Two clashes are still going on. The enemy tried 16 times to penetrate our defense in the direction of Toretsk. Since the beginning of the day, the occupiers in the regions of Toretsk, Krymske, Diliivka, Shcherbynivka and Ozaryanivka have been strongly repulsed by our defenders 13 times. Three attacks are still ongoing. The enemy is intensively attacking the Ukrainian defenders in the Pokrovsky direction. Here, during the day, the aggressor carried out 72 assault and offensive actions. The greatest activity of the Russian occupiers remains in the areas of Vodiane Druge, Myrolyubivka, Promin, Elizavetivka, Myrnograd, Kotlyne, Nadiivka, Andriivka, Shevchenko, Dachne, Ulakly and Yantarne. Ukrainian defenders have already repelled sixty-five attacks in that direction, seven more clashes are ongoing.

Can Polish tanks withstand ATGM strikes: ArmiyaInform report from Donetsk region	About the capabilities of PT-91 tanks in battle, the destruction of racist targets at short distances, and why the enemy wants to cut the Pokrovsk-Kostiantynivka highway so much further in the ArmyInform material. Getting to the -hiding places- of our tanks is another quest. We leave in the morning, overcome broken asphalt and field roads, behind more or less -living- settlements. The closer to the front line, the more broken villages where almost no one lives. The extreme part of the path is on a wet and viscous field, the swamp hits the car with -shards-. Ahead is a plantation, where Polish PT-91 Twardy tanks are hidden. Cars in caponiers, well camouflaged, nearby we can see a field warehouse with ammunition. From the outside, it is almost impossible to understand what is here. Even in winter, among bare trees. Neither enemy UAVs nor other enemy intelligence can detect tanks. -You can't get here on foot, although, of course, you can,- says the pickup truck driver who accompanied us with a smile, -somehow the guys took more than two hours to get through this wet field, and then we spent half a day washing them from the swamp.- Let's meet, tank platoon commander Andriy. He is from Kharkiv Oblast. In 2004, he graduated from the military department of the Kharkiv Institute of Tank Troops. After the large-scale invasion, he was mobilized into the ZSU. He underwent retraining at the National Academy of Ground Forces in Lviv. -In Lviv, a group of tank officers was formed for training at a training center in Poland. There they learned to work on PT-91 tanks. We mastered the technique together with the crews. After 1.5 months of training in 2023, together with these tanks, they went to Ukraine to perform combat missions. First, the Zaporizhzhia direction, now here in the Pokrovska district we are -piling up- on the occupiers,- says Andriy. -In short, the PT-91 Twardy tank is a third-generation Polish main battle tank modeled after the Soviet T-72 tank. In fact, these two tanks do not differ in any way. A combat vehicle weighing approximately 45 tons. The RT-91 tank uses active armor developed by Polish ERAWA: these are 400 protective blocks with a coating that reduce the visibility of the combat vehicle in the infrared and radar ranges. There are additionally welded protective blocks that should protect against projectile fragments of various calibers. Also, additional armor is installed to preserve the lives of tank crews from the hits of anti-tank missile systems. Considering the aerial threat posed by enemy UAVs, an anti-cumulative -brazier structure- is attached on top. Regarding weapons. The caliber of the gun is 125 mm, the Kalashnikov tank machine gun is 7.62 mm. Plus there is a 12.7 mm anti-aircraft machine gun, but it is practically not used on the battlefield. After all, the machine gun itself was developed in the 60s of the last century to be used against helicopters. The rotorcraft in those days did not fly fast, they were clumsy, so the tank commander could safely climb onto the armor and strike at them. Now, in times of mass use by the enemy of small UAVs at high altitudes, this capability of the tank is not used at all. If we talk about FPV drones, then only the -barbecue- will help effectively. The tank is equipped with a smoke grenade launcher, in addition, there is a night vision device. The chassis works stably. The maximum that we managed, it seems, the mechanic squeezed 60 km/h out of the tank on a dirt road. The car can maneuver over difficult terrain and overcome water obstacles. Overcomes fords and swampy areas up to 1 meter. Of course, you need to choose roads wisely, because you can drive into a swamp and sit -on your stomach-. It is not easy to pull a multi-ton car out of there. Lately, work has been very dynamic in the Pokrovsky area. Depending on the combat tasks, we work both with direct fire and from closed firing positions. The targets are diverse: accumulation of manpower, enemy equipment, shelters, some kind of dugouts. Most often, we use direct strikes here. At the same time, the firing distance was different: a kilometer, 500 m, 300 m, even up to 200 meters to the enemy. As it usually happens. For example, the command was given to the car crew to -dismantle enemy shelters where small assault groups have gathered- or perhaps a situation where the enemy is trying to break through the defenses of our units with infantry. The target can be located in a settlement or in a forest plantation -in the gray zone-. A tank equipped with EW goes on a mission, it is accompanied by an air reconnaissance unit, the commander at the control point -monitors- the video of the battle through the UAV. The tank crew must have full situational awareness on the battlefield. Conventionally speaking, the tank reaches the forest plantation, the -fire- command goes and that's it - the target is destroyed. If a direct hit, a second strike is no longer necessary. Of course, a Polish tank can fire up to 6 shots per minute. Just the other day, during one day of combat work, only one tank crew engaged the enemy 3 times with -direct fire-. Then the tankers shot the enemy at a distance of up to 200 meters. Is there anything left of the shelter and the raschits themselves? Judging by radio intercepts, no, only frantic Russian screams and continuous -mother- could be heard. So you understand, our work is -high-adrenaline-. The tank crew completed the task, rolled back, then headed to the -sink-. From closed firing positions, the tank works already at considerable distances. It is 8, 9 or even 10 km. In Donetsk region, it is more necessary to destroy the Rashists with -direct fire-. This is due to the high intensity of combat operations and the use of enemy assault groups in the area of ​​responsibility of our unit. We destroy the enemy with filigree precision. There has never been a case where a detected target was not hit. There is no significant difference whether these are small infantry groups advancing in the -gray zone- or a single unit of enemy equipment. There are coordinates, targeting and boom! Somehow, from closed firing positions, it was possible to destroy a Russian tank and BMP, which were moving in a column of enemy heavy equipment. It was about 8 km to the enemy. The boys and I didn't know anything about it. The combatant reported, said: -Well done, you got it!-. In general, during the two years of the war, so much enemy equipment was -placed- that you can't remember everything. At first, they exterminated the Rashists in Zaporozhye in the Rabotine district, now near Pokrovsk. In combat conditions, it is very important to maintain the survivability of the crew. People's lives matter, machinery is replaceable. The enemy is also hunting our tankers. Once one of our Twardys was hit by an anti-tank guided missile. The car stopped and caught fire, but the boys got out. Of course, the car stayed there because it couldn't move on its own. The crew left that place on foot. Good thing enemy FPV drones weren't working then. It happened that enemy shells burst very close, shrapnel hit the car. Then the boys were simply concussed, but they completed the task. The task of the Russian occupying forces is to take control of the main routes in Donetsk region, through which our troops are supplied -at zero-. Therefore, the enemy is trying to cut off the main logistics route Pokrovsk-Kostyantynivka for the Defense Forces. The enemy attacks in this direction continuously. The tactics of the Rashists are unchanged - they advance in small assault groups, infiltrate a certain area in the -gray zone- and try to advance to our positions. In some places, mechanized equipment is also used to lift the slats. But at the stages of their movement, our aerial scouts -fix- the movement and the coordinates are transmitted to the fire attack.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/21/chy-vytrymuyut-polski-tanky-udary-ptrk-reportazh-armiyainform-z-donechchyny/	2025-01-20T20:44:55-08:00
On the finish line: the US has decided on a site for the assembly of aircraft that will replace the ...	According to site The Defense Post, FLRAA is an ongoing program designed to replace aging helicopters UH- 60 Black Hawk and AH-64 Apache for modernized convertible aircraft, ArmyInform notes. Located near the company's Air Defense Center in Beech Field, this facility will conduct all manufacturing work for the initiative and will be supported by Bell's manufacturing network in Texas. Additional fuselage development will be conducted at the firm's Advanced Composite Center in Fort Worth, and final assembly of the aircraft will be conducted in Amarillo. Operations at the Wichita hub are expected to begin -in the next few months,- the company said. . -As Bell prepares for the next phase of FLRAA engineering and manufacturing, we are committed to investing in advanced manufacturing to deliver exceptional performance at an affordable price for our customers.- - said Bell CEO and President Lisa Atherton. -Textron has a rich history with the state of Kansas as well as the city of Wichita, and we are proud to deepen that relationship with this new venture.- Bell Textron awarded the main development contract FLRAA systems for the US Army in December 2022, with the company's V-280 Valor selected as the program airframe. Platform components will be sourced from various partners: Safran for the aircraft's high-voltage generator, Eaton for hydraulics, GE Aerospace for avionics, and Astronics for power and distribution systems. At the same time, CAE will supply flight simulators for the appropriate training of crews under this program. In August, the U.S. Army authorized Bell Textron to proceed with the development of the V-280 prototype. The first production aircraft is due to arrive by 2030. So, how do its creators see the successor to the famous American helicopters UH-60 Black Hawk and AH-64 Apache? The Bell V-280 Valor is a multipurpose convertible designed for the transportation of people and cargo, as well as for special operations. According to the customer's technical task, it should have a load capacity at the level of modern army helicopters, but surpass them in terms of flight characteristics. The V-280 has a streamlined fuselage with a cross-section close to rectangular. The bow part is reserved for the pilots' cabin, and in the center is the cargo-passenger cabin. A high-mounted wing is attached to the fuselage, at the ends of which there are two motorized nacelles. The tail feathers are V-shaped. The total length of the convertible is 15.4 m, the wingspan is about 25 m. The two propellers are 10.7 m in diameter. The dry weight of the machine reaches 8.2 tons, and the maximum take-off weight is 14 tons. The V-280 is capable of carrying up to 4.5 tons of cargo both inside the cabin and on external suspension. The cabin is designed for 10-11 passengers. The Valor test sample was equipped with two General Electric T64-419 turboshaft engines. Serial equipment will be equipped with a pair of Rolls-Royce AE 1107F engines with a capacity of more than 6,000 hp. k.s. everyone This decision was made to increase the overall characteristics, as well as for partial unification with the V-22 Osprey convertibles. The V-280 screw motor group has an original design. The motor nacelle and the engine are fixed on the wing, and the nose part of the nacelle with the propeller sleeve can move in the vertical plane for different flight modes. The engine and propeller are connected through an original Bell-Textron gearbox that provides power transmission in all hub positions. The onboard radio-electronic equipment of the V-280 meets Pentagon standards and includes all necessary command and control instruments, as well as navigation and communication systems. BREO allows you to control the convertible in all modes and solve transport tasks. The Valor's maximum design speed exceeds 550 km/h. Cruiser - 520 km/h. The practical height limit is declared at the level of 1800 m code. The combat radius of the flight is 1-1.4 thousand. km, and the driving range is 3900 km. The main advantage of the V-280 is its high flight characteristics. According to such parameters, it surpasses any helicopter of the US Army Aviation. In comparison, the maximum speed of the UH-60 is only 295 km/h, and the maximum range is 2.2 thousand. km With the appearance of the V-280 Valor, US Army aviation will receive new capabilities. Aviation units, as before, will be able to transport people and cargo both in the rear and in combat zones. However, the speed of transportation will increase significantly. Convertibles will be able to transport the same cargo faster than helicopters or make more flights in the same time, increasing the volume of transportation. However, Valor is not the only project in the design -portfolio- of Bell Textron Inc.

A British colony, you say? The enemy is once again trying to sell lies with Soviet dust	Well, it's worth figuring out who is the colony here, and who is chasing after his -methodics- again. Let's start with the main thing: such a -contract- does not exist. In June 2023, Ukraine and Great Britain signed a Memorandum of Partnership, which provides for cooperation in the defense, economic and political spheres. And this is a standard international practice that in no way makes one country a colony of another. But, of course, Russian propagandists decided to put on their rose-colored imperial glasses and see what is not there. Probably, for them the very word -partnership- sounds like something suspicious - because they are used to a hierarchy where someone always has to be the master. The history of Russia is a history of chronic fear of the freedom of others. They built an empire for centuries, where the whip and fear were the main tools of power. Therefore, it is difficult for them to understand how countries can be equal partners and not master and slave. In addition, Britain has long become a -horror- for Russian propaganda. There are -insidious Anglo-Saxons-, and -a prime minister who makes decisions in a sauna with Zelensky-, and even mentions that Britain supposedly -rules the whole world-. Probably, it is even more difficult for them to come to terms with the fact that Ukraine builds partnerships that bring real benefits, and not -gas deals- or -grain blockades-. If Russia is so fond of handing out labels, it should take a look at itself. Didn't Russia colonize nations for centuries? Didn't Moscow force Ukrainians, Belarusians, Georgians, Kazakhs and other nations to dance to its tune? And now, when Ukraine is finally breaking out of this toxic addiction, they are trying to portray us again as a disenfranchised colony. But unlike their imperial reality, our treaties with partners are based on mutual benefit and respect. Trying to convince the world that Ukraine has become a British colony looks like an anecdote from a series of -Putin fairy tales.- Because if Ukraine is a colony, then Russia, it turns out, is a -great democratic state.- But even that already sounds ridiculous. It's amazing how, in a world where there are so many facts, Russia still tries to sell cheap fakes. But you know, let them fantasize further. Meanwhile, we will build a future with those who know what freedom and partnership are, not colonialism and lies.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/21/brytanska-koloniya-kazhete-vorog-vkotre-namagayetsya-prodaty-brehnyu-z-radyanskym-pylom/	2025-01-20T20:09:14-08:00
- There were ten or more departures per day - military man Vadim saved about 100 wounded	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -I was working when the enemy surrounded Chernihiv. There were ten or more departures per day. Then the chairman did not think about how many people you brought,- Vadim noted. All these wounded servicemen were evacuated while the enemy was ravaging Chernihiv Oblast. He recalls one particular story that will forever remain in his memory. -In Chernihiv, the enemy fired at civilian infrastructure. One of the injured is a civilian man whose leg was torn off above the knee. Someone from the civilian or military applied a Soviet -Esmarch- tourniquet to him, and the man was taken to a military hospital&#8230; in the trunk of a civilian car,- Vadim recalls. When they opened the trunk, they saw that it was covered in blood. -They thought that the person was not alive. But I checked the pulse on the carotid artery - it was there,- the man said. He quickly took out a tourniquet from the first aid kit and put it on the wounded man. When he twisted the noose, the man screamed in pain. It was a sign that he was still fighting for his life. In the end, he was saved. As reported by ArmiyaInform, junior sergeant Bohdan with the call sign -White-, a pilot of the battalion of strike unmanned aircraft systems of the 38th Marine Corps Brigade, became a true symbol of accurate and merciless revenge on the occupiers. During his service, he sent about 250 Russian soldiers to hell. .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/vyyizdiv-bulo-i-desyat-i-bilshe-za-den-vijskovyj-vadym-vryatuvav-blyzko-100-poranenyh/	2025-01-20T11:51:28-08:00
A terminally ill father and a tearful story: a man from Kyiv was detained at the border with false d...	About this informs State Border Service of Ukraine. The men claimed they were on their way to visit relatives, and the son, who is a conscript, produced documents purporting to prove that his father was terminally ill and required constant care. However, the border guards discovered that the documents showed signs of forgery. They did not correspond to the official model and contained errors. Because of this, the Kyivan was refused to leave the border, and in his actions they see signs of a criminal offense under Art. 358 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine — -Forgery of documents or their use.- The State Border Service reminds of the futility of attempts to use forged documents when crossing the border. Thanks to modern inspection equipment and qualified personnel, border guards ensure reliable control and protection of the state border. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the ZSU and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/nevylikovno-hvoryj-batko-ta-slozlyva-istoriya-na-kordoni-zatrymaly-kyyanyna-z-falshyvymy-dokumentamy/	2025-01-20T11:31:21-08:00

According to him, the -Shershni Dovbush- unit works on one of the most difficult areas of the front, where Russian troops constantly carry out assaults and offensive actions. -In the Pokrovsky direction, they are coming in droves, constantly, but we can see them clearly and destroy them,- the commander notes. -Lyuty- emphasizes that his unit works non-stop: -Guys come from the road, immediately get to work, dig positions, arrange them and from the first day begin to perform tasks.

Oleg -Hera-: 10 years of war — from the defense of the Donetsk airport to the battles in Kurshchyna	The story of the fighter was published on January 20 on the brigade's page. -Ruins, smoke, constant sounds of explosions - Russian artillery, mortars, tanks were working on us. Sometimes it came to close combat. The enemy tried to destroy everything that was still intact. But we didn't give up,- Oleg recalls, talking about those difficult days. In 2014, after mobilization, Oleg returned from earning money abroad, where he worked as a welder at large infrastructure facilities. When the war began, he could not stay away and went to the Military Commissariat, where after a short training he was assigned to the 95th Airmobile Brigade, and later to the 90th Separate Airmobile Battalion. From the first days of his stay at the Donetsk airport, Oleg saw it destroyed and covered with smoke, as if from a picture of the apocalypse. Defense of the airport area became more and more difficult: lack of ammunition, food, water and constant cold. -The hardest thing was when we lost our brothers. It is the greatest pain when you realize that they no longer have a chance to survive,- shares the memories of -Hera-. Oleg's main task was to provide defense from the control tower, where the enemy repeatedly tried to break through. This point was key to controlling the airport. Then he not only led the defense, but also gave numerous commands, adjusting the fire of the mortar battery and destroying the enemy. Oleg does not forget his brothers who showed incredible courage during the defense of the airport. He mentions Ihor Branovytsky, who was captured while trying to help his seriously wounded comrades, and who was tortured for it. -He became a Hero of Ukraine posthumously,- says Oleg. Other heroes from DAP, such as Anatoly -Spartanets- Sviryd and Ruslan -Baghdad- Borovyk, had a great influence on Oleg. The -Spartan- was known for his courage and motivation for his brothers, and Ruslan, having released a photo book about the defense of DAP, became a symbol of struggle and resilience. -We have not surrendered the airport. Every meter of this territory cost the enemy dozens of their lives. We have shown that even in the most difficult conditions it is possible to remain invincible,- Oleg is confident. In the ten years that have passed since those events, Oleg has not stopped at what he has achieved. Despite the injury, disability and long years of rehabilitation after several operations, he returned to service. Today, he is the commander of a mortar battery unit and continues to destroy the enemy in the Kursk direction. -I want to say to those who are struggling right now: don't give up. We, the guys from DAP, held the defense when it seemed that we had no strength left. But we persevered. Your fortitude is your most powerful weapon,- adds the unit commander, talking about the continuous struggle for Ukraine. As reported by ArmiyaInform, Denys Gubernator, a former football player, after being wounded in the Donbass, decided to go into self-defense in order to return home and rest. After a year of rehabilitation and struggle with his own emotions, he realized that he could not leave his brothers at the front. Later he joined the -Charters- where his father serves.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/oleg-gera-10-rokiv-vijny-vid-zahystu-doneczkogo-aeroportu-do-boyiv-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-20T10:37:15-08:00

The Ministry of Defense has updated the system for checking the quality of property for the Armed Fo...	About the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported. To control the quality of material property received by servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Ministry of Defense uses an updated procedure for receiving it. According to the new algorithm, things that do not meet the requirements as a result of the inspection are returned to suppliers with reasoned remarks. Those, in their turn, should take into account the recommendations and return the material property already of appropriate quality. From December 2023, the Central Department of Quality Control began to change the system of acceptance of tangible property. When the new algorithm was just launched, between February and March 2024, 30-35% of products were returned to suppliers due to non-compliance. However, over the course of the year, thanks to the updated rules, the situation improved - and now this figure does not exceed 10%. -Providing the Armed Forces of Ukraine with quality property is not only a matter of standards, but also of trust in the state. The new approach to quality control creates transparent conditions that encourage suppliers to meet the highest standards. This is another step towards increasing the efficiency and fairness of the defense procurement system,- said Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. In December 2023, the procedure for checking property samples in testing laboratories was resumed. This made it possible to carry out a study of all indicators of raw materials and tangible property materials supplied under concluded contracts for the needs of the Armed Forces, and to identify the possible use of low-quality materials by suppliers for the manufacture of goods. In addition, the Ministry of Defense entered into an agreement with the British State watch fund, which finances the work of an independent laboratory to conduct a re-audit in case of suspicion of biased test results. Also, the Central Department of Quality Control has changed the place of acceptance of the property - it is delivered to the supply base and checked directly at the warehouses to avoid possible substitution. Previously, the supplier could deliver tangible property directly to the units after inspection at the factory. -The main task of the Central Quality Control Department was to create such conditions that would centrally prevent the participation of companies supplying low-quality property in tenders. This is possible only thanks to the creation of an evidence base,- said the head of the department Ihor Leshchenko. For the objectivity of the conclusions, the inspection is now not carried out individually, but by a collegial decision and is recorded on video. In case of violations, the video serves as an evidence base for both the manufacturer and law enforcement agencies. In addition, the introduction of a new algorithm for accepting tangible property is designed to prevent the pressure of interested parties on the bodies of the Ministry of Defense. The process is established by regulations and orders of the Ministry of Defense. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of will coordinate with the NATO Science and Technology Organization (NATO Science and Technology Organization — STO) research in the military field.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/minoborony-onovylo-systemu-perevirky-yakosti-rechovogo-majna-dlya-zbrojnyh-syl-ukrayiny/	2025-01-20T06:24:20-08:00

A bullet in the body — loyalty in the heart: the story of the border guard Vasyl -Virny-	The story of the fighter was publicized on the page of the State Security Service. -Defending one's country and family is everyone's duty,- Vernyy is convinced. He began his journey on the front line in Bakhmut, where his unit was sent to defend the city. Vasyl remembers how, in the first hours after his arrival, he had to go to the positions without even having the opportunity to rest. The enemy did not force himself to wait - in the evening, when complete darkness prevailed around him, he heard suspicious footsteps. It was dangerous to turn on the flashlight under the scope, so Vasyl acted on intuition and experience. -I heard someone approaching and realized it could be the enemy. -I started shooting, but before I had time to take a few steps, I was hit by five bullets,- says the border guard. Wounds in the back and buttocks could have been fatal, but Vasyl managed to survive thanks to the quick help of his brothers. A long rehabilitation, support of relatives and struggle with pain lay ahead. Vasyl does not hide that his wife and 12-year-old daughter, who are waiting for him at home, give him the most strength. They are his biggest motivation and reason not to give up. -If we do not defend the country, the enemy will come to our home. And we don't need that,- says Vasyl confidently. Today, -Virny- continues to serve in the rear support, helping the unit maintain combat capability and maintain morale. He remains faithful to his cause, his brothers and his native land. As reported by ArmyInform, on February 23, 2022, a serviceman of the TCC and SP of Kyiv region under the pseudonym -Pheasant- received a summons, first performed combat tasks in the Kyiv region, and then went to combat in the assault company in the 110th separate mechanized brigade in the name of Major General Mark Bezruchka.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/kulya-v-tili-viddanist-u-serczi-istoriya-prykordonnyka-vasylya-virnogo/	2025-01-20T03:31:43-08:00

Fake -farms-: the occupiers are trying to legalize pseudo-Cossackism	informs about this Center of National Resistance. Even last year, the Russian occupation administration appointed the first so-called chieftains, who headed the first Cossack cells in the TOT. However, all these cells are shams, because there are no participants except for the -chieftains-. Nevertheless, the Russians officially registered one of these associations, creating the so-called -Priazov Khutar Cossack Society-, which was headed by the repeatedly convicted marginal Viktor Plyashka. Note that all these gang formations, which the Russians are trying to legalize under the guise of -Cossacks-, have nothing to do with the Cossack heritage. This is just a typical Russian technique of appropriating and popularizing someone else's history.

Defense forces received more than 30 new models of small arms and grenade launchers in 2024	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informs about this. The list of codified samples includes pistols, machine guns, assault and sniper rifles produced by arms concerns of Germany, the Czech Republic, Belgium, the USA, etc. Among the samples of small arms approved for use are products of Ukrainian gunsmiths, in particular, a universal shotgun that can be used both against enemy infantry and against drones. -The level of the army's capabilities is assessed primarily by its arsenal of weapons. It is important not only the number of tanks, artillery systems, MLRS, but also what the infantry are armed with. New tools of war in the hands of our soldiers means more opportunities on the battlefield. Modern small arms and grenade launchers from the world's leading arms manufacturers and domestic gunsmiths allow our soldiers to shoot more accurately and hit the enemy at greater distances. Better characteristics of weapons, greater reliability are the factors on which both the results of combat missions and the lives of our soldiers depend,- said the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Ivan Havryliuk. Ukrainian servicemen who use small arms of Western production in combat conditions note its high efficiency. These weapon samples are distinguished by better accuracy and firing range. Soldiers also highly appreciate the ergonomics and ease of use of Western-made assault rifles and machine guns. In addition, Western-made assault rifles use 5.56 x 45 mm NATO cartridges, which have a higher bullet energy than the Soviet 5.45 x 39 mm small arms ammunition. And therefore, Western weapons have an advantage in killing action. Compared to Soviet or Russian models, the products of European or American gunsmiths are also distinguished by a much higher culture of factory execution. All grenade launchers codified during 2024 have NATO calibers of 40 and 84 mm. Among them are products of European and American arms concerns.

-Collect the frame-: as an actor and soldier, Maksym Devizorov helps veterans return to life	The guest of ArmiyaInform was the well-known Ukrainian actor Maksym Devizorov, who spoke about what motivated him to join the Defense Forces, how his acting experience helped during his service, and why it is important in the realities of war to continue to enrich Ukrainian cultural heritage. —What prompted you to join the ranks of the Armed Forces? — I was prompted by the call of my heart. I had no idea what I could do for the country at such a moment. We watched for several days what was going on. Then I could no longer marinate in it&#8230; From the first days I went to the TCC, I was told several times that they only take those who had combat experience. Then, with my friends and my girlfriend, we left for Lviv to send the girls abroad. Already there I registered, and when they asked who was ready to go to war, I immediately agreed. He immediately got into the 103rd separate territorial defense brigade named after Andrii Sheptytskyi. From the moment the battalions were formed, when all the recruits were still in civilian clothes, no one knew what they could do or what they could be useful for. However, we started training quite quickly and left for Donetsk within a month. My first position was a grenade launcher driver, it was even somewhat funny, because I have a license, but I was not a very confident driver at that time, I lacked experience. I studied here and there until I got a secondment at TRO-media, I was in the autorotat. - What moments on the firing line are most etched in your memory? -The brightest moment was on the first night in Pokrovsk. Then for the first time I saw this glow that did not stop. Of course, the moments when I lost my brothers are the ones that will be with me for the rest of my life. The first time we lost our brother in Donetsk region, then in the Kupyan direction three more of ours were missing. —How did your acting experience help you during your service? —My acting experience helped me record my appeal to volunteers. When it was necessary to ask them for help or to thank them, they immediately called me. In addition, he somehow -made a noise- in the technical education classes. We were then told to imagine that we were injured and had to put a tourniquet on, so I paid for my entire salary. Screamed, writhed in pain, saw how the boys even began to -catch the pale man- a little. These are such moments of humor, because there is no way without it. —Tell us about your service at TRO-media? What projects are you working on? —When I got there, we were preparing for the big festival -War in the Lens-. There were a lot of different projects. We shoot videos for a mobilization campaign, for recruiting, in addition to this, analytical programs. Currently, my main line of work is -Veterans Theater-. My brothers and I started such an initiative, where soldiers and veterans can come, learn to write plays, share their experiences in the circle of those who understand them. I personally consider this project very valuable, because it is not only therapeutic, but also cool texts come out of our military. These plays win various dramaturgy competitions, and are taken by directors to be staged in academic theaters. For example, Alina Sarnatska's play, A Combat Medic, will be played in the Zankovetska Theater next season. Volodymyr Tuka's play is already being staged in Kherson. We want to scale our project so that in every city there is a cell and those who feel the need to work through their pain through creativity. — You recently returned to the stage of the Theater on the Left Bank in the play -You can't go, you can't stay.- What feelings arose after such a long pause? - I breathed a sigh of relief, because for a long time I had been -mourning- myself that I could not return yet. Only then. when the war ends After all, I understood that at any moment the commander's combat order could come and I would have to go. However, as long as there is an opportunity to be in Kyiv, my colleagues asked me to somehow play together. I could no longer refuse, I somehow silenced these doubts and fears and left. It was very cool when my colleagues from the theater greeted me so warmly and showed such humane attitude. That's when we wanted to combine the -Veterans Theater- and the Theater on the Left Bank. I have become such a link through which this can be realized. Now we have launched the -Livy ++- project, that is, on the stage of -Livy- we will play performances of both the -Veterans' Theater- and other projects related to veterans, their rehabilitation, where they will be both actors and playwrights. —How do you manage to combine shooting in films and service? —When the situation became more or less clear to me, I agreed during the vacation to shoot the TV series -Cure from the Past-. There, I play a military man who has been injured and has lost his memory. Now this project has already been released. If sometimes it can be realized in short episodes, then this is a great joy for me, because I continue my service. We have prepared the New Year's movie -Train on December 31-, there I also play a soldier, I have a small appearance on the screen, but my brothers say that they are waiting and plan to go see this movie on vacation. - Do you plan to return to acting on a permanent basis after the war? -After the end of the war, we will tell the story of this war both on stage and on the screen. If we can adapt our -Veterans Theater- project to the needs of society and the market, I would very much like to continue doing it. Personally, it happened to me here that I was able to write and stage a play. Now I am organizing screenings of the play -Military Mom-, this is what drives me and helped me return to the idea that there is still a chance for a normal life. There were times when my friends said that this project was a turning point for them too, so for me it is real honey for the soul. And it will be cool if after the war it will also be possible to do this. - What is the main goal of the -Veterans Theater-? -The main goal of the -Veterans Theater- -is to build a dialogue between the veteran and the civilian. There is a lot of unspoken pain when many are stopped by the thought that no one needs it. For example, it's easier for me to live my experiences inside, I don't need to talk to someone, but to reflect on it alone. Therefore, the goal of this project is to help, so to speak, to -put together a frame- for our military and veterans in a circle of like-minded people who also went through all the horrors of war. Any possible manifestation of creative realization is the right path to yourself, first of all, to your healing. Someone may have done it before and now need a resource to resume this activity, and someone just needs to try it to understand if this activity is suitable for a person. And we are looking for different ways how this can be implemented. It would seem like the -Veterans Theater-, but we also organized an elective course in clay modeling. Personally, I have never done this, but when I got a small plate, a little strange, but still mine, I brought it home, put it there, and my heart loved to look at this beauty. - In your opinion, is it important to develop Ukrainian theater and cinema during the war? -It is extremely important to develop our art even during the war. We have been consuming pro-Russian content for a very long time in an incredible amount and this -warm bath- that everything will be fine has played an evil joke on us. Since the survival of our nation is now at stake, culture is an integral element of preserving our identity and statehood. Because of this, it is necessary to find an opportunity for the Ukrainian word and thought to be heard everywhere, including abroad, because otherwise everything will be tragic. - How did the war affect your relationships with family and friends? -Someone -dropped out-, on the contrary, relationships strengthened in the family. I have two brothers who also serve, we see each other very rarely, but there is already that unbreakable bond that is supported by our beliefs, that is, it gives us even more bricks in a strong family foundation. With friends, it is easier for me to communicate with those with whom I have a common experience. For almost 3 years, large-scale companies have lost touch with many, but this is life and we constantly have new companies, new partnerships.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/zibraty-ramu-yak-aktor-ta-voyin-maksym-devizorov-dopomagaye-veteranam-povernutysya-do-zhyttya/	2025-01-19T21:15:55-08:00

Advanced -stabik- with a cat in Donetsk region: why -the package of the wounded- is most needed near...	The stabilization point of the 2nd International Defense Legion of Ukraine was shown to ArmiyaInform by the head of the medical service of the 2nd International Defense Legion of Ukraine, senior lieutenant Mykhailo with the call sign -Engels- and paramedic Oleksiy with the call sign -Donatello-. He owes his nickname -Engels- to one of the senior officers, to whom Michael's beard reminded him of the famous German philosopher. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the soldier has gone from a soldier and a platoon combat medic to the head of the medical service of the 2nd International Defense Legion of Ukraine. On February 25, 2022, Mykhailo was mobilized as a soldier, but soon became a platoon combat medic. When it became known about his medical education, he graduated from the National Medical University named after O. AT. -Engels- from Bogomolets in Kyiv, a specialist in radiology, was appointed to the position of doctor of a medical center and promoted to the rank of officer. In the 2nd International Legion, the officer has been serving as the head of the medical service for a year and a half. The service had to be created from scratch, because when Mykhailo headed it, it had two drivers, two paramedics and no doctor. Therefore, the personnel issue had to be solved simultaneously with the establishment of material support. — Two paramedics, two drivers and zero doctors. And now we already have five doctors - a completely closed staff. To organize a medical service, first of all, people are needed. If there are people and people have the initiative, then everything will follow,- he says. Oleksiy -Donatello- adds that a lot depends on the head of the medical service, who is able to organize the work of the team and establish the necessary financial support almost -from scratch-. — I would say that an initiative nachmed is needed. At the moment when there was no Misha, there was almost nothing in the medical service either. The main thing the Legion could do then was try to engage with friendly organisms to help with the evacuation. There was one car, there were not enough crews, - stresses Oleksiy. He owes his nickname to the absence of several fingers on his hand, which makes his hand look like the limb of a ninja turtle from the famous series of comics and cartoons. With such a long-standing injury, Alexei could not serve, but he could not stand aside when his knowledge and skills were needed to save the lives of soldiers on the front lines. — It was still in my childhood, I already came to the war with an incomplete number of fingers. You may remember that my wife, who loves me very much, came up with the call sign. Who else would not have thought of it or dared, but she called it that, - jokes the doctor. Initially, the battalion medical service of the 2nd International Legion had to use the help and support of those military organizations to which the unit was attached, because their level of equipment and provision was much better. - Since we are a separate battalion, it is our -damned fate- to be assigned to someone forever. If we are attached to someone, it means we can use some resources of their organization, including medical services, Mykhailo explains. However, at present, thanks to the initiative of the commander and the staff of the battalion's medical service, the situation has changed, and already those military organizations to which the Legion is attached and interacts, have begun to use the established work of stabilization point 2 of the International Legion. - At the moment, the brigade to which we are assigned and all units have everything tied to this -stabic-. That is, now the brigade to which we are seconded works purely through us. And if you look at the map, then probably there is no such -stable- so close to the front anywhere else, - notes the head of the medical service. You can really get to -zero- from here in 10-15 minutes. However, such a quick evacuation of the wounded is possible only under ideal conditions, when the enemy shelling subsides and the activity of Russian drones in the air decreases. Then the injured person can be very quickly brought to the point, stabilize his condition and send him further to the hospital. - By the standards of how it could be and how it was - this is super close. In other subdivisions, it happens that it is necessary to drive an hour one way to the stabilization point. And this is taking into account that the front is not a straight line, and you still have to drive parallel along it to get to the positions, explains -Donatello-. Rapid delivery of the wounded simply from the positions to the stabilization point is one of the main advantages of the medical service of the 2nd International Legion. Medics emphasize that they managed to establish an evacuation mechanism at the grassroots level in such a way that everything can be done independently without the need to involve the resources of units. - We have specially equipped cars that can go there and pick up the wounded. We emphasize that we want to reduce the evacuation time. We are taking a risk, because now a lot of wounded cannot be evacuated from the positions when it is really necessary. The problem of overstretched tourniquets, tourniquet syndromes, and infected wounds has become acute. The advanced -stable point- allows you to avoid this, Mykhailo emphasizes. Shifting at the stabilization point is organized in three shifts, each of which works for three days. For the next three days, the members of the shift rest, after which they work in the battalion medical service for another three days. After that, back to the headquarters. — At the moment, we have three shifts of four people each: two doctors, a paramedic and a driver. If we have a wounded person, the driver and the paramedic go and pick him up from the position and bring him here. Next, two doctors stabilize the patient, and at this time the car is being prepared for further evacuation, says the head of the medical service. Previously, the shift was two-day shifts, but too frequent shifts could attract the attention of the enemy, so it was abandoned. There is a permanent -farm- on the -stabik- - a big black cat Boris, who does not go anywhere and helps take care of the premises and supports the wounded morally. Because sometimes, doctors joke, warming up, sipping on a -stick- of hot soup and petting a cat is no less important for patients than getting the necessary medical care. After all, the lightly wounded, who arrived from the positions, often did not have the opportunity to eat properly and warm up there. The medical service has several vehicles at its disposal - a bus, SUVs and even an American M113 armored personnel carrier, which, however, is currently under repair. All of them are necessary both for the evacuation of the wounded from the positions and for their subsequent delivery to the hospital. — What is good about wheeled machinery? The fact that it is easily repaired, has a better resource, is fast. But it is less passable. What is good -goose-? She's slower, but she's passable and has defense. However, at the same time, it attracts a lot of attention. Therefore, if we can drive quietly on an unarmored wheeled vehicle and without making a noise pick up the wounded person, this is the best option and we do it, -Engels- explains. — If we know that they are already waiting for us there in any case — it is necessary to do anything to pick up the wounded, and it is better to do it by riding a tracked vehicle, then we choose a tracked vehicle, -Donatello- adds. Soldiers can be sent from the headquarters to the hospital both in the transport of the medical service of the 2nd International Legion and in the vehicles of allies who are unable to evacuate the wounded from the front line, but can easily pick them up from the -stabik-. - Two doctors for one wounded person is quite enough. One works as an anesthesiologist, the other as a surgeon. -We are trying to provide help and stabilize the wounded as quickly as possible,- says -Engels-. Doctors can be joined at this time by a paramedic or a paramedic, who assist when working with a patient. Thus, three specialists can work with one wounded person at the same time. The main task at the headquarters is to stabilize the condition of the wounded so that he can get to the hospital normally. This journey can last from 30‒50 minutes to 1.5‒2 hours, and during this time nothing critical for the injured person's health should happen in the vehicle. — We do everything to ensure that the patient remains stable within an hour. This is our task. He gets to the hospital, and the full range of care is already provided there, which can be expanded, - explains the head of the medical service. In order to provide quality assistance, a stabilization point near the frontline must be properly equipped and provided with everything necessary. Several premises, of which at least one should be warm and electrified, access to water and electricity supply - if not from a fixed network, then at least from EcoFlow or a generator. — There should be a table on which to lay the wounded. There should be a basic set of consumables that are used. These are basic surgical items, basic anesthesia equipment, a ventilator, a laryngoscope, an oxygen concentrator, explains the head of the medical service Mykhailo. — This is a MARCH protocol at maximum speed. If with the MARCH protocol for a soldier, all this is put in one first-aid kit, then here it takes up a whole room. There is everything needed to stop the bleeding, everything to secure an airway, both non-surgical and surgical. Next, everything to restore blood circulation, including blood heaters, blood itself, solutions, Oleksiy tells and shows the equipment and consumables. Medics emphasize that deeper in the rear, literally an hour's drive from here, it is possible to set up a stab post with much greater capabilities, but the critical point is the time during which the wounded will be brought there. So it's much better to have a less equipped -stab- 15 minutes from the positions than a perfect one - an hour and a half. The most common are blast injuries and shrapnel injuries of the limbs, concussions and closed brain injuries are also common. Bullet wounds are much less common, but there is a lot of combat stress. — A year ago, most of our wounded were due to mortar attacks or RPGs, there were less frequent drops and AGS, now almost all injuries are the result of drops and FPV drone attacks. At the same time, the main fighters are injured when entering the position, because once they have reached the position, they are relatively safe there, but the way to enter the position is very difficult, says Oleksiy. Since the evacuation from the positions is carried out when there is power for it, not one but several wounded may arrive at the headquarters at the same time. Sometimes there can be even more than 10 - one or two severe, a few more moderate and most lightly wounded, with contusions or battle stress. — We sort them all, take them one by one and provide assistance. Up to ten at the same time are single cases. On average, 3-4 injured people arrive, one of them may be seriously injured - we provide him with assistance first. In parallel, we also work with others, depending on how dangerous their injuries are, says Mykhailo. A warehouse with consumables and other necessary things is organized in one of the premises of the stabilization point. Among the purely medical -consumers-, neatly folded civilian clothes - underpants, T-shirts, sweaters, sweatpants - attract attention. Nearby on the floor are several pairs of rubber slippers. — These are all clothes for the wounded. Almost all of them arrive in torn, wet, dirty clothes, covered in blood. To get to the wounds, we have to remove these clothes from them, cut them off. And our task is to prevent hypothermia, to warm patients - we need to dress them in something so that they are warm, dry and comfortable. Because if he puts all his wet clothes on himself again, he will never get warm, explains -Donatello-. Civilian clothing for the wounded is provided by volunteers to the medical service of the 2nd International Legion. They also hand over sets of adaptive clothing, which can be easily put on the injured person with the help of special Velcro fasteners. — I have already seen that there was a state initiative with the creation of the -Package of the Wounded-. I wonder who will be provided with them. Because if they will be provided directly in hospitals that are 30-40 kilometers from the front line, then, in my opinion, this is not super cool. It is necessary to provide the most advanced -stabiks-, where for the first time a person's clothes are cut off and something must be put on him immediately. This package, like all medical care, should be as close as possible to the front lines, Oleksiy emphasizes. — When a fighter enters the hospital, we immediately start to keep in touch with him. Since we have many foreigners in the Legion who are not familiar with the Ukrainian medical system, we have developed a guide for them in four languages ​​on what and how to do it, says the head of the medical service. A sign in four languages ​​- in Ukrainian, English, Spanish and Portuguese - should help an injured foreigner not to get confused and lost. By constantly maintaining contact with the medical service, he is guaranteed to receive all necessary medical care and statutory compensation for injuries. - As soon as the wounded leaves us for the hospital, we call the representative of his company - the foreman or chief sergeant. They pack his backpack with his things - documents, phone, clothes - and take them to him so that he has all the necessary things and can travel with them, says the medic. The most important thing, he emphasizes, is for the wounded to have a phone with him and to be in contact with the unit. Then it will be possible to prepare and send him all the necessary documentation, as well as visit the fighter during treatment and rehabilitation. — Representatives of the medical service and representatives of the Legion regularly visit the wounded. It is very important to have contact with them, because in hospitals in Ukraine, usually few people speak English, and even more so, almost no one speaks Spanish or Portuguese. We try to take care of our fighters at all stages, Mykhailo emphasizes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/peredovyj-stabik-z-kotom-na-donechchyni-chomu-pakunok-poranenogo-najpotribnishyj-poblyzu-nulya/	2025-01-19T20:39:53-08:00
Modernization will increase lethality: the high-tech destroyer of the US Navy will be equipped with ...	As informs the portal of the US Naval Institute, the work carried out will allow -Zumwalt- to remain one of the most technologically advanced and deadly ships in the US Navy, ArmyInform reports. Work, which began last August and is expected to run through 2025, is underway at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi. As reported by the press service of the US Navy, the ship will be equipped with Conventional Prompt Strike hypersonic systems. This retrofit involves replacing the original Advanced Gun System (AGS) with four large-caliber missile launchers, each carrying three hypersonic missiles, for a total salvo of 12 missiles. Experts at the defense site at Army Recognition said that Ingalls Shipbuilding's Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) division played a significant role in the modernization of destroyers of the Zumwalt type. On August 29, 2023, a $154.8 million contract was awarded for the modernization of the USS Zumwalt (DDG 1000), including the integration of a conventional rapid strike weapon system (CPS). This project follows previous contracts, including $10.5 million in January 2023 for planned modernization of USS Zumwalt and USS Michael Monsoor (DDG 1001). HII was also involved in equipping Zumwalt-class destroyers with advanced Mk 57 vertical launch systems under a $74 million contract awarded in April 2024. Leveraging nearly $1 billion in infrastructure investments, HII continues to improve the combat capabilities and technological sophistication of these U.S. Navy stealth warships. The Conventional Operational Strike (CPS) program, originally called Rapid Global Strike, is designed to give the United States the ability to launch high-precision conventional strikes around the world within one hour. CPS uses technologies such as hypersonic gliders and surface, air and underwater missile platforms. Potential delivery systems include missiles similar to intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), hypersonic cruise missiles and kinetic weapons launched from orbit. A key objective is to consider rapid response and capability scenarios other than nuclear strikes. Test milestones include the flight of the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon in 2011, the Common Hypersonic Glide Body tested in 2020, and integration plans for Zumwalt destroyers in 2024. Design measures are aimed at distinguishing CPS from nuclear systems to reduce the risk of misinterpretation by adversaries. Numerous defense enterprises are participating in the CPS modernization program. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor responsible for final assembly of the rocket, which takes place in Cortland, Alabama, integrating components manufactured by Northrop Grumman and Dynetics. Northrop Grumman is building the rocket boosters and the payload module, while Dynetics is building the hypersonic glider. Program funding and oversight is managed by the DDG-1000 Program Office. However, the cost of these systems is causing some concern in the US. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the production and maintenance of 300 hypersonic missiles over 20 years could cost nearly $18 billion, an average of $60 million per missile. Critics say the costs could exceed the value of many potential targets. Proponents object, insisting that hypersonic weapons extend operational range and accuracy beyond the reach of conventional systems, providing an advantage in contested environments. USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) is a guided-missile destroyer and the flagship of her class, named after Admiral Elmo Zumwalt. She has a displacement of 14,564 tons, is 600 feet long and is powered by an integrated power system that generates 78 MW, giving her a speed of 33.5 knots. Initially, such vessels were equipped with two 155 mm advanced gun systems designed for long-range land-based projectiles, but the abolition of the use of land-based ammunition removed the guns from the armament arsenal, leading to a transition from land attacks to surface warfare. The vessel has 80 Mk 57 Peripheral Vertical Launch System cells for various missiles, a radar cross-section designed to reduce detection, and an automation-oriented design for a smaller crew. Entered into service in 2016, the Zumwalt has undergone a variety of modifications, including the planned replacement of Advanced Gun Systems with hypersonic missile launch systems during a modernization period beginning in 2023. Zumwalt-type destroyers were conceived in the United States under the DD-21 program, launched in the 1990s, as a 21st-century solution to naval fire support previously performed by battleships. The program aimed to develop multi-role warships with a focus on land attack, surface warfare, and reduced radar detection, consistent with mandates from the US Congress to increase naval firepower. Due to rising costs and changing military priorities, the program was transformed into the DD(X) initiative, and the number of ships planned for construction was reduced from 32 to 3. At an estimated total program cost of $22.5 billion, the Zumwalt class of destroyers represents the transition to smaller, more technologically integrated fleets, as well as an attempt to balance technological innovation with fiscal and operational problems and a global race for hypersonic supremacy. In fact, hypersonic capabilities are now considered necessary by the United States to maintain strategic parity with rivals such as Russia and China, which have made significant advances in this area. China tested its DF-ZF hypersonic glider between 2014 and 2016, which is reported to be in service by 2019, along with other hypersonic weapons such as the DF-27 and YJ-21. Russia is developing similar technologies, including the Avangard hypersonic weapon system, which went into mass production in 2018, and the Oreshnik, recently used against Ukraine. In turn, it is reported that, according to the planned schedule, the first full-scale deployment of the Zumwalt should take place in the last months of 2026 or at the beginning of 2027. This major event will take place under the control of the US 7th Fleet and the US Indo-Pacific Command, confirming their leadership in this strategic step.

Day of commemoration of defenders of Donetsk airport: the second birthday of combatant Alex	The Day of Honoring the Defenders of Donetsk Airport in the system of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is celebrated annually on January 20. The defense of Donetsk airport is thousands of stories of bravery and exploits, front-line brotherhood and mutual aid. ArmiyaInform offers its readers today the memoirs of Doctor of Historical Sciences, senior lieutenant of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yevhen Lunyak. He defended DAP as part of the 1st tank brigade. The commander of his brigade at that time was the legendary tank driver -Adam- - Yevhen Mezhevikin, Hero of Ukraine. Today, Yevhen Lunyak, who continues to defend Ukraine, has prepared for publication the book -Front stories from Donbas-, which will soon be published in one of the capital's publishing houses. This is a collection of real stories collected by the author during the tragic and at the same time heroic vicissitudes of the modern Russian-Ukrainian war since 2014. until today. Evgeny Lunyak is a direct participant in most of the described events. The book will also include these stories&#8230; On November 30, 2014, in the midst of heavy fighting for the Donetsk airport, the 5th company of the legendary -cyborg- tankers of the 1st Separate Guards Tank Brigade (as it was called at the time) was tasked with going to the airport to fire at separatist positions in the old terminal and provide support to our DAP defenders. The departure was planned by the forces of four tanks (1st and 93rd brigades) under the command of Kombat Adam, Kombat Alex, Sturman and Company Commander Vano. At that time, the 5th tank company of 40 people had already lost 4 soldiers killed (Volodymyr Kundenko, Stanislav Krivonos, Yuriy Kostyuchenko, Volodymyr Titarchuk), 1 missing (Yevgen Savenko), more than 10 people were wounded, contused and injured. . 3 tanks were lost in DAP, 5 more combat vehicles were seriously damaged. Alex and Vano's crews were almost all officers. The tankers were hunted. The road to the DAP was now strewn with mines and closely monitored by the separatists. Unfortunately for our tankers, snow dusted the ground - and now anti-tank mines were completely invisible. Adam's tank went first, followed by Alex's tank, then Navigator, and last was Vano. As it turned out, Adam's tank drove through a dangerous area on the approach to the DAP. Alex was less fortunate. His tank hit a mine at the edge of the left track. According to the recollections of Vano, whose tank was riding behind, the left part of the 40-ton front combat vehicle was thrown into the air more than a meter, after which the tank fell, losing the ability to move, the front part was completely damaged. The commander of the tank Alex and his crew survived, you can say that they were born in a shirt, but all three received injuries. It was decided to continue the operation with Adam's crew, joined by Sturman, and evacuate Alex's damaged tank and crew, which Sturman and then Vano successfully did with their men. Since then, Alex and his friends (San Sanich and Tolyan) have remembered the date of this departure, when they were lucky to survive. They said that this day was their second birthday. The circling of the Terminator at the airport in our locations around Donetsk was talked about a lot and retold as a military anecdote or an anecdote, without knowing for sure the actors and the circumstances of the event. It was one of the night trips to the airport from Pisyk. I was told about this episode of the fighting for the airport by its participants, including the Terminator himself. Adam, Rotny and Terminator tanks participated in that visit. The tank of the latter, which according to the front line tradition bore its own name -Barsik-, was supposed to remain at the beginning of the runway to provide cover for a large convoy that was supposed to deliver food, weapons and medicine to the defenders of the old and new terminals. It seems that the plan was quite simple and straightforward. However, for some reason, -Barsik- began to operate according to a different program, which led to a great commotion in the separatist locations, not least because of the unpredictability and incomprehensibility of this tank's actions. Of course, as soon as the convoy began to approach the airport, the fighters of -Novorossiya- prepared for a fire attack on the objects that were on the runway. Their fire increased and became more accurate, but this time could not seriously damage our armored vehicles. As the three tanks successfully completed their task of escorting the column and turned around to return to base, Terminator's terrified voice came over the walkie-talkie: -Guys, I'm lost! I can't see anything!- -Barsyk- began to maneuver here and there along the runway. He sometimes approached the positions of the separatists, then moved away from them. Of course, they opened fire with all available weapons, but, fortunately, they could not cause serious damage to either the tank or the crew. -Guys, where am I?- - the Terminator's confused voice continued to shout over the walkie-talkie. It seemed to him that his tank was being pushed from all sides, and he did not know at all where he should go to leave the airport. It became obvious that -Barsik- had lost its way and could become the prey of the enemy, and its crew would face a sad fate. Adam, whose tank had already left the airport, commanded: -Barsik-, look, now we will give a line of tracers from a machine gun. Go to the tracers!- However, as the Terminator himself recalled, he saw these bullets from different sides, because the separatists also fired them. So I didn't know where to go. The Terminator kept asking for directions. His tank drove chaotically down the runway. Rotny ordered his mechanic Slavik to turn on the headlight on the tank. At the same time, he himself opened the hatch to look around. It was very risky, and how to find a lost tank with a frightened crew otherwise, he simply had no idea. However, the Terminator never saw the light of the headlights flashing from Rotny's tank. Adam gave him another clue. These were the lights of Donetsk at night. He used to say: -Look where the city is lit up and drive in the opposite direction.- However, the Terminator said that he could not see the lights of this metropolis either. Apparently, he was already in despair. But then Rotny, whose tank was just leaving the runway, had a life-saving idea. He asked the Terminator over the walkie-talkie if he could see the moon in the sky. The Terminator opened the hatch and saw the moon, which he happily informed Rotno. -Let the moon look in your eyes! Go straight!- — a new order came from Rotny. At that moment, the Terminator said that a tank had just passed him. It became clear to Rotny that his tank had passed Barsyk, which was at the beginning of the runway, and therefore quite far from enemy positions. Rotny ordered Slavik to turn back, drive up to -Barsik- and turn on the headlights. Now the Terminator saw Company's tank and confidently followed it to the base. Such circling around the airport caused the anger of Slavik, who was ready to give the Terminator a hard time, who, due to his own indolence, put his comrades in danger. However, first of all, Rotny said that in battle everyone can get lost and no one is immune to it. Secondly, the driver-mechanic of -Barsyk- Seryoh assured that he himself -got through-, although he had already been to the airport many times, but this time he was confused and could not find his way around. In the end, the Terminator and his adventures began to be ridiculed, which caused him a great mental battle. Terminator even moved to live in the locations of fighters of another brigade and did not come to the table of his company, experiencing such a failure, which, thanks to fate, ended happily. It was in this state that I found the Terminator a few days later in the Sands, he was glad of my arrival and the fact that I always treated him with respect and often called him by his first name and patronymic. Later, by order of Rotny, the Terminator moved to Tonenko. I think it was absolutely the right decision, and no one made fun of him here, and he was able to show himself well in household affairs, especially those related to cooking. *** Today, bloody battles on a scale that Europe has not seen since the Second World War continue in Donetsk region. In 2015, DAP became the symbol of the defense of Donetsk region against the Russian invaders, and now legends are being born in other cities of Donetsk region, where Ukrainian defenders are showing examples of resilience and courage to the whole world.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/den-vshanuvannya-zahysnykiv-doneczkogo-aeroportu-drugyj-den-narodzhennya-kombata-aleksa/	2025-01-19T20:17:56-08:00
Lies to order: propaganda invented a GUR sniper who shoots pensioners near Pokrovsk	In pro-Russian telegram channels and mass media, a video began to be widely distributed, where a supposedly Ukrainian sniper from the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine shoots civilians - elderly people who were walking on the road near Pokrovsk. The -news- emphasizes that this is a -special intimidation tactic- by the Armed Forces. To enhance the effect, the video was accompanied by -expert- comments from people with zero combat experience, but with the high rank of couch analysts. And, of course, all this is served under the sauce: -Look what they're doing!- 1. There is no evidence of the authenticity of the video. The video was shot as if it were another computer game. The angles are strange, the shot is blurry, and the moment of the shot is cut. For some reason, the camera -accidentally- ends up exactly where it needs to be. This is the typical handwriting of Russian propagandists, who still think that blurred shots add drama. 2. No geolocation. There are no location links on the video. No characteristic landmarks, no signs, no names of settlements. It seems that -Pokrovsk- appeared in this story by chance, or because the map of Donetsk region in the Kremlin ends with two or three familiar cities. 3. The GUR does not engage in such operations. The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is an elite unit that carries out strategic tasks, not contrived actions of intimidation against civilians. Such -plots- can look believable only in Russian TV series, where logic has long been buried. 4. The people in the video do not look like civilians. The appearance of the -victims- raises many questions. The clothes are unnaturally new, the posture is confident, and the movements are too coordinated for elderly people who are supposedly going to a war zone. Perhaps these are the same -actors- who portrayed Ukrainian refugees from infiltration camps? 5. Stage shooting. The shots do not have any signs of actual shooting. There is no reload sound or realistic recoil. But there is a suspicious smoke and the learned movements of the -sniper-, who looks more like an actor with military props. 1. Denigrate GUR. Ukrainian special forces have already become a symbol of efficiency and strength. Therefore, the enemy is trying to label them as -killers of civilians-. Although the Russians themselves are shelling peaceful cities and villages of Ukraine every day. 2. To justify their crimes. By creating such fakes, the Kremlin is trying to divert attention from the real crimes of the Russian army. Like, -and you look at what the Ukrainians are doing.- It's a classic trick to blame the victim for his own sins. 3. To sow panic among civilians. Russian propaganda is counting on the fact that such videos will cause fear and hatred among the residents of the frontline areas. They need to divide Ukrainians, to fuel distrust of the army. But with this quality of -cinema- it is unlikely to work. The fake about the -GUR sniper- near Pokrovsk is another attempt by Russian propaganda to denigrate Ukraine. But even in this they lacked imagination and skill. But another primitive film was released for the domestic consumer, who still believes that Ukrainians are fighting to -intimidate the Russians-. And we are just fighting for our land. And while the Russians are mounting their productions, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are really working. And, believe me, it is far from pensioners.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/brehnya-na-zamovlennya-rospropaganda-vygadala-snajpera-gur-shho-rozstrilyuye-pensioneriv-pid-pokrovskom/	2025-01-19T20:08:42-08:00

It is noted that the enemy is trying with all its might to displace Ukrainian fighters in Kurshchyna. Russian troops change their tactics often — from small enemy groups to convoys of equipment. -They were headed for the replenishment -to the vans- - but the FPV 47 -Magura- brigade sent them straight to hell. Destroyed APCs, tanks, BMPs, ATVs, KamAZs, holes and dugouts where the Russians were hiding - this is the result of the work of three FPV crews in three days in Kurshchyna,- defenders of Ukraine commented. As reported ArmyInform, aerial reconnaissance of the 3rd mechanized battalion of the 47th brigade noticed in time and destroyed a group of Russian soldiers who were preparing for an assault .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/na-kurshhyni-vorozha-grupa-pryamuvala-dlya-pidkriplennya-rosiyan-ale-yiyi-likviduvaly-bijczi-magury/	2025-01-19T10:57:50-08:00
The President of Ukraine and the First Lady honored wounded Ukrainian soldiers with state awards	About this January 19 informs Office of the President. In particular, this medical facility currently provides assistance to military personnel who fought in the Pokrovsk Region and in the Kharkiv region, as well as participated in the Kursk operation. Volodymyr Zelenskyi thanked the soldiers for the defense of Ukraine and awarded them with the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky III degree, the orders -For Courage- III degree, as well as the medals -For Military Service to Ukraine- and -Defender of the Fatherland-. -We want to thank you for protecting our state and our people. For service in various areas. All directions are important, and you were on the most difficult. You are our heroes, we are very grateful to all of you,- the President emphasized. Also, he and the First Lady together with the Minister of Veterans Affairs Natalia Kalmykova met with representatives of the Medical Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and military psychologists. The participants of the meeting noted positive changes in the field of mental health in the military sector. In particular, the specialty of psychologist has appeared, combat stress control groups have started working, psychological rehabilitation departments and offices in military medical clinical centers and hospitals have been developed, clinical psychologist positions have been introduced. Olena Zelenska noted that, according to a survey by the Ukrainian Veterans' Fund of the Ministry of Veterans, psycho-emotional instability among military personnel is considered a very likely challenge after returning from service by more than half of future veterans and veterans — 52.6%. -We need to work on making the aid comprehensive. For example, so that it covers both wounded servicemen and their family members in hospitals, as well as medical personnel who work in a constant stressful environment,- she noted. In addition, the President and his wife got acquainted with the project of creating barrier-free routes in the cities of Ukraine -Movement without barriers-, which is being implemented by the Ministry of Community and Territorial Development as part of Olena Zelenska's initiative. During this year, barrier-free routes with convenient entrances and approaches, transport, stops, sidewalks, public places will gradually appear in 12 cities and towns: in Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipro, Zhytomyr, Kropyvnytskyi, Lviv, Rivne, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Slavutychi, Ternopil, Buchi and Opishny. -Of course, the state and communities here cannot do without the cooperation of all objects on these routes — and this includes, in particular, businesses that are or will be included in our -Business Without Barriers- community: retail chains, banks, other institutions are already changing towards users and, we hope, will help smaller businesses do the same,- the First Lady concluded. As reported by ArmyInform, to implement the decision of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the troops complex group of the General headquarters headed by the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Oleg Apostol.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/prezydent-ukrayiny-j-persha-ledi-vidznachyly-poranenyh-ukrayinskyh-voyiniv-derzhavnymy-nagorodamy/	2025-01-19T10:36:05-08:00

The group is currently working in the 156th Separate Mechanized Brigade. The purpose of the work is to check the progress of the formation of the brigade and provide comprehensive assistance in matters of organization and preparation for combat operations. -Currently, the military unit has completed additional staffing and started basic general military training according to the updated program,- the statement said. At the same time, the selection of personnel for professional training is carried out. The supply of weapons and military equipment continues according to the plan. It was noted that during the inspection a number of significant deficiencies were identified, for the elimination of which tasks were assigned to the Commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In particular, regarding: -It should be noted that the mistakes that occurred during the formation and training of the 155th Anna of Kyiv Brigade have been taken into account, and measures are being taken to prevent them from happening in the future,- the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said. The General Staff Group will continue to operate in the 156th Separate Mechanized Brigade. -The command of the Armed Forces promptly responds to the problems of military units and provides comprehensive assistance to increase their combat capability and improve the motivation of servicemen,- the General Staff of the Armed Forces emphasized. Special attention is paid to the replenishment of combat brigades, which are engaged in intensive battles with the Russian invaders, with trained personnel. As reported by ArmyInform, on January 5, the issue of the 155th brigade was considered at monthly meeting of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces with commanders of unmanned aerial units systems and radio-electronic warfare. General Oleksandr Syrskyi paid particular attention to building the capabilities of the unmanned systems unit of the 155th mechanized brigade, as well as to problematic issues that need to be resolved.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/kompleksna-grupa-genshtabu-zsu-na-choli-z-olegom-apostolom-pereviryaye-hid-formuvannya-156-brygady/	2025-01-19T09:33:27-08:00
The spokesman of the Navy said whether Ukraine is threatened by Russian missile carriers that are in...	About it in broadcast of the national telethon -Edyni Novyni- on Sunday, 19 January, Navy spokesman Dmytro Pletenchuk said. -All the same, they will take out something for the protection of the base point. And, of course, we are monitoring this situation. We see everything that is happening,- Dmytro Pletenchuk said. To a journalist's request to explain what the connection is between the fact that Russia is taking missile carriers to the Black Sea and the fact that the launches will actually take place, the spokesman for the Navy answered as follows: -Here you always have to look up, because they are usually used during mass strikes together with other weapons systems: strategic aviation, OTRK, sea carriers of cruise missiles. And it is also necessary to look at the number: if we see more than one unit in the sea, and we know that an attack from the air is being prepared, for example, then, accordingly, we can count on the fact that, most likely, ships will also be used,- he says Dmytro Pletenchuk. The presenter also drew attention to the fact that the daily reports also include Russian missile carriers that are in the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore, the spokesman of the Navy explained why these ships are recorded and whether there were launches from the Mediterranean Sea: -The danger must be considered as always present. And this water area is the closest to us, and the Azov-Black Sea region and the Mediterranean Sea are interconnected. Of course, no launches were made. It should not be forgotten that the airspace of NATO member countries is in the path of tracking these missiles. Regardless of how they decide to use these missiles, this space is the sovereign territory of these states and it can be considered an attack on these states. Therefore, as a rule, they do not dare to resort to such actions, but it is also necessary to take this into account, because it is a danger,'' Dmytro Pletenchuk emphasized. As ArmyInform wrote, ships of the Russians are not allowed to their only foreign naval base in Tartus, which is in Syria, and they are forced to drift in the Mediterranean Sea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/rechnyk-vms-rozpoviv-chy-zagrozhuyut-ukrayini-rosijski-raketonosiyi-yaki-perebuvayut-v-seredzemnomu-mori/	2025-01-19T09:05:14-08:00
Oleksandr Syrsky commented on the transfer of Air Force specialists to other branches and types of t...	He told this in an interview with Andrii Tsaplienko. -First of all, there is my order, which prohibits the transfer of highly qualified personnel who have undergone training and who specialize in aircraft maintenance.

According to him, at the same time, Ukraine needs personnel at the front. He emphasized that it is necessary to increase the number of people in mechanized brigades. -Unfortunately, mobilization possibilities do not cover this need.

- They do not have the resources to throw everything with meat - how the tactics of the Russians in ...	Major Viktor Tregubov, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, stated this on January 19 on the air of -Suspilne Novosti-. -Even in the Toretsk direction, we observed how people were driven to the fortifications with mines in their hands so that they would throw them with their hands at the positions of the Ukrainians, but in the case of Pokrovsk, we see that they are no longer going head-to-head,- he said. According to the spokesman of the -Khortytsia- OSUV, due to a lack of personnel, the Russians are trying to enter the city from the western side. -They understand that now they no longer have the resources that would allow them to fill everything with meat, flood Pokrovsk with waves of meat, as they once flooded Mariupol. We have come to the moment when the Russians for the first time, maybe since the war, did not have enough meat to just throw people around, to make a mat of people, on which the next ones walk,- he explained. According to Viktor Tregubov, this means that the occupiers have certain problems with their own resource, which seemed inexhaustible to them. Now the troops of the Russian Federation are beginning to fight more thoughtfully and economically from the point of view of personnel. We will remind, on average, 50-60 clashes per day take place in the Pokrovsky direction. The enemy trying to bypass Pokrovsk from the western side to capture the city.

Pictures with their own history: the exhibition project - Airport opened in Kyiv. 242-	These are 24 works by the artist, volunteer, military serviceman Oleg Drobotskyi with the nickname -Artist-. He died in the spring of 2023 during the fighting in the Bakhmut district. Oleg Drobotsky created his paintings based on the photos of the famous journalist and photographer, author of the book -Airport- Serhiy Loik. And these pictures already have their own story. Three of them survived the occupation in Kherson: there they were hidden by Ukrainian patriots, and after the liberation of the city, they were transferred to the author's homeland. Oleh Drobotsky's parents, Mr. Igor and Mrs. Olga, were present at the opening of the exhibition on the eve of the Day of Remembrance of DAP defenders. According to his father, the idea to create a series of paintings based on the motifs of Serhiy Loiko's photographs originated in the -Artist- nine years ago. Since then, the exhibition has been in 10 regions of Ukraine - when its author was still alive. Mr. Igor also recalled that his son was killed when the Russians launched massive artillery fire at the position of the 67th Brigade. -Do you know what the soldiers of this brigade were like?... They were simply deranged. Strong They may have been inspired by the feat of the cyborgs and defeated the enemy with their motivation alone. The cyborgs had a crazy motivation, which was later imitated by the defenders of Azovstal, Bakhmut and other cities, who steadfastly held the defense,- says Mr. Igor. Also at the opening were representatives of law enforcement and law enforcement agencies, in particular, Minister of Veterans Affairs Nataliya Kalmykova. -When we talk about military and patriotic education, all the words sound quite formal. But it is precisely in such places, when we come and have the opportunity to touch the work of those who protected, defended, created - this is the living realization of military-patriotic education. In 2014-2015, DAP became a symbol of indomitability. Many of those who were then 12-13 years old are now defending the country in the ranks of the Armed Forces. And I am sure that it was the feat of cyborgs that became an example for each of these young men, a seed that later grew into powerful patriotism. Patriotism cannot be legislated or somehow created - it can only be woven through art, personal example. And today, unfortunately, every family has an example of a defender nearby,- Nataliya Kalmykova said during her welcoming speech. And the deputy head of the Department of Humanitarian Support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Oleksiy Serhiyenko, drew attention to the tenacity of the Ukrainian struggle for independence: -Every day, our soldiers demonstrate heroism and courage. The most important thing that unites our soldiers for centuries is that we never tire of defending our land, our Ukraine. And not once during all the historical battles have we encroached on other lands. And the whole world and the aggressor understand this. But our strength is enough. Our soldiers prove this every day. Today, as we stand in this hall honoring the heroism of cyborgs, our warriors are fighting under the whistling of bullets, shells, in danger, dying. And it is our sacred duty to remember everyone. And we will take revenge for each of our dead, for the grief of each family,- Oleksiy Sergienko said. A small impromptu musical performance was performed by Taras Topolei, the frontman of the -Antitila- band, who also joined the ranks of the Defense Forces at the beginning of the large-scale invasion. -Today we honor those who set an example of what is right. An example of how it works. How it should be done,- said Taras Topolya. Project -Airport. 242- was initiated by Iryna Zubkova, the sister of the Hero of Ukraine -cyborg- Ivan Zubkov, the organizer and founder of the annual commemoration and honoring of fallen -cyborgs-. -My brother as a commander and officer did not betray his oath to the end, stayed with his guys until the last minute at the Donetsk airport and died with them. When he was leaving our parents' yard, his mother said to him: -Vanya, you can die, you have two children.- And he answered: -Mom, I'm not the one to decide.- But it&#8230; I have you, my family.- And, perhaps, I bear the memory of not only my brother, but also those legendary soldiers who really volunteered and fulfilled their military and human duty to the end,- said Iryna Zubkova. Died on March 6, 2023 in the fighting near the village of Orihovo-Vasylivka, Bakhmut district, Donetsk region. Everyone will have the opportunity to view the exhibition within a month. The exhibition was held with the support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Department of Humanitarian Support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the Ternopil Regional Organization of the Right Sector political party, the Commander of the Operational Command -West- of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Brigadier General Volodymyr Shvedyuk , Oleg Kuzminykh (commander of the 90th separate airmobile battalion of the 81st separate airmobile brigade of the Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 2014-2015), volunteer Ivanna Yereyska, parents of Oleh Drobotskyi.

Roman Kachur will head the Sahaidachny National Academy of Ground Forces: what is known about him	Hero of Ukraine Colonel Roman Kachur was previously the commander of the 55th separate artillery brigade -Zaporizka Sich-. In 2022, the correspondent of ArmiyaInform recorded an interview with him, we suggest that he be recalled on the occasion of his new appointment. artillery-. Such feedback should be earned. As the combrig says about himself, -my hobby has combined with my professional activity. There are such lucky ones, and I am one of them. I love artillery, I do it, I do everything for its development at my level. The 55th Brigade sets the pace for the development of the artillery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. All of the commander's awards are a credit to his team. This is the reverse process. The commander forms, teaches the team, sets the vector of movement.- Roman Kachur was born in the Sumy region, after school he entered the Sumy Institute of Rocket Forces and Artillery named after Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, who graduated in 2005. Since childhood, he dreamed of doing real men's work. He is from a new generation of Ukrainian officers, from those who never served a single day in the Soviet army. From 2014 to March 2018, he performed combat tasks as the chief of artillery of the 81st separate air mobile brigade. From March 2018 to the present, he is the commander of the 55th separate artillery brigade -Zaporizka Sich-. He considers trained personnel, weapons and military equipment to be the key to success. He speaks briefly about the training of his subordinates: - Day and night, at any time of the year and in any weather, we prepared for the active phase of the war. The preparation paid off. The high morale of the trained combat personnel, who have fully mastered military work, their artillery systems and means of reconnaissance, became the key to success, stopping the enemy in all directions and defeating him. Artillery is a collective kind of troops, collective work, so here the question is not about the sergeant or the soldier, but about the collective, the calculation of the gun, the means of artillery reconnaissance - everything works in a complex. Yes, in our work we combine NATO complexes with still Soviet developments of the system, and we also use the latest Ukrainian developments. About half of the personnel of the brigade - with the experience of the first phase of the war, for the rest - the -hot phase- began now, in February 2022. On more than one occasion, the Zaporizhia Sich gunners were among the winners of the competition for the best artillery (mortar, mounted, self-propelled, rocket, anti-tank) battery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Regarding the requirements for subordinates in war, the brigadier confidently answers: - The requirements for subordinates are simple: honesty, decency, constant improvement of their professional skills and level of physical training. Well, to keep the high rank of soldier of the 55th brigade. Our units carry out round-the-clock fire damage to the enemy who set foot on our land, destroy the opponent. I do not follow the enemy's behavior. To me they are all whole, their behavior doesn't matter, they will all be destroyed. Units of the 55th brigade do not experience problems from the enemy's artillery. It also speaks to our training. We dictate our conditions for artillery duels, and as a result, the enemy withdraws his forces to longer ranges. The enemy is afraid of us. Now there is such a tendency that we begin to seek him out, lure him in order to impress him. To my question: -What was the most difficult thing for you personally from February 24 to today?-, Roman Volodymyrovych emphasizes: -There is nothing difficult except for the combat losses of comrades.- We do our work qualitatively and we enjoy it. Currently, we have received weapons from Western partners. It is already in operation, used for its intended purpose. The soldiers of the brigade master it in a very short time, up to one day, it is realistic. The latest samples are effective, only positive reviews. These are the French CAESAR and the American M777. We hit all possible targets, without exception: from the front edge to deep positions. Constantly, in which order we detect and destroy, in non-stop mode. We give priority to the enemy's artillery - so that it does not interfere with the destruction of the infantry, the destruction of strongholds, areas of concentration. We logically build a sequence of fire damage and -break them into molecules.- I have no doubts about the power of our brigade and the final victory of Ukraine over Russia in this war. Once and for all.

The Armed Forces explained why the number of women willing to join the army has increased	told the recruiting representative of the 141st OMBR motorized infantry battalion Mykhailo Chuplak. -If at the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the question of attracting women to the service was hardly discussed because of the long lines of men, then the situation changed later. After the hype among men subsided, women began to apply for these positions. They can replace men in some positions and do it successfully. That is why the percentage of women in the army has increased over the last three years,- he noted. According to the representative, they try not to recruit women to combat positions in order to avoid risks. The exception is combat medics. -Women have a higher level of stress resistance, are not afraid of blood and are quicker to calm wounded soldiers. This makes them indispensable in this role,- he added. Women are most often recruited into support and security positions such as cooks, accountants and drivers. At the same time, there are cases when women apply for combat positions, such as stormtroopers, machine gunners or infantrymen. The recruiting center emphasizes the importance of equal access to the service and celebrates the professional approach of women who choose a military career.

But objectively, they set themselves the goal of taking control of the Donetsk region. For this, they theoretically need to capture Pokrovsk. Another thing is that, most likely, their plans are not implemented,- Viktor Tregubov noted.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine disclosed the details of the first laparoscopic operation to remove a ki...	He told about this in interviewArmyInform. -Typically, a modern combat trauma is a large incision where the surgeon makes a laparotomy (cuts open, for example, the abdomen and operates on the internal organs) or a thoracotomy (cuts open the chest and operates). We have started to implement minimally invasive surgery - when not an incision is made, but a small puncture, and the surgeon, watching the situation through a video camera on the monitor, operates with micro-instruments,- Kostyantyn Humenyuk said. He explained that at that time military medics implemented minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy, thoracoscopy) for modern combat trauma. -And we are pioneers in the world, because we were the first to do it in combat conditions. In May 2022, I was in one of the military hospitals in the eastern direction. Then he performed a laparoscopic nephrectomy - laparoscopically removed the kidney, which was destroyed, with bleeding,- continues the chief surgeon of the ZSU. He said that in the past, with such injuries, an incision would be made on the abdomen, and the surgeon would remove the kidney with his hands, tying the vessels, etc. -I managed to do it laparoscopically: only small punctures in the stomach - and I could see all the internal organs on the monitor. I found that kidney, stopped the bleeding, removed it and saved the fighter's life. And you know: the next day, the same injured person arrived with a destroyed kidney. Having experience behind him, he performed the second operation much faster, because he knew all the technical points. Such an operation was carried out for the first time in the world, because then I looked through all the professional literature - but I did not find any examples. Then I asked myself why I was not told in the academy or universities that it is possible to do this (smiles). Therefore, it is military surgeons of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who are pioneers in the implementation of modern operations.- According to Konstantin Gumenyuk, now in mobile hospitals, surgeons also perform many such surgical interventions for modern combat trauma, namely laparoscopic and thoracoscopic. To the journalist's clarification, what guided the surgeon during the first such operation in the world, the officer replied: -I then started this laparoscopic operation - I went in, saw a large hematoma. And I had a choice: go to open surgery or continue laparoscopically. I'm not a gambling person, and it was definitely not gambling, I always weigh everything very much and take into account all the risks&#8230; But I just told myself I could do it. And with God's help, everything worked out. The operation lasted almost an hour and a half. Now we work on such cases for up to an hour.- You can read the full text of the interview with the chief surgeon of the Armed Forces at this link.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/u-zsu-rozpovily-detali-pershoyi-v-ukrayini-laparoskopichnoyi-operacziyi-z-vydalennya-nyrky/	2025-01-19T01:31:16-08:00

And he added that he has many new acquaintances. In particular, partners from other countries were very supportive — Israel, for example. They talked about their own challenges and scope of work. -But when I told that we can have up to 100-150 operations per day on just one direction of the front, they looked at me with wide-open eyes. Yes, we operate on wounded people with light, medium, heavy, and extremely heavy injuries. But the fact itself. Do you understand?- - said the chief surgeon of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian troops /->use their wounded soldiers to identify firing points of Ukrainian defenders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/protyvnyk-posylyv-nastup-na-shodi-zsu-strymaly-176-atak/	2025-01-18T21:14:59-08:00
In 60 seconds, even on three wheels: how -Mexican- and -Khohol- tamed the predator -Husky-	ArmyInform talked about how to safely deliver soldiers as close as possible to the positions on the battle line and take them out from there, what dangers await an armored vehicle during a mission and how to protect it from enemy damage, as well as a unique -three-wheeled- rescue from enemy fire. paratroopers The driver of the 46th separate airmobile brigade of the Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the call sign -Mexicanets- and his navigator, the machine gunner -Khohol-. A native of Poltava region has been in the -Mexicanets- army for more than a year - he was mobilized in September 2023. His father has been fighting since the first days of the -wide scale-, so the man had a reprieve for a while, but he was in contact with the local TCC and regularly updated the data. When the mobilization rules changed - arrived after the first phone call. The fighter was trained in Britain as part of the Interflex international training mission. He is satisfied with the training, although, according to him, some of what was taught by foreign instructors is unlikely to be needed in modern warfare. — We were sent to Britain for training, taught by Australian instructors. They taught skillfully, presented information clearly - I liked it. Although they teach according to the method, there are things that we do not use. But they listened to how our war was going on, and adjusted to it, tried to change the training so that we needed it, -Mexicanets- recalls. After basic combined military training, 15 of the best fighters of the combined training company were selected to take sergeant courses. They also underwent an advanced program in Britain compared to the BZVP, which also included courses in military leadership. — They look at who learns how, how they absorb information, and out of 200 people leave 15 for advanced training. At the sergeant's courses, they are already in command of the unit, each one in turn takes command and organizes the execution of the combat mission, says the soldier. After returning to Ukraine, the -Mexican- was appointed commander of the unit, he participated in battles in the Maryinka region. After getting to the hospital due to a hernia, he turned to the command with a request to be transferred to the position of a driver, which, based on his many years of civilian experience as a truck driver, was granted. -Khohol- is also in the army for the second year. A professional athlete, he also did not have any military experience and became a fighter of the 46th Brigade after the BZVP and training as a signalman. However, from the very beginning, -Khohol- was eager for combat tasks, so he soon became a machine gunner. - The machine gun is a heavy weapon. But I like it hard. He hits the enemy. That's why I saw myself here. I have skills and enough strength, so I am more needed here. And in general, I didn't come here just to -pat-, but to normally poke at the orcs, says the fighter. Khokhla's unusual appearance for a Ukrainian may surprise, but he is a native Kyivan from Darnytsia and almost the same age as Ukrainian independence - he is 33 years old. The Ukrainian language and the state of Ukraine are native to him, and he speaks in such a way that it is absolutely impossible to suspect him of being a foreigner. — Someone needs to defend the state. Therefore, we stand and will stand until the end. It doesn't matter that they (Russians - ed.) are healthy, big, how many weapons they have, how many resources they have. We have the land given by God, the truth is behind us and we will go to the end, he confidently asserts. As a -Khohol- machine gunner fought in different directions, he had to work against the enemy both from stationary positions with a machine gun on a mount, and from standard weapons on armored combat vehicles. Sometimes it was necessary to hit the occupiers at a distance of only 100-150 meters, which is extremely close for the heavy -Browning-. Now the fighter is in the position of a gunner in the crew of the Husky armored car, where he plays the role of a navigator and a machine gunner. The performance of combat missions and the lives of fellow soldiers depend on his endurance, courage, speed and accuracy. Since the spring of 2024, the -Mexican- was a driver, driving the -Cossack-. Later, the fighters -tamed- the Husky tactical support armored combat vehicle and since then have been providing front-line logistics on this highly maneuverable and well-protected Ukrainian foreign-made armored personnel carrier. The task of the -Husky- crew is to bring the fighters to the landing point and take them out during the rotation, evacuate the wounded and dead, deliver ammunition, water, food and everything necessary to the soldiers in the positions. The International MXT-MV armored car in the Husky TSV modification is the best for these tasks. — We deliver personnel to the positions, evacuate the -three hundred-, transport BC — we perform all the tasks of supplying the front line on the -Husky-. The passability of the car is excellent - a powerful engine, four-wheel drive, high ground clearance with regulation. Where there is a funnel - she jumps through it - says the -Mexican-. Comparing -Husky- with -Cossack-, the driver praises BBM of foreign production. He says that the -Cossack- only has wheel inflation, while there is no clearance adjustment - the chassis is all on shock absorbers, so it is more difficult for him to overcome potholes. -More maneuverable, faster and more energetic,- says the fighter about Husky. Another advantage of a powerful military vehicle is its capacity. Usually, in addition to the crew from the driver and the second number, 3-5 paratroopers can be accommodated in the cabin. However, if necessary, -Husky- can take on board 6-7 infantrymen, and in extreme situations - even much more. — At most, such a car took away 24 people, and I personally picked up 10 people, -says the -Mexican-, showing the small, but sufficient body of the car to accommodate a considerable load. They try to transport fighters in it only in case of urgent evacuation, because it is the least protected part of the armored car. -Husky- has strong protection, its armor easily withstands not only automatic and machine gun fire and debris, but also close bursts of mortar mines and artillery shells. The armored capsule reliably saves the crew and the paratrooper in the event of hitting an anti-transport mine receives a concussion, but remains unharmed. — They came under artillery fire more than once. Armor is strong, saves lives. Both 120 and 152 caliber can withstand a close gap - protection from debris is reliable. Mines were also hit and the capsule survived, the entire crew was alive, only contused, says the driver. In order to protect against FPV drones, the armored vehicle was additionally equipped with grilles-screens. Welded or bolted at a distance of 15-20 cm from the -Husky- armor, they are, according to the military, quite helpful, as they disperse the cumulative jet, reducing its penetrating power. — Lattices help a lot, because the momentum is lost, there is dissipation, and it hits the main armor only partially. They often have to be welded and twisted, because the -barbecue- cannot withstand shaking on a bad road - something often falls off, says the -Mexican-. Another level of protection is electronic warfare equipment against enemy UAVs. Several of them can be installed in the car so that they work and send a signal to the enemy at once on several frequencies. — We install 3‒4 REBs at different frequencies to protect ourselves and the infantry. -We turn them on when approaching a dangerous zone where enemy drones can reach,- says the fighter. - Logistics is determined by time - everything is always done in a gray, dark way. The task takes about an hour to an hour and a half to complete. It usually takes 30-40 seconds to stop the car, so as not to wind up. In a minute at most, you have to turn around completely, unload or load - and go fast, says the -Mexican-. -Husky- has infrared headlights that allow you to illuminate the road without exposing the car with bright light. However, usually the driver also uses a night vision device, looking at it continuously for 30-40 minutes. During the stop, the driver never leaves his seat in the armored vehicle, and the process is organized by the second number of the crew, who can perform various roles as needed, from the navigator to the machine gunner. It is he who knows the fastest and best way to place fighters and cargo in the Husky. — I always have an assistant, number two, with me. It constantly monitors, exits and helps to load or unload. He makes sure that all the people are seated so that no one is forgotten. And while driving, he is a navigator - looks at -Kropyva-, tells where there is a turn so as not to pass, - explains the driver. — I drive up, immediately turn the car around. Even before the stop, the navigator opens the door and prepares to jump out to quickly help someone get in or out. He distributes people by car so that there is no crowding and all this does not take a long time, says the -Mexican-. When the car moves, the second number is the last to jump into it almost on the move, because every second of delay can be fatal. And in just one minute, a powerful engine allows you to accelerate a multi-ton armored car to a speed of about 100 km/h. A vehicle near the frontline is always a prime target for the enemy. To put it out of order and destroy it, the occupiers try to aim first at the driver, because his damage will immobilize the car and allow them to finish it off with subsequent blows. -They hit the driver's seat if they can,- says the -Mexican-. — It's scary, of course, but what to do? During the night, we have to make 2-3 trips to drop in and take out our fighters and provide them with everything they need. Apart from us, no one will do it. However, -Husky- is not only a means of delivery and a target for which the enemy hunts. From fleeing prey, the armored car turns into a formidable predator when necessary. Its standard weapon — a universal 12.7 mm Browning machine gun — allows you to destroy the enemy at a distance of up to two kilometers. - There may be a task to move to the -front- and work on the enemy. The enemy is detected from the drones, they give us the coordinates - and we -take off-, fly away. We can shoot right on the move, if necessary - the main thing is to listen to commands on the walkie-talkie, -Khohol- says about combat work. Evaluating the survivability of the armored vehicle, he recalls the case when, during the approach to the position, the -Husky- on three wheels confidently took the crew out of fire. Then the enemy managed to hit the right rear wheel of the armored car, but the armored car reached the safe zone even though it had to drive literally on the rim. — They were given the task of taking the group out. When he climbed to close the door and flew into our rear right FPV wheel. Of course we were stunned, we got a slight concussion. But they closed the door and moved on three wheels. -Husky- took it out! - -Khohol- recalls enthusiastically. Fighters treat Husky with love and respect - almost like a living member of their friendly fighting team. It is taken care of, carefully checked and, if necessary, repaired with high quality before each departure, because the lives of fellows and their own depend on the health of the cheerful predatory armored car.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/za-60-sekund-navit-na-troh-kolesah-yak-meksykanecz-i-hohol-pryruchyly-hyzhu-haski/	2025-01-18T20:55:12-08:00
-Hood- over PT-91 Twardy, streaming and the enemy at 200 meters: -Dagger- about the features of tank...	The commander of the tank company 117 of the separate heavy mechanized brigade, senior lieutenant Oleksiy with the call sign -Dagger-, told ArmyInform about training in Poland, the advantages and disadvantages of the PT-91 Twardy, streaming from reconnaissance drones and the evolution of defensive structures, as well as the specifics of the use of tanks in Zaporozhye and Donetsk region. Oleksiy is an economist by education - in June 2022, he graduated from the National University of Bioresources and Natural Resources of Ukraine in Kyiv, having obtained a bachelor's degree. At the military department of the university, the young man studied to be a tank driver - this determined his combat path after the start of a large-scale invasion. — On February 24, 2022, we were supposed to have the day of the military department. Then the classes were postponed, but later continued. They completed their studies at the university in June, at the military department in August, and took the oath at the same time. In October, he was given the rank of junior lieutenant, he says. In January 2023, Oleksiy was mobilized and sent to study at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Peter Sahaidachny in Lviv. — If there was no military department, it would be much more difficult. I took something useful from there, because it provides the minimum necessary base from which to start. True, at the department we studied the T-64 more, and already at the academy we also started to master the T-72, - Oleksiy assesses the importance of initial training at the military department. According to him, it was useful even to older brothers who graduated from the department 20-30 years ago, although, of course, it was more difficult for them to renew their knowledge than those who graduated from the military department at the university recently. In February 2023, the young officer went to Poland to master the PT-91 Twardy and train personnel. The Polish military, he emphasizes, received Ukrainian colleagues hospitably and organized extremely intensive and useful training. — The Poles received us very well. They have a nice military town, very high-quality security there. They did everything to make learning as comfortable and productive as possible, Oleksiy remembers with gratitude. There were no problems with mastering new equipment, because the PT-91 Twardy is basically a T-72 with a number of useful modifications. According to him, the dynamic protection of ERAWA showed itself well, but the thermal imagers of the old generation caused complaints. In addition, some of them did not work on a full-time basis. — Twardy, in fact, it is the same T-72, just slightly modified. The gun and undercarriage are the same, but there is a thermal imager, a thermal sight, a more powerful engine, some differences in the turret. In general, this is a high-quality combat vehicle, characterizes the military Polish modification of the T-72. The tanker is very satisfied with the Tvardoy engine - compared to the T-72, it is significantly more powerful, thanks to which the armored vehicle -runs- much faster and more energetically. The young officer began his military career in August 2023 in the Zaporizhzhia direction, immediately becoming a temporary acting company commander. Before that, during training, Oleksiy commanded a platoon - they improved the skills of crews, maintained equipment, and maintained combat capability. — The battalion commander decided that I was the most prepared of all the platoon commanders to become a company commander. At that time, the company was already participating in hostilities, and I joined them. I had to -merge- into a new direction, because at that time I had no experience of commanding tank units directly during hostilities, the officer recalls. The specificity of the fighting in the south was the use of tanks as ersatz artillery to fire at the enemy from closed positions, since the terrain and the combat situation did not allow direct contact with the enemy. — The terrain in the Zaporozhye direction was not too favorable for a direct direct battle between the tank and the enemy. Therefore, they mainly worked from closed firing positions. It was quite effective - the tank was 6-8 kilometers away from the target on the front edge and like artillery fired in a hinged trajectory, the tank operator explains. True, artillery systems, he believes, are more effective because they have a larger caliber and a longer range, but tanks are also an effective means of fire, the presence of which should not be neglected. -Otherwise, it would just sit idle,- notes the tanker operator. -Without streams, it would be ineffective- The key to successfully hitting a target when firing from closed positions, the officer calls adjustments with the help of video streams from drones. — The crew arrives at the location, orients the car, attaches to the location, to the landmark. I am at the command post and coordinate them with the help of streams from drones. We find the target, calculate the output data for them. They practice and we can already see from the stream where they hit, where we need to hit and correct and I am already correcting directly, - he explains the organization of the combat work of the tank crew. Mainly, the tankers had to work on identified clusters and shelters of enemy infantry, they rarely had to deal with artillery positions or armored vehicles. -Without currents, it would be ineffective and quite difficult,- emphasizes the tanker commander. They also performed combat tasks related to offensive actions, during which tanks hit the enemy with direct guidance. — The guys left, they worked very well. In offensive actions, we supported infantry with tank firepower. Unfortunately, things did not always go smoothly, we also had losses. But in most cases, everything worked out, the tasks were completed, the officer assures. In addition to the active use of reconnaissance drones, another important innovation of the combat work of tankers in the Zaporozhye region was the development and installation of protective anti-cumulative superstructures on tanks - lattice or mesh structures, which were popularly nicknamed -barbecues-. — At first, our tanks had only dynamic protection units and on-board anti-cumulative screens. Then, based on the experience of hostilities in the Zaporozhye region from the fall of 2023, from November to December, we started installing additional protective elements with the help of volunteers, Oleksiy says. They tried to develop them in such a way that they did not prevent the crew from occupying places in the tank and leaving it in case of damage. Another important requirement was to maintain the maneuverability of the combat vehicle and the movement of the turret. Later, in the fall of 2024, factory designs resembling a hood also appeared. It does not limit the movement of the tank tower and the ability of the crew to leave the armored vehicle, and its only drawback is that in dense forest it can be broken by tree branches. — This car now has a factory-made protective structure. It's pretty effective stuff. Already here we tested it - there was damage by an FPV drone to the aft part of the tank and it was this net, this -hood- that saved it, - says Oleksii approvingly of the protective structure. The officer has a very negative opinion about the -sheds- that the Russians build on their tanks, noting that they limit the maneuverability of the machine, make it impossible for the turret to rotate, block the view and prevent the rescue of the crew from the damaged armored vehicle. Comparing combat work in the Zaporizhzhia region and in Donetsk region, the officer notes that the topography of the area and the experience accumulated over the past year, both by the Defense Forces of Ukraine and by the enemy, are a very significant factor. — In Zaporizhzhia, these are plains, very large fields cut by forest strips, and few villages. There are more settlements in Donetsk region and there are significant differences in altitude, much greater than in Zaporizhzhia - 200 meters high, then 130, 160, - says Oleksiy. Also, here you often have to engage in direct combat with the enemy, hitting infantry and shelters with direct fire. It is necessary to fire not only from a cannon, but also from a machine gun, sometimes at very close distances of 200-300 meters. -Under Pokrovsk, literally during all combat sorties, the crews had to work on enemy infantry at a distance of 200‒300‒400 meters,- the officer says. It is this use of tanks that most noticeably distinguishes the situation in Donetsk from Zaporizhzhia, where tankers in most cases performed the role of ersatz artillery.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/kapyushon-nad-pt-91-twardy-stryming-ta-vorog-za-200-metriv-kyndzhal-pro-osoblyvosti-tankovyh-boyiv/	2025-01-18T20:41:02-08:00
Inconspicuous and missile dangerous: Great Britain took up the development of the newest marine dron...	As informs the UK Defense Journal portal, the search for manufacturer companies to participate in the development will begin on January 22 2025 during the first meeting within the framework of the COOKSON Challenge Session project in London. Partners from NATO countries, -Five Eyes- states (interstate intelligence alliance) and some other interested parties are invited to cooperate, ArmyInform notes. -If you have experience with boats and ships, launch systems, surface-to-surface weapons, anti-aircraft systems, marine navigation with GNSS protection, sensors, integrators, autonomous systems or line-of-sight communications, this session can help you to interest,- said the Ministry of Defense of the United Kingdom. As the experts of the defense site IKK Defense Express (DE) told, at this time not only indicative characteristics of the future development, but also the date when the first prototypes should be shown - at the beginning of 2026. -Moreover, it is not easy to talk about innovative, but also mass development, because the conditions of the project include, in particular, the fact that in 6 months of serial production, it is necessary to reach the pace of two or three unmanned attack boats per month,- emphasized experts from DE. According to their findings, the future unmanned missile boat should have a cruising speed of up to 40 knots, a maximum range of up to 800 nautical miles, and a minimum patrol duration of 72 hours. At the same time, the platform must carry at least two missiles with a launch range of 30 to 100 kilometers, and must be able to operate even in conditions of active enemy electronic warfare. The UK Defense Journal, in turn, noted that the COOKSON project involves the creation of a small fast assault ship equipped with a modular payload and capable of operating in difficult conditions. The Ministry of Defense of the United Kingdom, according to British reporters, described the technical tasks of the project as follows: -The COOKSON system consists of a small, fast, low-visibility craft with &gt;2 unilateral effectors mounted on it, including a suitable launch system and supporting equipment. The COOKSON system must be able to travel to the delivery point via ground lines of communication (GLOC) (and) must fit into a 40-foot container, ideally even a 20-foot container.- The craft should be designed to be reusable across multiple missions, with a modular payload that provides flexibility for different operational needs. Once deployed, the system will operate autonomously or semi-autonomously to deliver payloads, conduct missions and return to friendly coastlines for rearmament and maintenance. In addition, according to the conclusions of DE experts, the future unmanned attack boat of the COOKSON project should have means of self-defense against enemy air targets. Here we are talking about large-caliber machine guns, MANPADS or other means. Also, this platform should be compact enough for convenient delivery, and missiles for this boat should be produced in the amount of at least 20 units per month. At the same time, what is particularly interesting, COOKSON is intended, first of all, to destroy coastal objects, and only then, in the second place, to destroy surface enemy targets. The project will rely on British industry, with the involvement of international partners to accelerate production and meet the needs of potential users. Britain is developing high-speed strike unmanned missile boats.

propaganda produces a fake about -Nova Bucha- in Suja	According to the version of Russian propagandists, the Ukrainian military is apparently planning to carry out a mass massacre of civilians in Suja (Kursk region). This story was peppered with drone footage taken somewhere in a garbage dump and comments from anonymous -experts- with a sofa instead of a podium. 1. Don't forget Bucha. Apparently, Russian propaganda remembered Bucha, because they still itch. The world remembers who actually committed war crimes in a Ukrainian city. It was not possible to get rid of it, so now the enemy is trying to transfer everything to Ukraine. But, as they say, a thief's hat is on fire. 2. Suja is a border town, but not a training ground for fakes. If the Russian army is afraid of guerrilla movements and drone strikes, this does not mean that the Ukrainian military plans to act like Russian soldiers. War in the 21st century looks different than in the textbooks of Soviet propaganda. But the Russians stubbornly live in 1943. 3. A fake without evidence is a classic of the genre. There is no evidence other than hysterical headlines in the Kremlin-controlled media. No satellite images, no intercepted conversations, no videos - just fantasy. Unless they will add some old photo and sign -here they are, Ukrainian fascists and what they are doing in Suja-. Because it is designed for fear and mass hysteria. Frightening Russians with mythical Ukrainian -punishers- is a traditional song of the Kremlin. But no matter how many times it is not twisted, words will not get better. 1. To justify the shelling of Ukraine. They said, you see, we are bombing Ukraine because they are preparing a -new Bucha- on our land. An old method of justifying aggression. 2. Strengthen mobilization. It is necessary to explain to the Russians why their sons continue to be dragged into the meat grinder. To avoid unnecessary questions, they are shown horror stories about -bloody dills-. 3. Distract from internal problems. When things are falling apart in the country, the best way is to invent an external threat. Russian propaganda copes with this task -perfectly-. 1. To ironize. Propaganda -throwbacks- do not withstand any criticism, so it is best to break them with sarcasm. 2. Don't behave. If someone seriously starts discussing the -genocide in Suja-, it's worth just calmly laying out the facts. 3. Spread the truth. The more people see the real facts, the less chance there is for fakes. The truth is on our side. -Nova Bucha- in Suja is another cheap thriller from Russian TV. But this script fails even before the first scene. Ukraine is fighting for its land, not for the fictional stories in the minds of propagandists. And if someone in the Kremlin is really afraid for their civilians, they better remember who started this war and why.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/rospropaganda-produkuye-fejk-pro-novu-buchu-v-sudzhi/	2025-01-18T20:01:15-08:00
The president insists that Russian ballistic missiles must be destroyed on its territory	He announced this during his evening video address on Saturday, January 18. According to the head of state, it is currently not enough to counter Russian missile attacks on the civilian infrastructure of ground-based air defense systems. -The blows were, in particular, ballistic. We continue to work for more air defense systems for Ukraine - modern systems that can shoot down such ballistics. And we are working to ensure that our Ukrainian army can actively act against enemy launchers, in particular, on Russian territory. I am grateful to all partners who support us in this,- the President emphasized, adding that -our long-range capability is one of the key tools for protecting life.- As reported by ArmyInform, Three civilians were victims of the Russian missile attack on January 18 in Kyiv, and three more were injured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/prezydent-napolyagaye-shho-balistyku-rf-neobhidno-znyshhuvaty-shhe-na-yiyi-terytoriyi/	2025-01-18T10:57:11-08:00

About one of these examples told in his Telegram channel, the head of the Center for countering disinformation of the NSDC, Defense Forces officer Andriy Kovalenko. In the video from the reconnaissance drone published on social networks, two occupiers on improvised crutches can be seen walking across the field towards the positions of the Armed Forces, but they never reach it, becoming easy prey for the Ukrainian drone with resets. — Mr. Pacchkovsky (@Q0MT6pFmbVqynsM) January 18, 2025 -Some sur. The Russians use such disabled people to try to identify the firing positions of the Defense Forces, and there are also cases when the wounded have already been discharged, but they survived, so they are given such final tasks,- said Kovalenko, commenting on the published footage. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian invaders tried in vain to advance in the Vovchansk region /->literally walking over the corpses of their liquidated accomplices.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/yakyjs-syur-okupanty-vykorystovuyut-soldativ-na-mylyczyah-dlya-vyyavlennya-vognevyh-tochok-zsu/	2025-01-18T10:54:06-08:00
A Ukrainian company helped the Russian Federation build nuclear laboratories — SBU	This was reported by the Security Service of Ukraine on Saturday, January 18. According to the investigation, already after the start of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, representatives of the specified company, which specializes in building materials, delivered a large-scale batch of ready-made profiles made of stainless steel to the aggressor country. -The occupiers used Ukrainian metal products to equip the office premises of the Russian Institute of Nuclear Research. -At its base, the Russians are developing projects of new types of missile weapons with a nuclear charge,- the report says. As noted, in order to hide international deliveries, the organizers of the outfit first sent the goods to a controlled company in the Middle East, and from there they re-exported them to Russian customers, although the financial statements of both companies were kept by the chief accountant of the Ukrainian enterprise. -During searches of the addresses of the company and the residences of the persons involved, mobile phones, computer equipment and documentation with evidence of criminal activity in favor of the Russian Federation were found.

Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General of Justice Serhiy Melnyk told about this. -Basic military training will be included in all higher education institutions and will be implemented for our students, citizens of Ukraine, in the second year.

The Defense Forces explained why the enemy attacked Borova and whether he had any success	The deputy commander of the 3rd of a separate assault brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Rodion Kudryashov. The officer explained that since Borova is a logistics hub of the Defense Forces, the enemy wants to capture it, which will make it impossible for the Armed Forces to have a presence on this side of the Oskil River. -Therefore, there is a fierce struggle for this village. All summer and autumn, the enemy tried to attack the front, that is, the line of responsibility of the 3rd OSHBr. There was no success. And now he began to move along the flanks, where in some places he went to the river bank. And from those directions it will try to move to the settlement of Borov,- said Rodion Kudryashov. According to him, this week the enemy resorted to numerous assaults, even in spite of unfavorable weather conditions. -Used a lot of equipment and a lot of infantry, all accompanied by a lot of artillery strikes. The enemy tried to break through the front edge, tried to advance again towards the settlement of Borov. During this week, the enemy had no success and suffered heavy losses. And the 3rd OSHBr replenished the exchange fund,- the Ukrainian defender noted. He also added that at the moment, in the Kharkiv direction, there is at least one enemy division opposite only one battalion of the 3rd OShbr. -This is three times the size of the brigade. Therefore, the enemy has an advantage not only in the number of infantry, but also in the number of weapons. And even with such superior forces, the enemy did not achieve any success this week, both along the line of the 3rd OSHBr and along the line of adjacent brigades,- the officer summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, trying to cross the Oskil's Russian troops use improvised watercraft.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/u-sylah-oborony-poyasnyly-chomu-vorog-pre-na-borovu-ta-chy-ye-u-nogo-uspihy/	2025-01-18T07:52:53-08:00

The 28th brigade explained that the occupiers are sending their soldiers without weapons towards our positions. The main goal of the -camel- is to run as close as possible to the positions of the Defense Forces and leave ammunition, mines or radios there, so that the assault groups can use them later. The Russian runner from the video was destroyed. In the Vovchansk direction, during an attempted Russian assault, a Ukrainian fighter captured six Russians. Hunters from 71 OEBR recorded the explanation of one of them on video. According to the occupier, his group jumped into the basement of the building and tried to knock out our soldier from there, but after they used up all the ammunition, our soldier captured a whole group of Russians. Azovets shot down an enemy FPV drone with the second shot. Soldiers of the reconnaissance platoon of the -Azov- brigade came under the crosshairs of an enemy attack drone while performing a combat mission.

As noted, the head of the enemy cell turned out to be an active engineer of the Kyiv Metropoliten utility company. According to the case materials, he was recruited back in 2015 in Moscow during a personal meeting with an FSB staff member. &nbsp; -A recruited agent was put on 'standby' and 'uncanned' after the start of a full-scale war via instant messaging. He was immediately instructed to create an agent network. The task of this group was to collect information about the locations and routes of movement of Ukrainian troops and their cargo, as well as launch missile and drone attacks on them,- the report says. At the same time, the perpetrator involved his own brother and mother, as well as several other acquaintances, in his agent activities. -A native of Kharkiv, who left the military unit after mobilization, and before that worked for Ukrzaliznytsia for 10 years, and is a driver of international road transport. The task of the deserter was to monitor the movement of military echelons of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the driver, under the guise of work trips, to merge the coordinates of checkpoints and units of the Defense Forces,- the SBU said. Having received from his henchmen the necessary coordinates for the assignment of strikes, the person involved summarized them and handed them over to his Russian curator. -The resident personally launched missile strikes on Kyiv, which is confirmed by his intercepted conversations. SBU employees documented the crimes of the Russian agency and detained its resident in Kyiv. At the same time, a deserter agent was detained in Kharkiv. During the searches, mobile phones with evidence of work in the Russian Federation were seized from the suspects. Firearms were also found, which were sent for examination,- the intelligence service added. Detainees were notified of suspicion for h. 2 Art. 28, ch. 2 Art. 111 (treason committed by a group of persons under martial law in accordance with a previous conspiracy) and ch. 1, 3 st. 436-2 (justification, recognition as legitimate, denial of armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, glorification of its participants).

-Limited suitability- must re-pass the VLK before February 4 - clarification of the Ministry of Defe...	About this reported on January 18 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The Ministry of Defense explains why it is necessary to undergo a medical examination and what the consequences may be in case of violation of the requirements of the law. On May 4, 2024, the Law of Ukraine dated March 21, 2024 No. 3621-IX -On Amendments to Certain Laws of Ukraine Regarding Ensuring the Rights of Servicemen and Policemen to Social Protection- (hereinafter - Law No. 3621). This document excludes from the provisions of the legislation on military duty and military service such definitions as -limited fitness for military service- and -unfit for military service in peacetime, limited fitness in wartime.- Order of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine dated August 14, 2008 No. 402 -On approval of the Regulation on military medical examination in the Armed Forces of Ukraine-, which defines the procedure for conducting military medical examination military medical commissions (hereinafter - VLK). During the medical examination of servicemen and other persons (including conscripts and conscripts) of the VLK, resolutions of the following general content are adopted: =-_blank- rel=-nofollow- href=-https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/3621-20#Text->By law No. 3621, i.e. up to and including February 4, 2025. What is the procedure for conscripts to change their status? Territorial recruitment and social support centers at the place of residence of conscripted citizens of Ukraine organize a medical examination and clarify information. According to the Military Accounting Rules (appendix 2 of the Procedure, approved by the resolution of the CMU dated 30.12.2022 No. 1487) conscripts, conscripts and reservists must arrive at the TCC within the specified time in mobilization orders, summonses, orders, respectively, for military registration and determination of appointment for a special period, registration of military registration documents, passing a medical examination, referral to training for the purpose of obtaining or improving a military accounting specialty, conscription for military service or training (verification) and special meetings of conscripts and reservists. At this stage, passing a military medical examination is possible only with a referral issued by the TCC. In order to issue a referral, the TCC must summon the conscript with a summons. If there was no summons, then the conscript can personally apply to the TCC to receive a referral to the VLK. We also note that according to clause 3.8 of chapter 3 of the section II of Order No. 402 Resolution of the VLK of district, city TCCs and SPs on the degree of suitability of a conscript for military service under conscription during mobilization, for a special period and/or under the period of validity of the legal regime of martial law is valid for one year from the day of the end of the medical examination. Therefore, conscripts need to update their medical information annually. Failure to comply with the rule on timely passing of military training is a violation of the rules of military registration or legislation on defense, mobilization training and mobilization. According to Code of Ukraine on Administrative Offenses (KupAP) for this, a fine in the amount of one thousand to one thousand five hundred non-taxable minimum incomes of citizens - or from 17,000 to 25,500 hryvnias. If a person with the status of -Limited suitability- does not pass a re-examination by February 5, the electronic military registration document in Reserve+ will remain unchanged. However, if the TCC sends a summons to pass the VLC, and the conscript does not fulfill the terms of this summons, the -wanted- status will be displayed in Reserve+. The Ministry of Defense is implementing a reform of the VLK. At the first stage of its implementation, it will be possible to send a request for a referral to the VLC through the Reserve+ mobile application, receive a notification with details and go to the health care facility indicated in the referral, without the need to visit the TCC. This stage should be implemented in January. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense implements systemic reform of the military medical examination (MME) in the Armed Forces. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/obmezheno-prydatni-mayut-povtorno-projty-vlk-do-4-lyutogo-rozyasnennya-minoborony/	2025-01-18T06:31:38-08:00
The occupiers are trying to cross the Oskil on improvised watercraft — Viktor Tregubov	This was announced by the speaker of the Khortytsya operational and strategic group of troops on the air of the telethon. - Major Viktor Tregubov, answering the question whether the occupiers manage to gain a foothold on the shore controlled by the Armed Forces. -The Russians constantly, especially at night, try to cross the Oskil on one or another watercraft that can carry five to 10 people. These are different types of inflatable, motor and other boats. The only way they do this is to try to sit down somewhere in a forest plantation and wait for a new group until there is a certain number of them,- the officer said. At the same time, he noted that Ukrainian defenders -are dealing with this issue with the help of fpv drones and drops.- -They catch them and just blow them out of the sky. But some are caught, and some are caught less. That is why the zone in which they like to cross most of all is a zone of constant fighting. But these are not the same battles as, for example, under the same Pokrovsk. This is a completely different intensity, a completely different scale, but this is really an attempt by small groups to infiltrate across the river to create trouble for Ukrainians there,- explained spokesman Viktor Tregubov. As reported by ArmyInform, in OSUV -Khortytsia- also denied the information about the alleged battles for Pokrovsk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/okupanty-namagayutsya-perepravytysya-cherez-oskil-na-improvizovanyh-plavzasobah-viktor-tregubov/	2025-01-18T06:12:06-08:00
They informed about the suspicion of the people's deputy, who made his -drivers- out of evasion	Data about this published on January 18 by the State Bureau of Investigation. Starting in July 2022, the People's Deputy sent letters on his behalf to the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine to grant permission for the departure of men in the guise of drivers who were supposed to accompany him across the border. 23 cases were documented when, on the basis of letters from a people's deputy, 18 men of draft age crossed the state border without him, because at the time of their crossing he was either already outside the border or did not leave the country at all. At the same time, sometimes he needed up to 5 drivers at the same time for trips abroad. Three of these -drivers- never returned to Ukraine. The People's Deputy was notified of the suspicion of organizing illegal transportation of persons across the state border using official position and official forgery (Part 2 of Article 332, Part 1 of Article 366 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). The sanction of the articles provides for punishment in the form of imprisonment for a term of up to 7 years. The people's deputy was also handed a petition to choose a preventive measure in the form of detention, which will be submitted for consideration by an investigating judge. People's deputy and persons who traveled abroad in this way are being searched. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/povidomyly-pro-pidozru-nardepu-yakyj-robyv-z-uhylyantiv-svoyih-vodiyiv/	2025-01-18T05:52:34-08:00
OSUV - Khortytsia - denied the information about the alleged battles for Pokrovsk	This was told by the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational and strategic group of troops on the air of the telethon. - Major Victor Tregubov. According to him, although the Pokrovsky direction remains the hottest, battles with the Russian invaders are taking place to the south of the city. -We have to emphasize once again that we are not talking about the city - we are talking about small settlements to the south of it, which are not part of it or part of its agglomeration&#8230; The Russians still set themselves the goal of covering the city: they do not even try to enter the city directly. They are trying to cover it from the sides, advance west of it and cut the relevant logistics routes,- the officer explained. As Tregubov notes, Ukrainian defenders are currently focused on preventing the occupiers from doing this. -And it is around this that the direct battle is going on. Our task is to prevent the Russians from entering the west of the city, to prevent the Russians from getting hold of the settlements southwest of the city and to try to cut the logistical arteries that lead to it. There is no question of a threat to the city itself. The Russians are only trying to create a situation in which the Ukrainian troops in the city will be weakened due to the deterioration of logistics,- added the speaker of the -Khortytsia- OSU. As reported by ArmyInform, today in the Pokrovsky direction, every meter of advance is given to the enemy at a high price, since only in the area of ​​responsibility of one brigade about 300 die per day on average occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/osuv-hortyczya-sprostuvalo-informacziyu-pro-nibyto-boyi-za-pokrovsk/	2025-01-18T05:39:40-08:00

The enemy uses meat assaults: assaults with infantry until they are wiped out - the 77th OAeMBr told...	Viktor Petrovych, a serviceman of the Dnipro Brigade, told about the situation there on the ArmyTV stream. — What has changed since the moment of our last communication? What is the situation in your brigade's zone of responsibility? — Due to extreme communication, the enemy has somewhat run out of armored vehicles. Currently, they are using meat assaults, that is, they are trying to attack our positions with infantry in waves. Previously, these were mass assaults with the use of armored vehicles. Then more than 10 units of armored vehicles were used twice. They have been repulsed and are now apparently restocking armored vehicles. But, nevertheless, the infantry is still used. — How actively do they break on the right bank of the Oskol River? That is, are they trying to cross, or are there no such attempts? — In our line of responsibility, no crossings have been made so far. We have destroyed all the water vehicles that have been abandoned there and they do not currently have this capability. In them, firstly, there is not a very wide wedge, and secondly, there is a very swampy riverbed and it is very wide, extremely difficult to wade through. That is, it is not enough to swim across, there is also a very wide strip of reeds and high banks. Well, in a word, it is difficult to move there. Therefore, so far no such attempts have been recorded, I have not been informed about them. — Mr. Viktor, can you tell us a little more about your visas, which are standing in front of you. Perhaps you know what these brigades, regiments and units are. Maybe there are some radio intercepts of them or communications with the captives? - At the moment I can't say for sure who is against us, but my comrade, who is now wounded, recorded and sent me a video showing all the chevrons he collected from the killed enemies . And there's storm-z, wagner chevrons, there's some of their widow chevrons. That is, in principle, there are a lot of different divisions, which, obviously, are not permanently here, but are like dowries. That is, let's say they form an assault company in another unit and attach it here to those who are standing here. And they storm until they are wiped out. Then the command takes them out of here, relatively speaking, the next ones are recruited. And the next ones are also sent to our positions until they are erased to zero. When massed infantry are used for assaults, fpv drones are most effective. When there are both mass assaults and in small groups, fpvs calculate the infantry well, hit them accurately, unlike artillery, which has a certain spread and with its help, it is quite difficult to catch a group of three infantrymen, relatively speaking. FPV is more efficient in this regard. They are also effective against moving armored vehicles, which are also difficult to hit with artillery. And in order to prevent the enemy from getting to our infantry, we need more fpv drones, we need a lot of components for them, we need a lot of material base in order to save the lives of the soldiers of the 77th brigade.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/vorog-vykorystovuye-myasni-shturmy-shturmuye-pihotoyu-poky-ta-ne-zitretsya-u-77-j-oaembr-rozpovily-pro-sytuacziyu-na-kupyanskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-18T04:57:14-08:00
A judge of the Economic Court of Kyiv was suspected of working for the Ministry of Defense of the Ru...	The State Bureau of Investigation reported this on January 18. It was established that as early as 2011, the aggressor country involved the then president, prime minister of Ukraine and a judge of the Economic Court of Kyiv, as well as heads of various branches of the judicial system, in subversive activities against Ukraine. The leadership of the Russian Federation has developed a plan according to which the defense capabilities and armed forces of the aggressor will be financed at the expense of the State Budget of Ukraine under the pretext of fulfilling the decision of the Economic Court of Kyiv to repay a non-existent debt. For this purpose, in 2011, the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation addressed the leadership of Ukraine with a letter of assistance in repaying the debt of one of the economic entities in the amount of $405.5 million. And for the supplied natural gas back in 1996-1997. Our state had nothing to do with the debt of a commercial enterprise and could not bear responsibility for it. However, in 2011, the former leadership of the country began to emphasize in the mass media that Ukraine should repay the specified amount to the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. In addition, a letter was prepared to the Security Service of Ukraine with a request to prosecute the head of the economic entity for allegedly transferring this debt to the state. Trying to artificially create grounds for direct financing of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation at the expense of the Ukrainian state budget, high-ranking officials involved the leadership of the judicial system and the judge of the Economic Court of Kyiv to recover $405.5 million in favor of the Russian Federation based on an illegal court decision. According to the scheme developed by the participants, in August 2012, the Ministry of Finance filed a lawsuit against the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine to the Commercial Court of Kyiv to collect more than 3 billion hryvnias from the state budget. The Russians were counting on the fact that back in 2004, the then Prime Minister, and later the President of Ukraine, promised to assist them in the implementation of these court decisions. However, due to the lack of contractual legal relations between the plaintiff and the defendant, the judge had to refuse to open proceedings in the case. Moreover, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation did not attach any evidence to the lawsuit to confirm why Ukraine should pay this debt. However, the judge of the commercial court made an illegal decision and transferred the duty of gathering and providing evidence in the case to the defendant. According to this decision, the Cabinet of Ministers provided copies of correspondence between the heads of the governments of Ukraine and the Russian Federation in 1996. They were dated even before the business entity concluded the agreement that resulted in the debt, so these letters could not be evidence of both the existence of the debt and its transfer to Ukraine. In addition, the originals of these letters never existed, but the court ignored this fact. Despite the expiry of the statute of limitations and the absence of state guarantees for the company's debts, as well as the absence of evidence of the very fact of the existence in 2012 of the company's debt under the contracts of 1996-1997, the judge satisfied the lawsuit of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation and decided to collect from any account of the State Budget of Ukraine in favor of the Russian Federation more than 3.1 billion UAH Part of the funds were collected from Ukraine in order to implement the aforementioned illegal court decision in favor of the Russian Federation. After the beginning of the aggression of the Russian Federation against our country and the change of the state leadership, in 2014 another judge of the Economic Court overturned this illegal decision, but it was not possible to return the money unjustifiably collected in the interests of Russia. According to the investigation, these funds were used to finance the so-called svo. As reported by ArmyInform, the people's deputy of several convocations was notified on suspicion of treason.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/suddyu-gospodarskogo-sudu-kyyeva-zapidozryly-u-roboti-na-minoborony-rf/	2025-01-18T04:33:30-08:00

A People's Deputy of several convocations has been notified of suspicion of treason	This was announced on January 18 by the Prosecutor General's Office. According to the investigation, the former deputy of the People's Republic, who was a member of the -Party of Regions- and -Opposition Bloc- for a long time, has been spreading Kremlin narratives since the beginning of Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine in 2014. In order to preserve the influence of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, which supports armed aggression against the country, the suspect spread the so-called ideology of -Russian peace-. With the help of the Patriarch of the Russian Federation, he became a curator for the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine. The suspect carried out his instructions and instructions in order to ensure that a significant part of Ukrainian society, who are believers of the UOC-MP, were under the direct influence of the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church. The People's Deputy also used the right of legislative initiative in order to hide the existence of a church-canonical connection and the entry of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church into the structure of the Ministry of the Russian Orthodox Church and to ensure the preservation of the Russian Orthodox Church's influence on the territory of Ukraine. The suspect gave an interview to the media, in which he made statements against other faiths operating in Ukraine, characterizing them in negative terms. His actions were aimed at inciting hatred and enmity on religious grounds. Before the start of the full-scale aggression, he left for the European Union on a charter flight, where he continued to work in the interests of the Russian Federation. As reported by ArmyInform, the TV presenter Medvedchuk was informed of the suspicion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/narodnomogo-deputata-kilkoh-sklykan-povidomleno-pro-pidozru-u-derzhzradi/	2025-01-18T04:02:45-08:00
TV presenter Medvedchuk was informed about the suspicion	This was announced by the Security Service of Ukraine on January 18. The Security Service of Ukraine collected a large-scale evidence base and received the conclusions of independent examinations confirming the anti-Ukrainian activities of the ex-host of the sanctioned TV channels -Nash- and -NewsOne-, which belonged to Viktor Medvedchuk and Yevhen Murayev. According to the case materials, after the start of the full-scale war, the person involved created his channel on the video hosting YouTube, where he continued to spread the narratives of the Kremlin. To do this, the blogger regularly invited pro-Russian -polite experts- to his broadcasts, a large number of whom are currently hiding in the Russian Federation. During the interview, both the author himself and the guests of the studio repeatedly tried to justify Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine, as well as the war crimes of the Russians, in particular, missile strikes on the civilian infrastructure of our country. Another pro-Kremlin blogger was a frequent guest of the figure, who in February 2024 had already received suspicion from SBU investigators. Then the court chose a preventive measure for him - house arrest, but later the blogger continued his subversive activities in the interests of Moscow. Both figures publicly tried to discredit Ukraine in the international arena and shook the social and political situation within our country. Forensic-linguistic expertise initiated by the SBU confirmed the facts of crimes committed by both bloggers. Currently, the investigators of the Security Service have informed them about the suspicion under Art. 2, 3 Art. 436-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (justification, recognition as legitimate, denial of armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, glorification of its participants). The question of choosing a preventive measure in the form of detention for the accused is being resolved. They face up to 8 years in prison with confiscation of property. As reported by ArmyInform, a banker was detained in Kyiv /a>, who donated to the occupiers. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/televeduchomu-medvedchuka-povidomyly-pro-pidozru/	2025-01-18T03:42:06-08:00

Delivery and evacuation of the wounded together. Some went out, others came in - it flew. There were then two resets: one reset nearby, the other a little further. Three men were injured at the time. Then Mavik will drop something somewhere nearby, it happens that it will try while moving. Those who voluntarily left a part, better return before March 1 2025. In this way, it will be possible to avoid punishment for the SZH, find a decent place in the unit and resume payments. Denis told his story. — After the injury, after the hospital, there are many emotions&#8230; The expensive part&#8230; that's why he ended up in the SZCH. It was the 23rd year. I had shrapnel in my legs, three pieces. One still remained there because they could not pull him out. After that, I was transferred to another company and there was such a wave of emotions that I went home. - How long were you at home? - Almost a year. It was very difficult to overcome myself. Understanding that he's gone, but the boys are there&#8230; and my father will tell me how and what&#8230; Need help there or something? well, one day I arrived in the district, asked to be transferred to my father. And this part accepted normally, the commanders here are normal, then everything is fine. -Charter- respects everyone who admits their mistakes.

Kamikaze tactics - the Russians run forward without weapons	The video was published on January 18 on the brigade's channel. Our aerial scouts spotted an enemy infantryman running towards our positions without weapons but with cargo. Such occupants are called -camels-. Their main goal is to get as close as possible to our positions and leave ammunition, mines, or walkie-talkies there for the assault groups to use later. At the same time, the -camel- itself is disposable, so he is not even given a weapon. Although it is not bad to equip them with armor, so that he could run as far as possible. -How effective such tactics are is questionable.

The technique is used to a limited extent and not in all areas. Especially when compared with the amount in which the enemy used the technique a year ago. Now, firstly, it has come to an end a little, and secondly, the use of FPV drones and mine barriers has significantly reduced the level of use of equipment. That's why a link is now used: infantry plus various types of UAVs. And that's how they go on an assault,- Viktor Tregubov said.

They are flooding with infantry - the enemy has increased the number of attack aircraft in the Toret...	Yevhen Alkhimov, press officer of the 28th mechanized brigade named after the Knights of the Winter Campaign, told this on the ArmyTV stream. -The enemy continues to use the tactics of small infantry groups, but the groups have become larger. If earlier the group consisted of up to 8 people, now it has increased to 20. If earlier they accumulated 1-2 people each and the group went on an assault, now the Russians use equipment for faster delivery of assault groups. Now the rolling starts right away,- said Yevhen Alkhimov. According to him, the large deployment of enemy drones creates significant problems for our logistics. At the same time, the enemy's use of anti-tank missiles decreased from 7-10 to 1-2 daily. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers are increasingly trying to -kut-i-znyshhyly-v-lysyachyh-norah/->apply new tactics — when a small assault group enters first, hides as close as possible to Ukrainian positions and waits for reinforcements.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/zavalyuyut-pihotoyu-na-toreczkomu-napryamku-vorog-zbilshyv-kilkist-shturmovykiv/	2025-01-17T22:33:21-08:00

About the lost -golden hour- after the injuries, the world's first unique operation near Bakhmut and...	Today we meet the doctor who performed that unique operation. This is the chief surgeon of the Armed Forces, colonel of the medical service Kostyantyn Humeniuk. -I had a choice: switch to open surgery or continue laparoscopically. I am not a gambling person, and it was definitely not gambling, I always weigh everything very much and take into account all the risks&#8230; But I just told myself I could do it. And with God's help, everything worked out. The operation lasted almost an hour and a half. Currently, we process such cases for up to an hour,- says the officer. In 2017, he was the chief surgeon of the ATO, in 2018-2019 — the chief surgeon of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. He met the large-scale invasion at the front - and since then he spends a lot of time in the area of ​​hostilities, in direct contact with the doctors of mobile hospitals and advanced surgical groups. In addition, he works a lot with partners, having a number of foreign business trips. During one of these, in the USA, Konstantin Humenyuk (and, therefore, the entire surgical service of the Armed Forces) received a standing ovation, seeing only a part and fragments of the work of our military medics in saving the lives of defenders. Next is an ArmiyaInform interview with Kostyantyn Gumenyuk. — What was your area of ​​responsibility when the full-scale invasion of the Russians began in 2022 and what is it now? — The entire surgical service of the Armed Forces is my area of ​​responsibility, starting with all advanced surgical groups, military mobile hospitals, military medical clinical centers located in different cities of Ukraine. And accordingly, all wounded, traumatized and patients of a surgical profile are under my responsibility. With the beginning of the war, of course, their number increased significantly, and the load on the entire surgical service accordingly also increased. He met the war in Donetsk region, where he went a few days before the invasion - at that time, the 65th military mobile hospital was stationed in Chasovoy Yar. At 5 a.m., I woke up to do the traditional morning workout — but around the same time, the OOS headquarters was attacked. From then on, it began: a non-stop stream of ambulances, many wounded with modern combat trauma, in particular, in a serious condition - with amputations of the lower and upper limbs. Many had to operate in various mobile hospitals in Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Druzhkivka, Pokrovsk, Dnipro, Kharkiv; deal with organizational issues regarding the flow of the wounded and change their evacuation routes, taking into account that Kharkiv was already being shelled at that time. The issues of medical supply with blood preparations and medicines were also important. Subsequently, he was engaged in moving the Odessa military hospital to another region, after that he returned to the front. We had to work a lot in the operating theaters in Dnipro - the Mechnikov hospital, the military medical clinical center and other civilian hospitals received a large flow of wounded, for which I thank the civilian surgeons and all other doctors and medical personnel who saved our wounded. As the chief surgeon, I am responsible for the wounded from the moment of his admission to the advanced surgical group. This is my very first link. —The war, unfortunately, became an impetus for progress in various fields. How was this reflected in military surgery? What do you think has been the quantum leap for military medicine since the start of a full-scale invasion? What has become a game changer for military surgery? - It is worth understanding that the more operations there are, the more experience surgeons gain. The more a surgeon works with modern combat trauma, the more he understands all the complex life-threatening moments, what are the consequences of this combat trauma, and, accordingly, the mastery of operative interventions increases, this is very important. Yes, since 2014, since the time of the ATO/OOS, we have also been gaining experience. At that time, there was a relatively small number of wounded. Yes, we were wounded by various types of weapons and sniper fire, then we could quickly deliver the wounded to mobile hospitals, the -golden hour- was observed, which is very important. After a large-scale invasion, we have a large number of wounded for the entire surgical service of the Armed Forces. And then we clearly understood that in order to save all these wounded, there must be a tactic of Damage control surgery. This is a special tactic that was introduced by our American partners, they used it in Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan. Its meaning is that during surgery, the surgeon should perform a shortened stage of the operation precisely to save life, without performing the full scope of operations. This is especially true for the unstable seriously wounded. After stabilization of the condition, the final stage of the operation is performed. And this tactic has proven its effectiveness in severe wounds of almost all localizations, especially the organs of the abdominal cavity, as the heaviest in the war. And it was during a large-scale invasion that we saw that when we use Damage control surgery, the results are better. We now apply this tactic to almost all injuries. An extreme case was when a wounded man with a fragment in the heart, signs of hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade, which is life-threatening, was operated on in a mobile hospital, the tamponade was removed, and the wounded man was evacuated to the Amosov Institute in 9 hours. There, high-class surgeons using high-quality equipment performed an operation, removed the splinter and saved lives. This applies to any other complex surgical interventions. In case of injury, the task of the surgeon in the mobile hospital is to save life. The priority is a saved life! Restoration of blood loss begins already at the stabilization point of the brigade, followed by rapid evacuation. And it is precisely this tactic in interaction with clear and professional assistance at all stages that allows for high-quality results, and the survival rate of wounded soldiers is much higher. In addition, there is another complication: all gunshot wounds are infected. We also have the problem of antibiotic resistance in the treatment of soldiers, it is difficult to deal with sepsis, and severe pneumonia is starting as a complication of combat trauma. There are cases where surgeons perform unique operations, but the wounded may die from bilateral pneumonia or multiple organ failure. Such complications are frequent and can lead to fatalities, unfortunately. — When was the peak of the arrival of the wounded to the advanced surgical teams? What is the intensity and stage of the war? - Spring 2022. But in general, the front is changeable. It may be a little quieter in Donetsk region, and it may get worse in the Zaporizhzhia direction. Then everything quieted down in this direction, but the number of wounded in Kharkiv region increased. It all happens very locally. — The burden on both the advanced surgical teams and the hospital due to the full-scale Russian invasion was colossal. How did you cope with this challenge? — Due to the professionalism of the managers of all departments. These are the heads of mobile hospitals and leading surgeons&#8230; If we talk about the surgical service, everyone performed their functional duties, their work, and thanks to this, we managed to survive. In addition, many surgeons and operating room nurses came to the army for mobilization. This also saved the situation, especially when there was a large flow of wounded 24/7, when surgeons could not sleep for two or three days. - What dynamics do you observe in the context of the frequency of fatalities in case of combat injury, icomparing the spring of 2022 and the beginning of 2025? — Seasonality greatly affects the survival rate of our boys. Yes, hypothermia, frostbite, for example, aggravate a combat injury. If a wounded serviceman spent 2-3 hours in some cold dugout, then this general hypothermia will also affect the soldier's survival. What we have seen during this time is that the faster the wounded are transported from the battlefield to the staging area of ​​a brigade or forward surgical team, the better the survival rate. We now often talk about the -golden hour- - that a soldier must be taken to a surgeon within an hour from the moment of injury. In this case, the results of treatment and survival will be better. We currently spend over an hour on this - sometimes 6, 12 or more. Often, during speeches at conferences, foreign colleagues ask me: -How so?!-. It has to be explained that the wounded man can put a tourniquet on himself, but for several hours he is not evacuated from the battlefield, and the combat medic cannot reach him - shelling continues, drones overhead, etc. Therefore, the evacuation of the wounded to the advanced surgical group or the stabilization point of the brigade takes place at night or in the evening, when there are fewer drones and there is an opportunity to approach with armored vehicles. - Actually, in continuation of the topic. According to the NATO protocol, the wounded should be in the hospital within an hour. In our realities of war, this -golden hour- is being lost. Do we somehow adapt these protocols to our war? Do we develop our own? Please tell us how we are dealing with this. - Yes, even from the experience of the ATO/OOS, we saw that if a wounded person is already at the surgeon's place within an hour, the survival rate is higher, the number of amputations due to tourniquets would be significantly less . But now we have such a situation that a military man puts a tourniquet, a certain time passes, and he cannot loosen it, for example, because the battle is going on or there is no combat medic, or he died. Then it is no longer possible to save the limb, we perform amputations. — In this context, another question: what do you see as the real volume of interventions for a paramedic? Is it planned to expand the training of doctors, to allow them to perform certain interventions? After all, there are rare cases when a person cannot be evacuated from the battlefield for a day or more - Currently, there are many centers in Ukraine that conduct training in tactical medicine, prepare combat medics, senior combat medics. Such courses are also held on the basis of the Ukrainian Military Medical Academy. Plus there are training centers, public organizations that deal with this training. Currently, this training is qualified and of high quality. But it is clear that there are not enough specialists to train such a large number of people. But my personal opinion: every Ukrainian, starting from high school, should have the skills to provide first aid to himself and others. These classes in Ukraine should start from school. People need to know how to apply a tourniquet or stop bleeding. A person must be psychologically prepared for extreme conditions - we have shelling of cities every day, sometimes, unfortunately, with a large number of wounded. A person should know what to do if there is no tourniquet at hand (therefore, there is a belt or laces), how to stop arterial bleeding or how to free the upper airway and provide quality resuscitation. Therefore, as the chief surgeon of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, I believe that within the borders of the state, the issue of providing first medical aid should begin at school. — In one of your interviews, you said that military surgeons of the Armed Forces of Ukraine implement and develop modern surgical techniques, especially in minimally invasive surgical interventions. In May 2022, in a military mobile hospital, you performed a modern laparoscopic operation for the removal of a kidney for the first time in Ukraine in a gunshot wound with destruction of the organ. Judging by open sources, such an operation had no analogues in the world at that time. Tell me more. - Usually, a modern combat trauma is a large incision, where the surgeon makes a laparotomy (cuts, for example, the abdomen, and operates on the internal organs) or a thoracotomy (cuts the chest and operates). We have started to implement minimally invasive surgery - when not an incision is made, but a small puncture, and the surgeon, observing the situation through a video camera on the monitor, operates with micro-instruments. Therefore, we introduced minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy, thoracoscopy) in modern combat trauma. And we are pioneers in the world, because we were the first to do it in combat conditions. In May 2022, I was in one of the military hospitals in the eastern direction. Then he performed a laparoscopic nephrectomy - laparoscopically removed the kidney, which was destroyed, with bleeding. Previously, an incision would be made in the abdomen and the surgeon would remove the kidney with his hands, tying the vessels, etc. I managed to do it laparoscopically: only small punctures in the abdomen - and I could see all the internal organs on the monitor. I found that kidney, stopped the bleeding, removed it and saved the fighter's life. And you know: the next day, the same injured person arrived with a destroyed kidney. Having experience behind him, he performed the second operation much faster, because he knew all the technical points. Such an operation was carried out for the first time in the world, because then I looked through all the specialized literature - but I did not find any examples. I asked myself then, why I was not told in the academy or universities that it is possible to do this (smiles). That is why the military surgeons of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are the pioneers in the implementation of modern operations. Even now, when I come to the mobile hospital, and there is appropriate equipment, and surgeons already perform many such surgical interventions for modern combat trauma - namely, laparoscopically and thoracoscopically. During one of the conferences abroad, when I talked about our experience, my colleagues simply did not understand how this could be done. Because if they perform such surgical interventions, then only in large basic hospitals, where there is equipment and a large team. But in our country it is done in combat conditions, where surgeons operate laparoscopically on the wounded. - What guided you when you performed the first such operation in the world? - I then started this laparoscopic operation - I went in and saw a large hematoma. And I had a choice: switch to open surgery or continue laparoscopically. I am not a gambling person, and it was definitely not gambling, I always weigh everything very much and take into account all the risks&#8230; But I just told myself I could do it. And with God's help, everything worked out. The operation lasted almost an hour and a half. Now we work on such cases for up to an hour. - Tell us about three unique operations of yours personally. - Not that they are unique - I will tell you about the most memorable ones. Once, a wounded man with a gunshot wound to the abdomen arrived at the mobile hospital, and the anesthesiologists were just about to give him anesthesia. And he opens his eyes and says: -Kostyantin Vitaliyovych, you operated on me in 2017, look, there is a scar on the side of my thigh, they took a bullet out of me.- And I did not remember him at all, even in which hospital he operated. It was so fate that he came to see me for the second time for surgery. Currently, he continues to serve on the front line. From the memorable still&#8230; You know, when there is a large flow of wounded, the surgeons do sorting: they determine who goes to the operation first, who goes to the second, and so on. And in civilian polyclinics, there are always disputes and quarrels about who will get to the doctor first. But among the wounded (severely wounded!) there is no such thing - they lie quietly. No one is saying that he should be saved first. There was no such case. And I have been to many sortings. They are concise: -Doc, as you say, you can see better.- Although I understand that waiting for you to be taken for surgery is psychologically very difficult. In many guys who wake up from anesthesia, I don't see fear in their eyes about not having, for example, a limb. He just says, -Amputation? And nothing could be done?... Well, there will be a prosthesis.- This cannot be expressed in words&#8230; They support me and help, in a big way, to communicate this difficult news. Many soldiers with prostheses continue to serve. I saw how one soldier's titanium prosthesis was pierced by a fragment. Such cases also happen. - Tell us about the three most unique operations in the army since the beginning of the full-scale invasion? - The first operation is a thoracoscopic operation for a gunshot wound to the heart and the presence of hemopericard and cardiac tamponade. The shrapnel entered the heart and hemorrhage occurred in the pericardium. As a result, the heart begins to work poorly, because it is unable to contract, blood accumulates in the heart bag. The wounded man suffocates, his neck veins swell. And at this time, the operation must be done quickly. And we went thoracoscopically - we made small punctures in the chest, installed a video camera, cut the pericardium, the blood came out of the heart, and it began to function normally. The wounded man's condition stabilized, and we sent him by helicopter to Amosov, where he was operated on and his life was saved. It was also the first such operation in the world. The second operation is the removal of the kidney, which I have already talked about. The third is when the fragment enters the large blood vessels, the inferior vena cava, or the aorta. These are large blood vessels and if the bleeding is not stopped in time, the person will bleed quickly. There was such a case when a fragment got into the inferior vena cava and got stuck in its wall. The surgeons saw this and asked me what to do. And this is a mobile hospital, and I understand that professional experience is needed, and that there is no threatening bleeding, you need to have a sufficient amount of blood, besides, other wounded people arrive. The military was stable, and we made an important decision: they made a tamponade, put drainage, quickly sent to the Institute of Shalimov, where it was operated. Life is saved. These are unique operations, but properly made decision - is also very important. It could be said that we operate there in a mobile hospital. But as the chief surgeon, I understand that the risk of bleeding was very high. And I understood that surgeons could not cope at that level, and we would lose life. Proper solution = saved life, and this is the most important thing. - How does work with partners continue? Do they come and take experience? What are their emotions when you talk about the experience of our combat doctors? About 12,000 participants. I had a performance in a very large hall, very briefly told about our surgical capabilities and how we save our boys. The hall applauded. And now I do not praise myself now - I was applauded not to me, but all the surgical service of the Armed Forces. I just put my hand on my heart and bowed. Many acquaintances of new ones. Partners from other countries were very supported by Israel, for example. They talked about their own challenges and volumes of work. But when I told that we can have up to 100-150 operations a day in only one direction of the front-I was looked at me with wide eyes. Yes, we have the wounded both with slight injuries, with medium, with severe, and extremely difficult. But the fact itself. Do you understand? .. - What is the most difficult operation you have performed? Lasted seven hours. Successfully. As for the wounded &#8230; When I operate guys, I do not allow myself to think that we will not handle somewhere. I clearly know that we will do everything. Yes, there are difficult cases where I see: 50 to 50, I ask myself how to do &#8230; At such moments, I never shy and call my senior colleagues, academics - and will always tell me. So now I say surgeons - call and ask. They even call at night, apologize who have woken up, but advise what to do with one wound. It is often the case that they need support or a hint. And they always get it from me. And I am proud to manage to today such a powerful professional surgical service of the Armed Forces. - What would you advise military doctors to prevent mental maintenance? Since we understand that such a load is difficult to withstand &#8230; - when I come to my colleagues, I always ask them what they do in my free time. Laughing answers that there is no free time. And if so - then fall asleep. Yes, monotonous work and constant load lead to psycho -emotional burnout. I ask them to watch beautiful movies. Be sure to play sports - necessarily! Sometimes the boys even order themselves small expanders, simulators, dumbbells, put tennis tables. Sport is a little distracting, and mental and physical activity should be combined. I advise you to monitor the webinars, new operations around the world. If possible, stroll in the open air. Well, key - communication with relatives and relatives. - What is your recipe to keep yourself mentally during this war? be able to separate from basic work and salvation. Be able to find joy in a little one: good music, good communication, a beautiful book, a beautiful movie. Sport. All in general leads to the fact that a person is distracted and there is no psycho -emotional and physical burnout. -what will be the completion of the Russian-Ukrainian war? I understand that options ( end of war. - Ed. ) can be very different. We really want our victory. But for me personally, the end of the war will be the moment when I get the following information: -Konstantine Vitaliyovich, no 200, no 300's.- This is the stop for me, definitely. So then we will operate in the boys hernia, appendicitis, cholecystitis or broken legs ( laughs ). We will continue to rescue both the military and the civilian population - but then all there will be non -adhesive injuries. - What will you do the first after the end of the war? Not even in the sea-but in any river: just swim, just sit on the shore of quiet and peaceful Ukraine.

Division-level breakthrough operation, late Soviet team and cementing -axis of evil-: expert on Nort...	Why did Russia resort to deploying troops from North Korea and for what reasons is it still hiding their presence there? Military expert Petro Chernyk answered these questions. -It is not a secret why this operation was organized. First of all, it is a diversion of troops from the strategic eastern bridgehead, especially in the Donetsk direction. And, of course, this debunks the myth that a non-nuclear country cannot attack a nuclear one. A nuclear apocalypse did not happen. But there is another very important and principled element in this operation: North Korean troops. They had a lot of questions at the beginning of their entry. A few months ago, the Russian Federation publicized this phenomenon that, they say, such forces will appear that will immediately knock out our troops from the territory of Kurshchyna. This did not happen. Therefore, the strategic question is being revised, whether these troops are so combat-ready and whether they are capable of performing the tasks assigned to them. We can definitely talk about it now from a certain experience. Now just a few analytical points. It was declared that it was used within the limits of up to 12,000 personnel (North Korean troops — ed.). First of all, these are mechanized units. Is it a lot or a little? This is a full division. The division, according to Soviet and current Russian standards, is 12,500 people. According to the classic statute, the same Soviet-Russian one, the division must break through brigade combat formations along a front of 10-15 kilometers, up to 30 kilometers in depth. The North Korean troops could not demonstrate anything like that. This is a very important detail. At most, if you scrupulously check and study their equipment, especially those already confirmed cases of their death, then this is the late Soviet Union, well, maybe a little improved. And let's not forget that combat experience is a very important detail. Our military is probably the most experienced military in the world at the moment—well, second only to the United States of America—but in the type of war we're fighting right now, especially in FPV drones. And here is another small cut. We recall that postcard of the North Koreans, where they tried to shoot down a drone as a bait, that is, a live person. What does that mean? This means that they are treated as biomass, and biomass cannot and will not perform any other option besides meat assaults. So, the summary. If the North Korean troops really had real combat potential, they would have organized at least one division-level breakthrough operation. This did not happen. Now a logical and understandable question arises: why is Russia beginning to hide the facts of their presence? But everything is elementary simple. Everything rests on strategic propaganda. It is similar to -we will take Kyiv in three days- and -we are at war with NATO-. And here it is the same: units on which a huge bet was made in the propaganda sense do not justify themselves. Therefore, this issue should be removed from the agenda. Plus, no matter how strange it sounds, there is also a certain geopolitical component of this phenomenon. What does it consist of? We have no doubt that the allies are conducting serious negotiations behind closed doors with both the Chinese and the Russian Federation regarding the fact that such a flagrant violation of the rules of international warfare is unacceptable. Because there was great geopolitics here for Putin - and not only for Putin, but also for China and for North Korea - this is the cementing of the so-called -axis of evil-. Therefore, they went into hiding and, in my opinion, will continue to do so. It is important for us to hold the bridgehead and to destroy as much as possible, both the occupiers - the Russians themselves - and the North Koreans. Why? Because it is a signal to world dictatorships that such frank adventures will have a certain value in terms of the destruction of their personnel.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/proryvna-operacziya-dyvizijnogo-rivnya-piznoradyanskyj-ekip-ta-czementuvannya-visi-zla-ekspert-pro-pivnichnokorejcziv-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-17T20:44:18-08:00
Bridging the gaps: France to develop new long-range ballistic missile	According to data reporters of the French magazine Challenges, the implementation of this defense project will be the first such initiative since 1997 year, ArmyInform reports. This potential development reflects the growing global reliance on ballistic missiles, which have proven effective in various conflicts. The proposed missile aims to fill a gap in France's capabilities, as its current ballistic missile systems are exclusively submarine-based and designed for nuclear deterrence. In turn, the experts of the Dutch portal for the study of defense prospects Army Recognition reminded that currently the French Republic is armed there are no land-based ballistic missiles. Its only -ballistic- is the M51 missile, which is launched from a submarine and serves as a means of nuclear deterrence. Discussions between the French Armed Forces and the Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) were focused on creating a ground-based missile system that would be controlled from mobile platforms such as trucks. Early design concepts suggest that this missile may have end-phase maneuverability similar to other advanced systems, making it more difficult for enemy defenses to intercept. Historically, France developed several land-based ballistic missiles after World War II. Between 1946 and 1947, German engineers in France worked on the Super V2, a medium-range ballistic missile project with planned variants capable of a range of up to 3,600 kilometers and warheads weighing up to 1,000 kilograms. However, in 1948 this defense program was terminated. The S2, in service since 1971, was a two-stage, solid-propellant medium-range ballistic missile equipped with a 1.2 megaton thermonuclear warhead. In 1980, it was replaced by the S3 missile, which had similar characteristics and remained in service until 1996. In 1974, France introduced the Pluton missile, a short-range tactical ballistic missile with a range of up to 120 kilometers designed for nuclear or conventional warheads. In 1991, the Pluton was replaced by the Hades missile, which had a range of approximately 480 kilometers. The Hadès missile, designated as a pre-strategic nuclear deterrent, was decommissioned by 1997. This new program differs from the French Long-Range Land Strike initiative (FLP-T), which is focused on the development of a replacement for rocket artillery with a range of up to 150 kilometers. In contrast, the proposed ballistic missile would exceed 1,000 kilometers, offering additional strategic options for deep strikes in conflicts. However, funding remains a serious problem, as the French military budget is already allocated to such priority projects as the modernization of M51 missiles and the development of the ASN4G air-launched missile. This potential program could also align with the European Long-Range Strike Approach (ELSA), a joint initiative involving Germany, Italy, Poland, the UK and Sweden. If developed, the missile would complement France's current capabilities, such as Rafale jets and cruise missiles, increasing its ability to launch strategic strikes. Ballistic missiles are designed to deliver warheads over long distances using an arc trajectory. They are powered during the initial phase of flight, after which they move on a ballistic trajectory under the influence of gravity and air resistance. This design allows them to hit targets at different distances from short to intercontinental. Their high speed and height make interception difficult. Some ballistic missiles are equipped with multiple independent warhead units (MIRVs), allowing a single missile to deploy multiple warheads at different targets. These features underscore the strategic importance of ballistic missiles, as evidenced by their effectiveness in recent conflicts and their potential to close capability gaps similar to those found in France's current arsenal. On October 1, 2024, Iran launched 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, several of which penetrated Israel's multi-layered missile defense system and struck key military bases. In response, Israel launched airstrikes using Blue Sparrow ballistic missiles carried by F-15 fighter jets. Analysts consider these exchanges part of the first -ballistic battle- since similar events in April 2024. China has invested heavily in ballistic missile programs with systems such as the DF-21D and DF-26 capable of targeting installations in the western Pacific. In addition, the flight range of the DF-100 supersonic missile was increased to 4,000 kilometers. The South Korean Hyunmoo-V missile, which is detailed told ArmyInform, capable of carrying an eight-ton warhead to a distance of more than 3 thousand kilometers, targeting underground and strategic facilities in North Korea. North Korea has also tested an intercontinental ballistic missile, potentially a solid fuel, capable of reaching the United States. These developments underscore the growing importance of long-range ground strike capabilities in modern defense strategies. How is a ballistic missile different from a cruise missile.

Russian fake about the mobilization of Ukrainian rescuers: what did they make up this time	Propagandists are actively dispersing fake -documents- and fictitious orders that refer to sending rescuers to the front lines. The manipulation is supported by false comments on behalf of Ukrainian officials and -testimonies- of allegedly dismissed employees of the State Emergency Service. Their goal is to create the impression that the state leaves civilians defenseless in wartime conditions. 1. The State Emergency Service performs exclusively humanitarian tasks. The State Service for Emergency Situations is not part of the defense forces and does not have the authority to participate in hostilities. Its main task is to eliminate the consequences of shelling, rescue people, clear mines and provide first aid. 2. There are no orders for the mobilization of rescuers. No information about the mobilization or other changes in the work of the service has been published on the official resources of the State Emergency Service. Official statements of representatives of the State Emergency Service deny any assumptions about the involvement of rescuers in hostilities. 3. Russian propaganda systematically attacks humanitarian services. This is not the first case when the enemy spreads fakes about the State Emergency Service. Previously, there were rumors about a -mass flight- of rescuers from front-line cities, -weapons supply- under the guise of humanitarian aid, etc. The purpose of these information attacks is to destabilize the situation in the rear. 4. The lack of logic in the fake. In the conditions of constant missile attacks and terror on the part of the Russian Federation, the reduction of rescue units would be illogical and harmful to the country's security. On the contrary, the Ukrainian authorities are strengthening the State Emergency Service, providing it with modern equipment and technology. Such emissions are aimed at inciting mistrust of the authorities, undermining the morale of the population and devaluing the work of rescuers. They try to create the impression of chaos and disorder in the rear. As a result, citizens may begin to doubt the effectiveness of critical services and panic. How to counter fakes 1. Trust only official sources. Information should be checked on the official resources of the State Emergency Service, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other verified media. 2. Do not spread unverified information. If you see suspicious news, do not repost it without checking. It is better to clarify the facts and make sure of their reliability. 3. Report fakes. Block accounts that spread false information and report them to social network administrators. Russian propaganda continues to use fakes as a tool of hybrid warfare. The enemy will not be able to sow panic among Ukrainians, because society has already learned to distinguish truth from lies. Ukrainian rescuers remain in place, fulfilling their noble mission of saving lives. And we must all support them without allowing the enemy to undermine our faith in the state and victory.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/rosijskyj-fejk-pro-mobilizacziyu-ukrayinskyh-ryatuvalnykiv-yak-vorog-manipulyuye-pravdoyu/	2025-01-17T20:10:59-08:00

Soldiers of the Patrol Police convinced the occupier to shorten his life	The corresponding video published in its Telegram channel by the -Predator- brigade. As can be seen in the released footage, the main argument of the Defense Forces fighters to induce the occupier to commit suicide was several drops from a quadcopter. Having received shrapnel injuries as a result of the bursting of grenades, the Russian realized that no one would evacuate him and made the only correct decision for himself. -They gave the Russian a nightmare with resets. He decided not to wait for evacuation with broken legs, and&#8230; shot himself Predators can safely be called masters of persuasion!-, the patrol officers noted.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/17/bijczi-patrulnoyi-policziyi-perekonaly-okupanta-ukorotyty-sobi-viku/	2025-01-17T09:54:50-08:00
-Samovolka-, injury and service with his father: the story of Denis Governor's return to the front	The story of the fighter was publicized on the page of the 13th Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine -CHARTER-. After returning to the army, Denys turned to the command with a request to join the -Charter- brigade, where his father was already working as a driver of the -Novator- armored car. This decision became important for him - fighting together with his father was fundamental for him. -When you serve next to a loved one, it gives you extra support. We work in the same crew, one helps the other, we transport the infantry and evacuate the wounded together,- says Denys. He works on a Browning machine gun, covering his comrades. Despite the danger that is always present at the front, Denys and his father feel that their strength lies in unity. The armored car driven by the father can withstand heavy fire, but at the front, even the best equipment cannot guarantee complete safety. -The main thing is to save personnel, protect people, even if you have to risk your life,- Denys emphasizes. He recalls cases when their armored car came under heavy fire, but thanks to quick actions and support of each other, they managed to get out of the most difficult situations. For the family of Governors, it is important not only to fight, but also to be together. The support they receive from each other gives them the strength to overcome the hardships of war. -My father and I are together, and this helps us keep up,- Denys concludes.

-Hare- who hunts tanks: the story of a platoon commander of attack drones	The story of the fighter was shared on the page of the 22nd separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Before the start of the war, -Zaets- had a peaceful profession - he worked as a helicopter electrician. This knowledge became a solid foundation for him in his new role. Now he leads a platoon of strike unmanned aerial systems that play a key role on the front line. -I quickly learned to work with FPV drones. Knowledge of electronics and practical experience made it possible to adapt quickly. Now I am responsible for receiving, checking, transferring drones to positions and using them,- says Zayets. He notes that FPV drones are an indispensable tool on the modern battlefield. -On one of the directions, we received the coordinates of an enemy tank moving in our direction. With the help of two drones, worth up to 50 thousand hryvnias each, we were able to destroy this tank. It was a significant victory, because a tank is a serious piece of equipment,- he says. -Hare- is sure that modern war requires not only bravery, but also a deep understanding of modern military technologies. He and his comrades work every day to improve their skills and stay one step ahead of the enemy. -The main thing is to fly out, hit and come back,- shares the credo of -Hare-. As reported by ArmiyaInform, Serhiy under the pseudonym -Bala- is a serviceman of the Chernihiv Territorial Center for Recruitment and Social Support.

Goodbye school, hello assault - the Russians are attacking yesterday's schoolchildren	Maksym Taran, press officer, told about this on the air of the -Edyny Novyny- telethon teams of NSU -Rubizh-. Among other things, according to him, the enemy works in combination with small groups of infantry. As a rule, these are 4-6 people who advance on Ukrainian positions every 20-30 minutes. Such assaults happen all the time. The stormtrooper contingent is the most diverse. -We are looking at the documentation of the killed, destroyed enemies. We see that passports of military personnel born in 2005-2006 are more common. This is if someone thinks that only drunkards and grandfathers are sent to mass assaults. They also send young men who don't even have a weapon record yet,- Maksym Taran said. As reported ArmyInform, -Rubizh- showed a selection of Russians' attempts to hide after the failure meat assault.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/17/do-pobachennya-shkola-pryvit-shturm-rosiyany-kydayut-v-ataky-vchorashnih-shkolyariv/	2025-01-17T08:52:48-08:00

Near Vovchansk, the occupiers walk over the corpses of their soldiers - DPSU	About this notify fighters of the State Border Service of Ukraine. -With the arrival of bad weather, the occupiers do not stop trying to push the Defense Forces away from the city of Vovchansk. Their tactic is to storm our positions under cover of rain or fog. Under such conditions, it is more difficult for Ukrainian drones to detect the movement of the enemy's equipment and manpower,- says the comment to the released footage from the frontline. Speaking about the tactics of the Soviet Union of the Russian Federation in this area, the head of the outpost of the first commandant of the rapid response brigade -Forpost- on the pseudo -Moroz- draws attention to the fact that the fields there are currently literally littered with dead occupants. -Thanks to remote field mining, drone strikes, use of FPV systems and artillery fire, the invaders will suffer devastating losses. Fields and landings are literally littered with enemy bodies. But even these losses do not stop the occupiers - they continue to move forward, stepping on the corpses of their comrades,- the DPSU notes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/17/bilya-vovchanska-okupanty-jdut-po-trupah-svoyih-bijcziv-dpsu/	2025-01-17T08:12:28-08:00

The bodyguard of the Russian propagandist Prilepin was informed of the suspicion	This was reported by the Security Service of Ukraine on Friday, January 17. As noted, the specified persons fell into the hands of the Defense Forces during the battles in the Pokrovsky, Siversky and Toretsk directions at the end of 2024. -One of the prisoners turned out to be a 32-year-old Russian who guarded the Kremlin's -warlord- Yevgeny (Zakhar) Prilepin during his trips to the temporarily occupied part of the Luhansk region. According to the investigation, the Russian militant joined the -Zorya- battalion of the terrorist organization -LNR- even before the start of the full-scale war. There, he was appointed as a sniper-reconnaissance,- the SBU said. Since that time, the militant fought against the ATO forces, and after the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, it continued its participation in the capture of populated areas of the Luhansk region. The rest of the suspects are traitors who fought on the side of the invaders in the Siverskodonetsk, Lysychansk, Rubizhny, Bakhmut, Pokrovsk, Pisok and Ozaryanivka districts. Now the captured accomplices of the occupiers face from 15 years in prison to life imprisonment.

It works even under water — the Defense Forces received a new metal detector	About this reported on January 17 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The Trembita metal detector has earned positive feedback from Ukrainian deminers. With its help, metal objects and weakly electrically conductive materials are detected without reducing sensitivity in difficult conditions, for example, in mineralized soils. The metal detector is intended for individual use and has an appropriate degree of protection. It is sealed, shockproof and waterproof, so it can be used for underwater demining. Also among the advantages of the metal detector: — Ergonomic (speed of transition from compact to working condition). — Compact. — Lightweight (no more than 2.4 kg). - Easy to use (easy automatic configuration). - The time of continuous operation is not less than 48 hours. This indicator is higher than that of foreign counterparts. — Can show the presence of anti-personnel or anti-tank mines in the soil, identify the most common types of Russian mines, such as TM-62M, PFM-1, F-1, RGD-5, PMN-2 and many others. -Ukraine is currently the most mined country in the world. Our sappers use various means of detecting mines and unexploded ordnance. Among them is the Trembita detector, which not only meets world standards, but sometimes surpasses foreign analogues. This is confirmed by positive feedback from demining groups,- emphasized the head of the Main Department of Mine Action, Civil Defense and Environmental Security, Colonel Ruslan Beregulya. According to him, another advantage of the Trembita metal detector is the presence of the Pinpoint function, which is necessary to determine the exact location of mines or unexploded ordnance that the deminer is looking for. This not only facilitates the search, but also avoids physical exposure to dangerous war remains during their excavation. As reported by ArmiyaInform, during 2024 the defense department codified and put into operation in the Defense Forces of Ukraine, almost 30 samples of automotive equipment for movement in difficult terrain and off-road conditions. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/17/praczyuye-navit-pid-vodoyu-syly-oborony-otrymaly-novyj-metalodetektor/	2025-01-17T05:53:54-08:00

As reported by ArmyInform, at the General Staff of the Armed Forces named two directions where the enemy is strengthened attacks our units.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/17/vorog-zapustyv-majzhe-900-droniv-kamikadze-i-zdijsny-ponad-4300-obstriliv-genshtab-zsu/	2025-01-16T21:18:39-08:00
- Meat stormtroopers - under concrete slabs and an attack on a tank with 6 FPV drones at once: comba...	-The main task of the tank units here is to stop the advance of the enemy's infantry, destroy enemy dugouts and shelters, destroy fire equipment, armored groups, and various heavy equipment of the Rashists. That is, to make the assault actions of the occupiers in the Kurakhovo district impossible as much as possible. Usually, on this part of the front, tanks work with -direct fire-. This is a very effective way of deterring offensive actions. The targets of the rockets, which are located at a distance of up to 4-5 kilometers from the tank, are hit. Recently, our tank crews have been carrying out combat missions, inflicting fire damage on the occupiers who were near the settlement of Zelenivka. The enemy suffers losses in manpower and manages to stop his advance to the Donetsk route. The enemy wants to enter this road at any cost, cut the communication and logistics routes for our units and create a new -bag- in Dachny. Just the other day, our tanks -dismantled- enemy infantry in shelters. Then it was possible to bury the -meat attack aircraft- under the concrete slabs of the hangar, which were about to carry out offensive actions. How many of them there were, of course, cannot be counted. But it was on this day that the Rashists from this village did not attack. Played to get ahead. We perform such tasks constantly, there is no such thing as a tank just standing in the waiting area. There is always plenty of combat work. Considering that the tank battalion was formed relatively recently, I think that the guys are well done. All are mobilized, of different ages and from different regions of Ukraine. Military tours continue, work is boiling day and night. There are no such tank duels now. Yes, it was more massive at the beginning of the invasion and in 2022-2023. But now the enemy is afraid to enter the line of fire, he perfectly understands the threat. And, in addition, today the occupiers feel a certain shortage of combat equipment. According to the extreme calculations of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the enemy lost about 9,800 tanks in the war against Ukraine. Tank battalion 157 of a separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine fights on T-64 tanks of various modifications. In combat, these machines have proven themselves in a very positive way. A 42-ton diesel tank with hundreds of millimeters of armor, three crew members and an automatic loader for the 125 mm main gun. Compared to the -72-, the T-64 has a simpler fire control system, and this gives a higher rate of fire. This is how it happens in battle: the one who fired and hit the target faster remained alive and won. More reliable undercarriage, but at the same time the engine is a little weaker than the T-72, T-80 and tanks of other modifications. The charging mechanism in the -64th volume- is a little more complicated, again, unlike the T-72. Here, the charging mechanism consists of three main parts. These are electric, hydraulic and mechanical. In the -72- it's simpler: electrical and mechanical. That is, there is no intermediate link - the hydraulic part. The 5TDF engine is generally very picky about temperature conditions. If the T-72 engine can be started without warming up at a temperature of minus 10-15°, then the T-64 must be warmed up. Sometimes it even happens that during higher temperatures it is necessary to warm up additionally. This is a problem at the moment. But in terms of other parameters and combat capabilities, this tank is almost not inferior to the T-72. About reservation, the tower in the -64th- is better protected, the armor body is almost the same. In terms of speed on the track, these two tanks do not differ in principle. But in hard-to-reach areas of the terrain, the T-64 still has better passability, it has tracks that -squeeze out- the swamp. The T-72 has a flat track, so it is heavier. Today, the T-64 remains the main battle tank of the Armed Forces. The maximum firing range of the cannon is up to 10 km, and the effective fire is 8.5 km. It is equipped with night vision devices, a thermal imager, which is integrated into the gunner's aiming system, and modern navigation and communication systems. The biggest threat right now is enemy UAVs. What exactly does the anti-drone protection of the T-64 tank consist of? There is passive and active protection against enemy FPV drones. Passive is a welded grill, -shroud-, protective -crowns- or they are also called -grills-. Active protection is, of course, electronic warfare systems. But as combat experience shows, now the enemy is actively using FPV on fiber optics. And, unfortunately, anti-drone protection is actually leveled off, so EW means can neither detect enemy FPV drones nor interfere with their work by suppressing radio communication between the remote control and the -fpvish- itself. Therefore, passive protection of the tank is currently playing a more effective role. In real combat, it saves the crew from destruction. The other day, the T-64 crew was working on a route and was attacked by 6 enemy FPV drones. They hit the motor-transmission compartment, because of which the tank stopped. But the -mangal- fulfilled its protection mission, the crew is alive. In our direction, the enemy is trying to use anti-tank missile complexes less. With what this is connected, perhaps with a shortage of anti-tank guided missiles. A tank without a crew is nothing. It's just a combat vehicle with armor and weapons. A trained and motivated crew is needed for a tank to effectively perform tasks in battle. The Training Centers of the Armed Forces carry out professional training of mechanics-drivers, gunner-operators and tank commanders. It lasts only 20 days. This is far from enough to professionally train the mobilized to drive a car and deliver targeted strikes at the enemy. Training should be increased and, most importantly, the quality of the training should be improved. Theory is great, but the practical component needs to be increased. This is especially true for driving and shooting. People of absolutely different age, psychotype and motivation come to us. Some grasp everything quickly, while others learn slowly. Some do not want anything at all: neither to know nor to learn. This especially applies to those people who came to us very recently. It can be seen that people do not fully understand why they join the army, that they need to protect the state and their native homes from an aggressor. The enemy will not stop himself, we must destroy him. Therefore, it is impossible to expect that, after professional training, a soldier who was previously a civilian will come and fully fight the enemy on tanks. Of course, we are trying to make up for certain shortcomings in his training on the ground, in the military unit. In order for the level of execution of combat missions to be better, and there were fewer losses. It also happened that such -specialists- came that they did not know how to fix even small technical problems. For example, the coarse fuel cleaning filter is clogged. Tankers are required to know the technical capabilities, operation and maintenance of the tank. And to constantly keep the combat vehicle in combat readiness. This is the Aziz. In modern warfare, tanks are a key element in both defensive and offensive operations. They provide mobile firepower and are well protected by armor. Some a la experts say that the role of tanks in the modern Russian-Ukrainian war has been somewhat downplayed, arguing that this is due to the scale and intensity of the use of UAVs. Especially FPV drones. But this is not the case. When a tank comes at you with anti-drone protection and EW plus it shoots and there are no anti-tank means to knock it down, it's very scary. This is a destructive force that is almost impossible to stop. Do not forget about shooting from closed firing positions. This is also an effective way to defeat the enemy, but at a longer distance. The tank can maneuver, change positions for strikes. But most importantly, it stops the advance of the enemy, who attacks continuously. This is colossal fire support for our infantry units. Ultimately helping to keep our frontline defenders alive. How many cases have there already been when using fire from tank weapons in interaction with drones and other technical means, columns of heavy armored vehicles of the enemy on different areas of the front were -dismantled- at a long distance. Tanks do this job effectively. One thing is a direct hit by a 125 mm projectile, then the equipment is completely destroyed and becomes inoperable, and another thing is drones, which carry a much smaller warhead and do not always manage to hit the enemy. Therefore, I would not be so categorical, unlike some experts. I have a counter question: how are you going to win back territories captured by the enemy, break through their defensive positions, and so on? The question, of course, is rhetorical! Tank Battalion Commander Stanislav is a 2018 graduate of the National Academy of Ground Forces. He is from Uzhhorod. Immediately after graduation, he got the position of tank platoon commander of the 17th separate tank brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He met the Great War as a company commander in the city of Shchastya, Luhansk region. Then, with paratroopers, the 79th brigade held the defense of the city. For a short period of time, he was the deputy commander of the battalion, then he was promoted - he became the chief of staff of the tank battalion. In 2022, he performed combat missions in the Severodonetsk, Kreminnaya, Lysychansky Refinery and Lyman areas. Then the direction of the village of Velika Novosilka. He participated in the counteroffensive and the liberation of the territory of the right-bank Kherson region. Then again the defense of Donetsk region. Last year, he headed the tank battalion of the 157th separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/17/myasni-shturmovyky-pid-betonnymy-plytamy-ta-ataka-na-tank-odrazu-6-fpv-dronamy-kombat-zhulik-pro-boyi-pid-kurahovym/	2025-01-16T21:06:52-08:00
IRIS-T is not the only one: experts talked about the newest drone fighter from the German manufactur...	The manufacturer of these special equipment is the Diehl Defense company, which is well known in our country thanks to the IRIS-T air defense system developed by it, about which our editors have repeatedly told in their reviews. Researcher of military equipment and armaments, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities of the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny Andriy Haruk told about the new complex for combating Russian UAVs in a comment for ArmiyaInform. - Andrii Ivanovich, what do you know about this complex, which is marked with the rather mysterious name Kinetic Defense Vehicles (-Kinetic Defense Vehicles-, in Ukrainian)? - It should be noted that this system, which is also known by the acronym -KDV-, is a fairly new product of German gunsmiths. It was first introduced less than a year ago, in February 2024, at the Enforce TAC exhibition. - In the very name of this special equipment, -sewn- and the determination of the mobility of this weapon. - The KDV is based on an extended version of the Mercedes-Benz G jeep, known as the Enok MBB, which ensures high mobility and cross-country ability. A remote-controlled Slinger (R400S) turret from the Australian company Electro Optic Systems (EOS) with a 7.62×51 mm machine gun is installed on the chassis. The mass of the module is 355 kg. This turret is versatile and can be equipped with a 12.7 mm machine gun, a 40 mm automatic grenade launcher, or a 30 mm M230 cannon. From 2023 It is supplied to the Armed Forces of Ukraine and installed on modernized M113 armored personnel carriers and armored vehicles of the Praktika company. The detection system includes the Diehl Defense electro-optical system with machine vision technology for automatic target detection with a 360° field of view and the EchoGuard radar of the American company Echodyne, capable of detecting drones of the Phantom 4 type at a distance of up to 1 km and Matrice 600 at a distance of up to 1.4 km. - What else did the German gunsmiths put in this device? - Thanks to the combination of optical and radar systems, the KDV effectively detects and tracks small UAVs in various conditions. The minigun provides a high density of fire, allowing you to effectively destroy drones. The design allows the system to be adapted to different requirements, including the replacement of the chassis and the combat module. - And who manages KDV? - The crew of the complex consists of two people. The calculation is housed in an enclosed rear cockpit with control consoles for the anti-drone system. A report posted on the official portal of the German government states that according to data for December 2024, Germany transferred to Ukraine 12 such systems. — Your expert opinion on this latest piece of equipment? To what extent is this weaponry promising? - The Kinetic Defense Vehicle is a good solution in the field of local combat against UAVs. The high-density minigun in combination with the EchoGuard radar and opto-electronic station allows you to effectively neutralize both reconnaissance and strike drones. And from the point of view of the modularity of the design, it is quite possible to mount such systems on Ukrainian chassis (for example, on Kozak armored vehicles). In turn, experts of the defense portal IKK Defense Express (DE), who also studied the Kinetic Defense Vehicle pointed out that the Diehl surveillance system looks like a rather interesting addition to the capabilities of the combat module from EOS, because it allows you to detect targets in passive mode without exposing yourself to the radiation of the surveillance radar. -It should be added that the armament of the Kinetic Defense Vehicle can obviously be changed at the request of the customer, and instead of a minigun, an automatic cannon can be installed there. The chassis can also be changed, the requirements for which are quite moderate, because the weight of the Slinger is 355 kg,- stated researchers from DE.

-Antichrist- on the coat of arms: -narrow- invented new sensations about Ukraine	On the coat of arms, in addition to the anchor and golden wheat, Russian -symbolism experts- saw something more sinister. For example, anchor lines form ancient satanic symbols, and the waves of the Black Sea are nothing more than a coded sign of the devil. A little more, and they would find there a secret QR code for a ticket to hell. I was especially pleased with the comments about the colors. Blue and gold? Of course! These are symbols of universal evil! Although, if you recall, these colors are also on the coat of arms&#8230; of Ukraine. But who looks at such trifles when it is urgent to save the world from -Satanists-. Russian propaganda seems to have taken a new course: if they fail to intimidate with missiles, they will try to demoralize with mystical horror stories. Because what could be scarier than a regional coat of arms with supposedly hidden signs of dark forces? Well, except that it's a Ukrainian FPV drone with hello on board. What's next? Will Ukrainian vyshyvanka be called clothing for occult rituals? And the borscht is an elixir of immortality created according to the ancient recipes of dark magicians? Oh, sorry, there was already borscht. Everything is simple. When the country is going nuts, prices are rising, and rights are disappearing, it's always convenient to distract people with stories about an -external enemy.- Especially when the enemy is not just -Nazis- (that record is already broken), but entire followers of the Antichrist! It immediately becomes clear why nothing works for them: evil itself is at war with them! While Russian propagandists invent yet another fairy tale, Ukraine continues to fight, work and keep order. The coat of arms of Odesa is a symbol of history, strength and freedom. And we will leave all this nonsense about the -seal of the Antichrist- to the conscience of those who see -Ukronazi Satan- even in a cloud in the sky. And you know what's the funniest thing? There is nothing to scare Ukrainians anymore. Because if we have not been broken by shelling, war and even Russian propaganda, then some invented -seal- certainly will not. And if someone really wants to see real evil, let them look in the mirror. P.S. And yes, next time throw something more original. Because the Antichrist is fed up with everyone.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/17/antyhryst-na-gerbi-uzki-vygadaly-novi-sensacziyi-pro-ukrayinu/	2025-01-16T20:10:37-08:00

Ice swimming for $8000: the violator's attempt to cross the border failed	About this informs State Border Service of Ukraine. The response group stopped two men - residents of Poltava and Chernihiv regions in front of engineering barriers. The third violator overcame the barrier and ran into the water. Having crossed a few meters, he turned towards the shore. Then he went into the water again and came back again. -The body shrinks, the lungs narrow, there is nothing to breathe, as convulsions take place- - these are the impressions of the attempt to overcome the icy Tisza River shared by a resident of Lviv Oblast, who was saved by border guards of the Mukachevo detachment. After that, first of all, the border outfit gave the violator an opportunity to warm up. He then said that the current was very strong and the water was cold, so he turned back. -It's better to give up. Than to swim across and drown,- concluded the detainee and does not recommend others to test their fate in this way. All three detainees were issued administrative reports for attempting to illegally cross the border. 2 Art. 204-1 of the Code of Administrative Offenses. They admitted that they paid the organizer of the illegal transfer $8,000 each. The search for organizers who send people to the cold Tysa continues. -It should be noted that the organization of the illegal transportation of persons across the state border of Ukraine, to a dangerous place for the life or health of the person being transported, is punishable by deprivation of liberty for a period of five to seven years,- the DPSU noted. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/16/kryzhanyj-zaplyv-za-8000-sproba-porushnyka-peretnuty-kordon-provalylasya/	2025-01-16T11:53:48-08:00

Ruins instead of rails: public transport in the style of the Russian world	informs about this Center of National Resistance. It is noted that from February 1, 40 Russian rubles will cost a ride in public transport in temporarily occupied Luhansk. And this despite the fact that there is no such public transport in the city. Locals have already gotten used to the fact that you cannot count on a route, tram or trolleybus. Not having a schedule or enough suitable transport is the least of the inconveniences. After all, the fleet is destroyed and it is simply dangerous to ride city buses. And the lack of drivers, who are simply mobilized into the enemy's army, completely destroyed the functionality of public transport in temporarily occupied Ukraine. As ArmyInform reported, in the occupied territory of Luhansk the condition of the sewage system is close to emergency, but the occupiers did not give commands to the local utilities solve this problem.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/16/ruyiny-zamist-rejok-gromadskyj-transport-u-styli-russkogo-myra/	2025-01-16T11:22:39-08:00

Our pilots spotted the enemy near the damaged equipment. The kamikaze drone tried to hit the Russian, but he began to dodge with maneuvers. The Dronari accepted the challenge and began to wear down the invader. Soon he went all-in and tried to shoot down our drone with a throw of his machine gun. He didn't hit, he continued to dance, and when he tried to lift the weapon from the ground, our pilots gave him a game over. -We do not leave any enemy unpunished.

Drunk, bruised, but without a balalaika: the Russian tried to escape to Slovakia	About this notifies the State Border Service of Ukraine. The 36-year-old man was found 50 meters from the border near the Palad Komarivtsi branch of the Chopsky detachment. He moved through thickets with bruises on his face. During the inspection, it was found that the man is a citizen of Russia and previously lived in Prykarpattia. Last fall, the migration service decided on his forced return to the Russian Federation. The Russian man spent several months in a temporary stay center for foreigners, but later decided to enter the EU illegally, avoiding the established exit procedure. The man reached Transcarpathia, where he drank alcohol -for courage-, lost his orientation to the local area and wandered through the village of Mali Selmentsi. During the journey, he got into a conflict with local residents, after which he was left without personal belongings. In the end, while moving in the direction of the border, he was detained by border guards.

Today, it is worth noting the soldiers of the 422nd separate battalion of unmanned systems, the 406th separate artillery brigade, the 425th separate assault battalion -Skala-, the 25th separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade, the 68th separate hunting brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush, who are effectively destroying the enemy, causing him significant losses in manpower and techniques As reported by ArmiyaInform, at the Headquarters of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the United Armed Forces of NATO in Europe presentation of the documentary film took place -Operation Kursk-. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/16/vorog-najbilshe-atakuvav-na-pokrovskomu-ta-kurskomu-napryamkah-genshtab-zsu/	2025-01-15T21:14:44-08:00
Surrounded Mariupol, complex operations at headquarters and wounded from Kurshchyna: the story of an...	The Russians came to his home, his native Donetsk region, twice: in 2014 - in Horlivka, and in 2022 - in Mariupol. He is an anesthesiologist. During the siege of Mariupol, he rescued the wounded for 21 days. Later, he left the city on the coast of the Sea of ​​Azov - when the Russians entered the territory of the hospital where he worked. Now Yelizar Grankov is in the ranks of the 71st military mobile hospital in the Sumy region. Coordinator of the department of anesthesiology and resuscitation, intensive care. Together with their brothers, they rescue the wounded from the Kursk direction. The resident of the department of anesthesiology joined the ranks of the Defense Forces in June 2023. He managed to get the primary officer rank - junior lieutenant. ArmyInform talked to the doctor during his vacation and shortly before his new business trip - about working in surrounded Mariupol and how he left the city (on a scooter, imagine!); about how he joined the ranks of the Defense Forces and rescued the wounded in the Sumy direction; about why science and military medicine should walk side by side in the current Ukrainian realities. And not only that. - Doctors in Mariupol civil hospitals are probably the people who first felt the war, because they had to work with a large number of wounded civilians. How intense were those days for you? - We felt the war very quickly. Literally half an hour after the first massive strikes, 5-6 AM on February 24, 2022. And then three weeks of intensive work, 24/7. At that time, I worked in several public institutions: in the 1st hospital in the city of Mariupol, a regional hospital, and in one private hospital. The footage from the Mariupol hospital in the tape -20 days in Mariupol- was filmed in our facility. Journalists found refuge in us and worked. — Mariupol in the spring of 2022. What was the most difficult thing for a doctor in a surrounded city? - We ran out of drugs, but we were allowed to take everything from the hospital pharmacy, and pharmacists and pharmacists brought drugs from the nearest pharmacies. But still: there were not enough drugs for the volumes and the number of people who came. Too many people, too great a flow of wounded. —What is the scariest memory you have during this time? And what, on the contrary, is a warm memory from that time that warms you? - You know, there was actually a lot of different things. But the worst thing is to hide children&#8230; It will be remembered forever, until the end of life - when it is simply impossible to save a small child who was torn apart by shells, fragments, bullets. I don't know what could be worse&#8230; Among the good memories is working with colleagues. Yes, then everyone was tired - but they helped each other, insured, worked, despite the fatigue. We lived these difficult three weeks in Mariupol as one big family, which fulfilled the main task of our lives: to save. In the surrounded Mariupol, there was purely -pure- medicine, without any other unnecessary thoughts at all. Just like now in the army - together with your brothers, your team, you don't think about money or anything - you just stood together and did your job. —You were leaving Mariupol through Berdyansk, and in one of the interviews you said that you managed to successfully pass one of the roadblocks thanks to your mother. Please tell us more about this episode. How many roadblocks were overcome in total? — There were more than 20 roadblocks. Some were passed quite quickly, some had long checks, they almost got into their underpants. The most difficult checkpoint was, in fact, in Berdyansk, where the -DNRivtsi- were stationed. We were also put under machine gun barrels to be shot, and when they saw that I was born in Horlivka, they asked why I didn't fight for -Mother Russia-. At first I traveled from the city on a scooter. Drove on it to a roadblock outside the city - then it discharged. We wanted to catch up with the car where my wife and father were. But it didn't work out, I realized that I wouldn't make it. There was a rather depressed state. Then my brother and I found the minibus where our mother was - and it turned out that there might be places for us too. There were six other young men there. Agree, it is difficult to drive through roadblocks with such a composition(smiles - ed.). And so it began at the checkpoint in Berdyansk: they were clinging to tattoos, to the residence permit - to everything. And our mother said: -If you take them away, take me with them, with my sons.- So we were quickly let go with the -get the hell out of here- argument. Six of our fellow travelers remained. But that was the decisive moment&#8230; The scooter also left with us, it is still with my parents. The road from Mariupol to Dnipro took a day. - What was the trigger when you decided to take a scooter and leave Mariupol? - We have been under the Russians for three days - they captured our hospital. On March 9, the last journalists left us, and on the 12th, the Russians arrived. They were even in the operating room. I had enough for three days. Medicines were running out, shelling did not stop, FABs were beating. Well, the Russians came in - it was clear that there would be further filtering, everyone would be closely watched. And since 2015, I have been -excluded- from the DPR - I expressed my opinion a lot, let's say. That is why I decided to leave Mariupol. —You became a part of the Oscar-winning film -20 days in Mariupol-. Do you feel like a part of the weapon in the information war, which works for the benefit of the civilized world, telling the truth without embellishments and propaganda? - Understanding this media has never been &#8230; But if there is any help and it's a way to convey some of the truth about Mariupol, not obscured by Russian bullshit propaganda&#8230; They simply destroyed Mariupol. There was a terrible cauldron. And the tape did not convey the horror that was happening in the city. If there was an opportunity, it would be possible to shoot even more that would shock the world. Because from time to time it is necessary to get such a terrible truth of ours in order for it to be heard and seen. — What brought you to the ranks of the Defense Forces? After all, you initially worked in the maternity hospital in Dnipro, and this work, in your words, became -therapy- for you. Why did you decide to join the ranks of military medics? - Yes, seeing how life is born is wonderful. But in March 2023, I came to work at the Main Military Clinical Hospital, first as a civilian doctor in the cardiac resuscitation department, and three months later I was mobilized. Until then, he worked in the 4th hospital of Kyiv for seven months. Yes, I actually worked for the Ministry of Defense and was booked, but there was an opportunity to get an officer's rank in two months, and for that I had to mobilize. That is why I made this decision. - What is your impression of the courses of the military medical academy? - The general idea is ok, but I believe that few people take this course, although we have a lot of medics who do not have a military department. And they either do not go to the Armed Forces, or, having a medical education, are in the positions of sergeants. Such courses are a great idea. Although when I was studying, the teachers operated according to norms that existed even before the large-scale invasion. This, I believe, is an outdated approach, because during this time the battlefield has changed a lot, to put it mildly, in military medicine. There was a lot of outdated information when I was studying. I don't know how it is now, maybe there are already changes. But science has to keep up with real war. A banal example: now there are FPV drones on the battlefield, which did not exist two years ago. Therefore, the academy must also change very quickly, transform its approaches, introduce new information into educational courses. - They say that war is always a catalyst for some kind of change. How is this reflected in your work as an anesthesiologist, for example, now in Sumshchyna? What has changed for the better, and what has changed for the worse? - There is development. As an anesthesiologist, I worked in operating rooms, in various departments, with adults, with children, in intensive care units, with seriously ill patients, etc. That is, there was a structure to how you work. Then covid began - the structure of work changed radically. And so the war began. And here, too, medicine is actually completely different: with injuries, with massive defects, with tourniquet syndromes, with bleeding, lung injuries. This was something special in the non-war period, and it is, unfortunately, the absolute norm now, during the war. And it is necessary to adjust to this new norm - to save and treat completely different injuries and other patients. Yes, the hospital has cool moments in terms of possibilities, analyses. There you are treated both in the operating room and in the intensive care unit. And when you work abroad, then&#8230; you are constantly -travelling-. 2024 I spent almost entirely in -travel-. When you arrive at a point, you need to get to know the doctors, the chief, other battalions and brigades, and medics. Lots of communication. It also happened that when we arrived at the stabilization point, we had to start everything from scratch: find a place to live, how to arrange and prepare everything. This is not taught anywhere - it comes with experience. In addition, standing in the northern direction, where the seriously wounded, learned many manipulations. It was at the -stabik- that he discovered a new picture of his work as an anesthesiologist: this work is fast, and the result of this work is whether he saved or not. Only this price. I can be proud of the fact that, thanks to the work of our team, thanks to the number of people there, none of our wounded died, everyone was saved. We had the maximum efficiency. Yes, there were -two hundred- - but they were already brought to us as such. And we tried to get people from that world anyway. We have had several such cases. But, unfortunately, the dead cannot be revived&#8230; - Can you remember a case when a seemingly hopeless wounded man arrived, and you pulled him out of the other world by an invisible thread? - There are more than enough such cases&#8230; From what can be remembered&#8230; Once a soldier was brought in with a wound in the leg, the surgeon began to apply an anastamosis to him in order to save the limb&#8230; And at the same moment, a senior lieutenant, unit commander, was brought to us. He was in agony, just gasping for air, pale, bleeding. He was given oxygen. There was a wound to the chest. Intubated. Adrenaline turned on. Intensive work continued, but the lungs still did not work and he could not keep the pressure. We transfused him with blood, put plasma&#8230; All this lasted about an hour. We tried to stabilize him, while the surgeon simultaneously saved another wounded man and his limb. Before that, he also placed a drain in the wounded officer's chest. After some time, it was thanks to this drainage that we realized that there was internal bleeding - a hole in the lung. We fully stabilized this injured person only after the surgeon had sutured the vessels and tissues. Sent to Sumy. Later it turned out that the officer had six broken ribs and six bleeding arteries. Our surgeon sewed up five of them in the initial conditions. Military survivor. This is one of the cases. And there were many of them in the conditions of the stabilization point. Our surgeon even performed an open heart massage several times: he cut the ribcage and pumped it. But these are just those cases when, unfortunately, a dead person was brought to us. And it was already such a gesture of last hope: either it will start or it won't. - What advice would you give to civilians who are afraid right now? Afraid, including joining the ranks of the Defense Forces? How to overcome fear? God&#8230; Being afraid of an uncle from the Military Commissariat is not something to be afraid of in life. Absolutely not. And in open access there is a lot of information about how to learn something, understand or motivate yourself and join the ranks of the Defense Forces. People are tired of war. Unfortunately But this is a normal, natural reaction. A person does not want to fight for 5 years, does not want to fight for 10 years. Everyone generally wants a little, little triumphant war - that would be class! - You left home twice: in 2014 - Horlivka, in 2022 - Mariupol? What gives you stability and the strength to hold on, go forward? - Good question&#8230; But in this context, I ask myself more about something else: what gives my parents the strength to hold on? They are now in their 70s. She lost her home 11 years ago. Three years ago, they lost their second home. And for them, the motivation to live is family, grandchildren&#8230; Neither money nor housing is a motivation here. Yes, the Russians took my house, then they took my house a second time. But&#8230; life was not taken away? I continue to live. And you have to continue living anywhere. The main thing is to be in Ukraine. What motivates me is that the Russians do not come here and destroy everything here, kill my child and my wife. Because I saw with my own eyes what happens where Russia comes. I am motivated by the idea of ​​my Ukrainian world. And in order not to be under the -Russian rule-. - What will be the end of the Russian-Ukrainian war for you? - And this is a very good question&#8230; Okay, so a truce is called—how much? A month, two, a year, three? The threat will still hang over us as long as the Russian Federation and its ideology exist. As long as the government and ideological attitudes in the heads of the Russian Federation do not change, until they realize that it is not necessary to trespass on their own land - until then there will be a constant permanent threat. Because this is an absolutely frozen nation. Well, we will go to the borders, for example, in 1991 - but who will prevent the Russians from unexpectedly launching a hundred missiles at us? And come here again? The Russians must admit and say that Ukraine is no longer part of the -development- plans of the Russian Federation. And the guarantees of the Western world are also important. Although we understand that now the world is shaking in all directions&#8230; And no one really knows what will happen next.

Economic results of 2024 and forecast for 2025: expert opinion	The year 2024 - the third year of a large-scale war - passed under the sign of the stabilization of the Ukrainian economy. After falling by 29% in 2022, our gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an initial 5.3% in 2023 and is expected to grow by around 4% in 2024. Thus, the national economy was able to avoid further declines, but it will take several more years to reach the level of 2021. The main factor of stabilization is the timely arrival of foreign financial aid. At the end of 2023, the situation was as uncertain as possible, as the European Union and the United States constantly postponed the adoption of multibillion-dollar support packages for Ukraine. However, in February (EU) and April (USA), the votes did take place, and we were able to cover the budget deficit in the amount of $3-5 billion every month. We start 2025 with a much greater margin of confidence. Ukraine can expect to receive more than $13 billion from the EU (Ukraine Facility program), more than $19 billion from revenues from frozen Russian assets under the ERA 7 plan, $3 billion from the IBRD, almost $3 billion from the IMF, as well as $1 billion from Great Britain. During the year, these funds should be enough to compensate for the deficit of the state budget in the amount of 25% of GDP. The gradual transition of the Ukrainian economy to a military mode continues. During the large-scale war, the capacity of the defense-industrial complex (OPK) increased 20 times, and in general, more than 500 companies of various forms of ownership work in the industry. During 2024, the volume of current contracts for the purchase of weapons exceeded half a trillion hryvnias (almost $15 billion), about half of which were concluded with Ukrainian manufacturers. to more than $400 million. Currently, there are more than 300 defense tech companies operating in Ukraine, the largest market segments are drones (19%), robotics (13%), artificial intelligence (13%). The most dynamically developing defense technology sector is production of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Substantial government investments contributed to an increase in the production of drones by more than 100 times. By the end of 2024, almost 100% of UAVs purchased by the state will be manufactured in Ukraine. According to the strategy of the Ministry of Strategic Industries, in 2024 Ukraine should have produced one million FPV drones and two million drones of all types in general. Unlike Ukraine, which thanks to foreign support has not yet before the full transition of the economy to military rails, the Russian economy is now completely dependent on the war machine. Moscow is forced to apply extraordinary fiscal and monetary policy measures to keep the country in normal economic conditions. For example, to constantly raise the central bank's discount rate in order to reduce the level of inflation. In July 2024, the Ministry of Finance tried to increase tax revenues by 4-5% of GDP, but due to the negative reaction of citizens, this initiative was withdrawn. However, in September, the Parliament still adopted a less rigid package of tax changes: an increase in the military levy on salaries from 1.5% to 5%, an increase in taxes for individual entrepreneurs, etc. Increasing taxes by itself for any which conditions are a heavy blow to the economy. In times of a large-scale war, it will have a particularly severe effect, taking away a significant potential for growth from the national economy. Shifting the burden of war onto the shoulders of the citizens of a belligerent country has always been a last resort when it is no longer possible to finance the war through income from abroad. Probably, the government takes such a step, having realized that Ukraine is in for a significant decrease in foreign support, or it will not be enough in the future. It is not yet known whether the Cabinet of Ministers will be able to collect the planned amount of tax revenues in full. However, it will definitely have the following consequences: the tax base will decrease due to the shadowing of the economy and conflicts between business and administrative bodies will increase. According to various estimates, in 2025 up to 50% of our economy will be in the shadows. Risks for the Ukrainian economy remain unchanged throughout the entire period of a large-scale war. Conducting active hostilities inside the country, constant shelling of peaceful cities, problems with electricity supply lead to the following negative consequences: a reduction in the number of economically active population due to emigration, a decrease in the volume of domestic and foreign investment in Ukrainian business, a significant increase in the costs of doing business. The increase in the inflation rate in 2024 to more than 10% is precisely due to the fact that entrepreneurs need to spend significantly more than before. The National Bank predicts a decrease in unemployment to 10-12% in 2025 (it was 14% at the end of 2024), but this is primarily due to an increase in the labor shortage. Another risk is the instability of the hryvnia exchange rate, although Ukraine is now able to control the main monetary variables without extreme actions. In particular, thanks to foreign revenues, the National Bank has been maintaining a sufficiently high level of international reserves for the third year - $35-45 billion, which makes it possible to prevent significant changes in the hryvnia exchange rate. But in 2024, the NBU's currency interventions to support the exchange rate increased by 20% compared to the previous year, which means that it costs us more and more to keep the exchange rate from sharp jumps. Ukraine's national debt is 92% of GDP, and in 2025 will exceed 100% of GDP. This signals high risks for the debt sustainability of public finances. However, in relation to our own GDP, we owe less than most of the completely peaceful G7 countries: the USA, France, Great Britain, Canada, Japan. 2025, the Ukrainian economy begins with slogans of readiness to continue a large-scale war in the long term . The increase in defense spending should strengthen Ukraine's stability in the long-term resistance to the occupiers. Hopes for Western support remain key, but the government is already preparing for possible challenges caused by a potential reduction in foreign aid, even if these preparatory actions harm the national economy. Given Russia's colossal military budget, our allies must realize the inevitability of military realities in the center of Europe for many years to come. Even if the front line is frozen, the pursuit of weapons will continue, because Russia is not going to give up its territorial claims. At most, the resources of the entire West, which can be freed up thanks to the cessation of active hostilities, should be thrown into the maximum strengthening of the Ukrainian war machine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/16/ekonomichni-pidsumky-2024-go-ta-prognoz-na-2025-rik-dumka-eksperta/	2025-01-15T20:51:16-08:00
Never Sleep: The Pentagon has announced the deployment of a new AI-based aerial surveillance system	This advanced system, designed to protect strategic facilities such as the White House, the Capitol and the US Supreme Court, is a significant step in strengthening air security, ArmyInform reports. -This is part of a broader effort to prevent threats similar to the events of September 11, 2001, when hijacked aircraft targeted important symbolic and strategic facilities, including the Pentagon,- the United States Department of Defense emphasized. The new system, known as Enhanced Regional Situational Awareness (ERSA), combines advanced visual recognition cameras and lasers. It includes AI-based identification and tracking capabilities, offering significant improvements over older similar equipment. Manufactured by technology company Teleidoscope, this system replaces equipment installed in 2002, which itself was a post-9/11 replacement for previous technologies. ERSA cameras feature both electro-optical and infrared imaging, high-definition resolution, and features such as infrared coloration that improve target detection using thermal signatures. These capabilities are further supported by a laser rangefinder that accurately measures the distance and height of objects. According to US Air Force Master Sergeant Kendrick Wilburn, who directs operations at the Joint Air Defense Operations Center (JADOC), the system can automatically engage and track moving targets using machine learning algorithms. The more the system is used, the more accurate it becomes, improving its own overall efficiency. -If we need to verify some radar data that we can't say for sure what the object is, we can use the camera system as a viewing asset at that fixed location to assist our technicians in the verification process,- Wilburn noted. . If ERSA operators determine that an unidentified aircraft poses a threat, they can provide early warning to unauthorized air traffic by notifying the pilot of the need to change direction and leave the special flight rules area in the Washington metropolitan area. The system also includes a visual warning device using a red-green laser that alerts aircraft that do not respond to commands to immediately leave the Special Flight Regulations Area (SFRA). These eye-safe lasers help avoid the need to deploy expensive military aircraft to investigate potential breaches. Wilburn explains that these visual cues, which operators call -sparkles,- often prompt pilots to correct their course and, if necessary, contact the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This advanced protection system was developed to solve the complex challenges of protecting urban airspace. Testing conducted in 2022 compared several camera prototypes, with the Teleidoscope emerging as the better choice due to significant software improvements. Two cameras are currently operational, with plans to deploy seven more cameras each year in future phases. The improvements made by the ERSA system have already changed the way air threats are identified and managed. Wilburn notes that the cameras are capable of detecting and tracking small targets, such as birds in flight, capabilities that were not possible with previous systems. In addition, the partial automation of the equipment allows operators to focus on more complex analytical tasks, such as assessing the intent of suspicious aircraft.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/16/nikoly-ne-splyat-pentagon-ogolosyv-pro-rozgortannya-novoyi-systemy-povitryanogo-sposterezhennya-na-osnovi-shi/	2025-01-15T20:36:38-08:00
More than 100,000 kilometers for the sake of support: how the patronage service of the 46th DSHV bri...	Captain Vadym Volynsky, senior officer of the psychological support department, told ArmyInform about the work of the patronage service of the 46th separate airmobile brigade of the Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. - The patronage service is a freelance structure of the brigade. Her main task is to work with wounded servicemen, visiting them in all medical, treatment, and rehabilitation facilities within the borders of Ukraine. An equally important task of the patronage service is to support the families of dead, missing and captured servicemen. The need for such a structure increased significantly after a large-scale invasion. The charity foundation -Angels- of -Azov- and the Third Assault Brigade became a role model. We monitor their work, try to adopt the best practices and implement them, based on our available forces, means and financial capabilities. The full patronage service of our brigade started working in February-March 2024. Before that, we had already worked with the wounded, but at first selectively in the nearest hospitals — we start working with the wounded by interacting with representatives of the medical service, medical company, and civil-military cooperation. Our psychologists from the combat stress control group, the psychological recovery group deal with all this. Representatives of our medical company provide them with lists of servicemen - who is being treated where, and they travel around Ukraine and visit the wounded. Usually there are two crews, in each of which one or two representatives of the brigade. In 2024, they covered more than 100,000 kilometers and visited more than 500 servicemen of the brigade in all corners of Ukraine. Representatives of the patronage service help to solve all problematic issues faced by the wounded - from providing basic household items to drawing up all the necessary documents. There can be a lot of problematic issues, but we try to solve them either on our own, or we already reach out to some public organizations, charitable foundations, volunteers who can help with this. We engage famous people, bloggers, and influencers to draw attention to wounded servicemen who need our help and support. — The main goal is to help and support a wounded serviceman. It is also a way to show that no one is left to fend for themselves. So that everyone feels: they are not forgotten, issues are resolved, and the team takes care of their own. The work of the patronage service has a very good effect on our soldiers, increases their morale and fighting spirit. Thanks to this, more servicemen want to return to their units and rejoin the ranks after being wounded. It also increases the reputation of the brigade, the Airborne Assault Forces and the Armed Forces of Ukraine as a whole. One of the components of comprehensive assistance to the wounded is the preparation of all necessary documents. A soldier reports a problematic issue, and we immediately call the deputy battalion commander for psychological support of personnel on the spot and try to resolve everything immediately. Accordingly, he further interacts with other representatives of other departments. It is usually possible to resolve everything within a period of one to three days. And then we send the necessary document by mail to the fighter where he is. This is such a bureaucratic procedure, but in the army there is really a lot of paperwork that someone has to do and do it well. — I will tell you how we worked in 2024. Together with representatives of civil-military cooperation, we compiled lists of the number of children in the families of dead, missing and captured fighters. We established cooperation with the management of the -Roshen- confectionery factory and, before the International Children's Day on June 1, held an event for children with animators and gifts: children up to 7 years old were given Lego sets, 8-12 years old - tablets, and 13-18 years old - mobile phones . Before the Day of Knowledge on September 1, a joint action with volunteers was also held - we sent school backpacks and stationery sets to children who were going to the first grade. Some were even able to be visited in person, and gifts were sent by mail to those we were unable to visit. The same was true for St. Nicholas Day on December 6, Christmas on December 25 and New Year on December 31. We are also in constant contact with the families of these three categories of servicemen - dead, missing and captured. The children and their relatives saw that the brigade remembers the service and feat of their sons, fathers, brothers and husbands, who gave the most valuable thing for Ukraine - their lives. — Work with the families of the missing is the most difficult, because it is the unknown that exhausts people. We provide the following advice: The psychological state of children depends on the mother or wife. It is important to take matters into your own hands and contact psychologists. Children feel their mother's condition. Keep them as stable as possible and pay attention to their emotions. We advise you to reduce the time spent in Telegram channels in search of loved ones. It is exhausting and mentally damaging. Instead, contact the units where the missing person served, relatives or witnesses to get more information. Many regions have free support programs for families of missing persons or prisoners. Many veterans' administrations and centers have support programs where families can get legal, psychological and practical help. We also provide contact information for such organizations. If you suspect that your loved one has been captured, contact the Red Cross or other humanitarian organizations that deal with prisoners of war. — It is possible to reliably confirm information about the serviceman's stay in captivity through the International Committee of the Red Cross. As practice shows, this is the only way to do it. It is there that they should confirm which person was recorded on the video found on the information resources of the occupiers. It is necessary to work with the families of the missing as much as possible, to be in constant contact with them. For this purpose, we hold various briefings, organize video conference calls, and work together with the Coordination Headquarters on matters of treatment of prisoners of war. This is done by our civil-military cooperation representatives. Also, the patronage service has pages on social networks, where we publish information about where to go for psychological help and support for family members of missing servicemen. This is also an important aspect of the job. - In a purely human way, I understand why people do this. They want to engage in some activity that they believe will have a result, will bring benefits. However, it is not really worth doing this, because no one will give you more information than a military unit, but this way you can cause serious damage to a soldier who is in captivity. It is a very bad idea to put a photo in open access, publish personal data - surname, military rank, position, unit or brigade in which a soldier serves. The release of such information does more harm than good. Having more information about the serviceman than he himself provided, the enemy will be able to find additional leverage and pressure on him. After learning about the rank and position, the occupiers will begin to demand from him to provide information of interest to them. Therefore, it is not worth publishing such ads, because they will only harm. — These people should be given psychological support, explained and convinced that sooner or later everything bad ends. Psychologists, representatives of the patronage service visit the families of prisoners, help them cope with tension, overcome despair. It is very important for people to see that they are not left alone with their grief, with their problems. Likewise, psychologists work with families of seriously wounded soldiers who have special needs and require special care.

Russia invented the fire - cottages of Ukrainian generals - in Los Angeles	One of the latest fakes claims that eight cottages belonging to Ukrainian generals, worth a total of $90 million, allegedly burned down in Los Angeles. This fiction was actively spread through various Russian media and Telegram channels. The information about the -burnt cottages- was first published by the Voenny obozrevatel Telegram channel on January 11, 2025. Subsequently, this -news- was picked up by such Russian media as Gazeta.ru, Lenta.ru, EADaily, Komsomolskaya Pravda, and Tsargrad. In their publications, they claimed that Ukrainian generals purchased real estate in the United States with funds received from Western financial aid to Ukraine. This information is completely baseless and untrue. The video shared with this fake is fake. No reputable media, including the United24 platform, published similar materials. In addition, the commander of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Major General Mykhailo Drapaty, who was credited with commenting on this event, never made such statements. The main purpose of this fake is to discredit the Armed Forces of Ukraine and create a negative image of the Ukrainian military leadership. By spreading such fictions, Russian propaganda is trying to undermine the international community's trust in Ukraine and reduce the support provided by Western partners. This case is another example of the information war that Russia is waging against Ukraine. It is important to be critical of such -news- and to verify information through reliable sources so as not to fall prey to propaganda and misinformation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/16/rosiya-vygadala-pozhezhu-kotedzhiv-ukrayinskyh-generaliv-u-los-andzhelesi/	2025-01-15T20:08:19-08:00

What specialists are needed in the army: the Defense Forces talked about mobilization challenges	On January 15, Colonel Oleg told about this on the air of the telethon -Suspilne Novyny- Makuha, commander of the 123rd separate territorial defense brigade. -The only personnel challenge I've faced is public opinion, which for some reason assumes that we go to war to die. No, we are not going to war to die, we are going to learn, we are going to reconcile, we are going to kill and defend our land and our families from the invaders,- he emphasized. According to him, there are a certain number of positions that need to be filled immediately. -These are positions of logistics support, air defense units, technological means, electronic warfare, crews of unmanned aerial systems. These are very important personnel that are needed, that we select, that we train, that we will use effectively,- said Oleg Makuha. He noted that the -Army+- application can be used to transfer to their brigade. Due to this application, 15 soldiers were killed in his unit during the month. -Preliminarily, on February 1, the recruitment of our brigade will be opened in Mykolaiv, where citizens can directly learn about the history of the brigade, about certain challenges of the brigade, about the personnel needed for the brigade, about the conditions for signing the contract and staying in our brigade,- said the commander of 123 of a separate brigade of the TrO. In his opinion, many citizens do not fully understand what awaits a person after he joins the army. -I have selected certain recruiters who explain to every citizen that he will undergo basic combined military training, undergo specialized combined military training, and then he will also undergo adaptation. When I talk to a serviceman, around the 3rd day he understands that he is not just in the Armed Forces, but in a family, confidence and desire appear,- he assured.

The Defense Forces declared an advantage in the use of drones in the Lyman direction	This was told by the commander of the 63rd on the air of the telethon -Only News- of a separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Pavlo Yurchuk. According to him, in the Lyman region up to 90% of Russian equipment is destroyed thanks to drones and artillery. The Ukrainian military actively uses modern fiber-optic FPV drones, which ensure high accuracy of strikes. -Up to 80-90% of the enemy's equipment is destroyed by our drones and artillery. The enemy has not yet managed to achieve parity, our forces are superior in terms of the number and accuracy of the use of unmanned systems,- Pavlo Yurchuk noted. As for supplying the brigade with drones and artillery, there are almost no problems. The brigade commander noted that the supply of ammunition is also at an adequate level, although not ideal. The main problem remains the limited replenishment of personnel. However, as Colonel Yurchuk emphasized, even in such a situation, the Ukrainian army acts rationally, not wasting human resources thoughtlessly, as the enemy does. -We really need more people to better maintain the defense line. But even with thousands of soldiers, we will not use human resource like the Russians do. We perfectly understand that the enemy cannot be defeated with human resources alone,- Pavlo Yurchuk emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy attacked in the Lyman direction 17 times.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/15/u-sylah-oborony-zayavyly-pro-perevagu-v-zastosuvanni-droniv-na-lymanskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-15T01:05:58-08:00

But they are still used, the enemy cannot completely abandon the anti-drone fight, but the intensity has decreased,- Dmytro Pletenchuk said. The spokesman of the Armed Forces Navy also noted that there is a season of storms in the Black Sea, which may affect the use of warships by the Russians. -The season of storms does not affect the possibility of going to sea, but rather the application. Because, as a rule, during strong sea waves, the carriers are not used specifically for striking,- he said. It should be noted that this morning, according to preliminary information, during a combined missile attack, the enemy used Kalibr missiles from the Black Sea. At that moment, there was one enemy missile carrier in the sea , capable of carrying up to four missiles.

All positions remain under the control of the Defense Forces, which successfully repelled two assaults involving armored vehicles. -The defense forces repelled two assaults using armored vehicles and infantry.

The second assault was less successful for the enemy: four more pieces of equipment and up to 35 military personnel were destroyed,- noted Yuriy Fedorenko. Despite the setbacks, the enemy continues to accumulate reserves and actively use manpower, especially in areas where armored vehicles cannot operate effectively due to difficult weather conditions. -We ensure stable defense dynamics thanks to the coordinated work of various units and the support of the Ukrainian people. The enemy is not making any progress, and his deadlines for seizing our territories continue to be missed,- Captain Fedorenko concluded. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukrainian units repelled four attacks of the enemy, who tried to break through the defense using heavy and light armored vehicles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/15/syly-oborony-vidbyly-dvi-ataky-na-kupyanskomu-napryamku-vorog-vtratyv-tehniku-i-pihotu/	2025-01-14T22:23:48-08:00

A fake about the execution of a Ukrainian soldier who refused to fight	First, the Armed Forces of Ukraine operate exclusively within the limits of the law and statutes. The Ukrainian army is not a Russian army, where punitive methods are common practice. There is a clear system of disciplinary sanctions in the Armed Forces, and no illegal actions, let alone executions, are allowed. Second, the widely circulated videos and -testimonies- of such massacres usually lack any evidence. There are no identified individuals, confirmed sources, or facts that could even partially support the truth of these claims. All these videos are created either with the help of editing, or with the involvement of actors, or with the use of artificial intelligence. Thirdly, the very source of the spread of this fake is Russian Telegram channels and pro-Russian resources. They have lost credibility long ago due to the systematic spread of lies and manipulation. Their goal is not to inform, but to intimidate. The goal is obvious - to sow panic and discord among Ukrainians. The enemy wants to make the military doubt its command, and society doubt its army. Such throws are aimed at undermining confidence in the leadership, demoralizing fighters and destabilizing the situation in the rear. Russia cannot win a war on the battlefield, so it is waging a war in the information field. It is important for them to shake us from the inside, to make us doubt the correctness of the chosen path. But Ukrainians have already learned to recognize these cheap manipulations. Ukrainian soldiers are united not by fear, but by love for the Motherland. We are fighting for freedom, for the right to live in a free country where people have dignity and the right to choose. In our army there is mutual respect, support and brotherhood. This is the basis of our indomitability.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/15/fejk-pro-stratu-ukrayinskogo-vijskovogo-yakyj-vidmovyvsya-voyuvaty/	2025-01-14T20:47:23-08:00
Invisibility cloaks, bunnies on mopeds and a military ticket that stopped the wreck: the story of in...	How did he meet the enemy in position while wounded? Under what circumstances did he destroy the two invaders? He told our correspondent about this: -Soon after the large-scale invasion began, I told my parents that I would join the army. They tried to refuse. I, in general, am a religious person and taking up weapons is not my thing. But, as my brother said: you can serve, because our enemies are butchers, and they are not people. Well, in any case, I'm defending my country, defending my nation. &#8230;I can recall an incident at the front that happened in May 2024 on one of the southern directions. We entered the position of the first number, in the evening. We were told to meet -bunnies- on a moped. It should be noted that the enemy was moving there on mopeds. At the position, we were together with my brother. The enemy started working against us with the AGS. A case came to me. And it felt like you were charged with all your might into that place with the handle of a shovel. Then I see something flowing from me&#8230; On the walkie-talkie, I said that I was -300-. They asked how I am now, can I move? I replied that I could. It was in the evening, nothing was visible, and we were also wearing -invisibility- cloaks that hide you from thermal imaging cameras. I unbuttoned my bulletproof vest and put on a bandage blindly. And just at that time we were told on the walkie-talkie that two katsaps were coming in our direction. I looked: there are actually two people walking and still shining their flashlights. I let them get closer, 150 meters away. I -struck- one, then our drones finished it off with drops. The second one on the right passed me at first, but I wounded him too. And just like that, it was finished off with resets. But we were to meet more Muscovites on mopeds that we were told about. I told the company over the radio that I was fit for battle: my arm was not yet numb at that time because I was hit in the shoulder. That is, he could shoot. However, the company commander said that I was the 300th, and therefore -in the gray- (at the very dawn - ed.) I had to get out of the position. But I understood that the work had to be finished. And my brother and I heard a moped going. They also said on the radio that the enemy is moving in our direction. Later it was reported that our mortars had worked, and the enemy had turned his moped around and turned back. Then, injured, at one point I lay there for 12 hours. Changed his bandage&#8230; Lasted -to the gray-. And -evak- (evacuation vehicle - ed.) came after me. This was my third injury. And the first was from F-1. She was dropped from a drone on me by katsaps&#8230; It fell on the left side, closer to the leg, and broke. I remember that I had such a hiss in my side then! But luck still. Because I have a habit of carrying all my things with me. I even took a military ID and wallet with me to the position. And it saved my left leg: the fragment hit the military ticket, pierced it through and stopped on the leather cover. I didn't even think that a military ticket could save me one day.

They were afraid for me then, and they are afraid now. But, in the end, they are proud of my choice,- says Bohdan.

-The Rock- That Can't Be Moved: The Story of a Marine Sgt	The soldier's story was published by the 38th Marine Brigade. Ilya grew up in the city of Pidgorodnoe, in the Dnipropetrovsk region. He decided to become a soldier while still studying at NKV No. 4. He began his service in the 1st separate battalion of marines, where he received his first knowledge of combat tactics and learned to survive in extreme conditions. When the full-scale invasion began, Ilya was already serving his military service. In the first days of the war, he took part in the defense of Mykolaiv, stopping Russian attempts to break through to the city. Later, as part of the 38th OBrMP, he participated in the de-occupation of the village of Urozhaine in Donetsk region and the defense of the liberated territories. Then there were the battles for the Podstepne in the south of Ukraine and the difficult days of the defense of Krynok. It was here that Ilya, together with his brothers, repelled numerous -meat- assaults of the enemy, working under constant artillery fire. In Krynyk, he was seriously wounded in the leg. Long rehabilitation did not break the fighter - he returned to his medical company to continue his service. Despite all the difficulties, Ilya remains an optimist. His life motto: -Never lose confidence in tomorrow.- -Skala- was awarded the award of the President of Ukraine -For the Defense of Ukraine-. He is sure that his struggle is a contribution to the future of his native country. -I believe in our victory, and this belief helps me move forward,- says Ilya.

Took it apart — Ukrainian drones were happy to meet the enemy tank	The video of combat work was published on January 14 on the unit page. Ukrainian drones of the -Phoenix- division systematically destroy both the enemy's manpower and its equipment. Recently, another victim of the Ukrainian defenders was an enemy tank that tried to break through the defenses. According to the fighters, the occupiers are already going as far as to throw single units of equipment into the battle. The fate of this tank was predictable - it was completely destroyed. -Our guys disassembled this iron down to the screw. It was a very unfortunate suicidal breakthrough for the enemy,- the fighters commented. As reported by ArmyInform, the air reconnaissance units of the 13th Brigade of the operational assignment -Charter- of the National Guard at night were able to find and hit Russian tank T- 80.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/kydajte-shhe-ukrayinski-drony-zavzhdy-gotovi-do-znyshhennya-rosijskoyi-tehniky/	2025-01-14T02:23:36-08:00
-Some take their own lives, some are killed by their fellow citizens - how Russia hides the presence...	On January 14, the head of the Center for countering disinformation of the NSDC, officer of the Defense Forces, Andriy Kovalenko, told about this on the air of the telethon -Yedini Novyny- on January 14. -When North Koreans first appeared in Kurshchyna, we reported that they would issue Russian documents and pass them off as Tuvans, Buryats and others. So it is. They are now operating on the fact that, they say, the Tuvans were taken captive, where the North Koreans are,- he said. According to Andriy Kovalenko, the authorities of the Russian Federation are trying to disguise the participation of the North Koreans in the war, so that it is more difficult to study the actions of the DPRK on the battlefield. -Kim Jong-un is interested in this because he plans to use the knowledge gained by the North Koreans in Kurshchyna for provocations on the border of the Korean peninsula against South Korea in the future. He is preparing for a hybrid war there, let's say that for a start. the Russians are trying to help in this,- he noted. In his opinion, the Russian special services train North Koreans according to special methods, which describe what to say in case of possible capture. -But they are doing everything so that North Koreans do not get captured. They are pumped in such a way that some of them simply take their own lives if they are wounded, some are killed by their comrades if they are wounded, some manage to be evacuated very quickly, earlier than the Russians from the battlefield,- Andriy Kovalenko said. He noted that the North Koreans operate in limited infantry groups. -They are young, they are, unfortunately, progressing in terms of training on the battlefield. It must be recognized. And they are progressing from the point of view of countering drones and modern methods of warfare. This, too, must be acknowledged. But, once again, the value of life is still invisible,- Andriy Kovalenko emphasized. We will remind you that Russia is trying to hide the presence of troops from North Korea, -> issuing them false documents. As reported by ArmyInform, on the eve of January 12, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky made public video interrogation of the first captured soldiers from North Korea. It is about two North Korean soldiers, one of whom on January 9, 2025 -pivnichnokorejczya-na-kurshhyni/->captured by the fighters of the tactical group No. 84 of the SSO, and another - paratroopers of the Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/deyaki-pozbavlyayut-sebe-zhyttya-deyakyh-vbyvayut-pobratymy-yak-rosiya-pryhovuye-prysutnist-pivnichnokorejcziv-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-14T02:07:46-08:00
The Ukrainian defense industry has increased production volumes by more than 20 times — MOU	About this informs January 14 Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for European Integration Serhiy Boev spoke at the meeting of the national arms directors of the member countries of the Contact Group on Defense of Ukraine held at the NATO headquarters in Brussels. -The Ukrainian defense industry is not fully utilized, there is a lack of capacity financing. At the same time, only in 2023-2024, the Ukrainian production of artillery systems increased three times, armored personnel carriers - five times, anti-tank weapons - twice, and ammunition - 2.5 times,- Serhii Boev said. According to him, Ukraine can produce more than 4 million UAVs per year under the conditions of full production financing. The deputy minister emphasized the need to increase and accelerate the production of equipment and ammunition. He also emphasized the importance of Ukraine's combat experience for the development of innovations and technological improvement of existing equipment. -Ammunition remains the No. 1 need, even with a view to increasing production. Anti-aircraft defense, heavy equipment, engineering equipment are potential products of joint industrial facilities,- noted Serhii Boev. Separately, he emphasized that the use of income from frozen Russian assets can become an additional resource for the Ukrainian defense industry and joint ventures. In addition, the issue of localization of enterprises engaged in the repair of equipment transferred by partners is becoming even more relevant. This will greatly simplify the logistics chain and save funds that can be redirected as needed. Serhii Boev also emphasized that jointly produced and tested on the battlefield weapons can be exported to partners after the end of the war. As a reminder, Ukraine expects record production of weapons in 2025. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov summarized the results of the 25th meeting of the Contact Group on issues of defense of Ukraine in the -Ramstein- format, which became an important stage in the strengthening of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/ukrayinska-oboronna-promyslovist-narostyla-obsyagy-vyrobnycztva-bilsh-nizh-u-20-raziv-mou/	2025-01-14T01:46:43-08:00

Marine drone + R-73 missile: the GUR disclosed the details of shooting down enemy helicopters	reported this by the GUR Ministry of Defense of Ukraine with reference to an interview for the channel -TSN. Week- The commander of the -13th- said that this operation was the result of many months of preparation and continuous work of their team. According to him, they used a naval drone for the first time to destroy an aerial target. He noted that the task was risky, but the team was confident in its abilities. -We saw the goal and understood that time was passing by minutes. In this operation, we did not hide from aviation, as usual, but, on the contrary, sought a meeting with the enemy. A helicopter is a quick target. Once it comes into view, it's only a matter of minutes to get into a good launch position. We calculated everything, and the missile hit the target from the first launch, -recalls the commander of the Group 13 unit. It is about an operation during which Ukrainian-made Magura drones managed to disable two enemy helicopters and seriously damage another one. According to the commander, it was possible to do this thanks to the modernization of the missile complex adapted to launch from the surface of the water. -In this operation, we used a modernized R-73 missile, which was adapted for launching from a water platform. This is a difficult task, because the rocket was originally created for air launch from aircraft with a higher initial speed,- — -13th-. According to him, the modernized R-73 missile, which previously belonged to the -air-to-air- class, was equipped with a new guidance system capable of operating at a wider angle. Its damage range reaches up to 40 km, and the weight of the warhead is about 8 kg. To adapt to the water launch, Ukrainian engineers significantly improved the launch system, making it possible to use it effectively on board a marine drone. -This is the first time in history that a naval drone shot down an aerial object. We proved that even from the water surface it is possible to work effectively on air targets. This opens up a new horizon in naval warfare,- the 13th emphasizes. The Group 13 division already has 9 sunk and 6 damaged enemy ships. And now a new milestone — air targets. The team is currently adapting new tactics to combat enemy aircraft. -Russia is forced to reconsider its strategies. Their navy and air force are no longer untouchable. We effectively paralyzed the Black Sea Fleet of Russia. They are afraid to go beyond their bases,- the 13th summarizes. As reported by ArmyInform, Magura V5 naval drones had already attacked enemy air targets several times before, but earlier -rosijskogo-mi-8-morskym-dronom/->inflated equipment still -lasted- to the coastline or airfield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/morskyj-dron-raketa-r-73-u-guri-rozpovily-podrobyczi-pro-zbyttya-vorozhyh-gelikopteriv/	2025-01-14T01:19:39-08:00

The one who is very much awaited: the driver - Ural - from Transcarpathia on how to survive under sh...	The story of the fighter was published by the 128th Zakarpattia mountain assault brigade. Oleksandr is not new to war — back in 2014-2015, he served in the same division when the brigade was encircled near Debaltseve. It was then, during the exit, that Alexander not only saved his comrades, but also took away ammunition from the encirclement, the rest of which had to be detonated so that it did not reach the enemy. Now he is the oldest in the battery, and on his -Ural- he delivers ammunition, logs for fortifications and equipment to combat positions. Since the truck is a -fat target,- as Oleksandr says, he tries to drive at night or in bad weather to reduce the risk of coming under fire. Like all drivers on the front lines, Oleksandr knows that every departure can be the last. His -Ural- repeatedly came under fire. Once, while driving in a landing, a 152-millimeter projectile flew by, and although the shrapnel damaged the truck, Oleksandr did not stop — he continues to perform his duties. -We're moving on,- he says. However, his service at the front is not only about risk. It is also about the family, because Oleksandr joined the brigade for her sake. His relatives, including an officer son-in-law and a brother who served in the infantry, are also connected to the army. -After the victory, I will return to peaceful work, but I will always remember why this became possible,- says Oleksandr, knowing that his relatives are waiting for him at home. For him, every day at the front is a struggle for the future of his children and grandchildren. As reported by ArmyInform, medic -Norman- from the 23rd separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the repulse of the attack destroyed six Russian servicemen, while kept the personnel subordinate to him at that time.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/toj-kogo-duzhe-chekayut-vodij-uralu-z-zakarpattya-pro-te-yak-vyzhyty-pid-obstrilamy-ta-dostavyty-vantazhi-na-peredovu/	2025-01-14T00:14:22-08:00

From 5 to 10 rolls per day: the occupying infantry is the main force in the Pokrovsky direction	About it on the air of the telethon -The only news- told artist duties of the press officer of the 33rd Mechanized Brigade Nazar Voytenkov. According to him, the occupiers' equipment is currently used mostly for logistical needs or rotational operations, and the main burden of attacks falls on infantry. -The Russians are mostly on foot, running from cover to cover, waiting for reinforcements to come and then storm our positions. It is also worth noting that Russians have learned to spread out, move at a distance of 15-20 meters from each other, it depends on the weather conditions,- explained Nazar Voytenkov. The intensity of the attacks is constantly increasing: in the current month, more than 130 invaders have already been killed or injured, and this is far from the limit. -They don't stop, they attack much more intensively, every day we have from 5 to 10 raids in small groups of 2-3 people,- the press officer added. Due to the small distance between groups and the frequent use of natural shelters to mask movement, it is much more difficult to destroy the enemy on such a stretch. However, the Ukrainian military does not give up, despite the difficulties. Nazar Voytenkov emphasizes that the Rashists are losing more and more people on the battlefield, and the reason for this is the complete indifference of the Russian army command to the fate of their soldiers. -They just throw their subordinates to their deaths, and they don't care at all,- he concluded. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Pokrovsky direction our defenders stopped 77 offensive actions of the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/vid-5-do-10-nakativ-za-den-pihota-okupantiv-ye-osnovnoyu-syloyu-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-13T23:54:32-08:00

At this level, there are requirements for working with radar stations and advanced flight planning, taking into account the wind at different altitudes. Level BKR III opens access to the control of tactical UAVs in all airspace, except for class A, at an altitude of up to 5,500 meters. The operator must be able to control the flight by instruments, work with collision detection and avoidance systems, and also perform take-off and landing at various airfields. The highest level of BKR IV gives the right to control operational and strategic Class III UAVs in any airspace and under any weather conditions. The operator must have skills in instrument flying, working with satellite communications and interacting with air traffic control authorities. The MOU noted that each basic qualification level contains a clear list of knowledge, skills and competencies of the UAV operator. Such standardization will allow units to effectively interact at the front and maximize the combat potential of unmanned systems. -It is important to note that flying beyond line of sight requires BKR level IV, regardless of the size of the drone. Each subsequent level includes all the requirements of the previous ones and requires the completion of appropriate training with the demonstration of practical skills. The requirements are developed in accordance with the resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine from 01.10.2024 No. 1129 on the implementation of an experimental project on the certification of schools of UAV operators. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukraine will receive 30 thousand drones. a> from the Drone Coalition.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/u-zsu-vprovadyly-chotyry-kvalifikaczijni-rivni-dlya-operatoriv-bpla/	2025-01-13T23:29:26-08:00

Meat Assaults 2.0: North Koreans die in Kurshchina like Russians	The commander of the platoon of the first battalion 95 said this in the Army TV stream on January 13. Lieutenant Stanislav Krasnov of the separate amphibious assault brigade. -The situation is steadily tense. Attacks occur daily, continuously throughout the day and night. Russian assault groups are trying to advance, but we successfully destroy them with the help of UAVs and artillery,- Stanislav Krasnov noted. He stressed that North Korean units operate in large groups. At first, they accumulate in the number of 20 to 50 people, and sometimes up to a hundred in landings, and then begin to move towards Ukrainian positions in open terrain. -I haven't seen such a number of people just moving around the field since the beginning of the large-scale invasion in 2022,- Stanislav Krasnov added. Unlike the North Koreans, the Russian military, trained by bitter experience, moves alone or in pairs, trying to minimize losses. However, such experience does not help the enemy avoid losses. The commander also shared his experience of communicating with a captured North Korean. According to Stanislav Krasnov, in North Korea, the Russian language is part of the school curriculum, so the soldier understood the basic commands well enough. However, the most important factor was the captive's desire to survive, which makes speech and gestures universal means of communication. -When a person wants to live, he will understand any language,- the officer added. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ukrainian side is going to use North Korean soldiers captured by the Armed Forces in the Kursk region, in their own interests.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/myasni-shturmy-2-0-pivnichnokorejczi-gynut-na-kurskomu-fronti-yak-rosiyany/	2025-01-13T22:25:51-08:00

Smart-REB: the Ukrainian manufacturer has created technologies that will change the course of war	—Please tell us how EW/EPR tools changed during the period of large-scale invasion? —At the beginning of large-scale, all analog EW was white noise. There were 7 Ukrainian manufacturers at that time. Currently, there are already 177 of them. And 99% of these manufacturers use this same white noise, which essentially clogs the communication channels and makes it impossible for the signal to pass between the drone and the operator. That is, we take this to be a standard WB. A year ago, at a meeting with representatives of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, in particular, the EW administration, the majority of EW/REP manufacturers were also present. It was then that we discussed plans for 2024. Among other things — frequencies, powers, and the like — manufacturers faced the task of making a Smart-REB. The stronger the connection between the drone and the operator, the more powerful the noise generator must be to suppress it. If in 2022 there were enough generators for 10-20 W, then at the end of 2024 the required power increased to 100 W. This increases the need for electricity. Previously, drones operated at stable frequencies (868 and 915.5 MHz), but over time, they began to use a wider range - from 170 to 1200 MHz. Effective suppression requires multi-channel oscillators: 8 modules of 50 W are needed to block frequencies from 300 to 1100 MHz, i.e. 400 W. Together with other electronic devices, the power reaches 600 W. Providing such power supply is difficult: powerful generators or large batteries are required. This became a challenge for the General Staff, which commissioned the development of Smart-REB - a system that automatically adjusts to the frequencies of drones and effectively blocks them. — What are the main innovations of the new EBU that make it unique on a global scale? — Now we smoothly moved on to the question of what our new generation EBU is. In our work, it should be noted that we have our powerful RND center, which is constantly working on the development of some new technologies. This is how we got the -Azimuth- PEP tool, now its new generation -Ranger- is on its way out - it's a direction finder. We realized that without specific, even in a certain kind of unique developments, we will not overcome drones, because they are constantly becoming more powerful, begin to fly further, carry larger and heavier projectiles, so we need to think about what and how to do so that there is an obstacle . So, our team first studied LoRa radio protocols. This is, in fact, the channel through which the drone and the pilot communicate. That is, not just one frequency, but a channel through which information is transmitted. Our PEP tool -Azimuth- sees the LoRa protocol, which in general is quite a complex thing that is quite difficult to crack and adapt to. Our -Azimuth- sees the LoRa protocol in real time. It has a zoom function, that is, a magnifying glass. There is such a -waterfall-, as if the frequencies are running, we zoom in, scale this -waterfall- and see in what mode the drone works. When we broke down the LoRa protocol, we realized that the main communication in FPV drones in general goes through it, and we concluded that this white noise is how to work with consequences. For example, when a person is sick, he has a runny nose - he drops his nose so that there is no swelling, but he does not treat the disease. Working with the LoRa protocol is like treating a disease. We started looking into what we could do, how to get into that protocol and disrupt that channel of communication between the drone and the pilot. I will not say that we claim mega-uniqueness in the whole world, but for this year 2024, I participated in 15 different exhibitions. The world is still dominated by white noise, 20-30 W modules, and there is no understanding of antenna power, repeaters, and the fact that a drone can hang in the air and transmit a signal, etc. This made us realize that we are moving in the right direction. Actually, we have chosen a key against the tamper resistance of the protocol. We understood how to interfere with the interaction at the protocol level and made a new type of digital oscillators that can tune to different frequencies. In its final form, this device should work perfectly with our Azimuth. One such device can work and detect a drone in a 25 km area, so 5 Mirage devices can work (this is a new technology). Therefore, -Azimuth- detects anything that moves at frequencies from 30 to 6000 MHz and accordingly transmits to -Mirage- a signal that some drone is flying, transmits at what frequencies, and it already generates at these frequencies at the protocol level. It is very simple to explain what makes this technology unique. - What were the difficulties during the trials or testing of your EW/PER means? - When you talk about EW in general, the average citizen thinks that it is some kind of box with antennas, but few people understand how it works . This is physics. It is not necessary for an ordinary person to understand it, it is difficult. I would like it to be interesting, because this is a new technology, and not everyone understands how effective it is. We constantly travel to the front for tests. And where the defenders see how this technology works, our Defense Forces, are first surprised and then delighted. After all, no one believes that this is possible. When we come and tell the military that launch any drone, we will spell it out and put it out, then at first they say that it is unrealistic, and we answer that we don't even say at what frequencies the drone will be launched. You don't need to know the distance, we will see everything ourselves and fill it up. Literally recently, we had tests - we launched a drone. We saw it on Azimuth, which was one kilometer from our position, so the drone could not even take off. We turned it off, the drone began to fly, and the device has such a feature that it takes 8 seconds to get a bearing, transmit a signal, fill forms on the Mirage. During this time, the drone flies a certain distance. We let it take off, pressed the button, and in 8 seconds the drone fell 300 meters away. This is actually surprising. In order to correctly and quickly adapt to the changes that are currently taking place very dynamically on the front, we have installed SDR boards. This is a new word in EW tools, because they are usually based on conventional cooling modules, connecting to an antenna. An SDR is a board with a chip, a microprocessor, capable of handling a large number of operations. In itself, it is not know-how, that is, it is a technology in the electronics market that is widely used. We learned how to use this microchip to generate interference at the protocol level. It takes us 3-4 hours to make this SDR board and teach it the functions we need. Download some functionality, test it, and it starts working. We synthesize electronic circuits and implement the microcircuit directly on this chip. The problem is written on a mathematical level. Basically, a mathematical method of creating an obstacle is used by the EW system. This is no longer just an analog technology, it is a new solution that required a lot of investment, fruitful team work, but at the end we got a unique tool that works logically. Another feature of this device is that the more powerful the repeater it has, the further our Mirage works. Our record is that we landed a drone at a distance of 3.7 km on twenty-watt modules. This is a very cool result. The distance to the operator was 4 or 5 km. In fact, they just took off and immediately fell. Our technical team immediately got these math calculations right. And all we need is a digital synthesis of the necessary tasks. Currently, the Mirage is an EW against FPV drones. It operates between 300 and 1600 MHz. Since this is a new technology, it is just beginning to be mass produced, we have primarily made a decision on FPV drones because it is the most massive phenomenon that primarily harms our defenders. The next stage is we are developing 1600-6000 MHz to cover the entire frequency range. It will look like this: there will be a complex called -Atlas-. It will include the -Azimuth- PEP tool and 5 -Mirage- REB tools. It will be able to protect against all types of drones. -Atlas- will represent all the assets that have already been developed. —How long did it take your team to create the latest tools? What challenges did you face? - I can't say exactly how long it took us to create it. We have several directions now, but I can say that a year ago we had a meeting at which the General Staff set us the task of creating a digital smart EW, and we worked throughout 2024 to bring it to life. The main challenge is people. In general, there are few technicians today, a significant part is serving and fighting. Some abroad. In fact, there is a competition for such people. We always go beyond the limits, we worked not only with our team, but also involved people from abroad. All this created a synergy, somewhere they were testing, somewhere they were finishing, for the whole year there were more than 40 trips. For example, let's go, conditionally, to Donetsk region and test. Everything may be perfect in the laboratory, but not so in war. We declare certain characteristics, go to the field, test, analyze how it works. The first 20 times, almost nothing worked for us. That is, we were programmed, but we turn it on - and it does not work. Antennas have been redesigned many times. Now the Mirage can actually work with quad-filar antennas (these are the ones that give dome protection and can work with directional antennas (they are also provided in the kit). Accordingly, the military will choose according to need. Moreover, this tool can be controlled remotely, which is not no one. We test it like this: the team goes to the front, displays everything, gives us a signal that that you can start the drone, and our technicians are in Kiev and turn it on. We made such a decision to turn on the analog interference. But -Mirage- can be integrated into the combat control system. so that regardless of government programs, we can provide solutions at the brigade level or at the level of an operational-tactical group and build into the system. Our stationary systems that protect critical infrastructure are also implemented through remote access. On it, we see the environment on the fly and simply enter it. We are an innovative company that suits the development asking questions is quite non-standard. We made the first EW robot on a crawler platform. It is a combination tool that protects against drones at all frequencies and can be used everywhere. It's called Berserk. For example, a group goes out for demining, the EW robot covers them with a dome, and people work safely. Evacuation: it can be attached to a trailer to remove a person, because cars often simply cannot. A group comes to clean up a settlement, our -Berserk- goes in front of them, which provides a dome of protection against drones, and the defenders can safely clear the settlement. This is the first such tool in history and on the market. Even in China, copies of our products have started to appear. We are making the Atlas complex based on the vehicle, that complex will include direction finding, EW neutralization and physical neutralization, we are considering a turret or small missiles that are designed specifically against Orlans, Shaheds, etc. At the end of 2025, we will have -Radar- - an active radar station, three-coordinate, with a phased active array. We will essentially have two types of detection, one will be a frequency ether scanner that sees everything that is moving and at what frequencies. They can simultaneously see up to 200 targets and accompany one to its destruction, give instructions to air defense, and we will be able to work against the Shaheds. The final will be the -Orchestra- complex, based on radar, direction finder, EW and physical destruction. - Tell me, please, how the development of your EW tools affects the development of high technologies in the field of defense in general? - I was recently at a business festival where we had a panel discussion, we discussed high technologies. It was about the fact that these are not always high-tech technologies, but sometimes low-tech. The main task is to perform its function. This is what Ukraine is now valued for in the world, because we have such solutions that no one else has. First of all, this is an example of how defense innovation starts the cycle of high technology, this cause and effect relationship. It is a process that takes a period of time to start, but once it is started, it cannot be stopped. Modern challenges, such as Russia's massive use of drones against Ukraine, have created motivation because we are defending our land. This aspect is very important. It's not enough to come up with something, it constantly needs to be improved. What was relevant 6 months ago may not be necessary at all now. Therefore, white noise products are gradually becoming a thing of the past. If earlier the tool provided protection for 300 meters for cars, now it is 200-250 meters, in a year it will be 50-70 meters. We also need to grow. In general, before, few people perceived that Ukraine and high technologies could be together, but now we see that DFTEK, our drones, EW and REP are what we can strengthen our combat positions. Unfortunately, our country has become such a training ground where we test all of this, but on the basis of this and what is in the world, we can create the latest developments, and this takes us to a completely different field of international image.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/smart-reb-ukrayinskyj-vyrobnyk-stvoryv-tehnologiyi-yaki-zminyat-perebig-vijny/	2025-01-13T21:12:47-08:00
It will come in handy everywhere: German gunsmiths are working on a new cruise missile with a wide r...	According to the authors of the portal Defense Industry Europe, the MBDA Deutschland company has unveiled a new concept of a universal Remote Carrier cruise missile Multidomain Multirole Effector (RCM²). This system will be developed to complement the existing air-based missiles -Taurus- and will ensure the versatility of deployment on many platforms, according to ArmyInform. The German branch of European missile giant MBDA has released a concept image showing the proposed RCM² remote launch vehicle, similar to a missile, launched from a warship, a transport aircraft and a mobile ground launcher. Analysts of edition The war zone in their turn state that the latest renderings of the RCM² published by the German missile manufacturers include an example of launching their charge from a warship's vertical launch system (VLS), probably Mk 41 VLS or similar model. The German Navy already uses the Mk 41 VLS on most of its frigates, and the system is widely used by NATO and allied navies. Although Germany has already ordered the Kongsberg Naval Strike Missile (NSM) as its future anti-ship and surface-to-surface missile, it is launched from box launchers rather than the Mk 41 VLS. Our editors told about these products in one of his previous materials. The following image from MBDA Deutschland shows several examples of RCM² -falling- from the rear ramp of an Airbus A400M military transport aircraft. The use of transport aircraft to drop winged munitions is now of increasing interest, highlighted by the concept of launching palletized munitions from the air Rapid Dragon US Air Force . It's also worth noting that Airbus has already conducted some experimental testing, including launching what it called a -remote flight demonstrator on a carrier.- And finally, the RCM² is shown to be launched by a tracked mobile ground launcher. Presumably the M270 multiple rocket launcher system (RCMS), which can fire 227mm artillery rockets as well as short-range ballistic missiles from the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). In the first rendering for this material, the M270 launcher is shown with a mixed payload of artillery rockets and RCM² remote launch vehicles. It will also provide compatibility with the M142 or HIMARS High Mobility Artillery Missile System. The RCM² missile is equipped with a turbojet engine that provides enough thrust for a range of about 500 kilometers. Weighing around 340 kilograms, this product can be configured with different payload options. This makes it adaptable to the specific needs of combat missions. Payload options include an explosive warhead for use as a barrage munition, electronic warfare payloads with jamming capabilities, and sensors for intelligence gathering. The design of the forward-looking rocket from MBDA also allows combining different payloads within the framework of a single mission, increasing the versatility of the rocket. The ability to mix payloads gives commanders increased flexibility in adapting to changing mission requirements and responding to new threats. The RCM² is also planned to be integrated into the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), a new generation fighter project aimed at developing advanced air combat capabilities for Europe. This missile system, with its versatile design and advanced capabilities, is expected to play a central role in the FCAS program, strengthening Germany's air and missile strike capabilities in the coming years. German gunsmiths are working on the new RCM² cruise missile. Visualization of Defense Central Missile presentation by MBDA Deutschland.

-Run-in with drones-: how defenders are prepared to face UAVs. ArmiyaInform report from Donetsk regi...	ArmyInform visited one of these trainings for combating enemy UAVs in the 21st separate special purpose battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky near the front in Donetsk region. More recently, one of the most difficult tests during the psychological preparation of soldiers for combat conditions was -tank run-in- - a set of exercises designed to teach servicemen to overcome their fear of a multi-ton enemy armored vehicle and to effectively destroy it. Tanks have not disappeared from the battlefield, but the chances of an infantryman engaging in close combat with a heavy tracked enemy tank are much smaller today than they once were. Instead, it is almost inevitable on the front line to encounter an enemy drone - a scout, a bomber with dropouts or an FPV kamikaze. -Fighters must know this sound, constantly move and be able to hide,- emphasizes the UAV pilot with the call sign -Asian-, who conducts training together with other instructors. The BZVP, according to them, provides only the minimum necessary basis for interaction with aerial drones, so additional intensive training after arriving at the unit is mandatory. During today's training, servicemen practice moving in fours and twos, firing from awkward positions from behind cover and, most importantly, detecting and reacting to enemy UAVs. The crew of the pilot and the drone operator will be located a few hundred meters from the training site and will raise the -bird- under the command of the instructors. A quadcopter simulating an enemy drone appears above the infantry at the most unexpected moment. Sometimes it simply flies or circles over a training ground, other times it rapidly approaches a group of military personnel or even simulates something similar to an FPV kamikaze drone attack. — We teach fighters how to interact with drones so that they get used to the sound of UAVs. This is necessary so that when they hear or see a drone, they do not freeze, but move, move, find shelter and hide. Because often they see a drone and freeze, because they think that thanks to it they are hiding, while from a drone they are perfectly visible, -Asiat- explains the meaning of training flights over infantrymen. Today, the main focus is on countering drones with drops, so after the first few flights they start attaching drops to the drone. First, these are imitations of ammunition without charges and with weak charges of the level of a loud firecracker, later - smoke grenades capable of covering the entire training ground with thick smoke. Instructor -Norman- emphasizes that one of the important skills is the ability to communicate with each other, informing each other of danger. Loudly shouting, informing your comrades about the drone and indicating the direction from which it is approaching, is no less important for survival on the battlefield than fast movement and finding reliable cover. — We see here a simplified version of what the guys will face on the battlefield. A drone is one of the elements of what may be waiting for them. The first thing a serviceman should do when he discovers a drone is to warn his comrades about the danger. Communication among themselves, exchange of information is the key to the survival of the whole team, he explains. This also needs to be taught, because quite often fighters not only freeze and freeze, but also shut up - either because of fear or because they think that the drone can -hear- them. Instead, the pilot controls the drone based on video, so it is impossible to express yourself with sound. Practices like today's take place regularly, and not only the newly arrived rookies take part in them, but also those who are taken out of the rotation positions. -This is my third training,- says the fighter with the nickname -Tima-. — The day before yesterday we were in positions, and now we are training again. This is the second time we work with drones. Training after BZVP may last longer, the same fighters who are removed from the positions are trained for a few days less - they already have combat experience and an understanding of what they will deal with on the front line. So there is no need to psychologically prepare them for shooting, explosions and smoke, unlike their newly arrived brothers. Drone operators note that progress during training using UAVs is noticeable after a few days — fighters not only get used to the buzzing of propellers, but also automatically perform the learned algorithm of actions. On the battlefield, this will significantly increase their chances of avoiding damage. — I personally train a little, but drones from other units come. During all the training, while they are working, learning to move in a group, to walk in pairs - all work is accompanied by a drone. That is, they should know this sound, get used to the drone and not be afraid of it, says -Asiat-. In addition to the skills of detecting a drone in time by observing the airspace, informing the group about it, moving quickly and finding cover, the fighters also practice firing at UAVs. However, despite the live cartridges in the stores when firing at targets from the firing range, now shots at the drone are only simulated. - The chance of shooting down a drone bomber is quite high, depending on where it is spotted. If he was spotted on the approach and started shooting at him in time, before he took aim, then at low altitude it is quite easy to shoot him down. The pilot will see that you are shooting at him, and this will prevent him from calmly hovering and making a reset, -explains the -Asian-. After several dozen activities on two groups of fighters who replace each other on the training ground, the instructors note a significant improvement in the skills of the fighters. Despite the fact that they were exhausted, the errors in the implementation of the algorithm were noticeably reduced - the actions of the soldiers became more and more automatic. In view of this, today the training with drones is completed and after a short break they are preparing for new exercises. This time it will be throwing live grenades. They, as well as patrons, are not spared for training.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/obkatka-dronamy-yak-zahysnykiv-gotuyut-protystoyaty-bpla-reportazh-armiyainform-z-donechchyny/	2025-01-13T20:39:27-08:00
Fake hysteria: Skabeeva revealed the theft of Koreans in Kurshchyna	Sound like a joke? But this has long been the working style of the Kremlin media. Creating a fake, blowing it up to the scale of a -world conspiracy- and presenting it as evidence of -Ukraine's aggression- is a standard scheme. This time the fiction is so absurd that it is difficult to understand how even the most ardent fans of Russian talk shows can believe it. The fiction about -kidnapped Koreans- in Kurshchyna looks like a propaganda attempt to once again shift responsibility for the failures of the Russian army to Ukraine. Kurshchyna, which has become one of the hot spots in the border battles, has long demonstrated the weakness of the Russian defense. However, instead of acknowledging their problems, the Russian media portrays -Ukrainian saboteurs- who are engaged in anything but real struggle. Obviously, there is no evidence in this -news-. No video, no witnesses, no statement from the North Korean government. But this was never a problem for Russian propaganda. For her, the important thing is not the confirmation, but the emotion. Hysteria, fear, hatred - this is the currency that Skabeeva trades in. First, it is an attempt to distract Russians from domestic problems. When there is instability in the rear and growing dissatisfaction with the war, it is convenient to show the -enemy- who supposedly threatens everyone. Secondly, this is a way to discredit the Armed Forces, which actually demonstrate effectiveness even on Russian territories. Thirdly, such delusion is needed to intimidate the own population. If you believe that -Ukrainians are kidnapping Koreans-, then anyone could be next. This is a game on fears and the creation of an image of an -all-powerful enemy- to be feared and hated. The reality is much simpler. The Armed Forces conduct combat operations against enemy military facilities and logistics. In addition, the military from North Korea, who joined the Russian army, also became our enemy. Our Defense Forces operate exclusively according to the rules of warfare and can capture soldiers from the enemy's army. In fact, Ukrainian FPV drones, strikes on warehouses and command posts - this is what worries the Russian command. And this is what forces Russian channels to invent all sorts of stories in order not to tell the truth about failures on the front. For Ukraine, information warfare is no less important than armed confrontation. And while Russia is inventing fables, we are telling the truth. And this truth is stronger than any lie. Therefore, let Skabeeva continue to invent -kidnapped Koreans-, -war mosquitoes- and -black biologists-. We know what we are doing - we are fighting for truth, freedom and for those who believe in our victory.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/fejkova-isteryka-skabyeyeva-rozkryla-kradizhku-korejcziv-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-13T20:23:51-08:00

Rustem Umyerov: Ukraine expects record production of weapons in 2025	The head of the defense department wrote about this on your Facebook page. He noted that this new association of states with the largest defense budgets among European countries is working together to strengthen European security and support Ukraine. -E5 plays a key role in important defense coalitions. For example, Germany and Poland are responsible for armored vehicles, France for artillery, France and Germany for air defense systems, Great Britain for drones and maritime security,- Rustem Umyerov said. According to the minister, during the meeting, the key priorities of the defense of Ukraine in 2025 were discussed. -First of all, these are weapons for the front: artillery shells, long-range weapons, Western armored vehicles. The second priority is to strengthen air defense, which includes new air defense systems and ammunition to counter Russian missiles and drones,- he emphasized. Particular attention was paid to the development of the defense industry of Ukraine. -In 2025, we plan a record production of arms worth 35 billion dollars. Of these, 17 billion will be financed by the Ukrainian government, the remaining funds can be provided by our allies,- Rustem Umyerov said. Defense ministers of the E5 countries also approved Roadmaps of defense coalitions until 2027. -This is a clear signal that Europe is ready to plan its support for Ukraine for years ahead,- the Ukrainian minister noted. He added that military aid to Ukraine will continue, because it is an investment in peace and stability on the European continent. -The bold decisions, unity and strategic vision of our allies are what bring us closer to victory. Ukraine is grateful for this support,- Rustem Umyerov concluded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/13/rustem-umyerov-ukrayina-ochikuye-rekordne-vyrobnycztvo-zbroyi-u-2025-roczi/	2025-01-13T10:28:56-08:00

-Aramis- and his iron birds: how drones become the key to victory	The interview with the soldier was published on January 13 on the DPSU page. Aramis began his journey to work with drones back in 2020, when he studied unmanned systems on the western border. But already in 2023, he headed an air reconnaissance and strike group that performs tasks in the combat zone. According to him, the experience of working with drones in the rear and on the front lines are two completely different worlds. The first combat flight fell on an operation in the Serebryansk Forest. -It was a completely new level. During training, you have time to think and analyze, and in real combat conditions, everything is decided in seconds,- says Aramis. Today, the main challenge for his group is the enemy's use of various EW tools. -Each target requires at least five or six drones,- he explains. -One is looking for EW means, the second is finding out the frequency, and the third and fourth are performing strike missions on specified targets.- One of the main priorities of Aramis and its unit is the elimination of Russian UAV operators. -Their operators are the key to their aerial intelligence. Depriving them of this advantage means bringing victory closer,- he notes. Despite the intensity of combat, Aramis emphasizes that constant training and skill improvement is critical. -We work constantly, analyze mistakes, train. As a sniper feels the recoil of a weapon, so I feel the -recoil- of a joystick. This is a delicate science that needs to be perfected,- he adds. As reported by ArmyInform, the sniper with the call sign -Malysh- is only 25 years old, but vich-z-vorogom-istoriya-snajpera-na-psevdo-malysh/-> he went through the horrors of the environment and fought with the enemy both at a distance of hundreds of meters and face to face.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/13/aramis-i-jogo-zalizni-ptahy-yak-bezpilotnyky-stayut-klyuchem-do-peremogy/	2025-01-13T05:09:00-08:00
SBU: a couple from Dnipro tried to carry out a terrorist attack on the order of the FSB	On Monday, January 13, informed the SBU press service.

Germany handed Ukraine the first of the 54 RCH 155 self-propelled guns ordered: what it is capable o...	This was reported by Tagesschau. The handover ceremony took place at the factory in the city of Kassel, where the KNDS company produces this weapon system. -This is a signal that Ukraine can count on us. And Germany is ready to take responsibility in Europe,- said Boris Pistorius. The first self-propelled RCH 155 was symbolically received by the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany Oleksiy Makeev. In total, Ukraine is to receive 54 RCH 155 artillery systems. The first six of these systems will initially remain in Germany and will be used for training the Ukrainian military. In 2023, it became known that the German company Kraus-Maffei Wegmann started production RCH-155 self-propelled artillery installations for the Ukrainian army. Artillery installation RCH 155 (Remote Controlled Howitzer 155 — remotely controlled howitzer) was created by the German company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (now KNDS). When creating a new artillery installation, German engineers took the best solutions from the PzH 2000 and Donar self-propelled guns. The RCH 155 is based on the chassis of the German-Dutch GTK Boxer wheeled armored personnel carrier with an 8×8 wheel formula. The newest 155 mm self-propelled gun was introduced in 2014. It is positioned as the world's first artillery system that can fire on the move. Primarily, this is needed to avoid return fire by enemy artillery during counter-battery combat. The RCH 155 self-propelled gun has a fully automatic loading system with an ammunition set of 30 equipped shells and 144 modular projectile charges. The maximum range of fire with a standard projectile is up to 30 km, and with a long-range active-reactive projectile V-LAP - up to 56 km. At the same time, the maximum rate of fire can reach 9 shots per minute. The RCH 155 has an advanced fire control system. The crew of the machine receives targeting via radio communication or using a data link. The shot is fired remotely by the crew located in the cabin of the self-propelled gun. Although in the event of an accident or failure, this artillery system can be loaded and fired manually. The interval between arriving at the firing position and opening fire is approximately 30 seconds. After firing the last projectile, the self-propelled gun is able to quickly leave the position to avoid counter-battery fire. The body of the machine is made of modular armor combined with ceramic protection. The triple bottom is shaped to provide maximum protection against anti-tank mines and improvised explosive devices. Damaged armor plates can be easily replaced in the field. The tower is made of lightweight aluminum armor and provides protection only against 12.7 mm small arms and artillery shell fragments.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/13/nimechchyna-peredala-ukrayini-pershu-z-54-zamovlenyh-sau-rch-155-na-shho-vona-zdatna/	2025-01-13T04:32:10-08:00
Recruiting boom in the Armed Forces: more than 7,000 applications were submitted for the new K-2 reg...	This is reports the press service of the K-2 regiment. -We expected a maximum of a few thousand applications, but by no means seven. This is a huge level of trust for which we are grateful. At the same time, this is a test, because most of our servicemen continue to perform combat tasks, and the resources for processing applications turned out to be insufficient,- the department said. According to the message, some applications are still being processed due to technical difficulties, but the recruiting process is already being improved. The regiment plans to increase the number of people involved in recruiting recruits and streamline the process from application to interview. -We will do our best to provide feedback to anyone who is interested in joining our regiment. It is important for us to attract talented, brave and motivated people who are ready to make efforts to protect Ukraine,- K-2 emphasized. Work on improving the recruiting process continues. The command assures that no application will be ignored.

According to Oleh Grudzevych, the enemy is attacking in waves, mostly moving on foot — our military personnel are -carrying out- equipment thanks to the use of drones. -We forced them to abandon the use of technology. Yes, no heavy unit has been observed for some time. Instead, the Russians tried to bring a reserve on a buggy, but again they were not lucky - our UAV operators destroyed the vehicle along with the reserve. They are now attacking on foot, coming in groups of up to five bodies. They attack stubbornly, sometimes up to 8 attacks a day,- Oleg Grudzevych said. At the same time, according to him, there are certain signs that the enemy is running out of steam: if earlier up to 90 people went on the offensive a day, now there are about 40. then come more trained fighters.

Military counter-intelligence agents detained an unemployed woman who was preparing a Russian drone ...	About informs SBU. It was noted that the priority targets of the aggressor were administrative buildings of state institutions and energy-generating enterprises of Ukraine. -In order to program enemy kamikaze drones to hit Ukrainian objects, the agent turned on GPS coordinates on her phone and took photos of the objects in such a way that their exact geolocation was included in the file properties,- the report says. The SBU said that the suspect forwarded the finished photos to her Russian curator through an anonymous chat in the messenger. Also, during reconnaissance forays, the agent spied on the air defense combat positions protecting Kyiv. It has been documented how the attacker conducted reconnaissance in the area where the radar station of Ukrainian troops is based near the capital of Ukraine. SBU employees detained the suspect at her place of residence in a rented apartment in Kyiv when she tried to hand over a new batch of intelligence to the Russian game. According to the investigation, the agent of the occupiers turned out to be a 27-year-old local unemployed woman who was looking for -easy- earnings on Telegram channels. A representative of Russia's military intelligence appeared there and offered money in exchange for cooperation. During the search of the detainee's house, a mobile phone with evidence of cooperation with the Russian game and a large number of SIM cards, which she used to conspire to communicate with the occupiers, were seized. Currently, the investigators of the Security Service informed her about the suspicion for h. 2 Art. 114-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (unauthorized dissemination of information about the location of the Armed Forces or other military formations formed in accordance with the laws of Ukraine, committed under martial law).

Why orders for transfer through the Army+ sometimes have to wait a long time: the Ministry of Defens...	Relevant information is available at site MOU. The function of changing the place of service has been working in the Army+ application for almost two months. Already 7,000 servicemen have received approval to continue their service in the part they chose independently. At the same time, in recent weeks, the Ministry of Defense has received about a hundred appeals from servicemen who are still waiting for the order or face its being ignored. The MOU explained each of these cases. Why do we have to wait for an order sometimes for a month, or even longer? Every day, up to 1,000 reports are submitted to the Personnel Center of the Armed Forces through Army+. Currently, they have already submitted 30,000. Some military personnel submit 5-7 times, correcting errors following the prompts of operators, or receiving a rejection each time due to rejection of the transfer by the commander of the unit, where his approval is required by the resolution. This increases the burden on operators who work around the clock. Sometimes orders are formed in a few days, and the military can immediately see its number and date in the application. And sometimes it takes weeks. What have we done to simplify the work of operators? We analyzed the most common mistakes made by the military and improved the report template in Army+. Added a link to sample recommendation documents and a list of typical military documents with tips on which pages to attach. The order is already in the formation, but the commander ignores it and avoids appeals There are artificial barriers that can be created on the ground. They are already being overcome. For example, in December, amendments were added to Cabinet Resolution No. 1291 and the formation of orders for soldiers and non-commissioned officers was simplified by the order of the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, removing the post of military officer from him. It is enough to indicate only his name, rank, part numbers and tax payer cards. Yes, cases were removed when the transfer order was ignored due to a change of position in the staff list. In addition, the Central Office for the Protection of Servicemen's Rights, together with military administration bodies, respond to servicemen's appeals and monitor the execution of orders by unit commanders. The main thing is that if there is an order to transfer, it must be carried out. And the commander should not detain a soldier who legally chose another unit for himself, where he will feel motivated. If there are such cases, fill out the form in the application, which is located on the route: Menu → Support service → Frequently asked questions → Change of service location. Select the question above. The status of the order will be recorded and clarified. A contact e-mail is indicated in each form. It is he who will be notified of the result of the inspection.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/13/chomu-nakazy-na-perevedennya-cherez-armiya-inkoly-dovodytsya-dovgo-chekaty-roz%ca%bcyasnennya-minoborony/	2025-01-13T02:10:40-08:00

About this on the air of the telethon -Social News- he told Oleksandr Nevidimy, chief communications branch of the 46th separate air mobile brigade. -The enemy does not abandon the goal of capturing the entire settlement of Kurakhove. The advance of the enemy has not been recorded recently, because we detect all such attempts in time and inflict adequate fire damage on the enemy,- he said. According to him, the nature of Russian assaults has remained unchanged for a long time. -These are small groups of infantrymen and groups on motorized vehicles with the support of attack UAVs. The work of barrel artillery and the use of multiple rocket systems became more active. The enemy is constantly working on our positions with all types of MLRS. Well, in general, it just completely destroys the city,- noted Oleksandr Nevidimy. He said that over the past year, his brigade destroyed 118 tanks, 63 artillery systems, 2,318 UAVs of all types, 243 units of armored combat vehicles, 144 vehicles, 52 light armored vehicles, 53 units and 4,206 enemy personnel killed and wounded. -But again, these figures do not include the number of Russian servicemen who were in dugouts, in equipment and the like. That is, we could not count how many were there. These are just the numbers we saw in the streams on the battlefield. And 61 occupiers were captured,- he said.

Pokrovsky direction: why the Russians do not launch a frontal attack on the city	This was reported by the spokesman of the operational-strategic group of troops -Khortytsia- Major Viktor Tregubov. -Pokrovsk is now a key direction for the enemy, but the Russians are no longer ready to attack it in the same way as it was before, for example, in Mariupol or Bakhmut. They cannot afford to use attacks in the forehead, due to significant losses,- Viktor Tregubov noted. According to him, the Russians are no longer ready to storm large Ukrainian cities using the same methods as before: head-on, with waves of offensive forces in urban battles, recruiting recruits and untrained soldiers for the assault. Recalling the experience of Russian attacks in 2022, Viktor Tregubov emphasized that Russian forces lost too many people to repeat these tactics. -They understand that urban battles in Pokrovsk can become a real -meat grinder- for them, especially considering that the city is well fortified and defended by experienced Ukrainian defenders,- the speaker said. In addition, significant Russian losses in urban battles, in particular in Kurakhovo, Toretsk, and Chasovo Yar, proved how high the cost to the enemy of such attacks is. Therefore, given the situation, they will probably not risk their forces in direct assaults, and will continue to try to bypass and surround the city. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Pokrovsky direction, our defenders napryamkah-ta-kurshhyni/->stopped 58 offensive and offensive actions of the aggressor.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/13/pokrovskyj-napryamok-chomu-rosiyany-ne-jdut-v-lobovu-ataku-na-misto/	2025-01-13T01:36:25-08:00
Passed through the environment and fought face-to-face with the enemy: the story of a sniper on pseu...	His story was told in 23 separate mechanized brigades. -Our hero is only 25 years old, but with the experience he gained in the war, he could already be writing a memoir. -His path to the sniper craft began long before the front,- the report said. In civilian life, he worked as an underground machine operator at a mine. However, at the age of 23, he left his usual life and volunteered to defend the Motherland. At first he wanted to serve next to his twin brother in the Navy, but he was transferred to another unit. In 2023, he joined the 23rd Brigade, where he is still serving. Subsequently, he was trained at a sniper school and began a new phase of his life - on the front line. In the hero's opinion, -a sniper is more than just a fighter with a weapon, he is a person who is able to work where an ordinary shooter cannot.- -Malysh- works with the UR-10, a Ukrainian semi-automatic rifle with a caliber of 7.62×51, capable of accurately hitting targets at a distance of up to 800 meters. However, the effectiveness of the shot depends not only on the technique or weapon, but also on the understanding of many factors: wind direction, temperature, atmospheric pressure. Before each exit, the team conducts thorough reconnaissance. -We choose a position so as to remain inconspicuous. Camouflage is the key to survival. The position can be our base from one day to five, depending on the task,- explained -Malysh-. Once, while on a combat exit at an observation post, a sniper pair spotted the enemy running in the direction of their positions. -At first they wanted to neutralize him, but they took a closer look: he was moving strangely, as if he did not realize what was happening. They decided not to shoot, detained. It turned out that the occupier was a Yakut. It was also surprising that he was laughing all the time after being detained,- the fighter said. -Kid- suggested that it was caused by stress and panic. Then it turned out that all the information he gave during the interrogation turned out to be false. But war is not only about relative control of the situation, but also about incredible challenges. Once -Malysh- and his siblings found themselves surrounded. The enemy attacked as many as 16 BMPs, but they managed to destroy one with the help of a large-caliber machine gun. Then four infantrymen and two snipers confronted the enemy who went on an assault. Unfortunately, everyone died except for -The Kid-. -The hero's partner later fell under the bullet of a wounded occupier, whom they did not notice at first when they were making their way back to theirs. Left alone, wounded and exhausted, receiving instructions from the platoon commander via walkie-talkie, the hero made his way to his positions,- the 23rd Brigade said. The guy came across an anti-tank ditch with very steep slopes, which he was able to overcome with the help of improvised means. In the end, -The Kid- managed to get to his own. After this incident and treatment in the hospital, the soldier returned to duty in his unit, even though fragments still remain in his body. As for the work of a modern sniper, as the hero claims, it is changing rapidly with the advent of new technologies. Drones make it difficult to choose positions, forcing you to work closer to the infantry, to perform the work of a -marksman-. But even in such conditions -Malysh- continues to fulfill its mission. -Camouflage cloaks, thermal imaging devices, night vision devices, weather stations - all this makes us effective. But the main thing is knowledge, patience and faith in one's own abilities,- he says. The guy is only 25 years old, but he has more on his shoulders than the average person can handle. -Therefore, Malysh's story is not just a story about one man's courage. This is a symbol of the indomitable spirit of all defenders of Ukraine, who prove day after day: their heroism and devotion to the Motherland have no limits,- noted the 23rd OMBr. Earlier, ArmyInform reported on the story Shahed hunter. Oleksiy joined the ranks of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as a volunteer in the summer of 2022. Before that, he worked as a land surveyor in the bodies of the State Geocadastre.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/13/projshov-cherez-otochennya-i-borovsya-vich-na-vich-z-vorogom-istoriya-snajpera-na-psevdo-malysh/	2025-01-13T01:09:04-08:00

North Koreans at the front: if not to shoot, then to explode	This was reported by the deputy commander of the air mobile battalion of the 95th DSHV brigade Major Anton Zakharchuk According to him, North Korean soldiers often blow themselves up with grenades when they realize that they are surrounded by Ukrainian troops or that they may be captured. -This has become commonplace,- the officer says. -We try to identify them using aerial reconnaissance, they hide in trenches or holes, and when we get closer, we hear explosions.- Another important point that Anton Zakharchuk drew attention to is the role of North Korean soldiers in Russian assault groups. They are the first to attack, often acting as -meat- for the assault, while Russian troops take a more passive position, entrenching themselves in already captured territories. This tactic shows how the North Koreans are being used as human shields for the Russians. As ArmiyaInform reported, soldiers of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine repelled the assault of the North Korean troops, which lasted from morning to night in Kurshchyna.

Water supply at TOT: Lysychansk is still without water, and attempts to restore it are fruitless	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. According to him, the occupation administration tried to start the water supply system, but the result turned out to be predictable - numerous surges at the water wells. At the same time, we are talking not only about apartments, access to which is difficult due to the lack of owners. Key infrastructure elements that the occupiers have been trying to -restore- for over 2.5 years have been destroyed. It is worth noting that the situation with water supply in the city of Lysychansk remains critical since the moment of its occupation. Devastated budgets, corruption in the ranks of the occupiers, and the lack of real work to restore infrastructure mean that even such basic services are out of reach for local residents.

Fully Ukrainian armor with an American engine, the power of which is 440 horsepower, automatic transmission. The operating range is 1000 km. Speed ​​on the track up to 120 km/h. Good passability in fields and hard-to-reach areas. But you need to -trust- the chassis a little more so that it does not throw strongly to the sides while driving. The landing compartment accommodates up to 8 people. Plus 2 crew members. A Ukrainian-made 12.7-mm NSVT large-caliber machine gun is mounted on top of the capsule cabin. But in fact, according to the characteristics, it is the Utyos machine gun. This weapon is used by marines to suppress enemy fire activity during amphibious landings in the area. Ukrainian armor is of very high quality. The other day, the enemy hit us with 120 mm mines, the shells exploded nearby, the cabin and the driver's side window were slightly cut by shrapnel. The car survived, everything is fine with the crew and the people who were in the landing compartment. According to the stated characteristics, the car can withstand an explosion on an anti-tank mine, but, fortunately, I did not have to test it on myself. The work on the battle line and the approaches to it is very difficult. Mobility and unit cohesion are important here. The guys on the front edge keep the defense, after the combat rotations, they need to be quickly changed. On -Cossacks- it comes out very quickly. There is a point in the area where we are supposed to meet our guys who need to be picked up. Let's preferably leave at night. A replacement group is eliminated with us. Of course, close to the positions, we can't drive up. raiders use reconnaissance UAVs and FPV drones. Therefore, to go to the very -front- is to become easy prey for the occupiers and commit suicide. No one fights like that now, we value every life of our brothers, unlike the enemy. And in general, the time when you could safely go to the front line has long passed. The replacement has taken place, the new marines are in position and with fresh forces they are hitting the invaders who are advancing in infantry groups. The enemy's tactics remain unchanged: assault groups of several people advance in the -gray zone- and die before even reaching our positions. Next comes another group, which is also destroyed. -Borziy- has been in the army for a long time, since 20 years. Born in Cherkasy. Started in a separate battalion of marines of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He was a simple driver, got into a mortar division, worked on 120 mm mines. Went for promotion - became a platoon sergeant major. First contract from 2016 to 2019, served three years faithfully and resigned. Worked for a -citizen-, earned good money. Then he returned to the army again, to the air defense unit, which was located not far from home. -The commander of the unit, when he found out that I was a marine, told me: -you will be bored here, the adrenaline is not the same.- But soon a large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation began, so it was no longer boring for anyone. But I still wanted to join the Marines. The 38th Brigade was just being formed. And here I am. A year ago, he received the rank of officer and headed a platoon. -Recently promoted to the commander of a company of marines,- says -Borziy-. To the question of how to encourage men to join the army, Borziy answered: -For example, I could not just watch how these Russian bastards occupy our land. Every reasonable person sees that Russia is the aggressor and the occupiers have come to Ukraine to kill us on our land, destroying everything in their path. I believe that every man should take up arms and defend his family and the territorial integrity of Ukraine. And not to sit at home, under the skirts of their wives. I do not condemn anyone, but a person appears to be in trouble. That's why such trouble happened to us. We are obliged to protect Ukraine.- Let's meet the driver of -Cossack-5- Yaroslav with the call sign -Mudriy-. The guy says: the call sign was given in honor of Prince Yaroslav the Wise of Kievan Rus. He is 29, from Zhytomyr Oblast, in the brigade since March 2023. Before the Armed Forces, he worked as a construction worker. -In the first year of the invasion of the Russian Federation, I went to the local TCC six times, I was directly kicked out of there. They said: there are no vacancies for you, boy, go home for now. Wait for your time,- says the -Wise One-. The marine fought in difficult areas of the front of the Russian-Ukrainian war. -In 2023, our unit was in Donetsk region in the Kurakhiv direction, then it was transferred to Kherson region, carried out combat missions in Krynyk, and then again in Donetsk region. It was very, very difficult in Krynyk. The Katsaps covered us with artillery, they did not spare the KAB, their tanks worked on us. I was injured there last December. The mine flew, the fragment went under the shoulder blade. After treatment, he returned to action,- says Yaroslav.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/13/bez-nogo-zaraz-na-fronti-niyak-ukrayinskyj-bronovyk-kozak-ryatuye-morsku-pihotu-na-peredovij/	2025-01-12T21:09:34-08:00

A counterbattery's best friend: Swedish fighters have developed a high-tech radar	As informs in an official release, the developer Swedish company Saab, five Arthur systems of the next generation, which named TAIPAN by the British Army, were delivered, adopted and are in service with the 5th Regiment of the Royal Artillery of the United Kingdom Armed Forces, ArmyInform reports. Scandinavian gunsmiths emphasize that, replacing the MAMBA equipment - the latest generation Arthur radar - TAIPAN offers the British Army rapid deployment and redeployment, high operational mobility and precision counter-battery operations, locating an increased number of targets at greater distances with reduced electronic warfare signatures, using the Saab digital antenna. This ensures survivability, reliability and high availability. -We are extremely proud to support the British Army with our state-of-the-art TAIPAN systems. Our relationship with the Army through the Arthur system is based on years of service in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Saab team is looking forward to continuing our support for the UK as it has become an early adopter of the new systems for the current and next generation Arthur,- said Andy Fraser, Group Managing Director of Saab UK. -Saab is our key partner for both MAMBA and TAIPAN, and what it as a company has and continues to provide to our Armed Forces is extremely impressive. MAMBA has proven its worth, and TAIPAN is a step in changing capabilities,- said Lieutenant General Sir Andrew Gregory, Head of St James's Park. According to analysts of the Dutch portal Army Recognition, which studies the arms market, the TAIPAN counter-battery radar is the latest iteration of the ARTHUR series (artillery radar) Saab. This advanced radar system is designed to detect and locate enemy artillery, mortars, and rocket launchers, greatly enhancing counter-battery operations. With advanced technology, TAIPAN provides real-time intelligence that allows artillery units to quickly identify the source of enemy fire and respond effectively. TAIPAN mounted on a high mobility truck MAN SV 9T, equipped with digital antenna technology and an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, which allows it to track multiple targets simultaneously with unsurpassed precision. This system has an impressive detection range, capable of identifying various types of threats at significant distances. As for artillery fire, the radar can detect shells at a distance of up to 40 km. For mortar fire, the system can detect incoming projectiles up to 20 km away, and for missiles it can track projectiles up to 60 km away. Radar coverage in azimuth spans 360 degrees, providing full tracking of the operational area and allowing the system to detect incoming threats from any direction. TAIPAN offers reliable stability in challenging environments. Its advanced signal processing provides accurate tracking of artillery, mortar and missile trajectories, providing accurate data on the location of enemy positions with minimal delay. The system's digital beamforming technology increases its resistance to jamming and electronic countermeasures, making it survivable in electronic warfare scenarios. In addition, the ability of this equipment to be rapidly deployed and redeployed provides flexibility in the fast-moving environment of the battlefield. This combination of long-range detection, high mobility and resistance to electronic warfare makes the TAIPAN radar system an invaluable asset to today's military forces. This not only increases the effectiveness and speed of counter-battery fire, but also significantly contributes to the overall coordination of artillery operations, ensuring a quick and accurate response to artillery threats. With the integration of TAIPAN, British Army artillery units are better equipped to dominate the battlefield, providing a critical edge in modern warfare. The British Army demonstrated its advanced TAIPAN anti-battery radar system during the Dynamic Front exercise recently held at the Rovajarvi training ground in Finland. More than 250 British Army soldiers and more than 5,000 soldiers took part in these exercises. multinational NATO forces from 28 countries. The event provided a unique opportunity to demonstrate the integration of advanced artillery and radar technologies into a tactical environment. One of the key moments of the -Dynamic Front- exercises was the combat firing of the 155-mm self-propelled howitzer -Archer-, which is in service with the 19th regiment of the Royal Artillery and about which told our editorial office It was the first time the British Army had deployed the Archer system in a tactical setting during a multinational exercise. Known for its mobility and accuracy, the Archer howitzer complements the TAIPAN radar, with the two systems working in tandem to provide a rapid response to artillery threats. Swedish company Saab delivered a new generation TAIPAN Artillery Hunting Radar to Great Britain.

propaganda invented a fake about Ukrainian medics and wounded at the front: what this time	The favorite Russian fable about -nationalist battalions- received a new sound. This time, Kremlin propagandists decided that the Ukrainian system of medical evacuation and front-line aid works according to the principle: -Nationalists first, then everyone else.- To create the effect of -horror-, they even added that ordinary soldiers were supposedly specifically denied help in order to save -right-wing radicals-. In fact, the system of medical care in the Armed Forces works smoothly and as efficiently as possible. Priority in the provision of assistance is determined solely by the severity of injuries, regardless of rank, battalion or any other factors. Ukrainian medics work heroically in extremely difficult conditions, saving the lives of every soldier. As for the -nationalist battalions-, this is an old cliché of Russian propaganda, which has long ceased to be true. All units currently defending Ukraine are integrated into the Armed Forces, and there is no privilege for individual groups. Russia really needs to maintain its myth of a -split- in the Ukrainian army. Creating an image of -privileged- and -discriminated- soldiers helps them invent reasons why the Armed Forces continue to successfully defend their land. Moreover, it is a way to devalue the heroism of Ukrainian doctors, who actually perform titanic work. Imagine a field hospital under artillery fire, where doctors with a stopwatch check IDs and determine the -degree of nationalism- of the wounded. In reality, doctors rush to save everyone, risking their lives, and priority is given according to the degree of severity of injuries. The propagandists must have been too engrossed in their own series. The fake about -priority aid to nationalists- once again demonstrates how far Russian propaganda has gone in its fantasies. But let them invent nonsense rather than win real battles. The truth is simple: every Ukrainian soldier and medic proves every day that humanity and professionalism will always win.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/13/rospropaganda-vygadala-fejk-pro-ukrayinskyh-medykiv-ta-poranenyh-na-fronti-shho-czogo-razu/	2025-01-12T20:19:44-08:00

Recently, his mobile fire team shot down an enemy drone that was attacking one of the critical infrastructure facilities. -It happened early in the morning. It was still dusk, so they worked acoustically. First, they heard a slight sound in the clouds, like a two-cylinder moped engine, then they visually fixed the target and opened fire on impression from machine guns. Everything lasted a few seconds, so there was never any time to think. They worked well thanks to the acquired skills, experience, well-aimed and mounted weapons. They realized that they had shot down the target when the drone began to descend uncontrollably. -Shahed- fell in the field in a moment,- recalls the serviceman. A mobile fire team usually consists of several people. Therefore, while there is no approach of the target to our position, someone is left to watch the airspace, and the rest can rest. Timely communication between groups and the command post is also important. The guys can always warn about a threat in our area of ​​responsibility, tell us something. -We have to study and train even more. Increase anti-aircraft defense, in particular mobile fire groups, EW stations. To shoot down all the flying junk of the enemy still at the borders, or turn it back.

Not only do they disguise themselves as civilians: the enemy uses camels in Toretsk	Yevhen Alkhimov, press officer of the 28- of a separate mechanized brigade named after the Knights of the Winter Campaign. -The situation is quite difficult, but there are no territorial changes in our area. We are holding our positions. The enemy is trying to inflict fire damage from the occupied 9th floor. The city is in ruins,- he said. The press officer also spoke in detail about Russian soldiers who dress up in civilian clothes. -It is not the first time that the enemy has changed into civilian clothes to carry out certain actions. In this case, people in civilian clothes enter the building, leave the same in civilian clothes, but already in equipment. This is done to accumulate forces and further assault actions,- explained Yevhen Alkhimov. He told about a recent case when a Russian man in civilian clothes walked the streets with a bag. The man was followed and it turned out that the bag contained anti-tank mines, which the occupier used to mine the roads. -This happens quite often, because the enemy is trying to advance us at any cost, and this is one of his tactics. It happens that so-called -camels- are used - a person in civilian clothes, without weapons, but with backpacks containing ammunition, food, etc. They are noticed, destroyed. And then the next assault group enters this place and they have a certain supply of ammunition and provisions,- said the press officer. Yevhen Alkhimov added that there are still civilians in Toretsk and the Russians are taking advantage of this.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/12/ne-tilky-perevdyagayutsya-v-czyvilnyh-vorog-vykorystovuye-verblyudiv-u-toreczku/	2025-01-12T07:53:29-08:00
-Meat assaults- do not give results: in the East, the occupiers continue to wipe out their infantry	A serviceman of the 1st separate detachment of the special purpose center -Omega- with the call sign -Artist- told about this on the air of the Yedyni Novyni telethon. -Long-term actions of the enemy are expressed in the so-called -meat assaults-, this is their forte. They use only infantry, in this direction they have neither armored nor lightly armored vehicles. Passenger cars or ATVs are used for movement,- said the Artist. He said that the Russians use a significant mobilized resource, but there are also well-trained personnel soldiers. -The mobilized go and die, the personnel know how to analyze and make decisions. Mostly the infantry doesn't even understand the tasks they have to perform,- said the serviceman.

According to her, recently fighters of the 117th heavy mechanized brigade repelled an enemy offensive, in particular, they destroyed six units of enemy equipment. -That is, in our area of ​​responsibility, six units of equipment were advancing - these were tanks, one of which was a T-90, and there were also two infantry fighting vehicles in which the infantry was located. Such a mechanized onslaught was approaching our positions,- said Yuliya Stepaniuk. She noted that initially Ukrainian FPV drones could not attack Russian equipment due to enemy electronic warfare equipment. -That's why our artillery worked well here. This is our famous tracked sniper. They hit these BMPs. It was possible to destroy both the BMP and these REBs. Later, the enemy put forward two tow trucks that wanted to take away the wreckage of this equipment, and they were also destroyed,- said Yuliya Stepaniuk. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 117th heavy mechanized brigade demonstrated hitting a projectile directly into a group of Russian soldiers who were pushing to our positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/12/vorozhi-tanky-j-bmp-hotily-atakuvaty-ukrayinski-pozycziyi-ale-yih-zupynyla-snajperka-na-gusenyczyah/	2025-01-11T23:49:38-08:00
Night attack of the Russian Federation: air defense units shot down 60 enemy UAVs	This is reported by Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Instead of an assault, there is a surrender: the occupiers try to destroy their fighters	The commander of the crew of unmanned aerial vehicles told about this on the Army TV stream on January 12. -Heavenly Punishment- of the 4th brigade of operational assignment -Rubizh- of the National Guard of Ukraine Andriy Otchenash. -With the resources that are in our brigade, we hold the front quite firmly, destroying a large number of representatives of the Russian Federation. For example, during a week of work of our unit, 100 representatives of the Russian Federation and even more die easily. At the same time, with minimal and sometimes zero losses among the Defense Forces of Ukraine, this is also very pleasing,- he assured. According to him, the tactics of the Russians have not changed. They continue to use small assault groups of 2-3 military personnel and try to pin them down in certain positions. -While sending from a distance of 30-100, sometimes 150 meters from each other. Whoever survives will be established. We see that even those military personnel who want to surrender, because they cannot stand the terrible treatment of people, even if it is the enemy, the Russians are trying to destroy their soldiers,- he noted. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian troops use weapons and ammunition produced by the DPRK. However, their effectiveness is seriously doubted due to numerous technical shortcomings.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/12/zamist-shturmu-zdacha-v-polon-okupanty-namagayutsya-znyshhuvaty-svoyih-bijcziv/	2025-01-11T23:04:10-08:00

The French -Caesar- for Anna of Kyiv: how the artillerymen of the 155th brigade studied and fought. ...	ArmyInform was told about this by the commander of the 155th artillery division of the separate mechanized brigade named after Anna of Kyiv, Major Nazar Balagutrak with the call sign -Cossack- and the commander of the 2nd self-propelled artillery battery, Lieutenant Petro Molodik with the call sign -Apostol-. On the position of the CAESAR self-propelled artillery installation, we leave in anticipation of combat work. You don't have to wait too long after arrival - before the command -Cannon to battle!- we barely have time to inspect the positions of the gunners. This is a deep caponir, in which a considerable French self-propelled gun is completely sheltered, as well as a dugout of artillerymen and two separate ammunition storages, one with shells, the other with gunpowder charges, far from the gun and the shelter of the gunners . Positions are disguised so that they can be seen at a distance of several dozen steps is almost impossible. Even knowing that gunners are stationed somewhere here, one has to look closely to see traces of people and equipment. Separate storage of ammunition in two stacks away from the gun and the dugout is necessary so that the shelter of the gunners, the -self-propelled gun-, projectiles or gunpowder could not be hit with one ammunition. At the same time, from two to five dozen charges at a distance of 20‒30 meters from the gun. This amount is enough for effective combat work and at the same time it allows not to expose the position to the danger of losing a significant amount of ammunition. — Depending on the situation and tasks, there may be 50-60 charges at the same time, but, as a rule, we try distribute them so that the enemy's random projectile does not cause terrible damage, - says the commander of the artillery division, Major Nazar Balagutrak. Later at the command post, the officers will explain the priorities of such arrangement of the position: in the first place is the preservation of the lives of the soldiers, in the second place - equipment, in the third place - ammunition. live contact with settlement fighters, find out their needs and monitor combat work. — I try to visit positions, look people in the eye, thank them to them for their work. Or not to thank, but to scold, if they suddenly become stupid. But in most cases, I praise them, because they not only try, but also do well, - says the commander of the artillery division, Major Nazar Balagutrak. humanity in wartime should also be taken into account purely economic criteria, no matter how cynical it sounds, for the first view. - People are an irreplaceable resource. You can sacrifice any equipment just to save a human life. This is primarily from a purely human point of view. But if you calculate how much it costs the state to train one artilleryman, prepare a calculation, then the sums will be huge, - the military officer explains his opinion. So finding ammunition, repairing damaged or replacing lost equipment is much easier and ultimately cheaper than to train experienced artillerymen, provide treatment and rehabilitation of the wounded or pay the families of the dead. Major Nazar Balagutrak is a military man who has connected his life with the Armed Forces since his youth. Since 2019, he has participated in Operation United Forces, at the front from the very first day of a large-scale invasion. Comparing the combat operations of the time of the OOS with the current war, the officer draws attention not only to the colossal increase in the intensity of combat operations, but also on the delegation of authority and responsibility, which did not exist before. — It is difficult to compare the war of the time of the Soviet war after 2022. It was much easier in the OOS — everyone already knew the positions and simply changed brigade to brigade during rotation, handed over and organized combat duty, he says. Now it is necessary to completely organize combat work in a new place from scratch - move the military body, set up positions, establish management and logistics, solve many related issues. — You understand that there are people behind you, there are weapons behind you, and it is necessary to protect, firstly, people, and secondly, to fulfill the assigned combat task with the available forces there. You have to make accurate and correct decisions, because your life and the lives of your people depend on them, - explains the commander of the art division. Lieutenant Petro Molodik, who participated in the anti-terrorist operation in 2014‒2015 , says that all his experience of about one and a half years at that time can be invested in three days of war after the start of a large-scale invasion. In France, fighting on -Caesars- both experienced combat gunners, such as the officers we are talking to, and newcomers, who over the course of two months underwent basic combined military training and professional training in Ukraine, studied. training for gunners at the 199 training center of the Military Academy in Zhytomyr. Even before we went to France, we had a formation of batteries and tactical exercises with live fire, says Major Nazar Balagutrak. fighters to perform combat tasks and the suitability of the unit to participate in combat operations. The first stage is BZVP, the second is individual training in a specialty, the third is collective training as part of an entire unit. - Studying in France is a great experience, because the opportunity to form a unit from scratch is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. As you make him, so he will fight. We were very lucky with the fighters, especially with the firemen, because the people all came with the right attitude, says Lieutenant Petro Molodik. like clockwork — quickly and flawlessly. From the team -Cannon to battle!- just over a minute passes before a shot is fired. During this time, the fighters have time to set up the gun, perform guidance, raise the projectile and gunpowder, and charge the self-propelled gun. Following the first shot, the next one takes place almost instantly - during this time, the calculation has already managed to make adjustments and deliver the charge. For their knowledge of the Caesar self-propelled guns and the ability to work with a cannon, the calculation fighters owe their training in France. It was there that they polished the skills acquired in Ukraine to an impeccable level and learned a lot of useful things about the -self-propelled gun- from experienced French colleagues. - The most important thing that the French taught us was the maintenance of the gun during combat work. From the beginning, we explained that fighters have general training, they can fire on a target, but they need to simulate combat work when the gun is damaged or malfunctions. Therefore, during the exercises, the French could specially pull out a pipe or damage something in the computer so that it malfunctioned, and taught the soldiers how to calculate how to detect and correct an error, says Major Nazar Balagutrak. Also significant attention was paid to individual training by specialty and combined training with simultaneous training in tactical medicine. However, Ukrainian artillerymen note, not everything taught by French colleagues in this regard is suitable for use in the conditions of modern war. — The French have combat experience, but these are completely different theaters of combat operations — Iraq, Afghanistan , Mali in Africa. But you understand that fighting a Muscovite is a completely different story. Therefore, we had to adapt what they taught us to our realities, because ours is not the kind of war they are used to, - explains Lieutenant Petro Molodik. and tactics of combat use of artillery. For example, according to French rules, gun positions are set up at a distance of 20 kilometers from the line of battle, but in Ukrainian realities we have to set up positions at a distance twice as close. because we must have a fire maneuver in the depth of the enemy's ranks. That is, based on the technical characteristics of the gun, we have no other option than to place it 10-12 km from the anti-aircraft missile system, - says Nazar Balagutrak. The French gunners note material support and well-thought-out and well-organized logistics as the strengths of the French. - Their logistics work perfectly - this is exactly what we were sorely lacking at the beginning of the war. The French have it very well thought out and adjusted, but we started to develop in this regard only during the war, - says Major Balagutrak. On the other hand, Ukrainian artillerymen, thanks to their combat experience, have serious advantages in communication and situational awareness. - When the French saw our Delta in action, they would be shocked. They have a similar thing called -Atlas- and it is very complex, it needs secure radio communication channels. Our system works much simpler and better, - says the officer. With special pleasure, the gunners remember how they impressed their French colleagues with the accuracy of shooting. - We showed class at the shootings. There was a training ground where old tanks were broken. The French bought 200 shots for us - and our -Nettle- and the use of drones simply shocked them. Because we simply raised the -Mavik- and from the third shot, having the plug -missed - flight-, put the projectile directly into the tank, - smiles Lieutenant Petro Molody. So the French gunners not only taught the Ukrainians, but also learned themselves, having tried to apply the acquired knowledge in practice at the end of the training. The officers say that the foreign colleagues succeeded quite well, because the level of their basic training is very high. - Everyone likes the comparison with cars. Let's put it this way, 2C1 -Carnation- against -Caesar- is like my father's old -nine- and a good -Mercedes-. The -Nine- drives and she doesn't care, and the -Mercedes- is comfortable, but if the on-board computer is covered there - that's it, call a tow truck, - Lieutenant Petro Molodik says about the advantages of the -Caesar- ACS. The advantages of -Caesar- are obvious, but a complex computerized system can cause an unexpected failure in small moments that can negatively affect the work of self-propelled artillery installations. As an example, gunners talk about the work of a -self-propelled gun- during frost. -Caesar- has many moving parts, and if moisture gets between them and freezes, the system may malfunction. — Because if a little moisture gets in, it freezes and this affects the operation of the sensors. The pressure of the hydraulic system is 200 atmospheres, it is definitely enough to expand the cannon. But the sensors are very sensitive and start to fail. Therefore, it is necessary to disassemble and assemble the cannon every two hours, - explains the officer. In addition, the gunners pay attention to the resource of the cannon barrel of 4 thousand shots, noting that during intensive combat work it will be good if it is enough for 10 months, if not less. And also for the failure of fighters during intense shooting. However, it is not difficult to replace them, because there are spare ones in the kit. However, -Caesar- has significantly more advantages - from several ways of quickly binding to the terrain to the ability to almost instantly calculate individual corrections for each gun when firing . A significant advantage of -Caesar- for ensuring shooting accuracy is the ballistic station, which measures the initial speed of the projectile at the exit from the barrel. Towards the end of the conversation, we return to the greatest advantage of Ukrainian artillerymen. These are motivated and well-trained fighters of gun calculations. During exercises in France, they gave a head start even to younger, stronger and more trained French colleagues and in competitions with crews of foreign colleagues on accuracy and speed of fire they won with a score of 3:1. — You know what they are in did we win In a tug of war! Because there are all young healthy guys, 18‒25 years old, many representatives of the peoples of French Polynesia — healthy, stocky, very strong. And we have older men, says Lieutenant Petro Molodik. However, when it came to combat shooting, the Ukrainians -showed their class- and performed better than the French teachers themselves. — When a person fights for his Motherland, when he understands who and what is behind his back, it is a completely different feeling than participating in military conflicts somewhere far from home on a foreign land. -Patriotism is not an empty word,- says Major Nazar Balagutrak, speaking highly of the soldiers of the gun combat units. Each of them bears the names of Ukrainian hetmans and military leaders — Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, Ivan Mazepa, Petro Skoropadskyi, Simon Petliura and even Nestor Makhna. This is how the French self-propelled guns -Caesar- received Ukrainian callsigns from the 155th brigade named after Anna of Kyiv. The gun, the combat work of whose crew we observed at the positions, is named after Hetman Petro Konashevich-Sagaidachny. Like her heavenly patron, who marched on Moscow, she strikes Muscovites with mercilessly murderous precision.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/12/franczuzkyj-czezar-dlya-anny-kyyivskoyi-yak-vchylys-i-voyuyut-artylerysty-155-brygady-reportazh-armiyainform/	2025-01-11T21:22:20-08:00

Hitchhiker stops drones: US companies join forces with AI to counter barrage munitions	As stated in the information from the authors platforms UNITED24, this partnership brings together IronDome IronNet , a cyber threat detection system, with Asterion's experience at neutralization of unmanned aerial targets. This synergy is aimed at meeting the Pentagon's growing demand for integrated defense solutions, ArmyInform reports. //www.newsweek.com/->magazine Newsweek, the advanced interceptor drone HitchHiker (-Hitchhiker-, in Ukrainian) is an advanced platform designed to counter a wide range of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), not only increases battlefield situational awareness, but is also an effective tool for neutralizing aerial threats. Its deployment underscores the growing role of advanced technology in modern warfare. HitchHiker is a multi-role unmanned interceptor aircraft capable of speeds of up to 450 km/h with a range of 200 kilometers. The system integrates advanced sensors for situational awareness and a secure network environment that enables early detection of enemy drones. Experts in the Netherlands portal Arms Market Research Army Recognition said that the HitchHiker is launched through the ASTERION PERIMASTER C4 system, a sophisticated command-and-control platform that integrates data from long-range sensors. This system places the HitchHiker directly behind incoming threats, allowing operators to visually inspect potential targets in real-time before neutralizing them or recalling the drone to base This flexibility makes the drone valuable for both surveillance and direct action missions. One of the defining features of the HitchHiker is its ability to automatically launch from fixed or mobile platforms. This capability allows it to quickly respond to threats and even counter swarms of drones, a growing concern in today's conflicts. By automating launch and operation, the system reduces response time and maximizes battlefield effectiveness. Looking ahead, Asterion Systems is developing a reactive version of the HitchHiker capable of engaging high-speed reactive UAVs. This upgrade will further expand the tactical application of the drone, allowing it to intercept targets beyond the reach of current electric models and solidifying its position as a leading anti-UAV technology. In today's fast-changing battlefield landscape, HitchHiker deployment is essential addition to the defense arsenal of any country. As conflicts increasingly use UAVs for intelligence, surveillance and strike, platforms like HitchHiker provide a significant advantage. By integrating advanced artificial intelligence and autonomous systems, HitchHiker not only strengthens defense capabilities, but also offers a glimpse into the future of drone warfare. Success in the trials could pave the way for wider deployment across NATO forces, setting a new standard for anti-drone solutions in modern warfare. Rear Admiral Mike Hewitt, director of IronNet, described HitchHiker as a -picture- for warfighters capabilities with the potential to change the dynamics of modern warfare. Economic operation of a drone that uses an all-electric propulsion system provides lower operational requirements and maintenance costs compared to traditional air defense systems such as expensive Patriot missiles.

In the news circulating on Russian channels, it is said that Ukrainian hospitals, in particular in Dnipro, are receiving NATO officers en masse after the -defeats- of the Armed Forces on the battlefield. Kremlin -journalists- even invented -informants- who saw how -foreigners with expensive equipment- were allegedly brought to hospitals, and the entrance to hospitals was guarded by SBU units. And, of course, all patients speak English! In fact, hospitals in Dnipro, as well as in many other Ukrainian cities, are full of our soldiers who risk their lives every day defending Ukraine. They are heroes treated by dedicated doctors. There are no -high-ranking NATO officers- there and there cannot be. This fake is another attempt by the Kremlin to explain to its own audience why the Ukrainian army turned out to be stronger than they thought. Such fakes help Russian propaganda to create the illusion of a -war with NATO- and not with Ukraine. After all, to admit that the Ukrainians themselves are defeating the Russian army is to destroy the myth of the -second army of the world-. That is why the NATO generals appear, who allegedly flooded the Dnipro hospitals. Apparently, Russian propagandists completely forgot that Ukraine has enough of its own talented commanders and strong soldiers who destroy the enemy even in such difficult conditions. As for hospitals, if there are -high-ranking- persons there, then these are our heroes, who deserve this title by their exploits. The story about the NATO generals in the Dnipro hospitals is another example of how Russian propaganda tries to hide its failures. But the truth is simple: Ukraine is fighting without needing fictional heroes. And let fictions remain for Russian talk shows - they fit there.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/12/fejk-pro-nativskyh-generaliv-u-likarnyah-dnipra-navishho-cze-vorogu/	2025-01-11T20:15:49-08:00

In practice, the occupiers will be entertained in hospitals: the new student policy at TOT	About informs Center of National Resistance. Mostly in the so-called rehabilitation centers for -svo- terrorists. There they will work in local clubs and entertain decommissioned -heroes- with cult events. This production practice of cultural studies students is part of the Kremlin's policy of occupying Ukraine. First of all, to Russify the youth and destroy their Ukrainian self-identity. Another thing is to impose a sense of involvement in the -Russian peace- and its exploits, and as a justification for the crimes of terrorists. And Luhansk -academy- of culture and arts is not the only one. As reported by ArmyInform, more than 70,000 residents of the temporarily occupied territories of Donbas who have issued pensions in the Russian Federation never received the promised payments.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/11/na-praktyczi-rozvazhatymut-okupantiv-u-shpytalyah-nova-polityka-studentstva-na-tot/	2025-01-11T10:06:23-08:00

I am sure that these actions are part of a purposeful strategy of the Russian Federation, aimed at destroying the national identity of Ukrainian children by instilling Russian culture, history and language, and involving them in the future to fight against their native country.- Dmytro Lubinets emphasizes that Russia's goal is to create a generation deprived of its national memory. -Ukraine will continue to seek punishment for everyone who encroaches on the lives, safety, and existence of Ukrainian children who were forced to fall under the rule of the aggressor. We must not be silent. Ukraine, together with its international partners, continues to fight for the return of every child to their home and the bringing of the guilty to responsibility!-, says the post of the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.

Life in the -failure- mode: the occupiers are creating social chaos on TOT	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, head of the Luhansk OVA. According to the official version of the occupation authorities, the reason for the delays was a -technical failure- due to which the data of tens of thousands of pensioners was lost. Now everyone who applied for Russian pensions is forced to update the information in the databases. At the same time, the situation in the field of passenger transportation in Luhansk remains critical. Back in October, transport companies complained about a shortage of about 300 drivers due to forced mobilization. Despite an attempt to attract workers by offering one-time payments of 100,000 rubles, a job as a driver in Luhansk can only be obtained through the Military Commissariat. The shortage of personnel and delays in social payments are becoming increasingly obvious consequences of Russian aggression in the occupied territories.

The President of Ukraine disclosed the details of the operation to capture North Korean soldiers	This was announced by the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The capture was made possible thanks to the coordinated actions of tactical group No. 84 of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and paratroopers. Despite the injuries, the prisoners survived and were taken to Kyiv. They are currently communicating with SBU investigators. -This was not an easy task: the Russian military usually finishes off its wounded to hide any evidence of the participation of other countries, including North Korea, in the war against Ukraine,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyi. Detainees are provided with necessary medical care in accordance with international standards. The President also instructed the Security Service of Ukraine to ensure journalists' access to these persons so that the world learns the truth about North Korea's participation in the war. This case is yet another proof of Russia's use of military personnel from other countries for aggression against Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, the soldiers of the Defense Forces of Ukraine -na-kurshhyni/->captured the first military personnel of North Korea who fought for the Rashists on Kurshchyna	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/11/prezydent-ukrayiny-rozkryv-detali-operacziyi-zi-vzyattya-u-polon-pivnichnokorejskyh-soldativ/	2025-01-11T04:32:37-08:00
One with a broken jaw, the other a talker - the first North Korean prisoners from Kurshchyna	About this reported on January 11 by the Security Service of Ukraine. Thus, the Security Service of Ukraine, which documents and investigates relevant crimes, received indisputable evidence of North Korea's participation in Russia's war against our country. We are talking about two North Korean soldiers, one of whom was captured on January 9, 2025 by the fighters of tactical group No. 84 of the SSO, and the other by paratroopers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Immediately after capture, the foreigners were provided with all necessary medical care, as provided for by the Geneva Convention. They were taken to Kyiv to carry out primary investigative measures. They are kept in proper conditions that meet the requirements of international legislation. The captives do not speak Ukrainian, English or Russian, so communication with them takes place through Korean translators in cooperation with South Korean intelligence. At the time of capture, one of the foreigners was carrying a Russian-style military ID issued in the name of another person with registration in the Republic of Tuva, Russian Federation. And the other was without documents at all. During the interrogation, the DPRK soldier, who had the ticket, told the SBU employees that this document was issued to him in Russia in the fall of 2024. Then, according to him, part of the combat units of North Korea were coordinating with Rashist groups for one week.

How to get to the top sniper world league: about the marksmanship course and techniques from experie...	The sergeant-instructor of the sniper training school of the 199th training center of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the call sign -Zub- told ArmyInform about how the role of a sniper on the frontline has changed and how future snipers are trained. The future sergeant-instructor chose contract service in the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2019 after, as a young man, he tried himself in various professions, but never found his vocation in civilian life. — I worked in many places, tried my hand at many things. At some point, he decided to go to serve on a contract, not knowing at the time what service in the army was like. A representative of the 79th Airborne Assault Brigade offered two vacant positions for selection - a scout and a sniper. A sniper sounds cooler, it sounds proud, so I decided to become a sniper, says the soldier. The first visit of -Zuba- to the OOS zone was in 2020 to Maryinka district - half a year before the silence regime was introduced. A year after returning from Maryinka, the district of Stanytsia Luhanska and Shchastya was included in the second rotation. There, at the end of the rotation, the sniper met a large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. After several injuries, including a serious one, the soldier was transferred to the position of an instructor at the sniper school at the 199 training center of the DSHV, where he has been serving for almost a year - since February 2024. The sniper was not even interested in the possibility of leaving the service, because he wanted to continue protecting Ukraine from the Russian invasion. — As long as I'm alive and head-hands-legs are in place, I will serve. I love Ukraine, and although I don't like everything in our country, I am ready to fight for it. the Russians simply attacked, invaded, ruined our lives, ruined the lives of my relatives, friends, and relatives. So it's a matter of principle for me, he says. It is an honor to wear a military uniform and to be among fellow soldiers, to have respect among them, to give them and to receive support from them. Because oath and brotherhood in battle are extremely important. -Zub- says that during the large-scale invasion, the role of the front-line sniper changed a lot compared to the previous period of the war during the ATO/OOS. During the three years of the war, the sniper turned from a highly specialized fighter into a universal soldier. Before full-scale, a sniper is some kind of -semi-legendary figure- who works in a -detachment- from the main forces and no one knows what, where and how he does. A little like in the movies - your tasks, your subordination. Everything is its own, everything is separate. Now a sniper can go to war with a machine gun, and with a grenade launcher, if necessary. If he is near the positions that the enemy is storming and he understands that at that distance it is impractical to work with a rifle, then he will work with a machine gun, says the soldier. Now a sniper must be a universal soldier who cannot work exclusively with a sniper rifle, because during urban battles at short distances of 30-50 meters, an automatic rifle with a thermal imager is much more appropriate and effective. — At the beginning of the war, the first seven months, I didn't even know what a pit was. And many did not know what a pit was - especially those who worked in intelligence units, in sniper units. Arta was met simply: when flying, fell to the ground - and you are already safe, -Zub- explains. Instead, drones now — with skids and kamikaze — require reliable shelter and careful camouflage, and even that is far from always helping to escape them. — The buzz of a drone now feels scarier than the whistle of a falling mine. Because it is enough to fall on the ground from a mine - and 80% that you will not be affected. And with a drone - fall, don't fall, but if there is no shelter, then it is much more difficult to escape. And even if there is cover, the FPV can fly after you, says the sniper. Camouflage has also become significantly more difficult, because often drones are equipped with thermal imaging cameras, from which it is almost impossible to hide. — If earlier it was necessary to camouflage primarily from infantry, now everything has changed — first of all, it is necessary to camouflage from the sky, from drones. That's why we now teach cadets to take cover and camouflage from UAVs to the greatest extent, the instructor emphasizes. Enemy infantry, he says, are now virtually incapable of detecting a trained sniper and rarely attempt to do so. Instead, drones have become a major threat, so hiding from them is critical. — It is now better to spend more time learning to cloak from drones, aerial imagery, and thermal imaging drones than infantry. This is much more important now, because the enemy tries to detect snipers primarily using UAVs, says Zub. Suffering from enemy drones, the sniper is able to help his own drone operators, who cannot provide surveillance and reconnaissance due to difficult weather conditions - strong wind, high humidity, a significant drop in temperature. — In autumn and winter, with worsening weather conditions, the sniper's role as an observer increases, because these are eyes that can watch 24/7. The guys in the trenches can't look at the thermal imager or the -nightlight- continuously, every 5-7 minutes they give their eyes a rest. A sniper is trained not to take his eyes off the sight almost constantly, says the soldier. This allows you to carefully monitor the -gray zone-, because the lack of reliable round-the-clock and every-second surveillance is extremely important - according to the law of meanness, the enemy will try and be able to move unhindered precisely at the moment when no one will see him. It is impossible to start training for a sniper immediately after the BZVP, even with a very significant training target and high indicators of accuracy and accuracy of shooting - it is necessary to pass the selection at the next stage within the limits of separate training. — First of all, you need to take a marksmanship course. This is a 45-day basic course that trains infantry snipers, the entry level of sniping. -We try to take people to the basic or advanced level only after marksmanship courses,- says the instructor. Already after that, training begins for the basic and advanced level of sniping, during which specialists who work with large calibers at significant distances are trained. First of all, they teach night shooting from awkward positions, camouflage and interaction with UAVs. - Shooting - at least 3 times a week. We learn to shoot both at night and during the day, although with the start of a full-scale invasion and especially with the widespread use of drones, day work has lost its relevance. That's why we switch to night work - classes with thermal imaging cameras - how to shoot, where to shoot, how to work, how to adjust, how to install, says the instructor. The course of enhanced intensive training lasts 45 days and is mainly aimed at acquiring practical skills. Theoretical training is also available, but it is tried to be given at the same time as practical training during training, rather than spending time on separate long-term courses without a rifle in hands at the range. — It turns out that we show and explain how it works in practice, and from practice we go to theory. Often the theory written in books is for competition, for shooting in ideal conditions. -We are training a sniper for war,- Zub emphasizes. — We are trying to give the cadets as much shooting as possible from awkward positions, shooting under loads. Just lying down, let's shoot minimally, because it's very simple. We let them do it so that they -scored- their plates and understood how ballistics work. And then there are loads and awkward positions, explains the sniper. This is how preparation for real combat takes place, during which it is now very rare, almost never, to lie quietly with a rifle. — That is why we try to adapt the exercises described in the book in such a way as to adapt them to combat conditions as much as possible. Because the person we let out must be ready for the real conditions he will encounter on the front line, the instructor emphasizes. - The base course is a 308 caliber and an Archer thermal sight. Rifles, usually UAR-10 or Z-10. The increased level is already 338, 8.6 mm. And even higher is already 50 caliber, 12.7 mm. It's Barret and Cadex, says the sniper. Instructors undergo training in NATO countries - France, Britain, Norway, and then transfer knowledge and skills to cadets in Ukraine. However, -Zub- notes, foreigners also learn a lot from the Ukrainian experience. Ukrainian snipers already belong to the top world sniper league. Anyone who shows a high level and shows desire during the BZVP and marksmanship course can join their ranks after undergoing specialized training at the 199 training center of the DSHV.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/11/yak-potrapyty-do-vyshhoyi-snajperskoyi-svitovoyi-ligy-pro-marksmenskyj-kurs-ta-pryjomy-vid-dosvidchenyh-instruktoriv/	2025-01-10T21:13:09-08:00
Professionalism is not measured by age: which company is rearming sniper units of the US Army	The American publication We Are The Mighty, devoted to military topics and materials about military equipment, notes that such Thus, the history of the long process of procurement of new sniper rifles by the Ministry of Defense of the United States, which began in the early 2010s, is coming to an end. ArmyInform reports. The general contract with the Pentagon is for the Army's new sniper weapon system, the MK22 Adaptive Design Multi-Role Rifle. In turn, the official website of the development company Barrett Firearms Manufacturing Inc., late November -is proud to announce that the Marine Corps Systems Command has achieved full operational capability (FOC) to field the MRAD® MK 22 Mod 0 Advanced Sniper Rifle (ASR) one year ahead of schedule term-. -The MK 22 isn't just another rifle, it's a modular, mission-adaptive system that gives the warfighter unparalleled accuracy and flexibility,- said Brian James, Barrett CEO. -We are honored to contribute to this essential effort to modernize the U.S. Army and Marine Corps and to support our nation's elite forces.- The MK 22, according to its developers, offers unmatched versatility with caliber conversion kits that allow easy conversion between 7.62mm, .300 Norma Magnum and .338 Norma Magnum. This adaptability improves the ability to engage targets with accuracy at long ranges. Combined with the state-of-the-art M317 Precision Day Optic, a variable-power scope that calibrates 7-35x magnification, the MK 22 provides a significant leap in capabilities over legacy sniper systems. Barrett designed the MK 22 as a complete system that provides Soldiers with an integrated solution designed to create operational efficiencies. Each rifle kit includes three barrels, a hard and soft carrying case, 15 magazines, a set of cleaning tools and accessories, a silencer, an optic with a scope mount, and special components such as a sniper scout tripod kit and anti-glare. -The MK 22 combines what was previously two rifles into a single platform, easing the burden on the Marine Corps and improving logistics efficiency,- Mr James said. -The ability to change caliber in the field ensures that Marines are ready for any mission, anytime, anywhere.- Another important advantage of the MK 22 is its durability. Maintenance is simplified, most repairs will now be done at the organizational level. In the rare event of a barrel failure, the rifle can be quickly converted to a different caliber, providing continuous operational readiness, an improvement that was unattainable with previous systems. -At Barrett Firearms, we are committed to equipping our armed forces with the tools they need to succeed on the ever-changing battlefield,- said Brian James, Barrett CEO. -The advanced MK 22 Mod 0 sniper rifle exemplifies our commitment to precision, innovation and mission success. As the Marine Corps enters this new era of sniping capabilities, Barrett is ready to support their efforts and the future fight.- As the experts of the Dutch defense research portal Army Recognition told, the MK 22 Mod 0 sniper rifle was developed and manufactured by the American company Barrett, known for its high-precision long-range rifles. Barrett is well known in the market for the M82 .50 caliber sniper rifle, and the MK 22 continues their legacy of creating state-of-the-art sniper systems for military and law enforcement applications. The MK 22 Mod 0 is a large-caliber modular sniper rifle designed to engage targets at distances of 1,500 meters and beyond, meeting the growing need for long-range accuracy in a variety of operational environments. Despite the fact that Barrett Firearms is a young company by the standards of the arms world (it was founded in 1982), Barrett has already managed to make a name for itself as a manufacturer of quality small arms, optical devices and ammunition. The headquarters of the company is located in the state of Tennessee in the city of Murfreesboro. The main focus of the company's work for many years has been large-caliber sniper rifles. After completing the Full Operational Capability stage, the MK 22 Mod 0 ASR (Advanced Sniper Rifle) is now fully operational and available for use by Marine Corps sniper teams. The ongoing success of this program underscores the US Army's commitment to modernizing its equipment and equipping its military personnel with the best possible tools to succeed in any combat environment. As the US Marine Corps continues to improve its sniper capabilities, the MK 22 will become a cornerstone of its strategy to ensure long-range combat superiority. Emphasis will now shift to continuous training, maintenance and operational integration to ensure the MK 22 remains an effective and reliable asset for years to come. US Marines test the new MK 22 ASR bolt-action rifle.

Cash support in the Armed Forces: how much will be paid in 2025	For the year 2025, significant changes in the cash supply and various payments for military personnel are not foreseen for the most part. Unless, of course, changes are made during the year that will allow for increased payments to defenders. But there are those who are promised an increase in money - cadets of higher military educational institutions. How reported by the Ministry of Defense, this was stated by the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Serhii Melnyk at a meeting with cadets of the National Academy of Ground Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny: -As of March 2025, cadets of the 1st-2nd courses will receive payments at the level of the minimum wage in Ukraine, which is 8 thousand hryvnias. Taking into account that the salary will increase, the financial support will also increase in the corresponding ratio. Cadets of 3-4 courses, which are equivalent to contract service, will receive more than 20,000 hryvnias.- Currently, the minimum amount of financial support is 20,130 hryvnias for recruitment. And then everything depends on a very large number of factors: rank, position, seniority, etc. You can read in more detail about what the financial support consists of here. By the way, you can find out the amount of your allowance in just a few clicks. The Ministry of Defense introduced an online calculator /a>. It allows you to find out the amount of payments you should receive quite easily and quickly. You only need to know your rank, length of service and tariff class (you can find it out from the financiers of the military unit). Currently, -combat- pay is the largest financial source for many members of the military. Depending on the place of service and the tasks performed, the Ukrainian military can additionally receive 30, 50 and 100 thousand hryvnias. In addition, there is an additional payment of 70 thousand hryvnias for those who are on the front lines. 100,000 is given to servicemen who are directly participating in hostilities at forward positions, in occupied territory, or between the positions of the Defense Forces and the enemy. This reward is also given to those who carry out fire damage tasks - these are rocket launchers, gunners and anti-aircraft units. Of course, they are not directly on the conflict line. But their time working against the enemy is also counted towards the payment of the 100 thousand reward. 50 thousand are paid to those who perform combat (special) tasks as part of military administration bodies, headquarters and command, which carry out operational management of units. Including outside the areas of hostilities. 30 thousand are received by servicemen who perform combat (special) tasks in accordance with combat orders. In particular: Also, 30,000 gratuities should be paid to those engaged in demining (outside the areas of hostilities) and anti-aircraft cover and ground defense of critical infrastructure facilities. It should be taken into account that such a reward is paid in proportion to the time spent on the front line or the performance of combat missions. On average, a little more than 3 thousand hryvnias per day. For example, if you spent 10 days on the front line, the payment will be a little more than 30 thousand hryvnias. 70 thousand is intended for those who directly perform combat or special tasks on the front line with the enemy or in his rear. This surcharge does not replace -combatants-, but is in addition to them. But it works on a storage system. That is, this money should be paid only after a total of 30 days have passed on the front line. It can be for several months. This is a one-time benefit for servicemen signing their first contract with the Armed Forces. The amount of the benefit depends on the subsistence minimum for able-bodied persons, which is approved every year in the state budget, as of January 1. In 2025, it is UAH 3,028.00. So now, after concluding a contract, you can get: This payment is provided for the military: To get help, you need to write a report in the name of the commander. This is not a complete list of additional benefits that a serviceman can receive. Some of them, for example, regarding sublease or assistance for solving social and household issues, depend on the decision of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine. After all, the order of payments is determined for each year. As soon as the order for 2025 becomes known, ArmiyaInform will immediately report about it.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/11/groshove-zabezpechennya-v-zsu-skilky-platyat-u-2025-roczi/	2025-01-10T20:48:55-08:00
Intergalactic mercenaries on the side of the Armed Forces: another fantasy from the Kremlin kitchen	According to the Kremlin fantasists, these -mercenaries- are not only part of the Ukrainian army, but also plan to attack peaceful Russian citizens, disguising themselves in Russian military uniforms. Why not add flying saucers to it, or at least spies in the form of crows? It would be no less plausible. This entire narrative is a common attempt by Russian propaganda to explain its failures in its own border zone. The only real -threat- in the Kursk region is panic, which Moscow itself creates. Ukraine defends its territories and does not need to invent provocations or look for -mercenaries-. it is beneficial for Russian propaganda to paint the image of an -external enemy- that intimidates Russians and justifies the further militarization of society. Foreign mercenaries are a favorite subject that plays on people's imaginations. After all, how else to explain that the Kremlin will lose the war to Ukraine? This story about foreign mercenaries is another proof that propaganda in Russia works according to the principle: -It doesn't matter if there is logic, the main thing is to sound scary.- Meanwhile, the world is just wondering how deep this morass of absurdity can be.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/11/mizhgalaktychni-najmanczi-na-boczi-zsu-chergova-fantaziya-z-kremlivskoyi-kuhni/	2025-01-10T20:20:12-08:00

According to the officer, although the ammunition comes directly from North Korean factories and is -fresh-, it does not meet modern quality standards. Special remarks concern powder charges, which often have defects. -The North Korean ammunition currently used by the Russian Federation has low-quality powder charges and components. We have seen cases where shells have broken in the bore due to manufacturing defects. Such situations have already happened with the Soviet D-30 howitzers. If these defects are repeated with the North Keres self-propelled guns, it will only be better for us,- the representative of the Armed Forces noted.

Vshchent — the Russian military destroys the civilian infrastructure of Pokrovsk with the help of an...	About it on the air of the telethon -The only news- said the officer of the intelligence department of the brigade of NSU -Rubizh- Hero of Ukraine Vitaly Lytvyn. According to him, the Russians are actively using aerial strikes with guided aerial bombs (CABs), and the selective use of these bombs is a clear confirmation of the aggressor's intention to destroy civilian objects. -We are not observing serious strikes on military positions, on the contrary, the Russians are mercilessly destroying civilian infrastructure, in particular energy networks,- Lytvyn said. The destruction of energy facilities has become a serious problem for local residents. By the end of 2024, almost 90% of Pokrovsk's energy infrastructure was destroyed. This not only made life difficult for civilians, but also became part of the terror strategy. According to Lytvyn, at the end of 2024, the destruction of about 70 civilian buildings was recorded, which underlines the scale and systematic nature of this terror.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/vshhent-rosijski-vijskovi-rujnuyut-czyvilnu-infrastrukturu-pokrovska-za-dopomogoyu-kabiv/	2025-01-10T11:58:46-08:00
From armored vehicles to ATVs: how the weather changes the tactics of the Russians	He told about it on armyTV stream officer of the information and communication service of the 14th operational brigade named after Ivan Bohuna NSU -Chervona Kalyna- Maksym Bakulin. According to him, difficult weather conditions force the enemy to change their approach to combat operations, giving preference to mobile transport. -Today, the enemy does not use a single tactic. They use various means to carry out assaults. Most often, these are quadricycles or high-terrain vehicles, because heavy equipment or armored vehicles cannot overcome difficult terrain, especially swampy areas, due to weather conditions,- the officer noted.

The President of Ukraine emphasized the importance of security guarantees for achieving peace	The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky told about this in an interview with the Italian TV channel RaiNews24. -We want peace more than anyone else. And this is understandable, because we lose more than everyone, especially people. But before agreeing on something, it is very important that these are serious security guarantees for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe,- the president emphasized. According to him, such guarantees should make it impossible to repeat aggression on the part of Russia, as it happened after the occupation of Crimea in 2014 and subsequent events in 2015. During the interview, Zelenskyi also noted the importance of Italy's support for Ukraine and emphasized the need to maintain European unity in the fight against Russian aggression.

$300 per head — in Odesa, a border guard cut a hole for evaders to Europe	The State Bureau of Investigation reported this on January 10. SBU employees, in cooperation with the SBU and the State Border Service, exposed a law enforcement officer who organized money on the passage of men of conscription age through the transit section of the road with the Republic of Moldova. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine, the transit section of the Odesa-Reni road, which passes through the territory of Moldova, has been subject to regime restrictions. In particular, the control bodies must inform the TCC about men who are subject to mobilization and try to pass the checkpoint without registration documents. In December 2024, one of the law enforcement officers decided to make a little money from the unimpeded passage of conscripts and offered a businessman he knew to transport willing men under the guise of -goods-. For the passage of such a -transit taxi- he asked to pay him $300 per passenger. According to operational data, he could let dozens of people through the post. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/po-300-za-golovu-na-odeshhyni-prykordonnyk-prorubav-dlya-uhylyantiv-shparynu-do-yevropy/	2025-01-10T11:03:50-08:00

Volodymyr Zelenskyi on new US sanctions: this is a serious step in the fight against Russian aggress...	This was announced by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his post in Telegram. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyi, these measures significantly affect the financial basis of the Russian military machine, because they block key elements of the supply chain. Russian energy companies, insurance organizations, service providers in the oil and gas industry, 184 tankers of the -shadow fleet-, as well as logistics facilities and companies from third countries were sanctioned. -It is especially worth noting the pressure on companies such as Surgutnaftogaz, which is a key financial source for the Putin regime,- Volodymr Zelenskyi emphasized. The head of state emphasized that such steps send a clear signal: criminals should be held accountable for their actions. The less income Russia receives from oil and energy resources, the sooner peace will come. The president also noted that energy resources should not be used as a weapon, as the Russian Federation does. He called on countries that respect international law to ensure a stable and reliable energy supply for the world. -We are sincerely grateful for America's leadership in holding Russia accountable. I am sure that these steps will significantly reduce oil revenues, and with it Russia's ability to continue aggression,- concluded Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukraine continues to fight for the return home of children who were victims of illegal deportation and forced displacement by Russia. This issue became one of the main topics of the talks between the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi and the President of Italy Sergio Mattarella.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/volodymyr-zelenskyj-pro-novi-sankcziyi-ssha-cze-serjoznyj-krok-u-borotbi-z-rosijskoyu-agresiyeyu/	2025-01-10T10:27:36-08:00

Medic -Norman-: six destroyed enemies and 16 days of steadfast defense	His heroic story was shared on its Facebook page by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine . -Norman- is a 48-year-old combat medic of a mechanized platoon who, together with three brothers, stopped the enemy's attempts to advance deep into Ukrainian positions for 16 days. As -Norman- tells, in the composition of four fighters, they occupied two observation points that were located close to each other. -Norman- divided his men in such a way that the experienced fighters were in the front post and the younger ones were in the rear. An important element of their success was a competent position, thanks to which they became almost invisible to enemy UAVs. -Thanks to our competent position, we were practically invisible to enemy -birds-, so the enemy, coming to our positions, practically did not see us,- he notes. Considering the situation, -Norman- decided to use the available weapons in order to stop the enemy. Three cluster mines were initially planted, and one of them stopped three Russian soldiers. After that, using grenades, -Norman- destroyed three more occupiers. -We let them get as close as possible and destroyed them&#8230; The main thing is to prepare the guys, to give them an understanding of who and what to do, to tell what everyone's actions are if the enemy approaches from one side or the other. When people understand what they need to do and what to expect, then they are more confident and calm,- he explains. His calm expression and confidence help to maintain the morale of his subordinates. -I don't know, it somehow works out that way. The fighters see me, my calm expression on their faces, and, probably, they are also less nervous. Even if I'm nervous or tense, it doesn't show in any way, so the fighters feel a certain confidence in me. I don't have any other explanations,- adds the military man.From anticipation of war to the front line: how -Matroskin- became a machine gunner	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/medyk-norman-shist-znyshhenyh-vorogiv-ta-16-dniv-nepohytnoyi-oborony/	2025-01-10T09:19:24-08:00

Russians are massively looking for their missing soldiers: the Ukrainian project received 52,000 req...	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. This figure does not include the dead and is 2-3 times less than the total number of missing Russians, because not all relatives turn to the Ukrainian project. The Russian authorities are trying in every possible way to hide information about the losses that the Russian army is suffering in the attempt to occupy Ukraine. The topic of missing, captured and dead occupiers is taboo in Russia. &nbsp; Using the information provided within the framework of the project, Russians get the opportunity to confirm the status of prisoners of war or the dead and to request exchanges from the Russian authorities. In 2024, information was provided about 1,570 Russian soldiers being held captive in Ukraine, of which 397 were exchanged for the Defenders of Ukraine. The statistics of appeals to the -I want to find- project show the increase in losses of the aggressor's army in Ukraine. The majority of applications relate to those missing in 2024, with 29,472 occupants. The largest number of invaders disappeared in the fields and plantations of Donetsk region — 19,025 occupiers, in particular in Pokrovsky (8,597) and Bakhmutsky (5,164) districts. Another 3,069 occupiers disappeared on the territory of Russia, mainly in the Kursk region. 63% of the missing are young men aged 17-39. Among the 20 units of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, which lead the lists in terms of the number of missing persons, 8 are staffed by illegally mobilized people in the ORDLO (-people's republics-). The Russian military leadership uses these units as -cannon fodder- and does not pay attention to the loss of personnel. 73% of Russians who contacted the -I want to find- project said that they do not support Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It seems that only after losing their loved ones, Russians begin to realize the real cost of the bloody war unleashed by their country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/rosiyany-masovo-shukayut-svoyih-znyklyh-bezvisty-vijskovyh-ukrayinskyj-proyekt-otrymav-52-tysyachi-zapytiv-za-2024-rik/	2025-01-10T06:26:49-08:00

I went in at one place, and went to the shore 200 meters from it. Crossed the river twice - there is an island between its arms. Then he walked through the swamps, leaning on a stick.

Genocide of the occupiers, -secret laboratories- for -fpvishok- and printing parts for a drone on a ...	The Royal Brigade is defending one of the strategic cities in Donbass - Chasiv Yar. For more than half a year, the brigade has been destroying the occupiers and preventing the enemy from advancing. The enemy suffers colossal losses in manpower and equipment. ArmyInform asked Vyacheslav about how it is possible to deter raiders in battles in urban areas, why FPV drones have become -ambulance- on the battlefield for our infantrymen, about the work of the -secret laboratory- of maintenance of -fpvishok- and how much time requires a 3D printer to print one part for the drone. The city of Chasiv Yar is located on the heights. The occupiers really want to capture it, because it is actually the gate to Kostyantynivka, Druzhkivka and Kramatorsk. The Russian offensive on the city began back in April 2024, the 24th Brigade arrived here to replace units of the Defense Forces in June. The strategic advantage of our forces here is the channel, which makes it difficult for the enemy to move and use armored vehicles. However, the city is constantly under enemy fire: anti-aircraft missiles and constant artillery fire. the Russians are trying to cross the channel and advance in the city itself. In some areas of the city, there are heavy urban battles. -The main concept of functioning of our unit? We are organizing a local genocide of Russians in our direction. Our daily tasks are to make the world less dirty and cleaner. Fighting our defenders from the Royal Brigade is the Russian 98th Airborne Division plus attached units. Racist paratroopers are not some fools, not a bunch of mobs from the -DNR-, -LNR- or the Siberian hinterland. They know how to fight, there is nothing disorganized or chaotic, their offensive actions are thought out. But people do not mean anything to the Kremlin, the Rashists die en masse and this does not stop them for a single day. Currently, there are no significant changes in the tactics of the enemy. As before, the occupiers are betting on manpower, small assault groups. They try to cross the Siverskyi Donetsk-Donbas channel, accumulate in broken houses and basements, and then try to attack. This is a brief description of the enemy's actions. We stop enemy attacks with kamikaze drones and drops from FPV drones and Maviks. We cut the occupiers, wherever they are hiding. Our drones are always in the air. the Rashists, as they enter in small assault groups of 5-6 people, immediately disperse, run to basements, broken houses and sit. We use drones to -smoke- them out of hiding places. If it is not possible to get the Russian army out into the fresh air, we attach a powerful reset and hide the enemy under concrete slabs forever. Lately, this is what we do regularly, so as not to fly after each individual rashist, we -ground- them all together in the basements. And we destroy the enemy, and he will no longer use the shelter to entrench himself in the area. The main thing during combat missions is interaction with reconnaissance UAVs, strict adherence to the orders of the command, which determines the priority of targets and gives the go-ahead for use. In fact, FPV drones have become an -ambulance- for our front-line infantrymen. If the enemy did not reach our positions, then the task was completed perfectly. Once, during the occupier raid, two rioters ran into the basement of an apartment building. Our -fpvishka- flew there immediately and as many as eight Russians ran out. We were in shock. So, on that day, I remember, we caught these -paratrooper rats- hiding in the holes all over the city for more than three hours. They put everyone together. Ideally, how combat work should go: one drone - one sortie - one destroyed occupier. But it doesn't always work out that way. Sometimes more drones go to the same target. Depending on the nature of the terrain, weather conditions, pilot accuracy. Somewhere, the enemy may have been -silenced- or the radio horizon does not allow lowering, or they simply missed the target, something else, different things happen. How we work: a drone is attached to a reset system - it's a bomber. We have an FPV-kamikaze that did not catch a reset. Accordingly, the reset systems are very different, there are many variations. Incendiary substances, cumulative, fragmentation, high-explosive, thermobaric, in the word -love-dove-. Of course, in an urbanized area, we use fragmentation ammunition less, but they are always ready. There is a certain amount of cumulative ammunition in case enemy vehicles go on an assault. Russians also learn, they understand that during the day it is better not to use equipment, even with electronic devices, because sooner or later it will be -unwinded-. The enemy uses it during bad weather conditions, for example, when there is low cloud cover and a plus in the morning -in gray-. Armored vehicles jump in just to land a landing party and immediately run away. But it is quite often blown up on our mines.- The collection, maintenance, retrofitting and testing facility for FPV drones supplied to Royal Brigade units is hidden away from the front line. The boys jokingly refer to it as the -secret lab-. In fact, this place is a -fat- target for the enemy. From the outside, you'll never know what's hidden inside. Large room, multiple workstations, laptops, inspection and repair equipment, 3D printers, drone storage, staff rest beds. Work is also boiling in another room. Literally every meter of the -laboratory- is sharpened for working with drones. CCTV cameras are working so that no one from outside can enter the territory. Maintaining secrecy is important to the unit today. The guys are all in civilian clothes. The vast majority of military personnel are from Western Ukrainian regions. This is also, obviously, a brigade from Lviv Oblast. -FPV drones come to us both through government funds and through volunteer support. Almost all of them come in raw, to say the least. Before sending them to perform combat missions, it is necessary to -trust- them to a combat-ready state. The secrets to a long FPV drone life: careful maintenance and replacement of parts to ensure their reliability and durability. We check the integrity of the drone, inspect each component in detail to make sure there are no damages or weak points. These are the hull, propellers, electronics, engine and mountings. Quite often, -fpvishki- come with low-quality parts, especially the mounts for the camera, antennas and other important elements. Then -flashing- the electronic system, checking the signals from the radio system. Where it is necessary to replace the batteries, the duration of the flight depends on it. The greater the weight of the resets, the more capacious and more powerful the battery should be. Maintenance of motors and propellers is self-evident, everything is important here - noise, vibration. If the camera is weak, we change it, the same applies to the video transmitter. In general, the application of an FPV drone is a rather complicated system. This is the work of repeaters, ground stations plus remote controls, glasses. Everything must be collected and tested. Testing is carried out on a training ground. Our -lab- masters are all able to fly drones. To feel its work with your fingers. In fact, they check the maneuverability of the drone, its stabilization, how it performs at a long distance and other parameters. The FPV drone must show its best performance before sending it to combat. A priori, he must be combat-ready. This is an axiom. If there are defects, the guys find out the causes of the problems and further test them. Until it's ok. Work without days off, around the clock. Combat units for -fpvishka- are prepared in another place. Depending on the combat mission and its complexity, we prepare a certain number of FPV drones for combat sorties. Guys go to the position with a certain margin. If more is needed, we promptly deliver drones to the positions. There should always be plenty of them. It cannot be that there are few of them. Capable and abundant drones help save the lives of our infantry on the front lines. 3D printing makes almost everything for FPV drones. Parts, some fasteners, covers, different shapes, even a case for ammunition can be made. That is, it is cheap and very fast, which is the main thing. Anyone can make it themselves, you don't need to be a great specialist to learn how to work on a 3D printer. The software is launched, we draw the desired part, pour it onto the printer itself, and printing begins. For example, one mount for a video camera is printed in about 3 hours, of course, something simpler takes less time. We have plenty of plastic for printing parts. The printer works non-stop, 24/7. Honestly, I don't know how we lived without it, without a 3D printer. By the way, we also print the details on the -maviks- here. Fortunately, we have a guy who, before the Great War, was an architect in civilian life. Tyamushchy, -cuts- details on a printer like a chef ingredients for his dishes in an expensive restaurant. We are at war with the Russians, there are a lot of them. Russia presses and advances every day. Therefore, we will always lack people. More FPV drone operators and pilots are needed to destroy Russia. We must stop them and destroy them. Accordingly, as many people as possible are needed to prepare the drones for battle. We have guys with completely different specialties serving here. Humanitarians, teachers, journalists, builders, citizens of Aitiv, ordinary workers. All are self-taught, no one taught us how to hold a soldering iron in our hands. Only two of our -civilian- unit repaired computer equipment. Join the Ukrainian army. Now it is possible to independently choose a place of service, a specific division and a position, even without the participation of the TCC, if someone is afraid. Ukraine must be defended now, you cannot just sit at home and wait for Muscovites to come to your home. Our military part belongs to the list of priority equipment parts, so there should be no problems. There are recruiting centers where they will help you and the candidate will receive up-to-date information on available vacancies. By the way, the recruiting center of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo operates at the address: Lviv, st. Osmomysla, 9.

The actor from the series -Dilnychiy from the DVRZ- commands a platoon at the front: the story of Ju...	Before the large-scale invasion, Ihor was known to Ukrainians thanks to many films and series, in particular, -Dilnichiy z DVRZ-, where he played one of the roles. How is the Ukrainian actor doing now? Did previous production experience help in the army? But what should he say to the men who have not yet joined the Armed Forces? The junior sergeant told our correspondents about this: -I have two higher educations: one is acting, the other is economic, -Theatrical Business Organization.- It so happened that two of them helped me in the army at the same time. Because now I am acting as a platoon leader, and my organizational skills have turned out to be useful. I worked at the Kyiv Academic Theater of the Young Spectator in Lypki. By the way, the director Artur Artemenyev is there and he is also fighting now. But even on vacation, he tries to come and stage and rehearse plays. Asked me if I was ready to play. I think not yet, I cannot jump over this barrier and quickly return to civilian life. By the way, many actors from the theater have already been drafted into the army. Yes, I am known for my roles in the films -Iron Hundred-, -Mom, I love the pilot-, -District from the DVRZ-&#8230; In general, if you look at my filmography, some of my roles are military. For example, in the tape -Khalep for 5 bucks- I play a military man who was in the ATO. But when you see all this not on the set, but in real life, then, you know, in the war, everything is completely different, the other truth of life is cruel. I joined TCC in 2022. About two or three months after the beginning of the large-scale invasion, he was engaged in volunteering. Well, then I already said to myself: I can't be here, I must be there, because my duty as a citizen of Ukraine is to protect. After Buchi and Gostomel and many occupied cities, I felt that I should be there, with my brothers. My family accepted and supported my decision. Was trained in Britain. They really cooked well there. At least people do not get lost in a stressful situation after such training. The more you know and are able to do, the more chances you have to survive. When he got to the 21st separate battalion, at first they performed tasks in the Kyiv region. Then we moved to the Bakhmut direction. When commanding people, in my opinion, humanity should come first. You have to carry out combat orders, combat orders and always think about how to save personnel. But you must also have a core. Of the places where our platoon visited, the most difficult, perhaps, were in Klishchiivka, Vesely, Krasnohorivka. Although in fact it is difficult everywhere. We have enemy assaults almost 24 hours a day. Lots of drops, lots of drones, fiber optic drones. And here in civilian life you see: one is walking, the other is afraid, the other is at the border. The Great Abyss&#8230; If I had the opportunity to address the men who still live in rose-colored glasses and cling to women's skirts, I would tell them that they should understand who is behind their backs. Do I need to be reminded of this? You have to be ready to walk this path. If we don't do it, no one will do it for us. Otherwise, we will be destroyed, or the enemy will force us to fight for him. If the occupiers come, they will bring you to your knees, kill your wife and children. Because the present enemy is cruel. Therefore, civilian men should at least think about their families. This should be their main motivation. It is necessary to go to the army in order to restrain the enemy and in order for us to live normally in the future, raise children and grandchildren, work, talk and breathe freely in our country. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/aktor-z-serialu-dilnychyj-z-dvrz-komanduye-vzvodom-na-fronti-istoriya-molodshogo-serzhanta-igorya-pisnogo/	2025-01-09T20:33:22-08:00
Fragile killer -Shakhediv-: what is known about the anti-aircraft missiles that Ukraine will receive...	How reported ArmyInform, this was discussed at the beginning of November 2024 at a meeting in Kyiv of the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General Anatoly Klochka with by the management of the specified company. By data of the official Frankenburg portal, this defense firm from Tallinn aims to revolutionize the guidance systems in specialized weapons. The Mark 1 missile uses an AI-based situational awareness program. Frankenburg Technologies General Director Kusti Salm calls this technology reliable, and its testing in Ukraine should begin in 2025. According to him, everything is ready for testing, and the developed technology has attracted wide attention of representatives of the specialized market. -The technology is very reliable, and we will start testing it in Ukraine this year,- said Kusti Salm, which cited by Estonian news portal ERR.ee. According to the rocket builder, the project is already ready for testing. Probably based on the principles of military-commercial secrecy, this Baltic company does not reveal any details about their product. On the manufacturer's website, it is only stated that the mission of the Estonian gunsmiths is to -equip the free world with the technologies necessary to win the war-. Meanwhile, Bloomberg authors highlighted the Frankenburg company among the four leading European high-tech start-ups in the defense industry. -Estonian company with a simple motto - &#8220;Technology will win in war&#8221; — produces cheap missiles to shoot down drones that use software to accurately hit targets,- Bloomberg notes. According to Kusti Salma, a possible ceasefire in Ukraine will not reduce the demand for new weapons. > -There will be a new and much larger war in Europe,- he predicted gloomily in a conversation with Bloomberg reporters. In turn, analysts of the research portal According to information from open sources, the ICC Defense Express (DE) made quite meaningful conclusions about this product. The publication notes that the specific characteristics of the Mark 1 anti-aircraft missile have not been published. But an official image posted on the company's website gave them a hint. -Obviously, we are talking about a very small anti-aircraft missile, perhaps with a total length of about 0.5 meters. And this is really the only possible option to mass-produce such means,- DE experts state. That is why, according to them, the photo below is obviously a full-size mockup of this anti-aircraft missile, which received other aerodynamic surfaces. span> After all, according to the researchers from IKK Defense Express, the task of the Mark 1 is to intercept drones, and therefore it is quite logical to use a comparable means. -Because objectively, of course, it is possible to hit Shahed with 7-meter missiles from the S-300, but it is orders of magnitude more profitable - with much cheaper means, if they demonstrate the appropriate effectiveness,- DE emphasizes. According to the vision of the weapon under study, the publication's experts believe that considering everything in Frankenburg Technologies made a number of absolutely correct conceptual decisions. -Based on the given description, for example, (Estonians, ed.) could use a camera and &#8220;machine vision&#8221; as a homing head. with auto-detection and auto-targeting. And such a solution is orders of magnitude cheaper than any other option with a radar, infrared, or even semi-active laser guidance system,- DE believes. there is a radio command solution, when only control signals are transmitted to the missile itself, and the ground station takes over all calculations with the missile and target alignment in space. -The small size of the rocket immediately means that its creation requires many times less solid fuel and other materials. But there remains the question of the range, height and power of the warhead,- DE emphasizes. At the same time, they tentatively took the Stinger missile as a guide: with a length of 1.5 meters, it has a range of up to 6 km, a height of up to 3.5 km, and the weight of the warhead is 2.3 kg. -If Mk 1 from Frankenburg Technologies is three times smaller, then it is possible to expect approximate parameters to 2 km in range, up to 1 km in height and a warhead weighing about 0.5 kg. That is, it is quite sufficient for the destruction of drones, which is what the entire development concept is based on,- the experts of the IKK Defense Express portal summarized their conclusions.

Protests that did not exist: the factory of fakes of the Russian Federation created a new fact about...	This time, the Russian media decided to -hint- to Ukrainians that they themselves allegedly do not like their own struggle for freedom. According to the scenario of the propagandists, a wave of mass protests against mobilization and the continuation of hostilities swept across Ukrainian cities. Of course, there were no such protests. But when was propaganda about the truth? Russian media said war-weary Ukrainians took to the streets to demand an end to mobilization and talks with Russia. Fake videos circulated on Telegram channels purportedly show crowds with placards shouting anti-war slogans. This -information piece- was supplemented with classic elements: The first and main proof that this event did not happen is the complete absence of mentions in independent media or even Ukrainian social networks. The modern world leaves no chance to hide large-scale rallies, no matter how much some government wants it. The second proof is the absurdity of the idea itself. Ukrainians know what they are fighting for. Even in the most difficult moments of the war, society continues to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine. There are simply no prerequisites for such protests. This fake has several functions: We are all well aware that Russian propaganda has long since turned into a theater of the absurd, where fiction and manipulation play the main roles. But every such fake can and should be exposed. Ukraine is fighting not only for its territory, but also for the truth. And every exposed fake is another victory in this war. Therefore, the next time you see the -news- about Ukrainians protesting against themselves, remember: this is another scene from a Russian drama that has nothing to do with real life.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/protesty-yakyh-ne-bulo-fabryka-fejkiv-rf-stvoryla-novyj-fakt-pro-ukrayinu/	2025-01-09T20:01:06-08:00
Our prisoners were tortured - three jailers-traitors from Horlivka were informed of the suspicion	This was announced by the Security Service of Ukraine on January 9. The extras are three residents of the region: Andriy Kononenko, Dmytro Andreev and Artem Karyanov, who at the beginning of the full-scale war joined the occupation -department for the execution of punishments for the DNR-. There they were appointed guards of the Russian torture chamber, which the Rashists had set up on the basis of the captured correctional colony No. 27 in Horlivka. In the torture chamber, they organized so-called -receptions-, when during the first day of imprisonment Ukrainian prisoners were beaten to death with special PR-73 batons. According to the military counterintelligence of the SBU, in this way the Rashists immediately tried to psychologically break the victims and -beat- their consent to cooperation with the Russian Federation. In case of refusal, the perpetrators imprisoned the prisoners in solitary confinement or overcrowded cells, where they were left standing for a long time, without food and water. Another form of torture used by the perpetrators was an imitation of a -shooting- with firearms, when the victims were placed against a wall and shot next to them. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed Andreyev, Karyanov and Kononenko in absentia about the suspicion under part. 2 Art. 28, ch. 1 Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (war crimes committed by a group of persons based on a prior conspiracy). Since the perpetrators are in the temporarily occupied part of the territory of Donetsk region, comprehensive measures are being taken to find them and punish them. As reported by ArmyInform, law enforcement officers detained a couple suspected of involvement in the terrorist attack near the administrative building of the TCC in Dnipro.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/katuvaly-nashyh-polonenyh-povidomleno-pro-pidozru-3-tyuremnykam-zradnykam-z-gorlivky/	2025-01-09T11:58:22-08:00

Rustem Umyerov also thanked the Netherlands for significant and consistent assistance to the Ukrainian military. -This partnership has already significantly strengthened Ukraine's defense capabilities, and we are working to develop it further. The key topic of the meeting was the direction of investments in joint defense projects,- he noted. According to him, a particularly important direction is the production of long-range drones. They discussed in detail how to make this process as efficient as possible and analyzed the best direct financing mechanisms. The possibility of using revenues from frozen Russian assets to support the production of spare parts for drones was also considered. According to the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, this can become an effective tool for increasing Ukraine's defense capabilities. -Another key topic of the talks is strengthening our air defenses. The Netherlands will soon provide assistance that will significantly strengthen our defense of the sky. Grateful for the support, initiative and consistency,- he summed up.

Russian attack aircraft were coming, and then they flew away - the sniper work of our gunners	The video of the defeat was published on January 9 on the brigade's channel. The occupiers were moving along the road without observing distances, so the shell that exploded just inside the group had a great killing power. When the drone arrived at the site, it recorded the abandoned bodies of the dead. Another part could be torn apart by an explosion, and someone could later die from injuries. As reported by ArmyInform, the situation in the Pokrovsky direction remains tense due to significant concentration of enemy infantry, which is carried on motorcycles. This was reported by the head of the communications department of the 117th heavy mechanized brigade, Lieutenant Yuliya Stepaniuk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/rosijski-shturmovyky-ishly-a-potim-rozletilysya-snajperska-robota-nashyh-artylerystiv/	2025-01-09T11:41:24-08:00
The Defense Forces explained why the Russians began to use less equipment and small assault groups	On January 9, deputy told the commander of the battalion of the 68th separate hunting brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush -The Italian-. -Now the advance of small groups of the enemy is slower. Weather conditions will play into our hands a little. As long as the enemy does not use either light armored or heavy equipment. We are talking now about an infantry advance, about an infantry effort to storm our positions,- he said. According to him, the enemy has recently started shelling Ukrainian positions more with artillery. He is looking for our firemen and begins to have a little nightmare. Here they became more active. And the heavy bombardment intensified,- he noted. The -Italian- noted that there was fog for most of the day, so the enemy began to use artillery more. -It is very difficult to work with drones. And due to the fact that they have more ammunition, it seems to me that they like to shoot at random, like artillery training,- he explained. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Pokrovsky direction the enemy 31 times /->started collisions of varying intensity. Our defenders repelled 20 enemy attacks in the areas of the settlements of Baranivka, Myrolyubivka, Elizavetivka, Promin, Lysivka, Zelene, Zvirove, Novy Trud, Pokrovsk, Kotlyne, Uspenivka, Novovasylivka, and Novoelizavetivka.

Norway will provide Ukraine with military aid worth 2 billion euros — Rustem Umyerov	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported this on the evening of January 9. -In 2025, Norway will direct the largest military aid in its history — more than 2 billion euros — specifically to Ukraine. These agreements will bring our cooperation to a new level. Together with Mr. Gram, we discussed the priority areas of using this assistance,- Rustem Umyerov said. According to him, during the meeting special attention was paid to the issue of strengthening air defense systems. -This is a critical direction, and we count on support from Norway. In addition, Norway will continue to invest in the Ukrainian defense-industrial complex and joint projects, in particular in the production of ammunition. We discussed a new mechanism of cooperation - the -Norwegian model-, which will complement the already successful -Danish model- and strengthen our defense capability,- said Rustem Umyerov. He reminded that Norway is one of the countries that helps not only on the battlefield, but also promotes the unification of European countries to support Ukraine. -I thanked Mr. Bjorn Arild Gram for Norway's leadership in the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities and for a significant contribution to the support of Ukraine,- Rustem Umyerov concluded.

Our FPV drone sat on the side of the road and waited for enemy traffic. Thus, the energy of the batteries was saved. When a Russian buggy appeared on the road, the drone rose and hit the target. The buggy flew off the road and its passengers were injured. The next drone set the buggy on fire, and the third checked to see if everything possible had been destroyed. -Times change, methods of warfare change and, of course, ambush options change! The smarter and smarter survive. Don't be a template player, think and work creatively! War is also art!-, the unit commented on the video. As ArmiyaInform reported, the pilots of the UA_REG Team unit of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces made a selection destruction of Russian transport in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/sydyat-i-chekayut-na-czil-nashi-speczpryznachenczi-zrobyly-zasidku-drona-na-zemli/	2025-01-09T10:32:52-08:00

Our drones not only hit enemy equipment, but also detonated the ammunition. It did the same when destroying Russian guns. If there were no shells nearby, a hole was made in the barrel of the cannon. It is interesting that the enemy gunners only recorded the work of our pilots on their phones. They will later tell the children that they were sent to the infantry by the -Birds of Magyar- themselves. They will be if they survive. -Slicing interesting situations. January is busy in Donbas.

Drivers and doctors - what kind of specialists is the top division of the HUR looking for?	published answers to common questions about service in military intelligence on its social media pages. subdivision of GUR MOU -Artan-. In particular, the post refers to the salary and material support of intelligence officers. -Salaries are calculated according to a separate tariff grid. It can reach 200 thousand. per month: depending on the tasks and duration of stay in the area of ​​execution of the combat order,- the post says. The unit also provides personnel with food, medical aid, ammunition and transport for the period of stay in the district. At the same time, the intelligence representatives emphasized that most of the positions in -Artan- are combat positions. Therefore, the unit created an effective system of rotations of the military, so that people could restore strength after completing tasks. -We compensate the load on the military with regular rotations: after each task. This year, the unit has grown across the state. Additional positions of driver mechanics, medics, and engineers have appeared,- the department's page reports. Separately, the special officers commented on the current topic regarding the possibility of transfers. According to the published post, it is currently easier for civilians who wish to serve in intelligence to immediately mobilize to Artan than to later look for ways to transfer to GUR from the Armed Forces. The main difficulty lies in the different subordination of structures, so the procedure can be extremely long. Earlier, the officer of -Artana- with the call sign Favorite congratulated Ukrainians on the New Year and summed up the year 2024. According to him, during the year, the unit has grown many times over, and it has also been possible to significantly improve the system of intelligence support for planning operations. On New Year's Eve, the head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence, Kyrylo Budanovrecorded an appeal in which he personally thanked the commander - Artan- Viktor Titan for effective work.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/vodiyi-j-medyky-yakyh-fahivcziv-shukaye-topovyj-pidrozdil-gur/	2025-01-09T10:02:46-08:00
Procurement for the Armed Forces: agencies of the Ministry of Defense are preparing to work already ...	This was told by the director of Radio NV in an interview Gleb Kanevskyi of the Procurement Policy Department of the Ministry of Education and Culture. According to him, this applies to both rear and procurement of weapons and ammunition. -This will make it possible to immediately start providing the Armed Forces of Ukraine under the new budget, while the provision of the Armed Forces under the transitional contracts of 2024 continues now. That is, the work is ongoing, the reform of the procurement system in the Ministry of Defense is ongoing,- noted Hleb Kanevskyi. He recalled that in 2024 the procurement agencies of the Ministry of Defense - -State Rear Operator- and -Defense Procurement Agency- used the largest budget in the history of Ukraine for the provision of the Armed Forces during a large-scale invasion. In total, 370 billion hryvnias were mastered during one calendar year. Independent Supervisory Boards were also established in both agencies, most of whose members were chosen by recruiting companies as a result of open tenders. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense responded to criticism regarding changes to the charters of procurement agencies. Introducing these changes is not an attempt to destroy the procurement reform of the Ministry of Defense, but a legislative requirement to prevent threats to National Security.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/zakupivli-dlya-zsu-agencziyi-minoborony-gotuyutsya-do-roboty-vzhe-z-novym-byudzhetom/	2025-01-09T09:48:34-08:00
Ukraine will receive 30,000 drones from the Drone Coalition	About this reported on January 9 the Ministry of Defense of Great Britain. It comes after an extra £190m was announced for the UK-led International Fund for Ukraine following fresh pledges from allies. Defense Secretary John Healy announced the drone transfer along with Latvian Defense Minister Andris Spruds during a Ukrainian defense contact group held at Ramstein Air Base. The Drone Capability Coalition supports Ukraine with unmanned means of surveillance and attack. Funding for the new 30,000 drones comes from the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands, Latvia and Sweden. These state-of-the-art unmanned aerial vehicles with a first-person view will help Ukraine combat Russian aggression by allowing the Armed Forces to bypass Russian air defense assets to target enemy positions and armored vehicles. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukraine and Great Britain discussed the conclusion of -partnerstva/->bilateral agreement on strengthening partnership.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/ukrayina-otrymaye-30-tysyach-bezpilotnykiv-vid-koalicziyi-droniv/	2025-01-09T09:32:19-08:00
The aggressor uses its research fleet for sabotage against NATO countries — the SZR	About this reported on January 9 the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. We are talking about the Baltic, Barents and North Seas, as well as the world ocean as a whole. The capabilities and threats posed by Russian research vessels are being explored on the University of Texas platform. At first glance, the study of the world ocean is a peaceful field of activity, but in the execution of the Russian Federation it poses many risks for the modern world. Experts from the University of Texas recall the recent incident in the Irish Sea with the research vessel -Amber-, which was intercepted by the Irish Navy while deploying a UAV in the area of ​​vital underwater power and internet cables. Russia has been using hydrographic vessels for reconnaissance and sabotage against the underwater infrastructure of NATO and EU members for decades. They are taken care of by the -research fleet- of the Department of Navigation and Oceanography together with a unit of the Ministry of Defense of Russia called the -Main Directorate of Deep Sea Research-. In particular, the latter has at its disposal the special-purpose nuclear submarines BS-64 -Podmoskovye- and BS-136 -Orenburg-, research vessels -Yantar- and -Almaz-. The Russian Navy also has numerous hydrographic vessels designed for sea, river and lake surveys and pilotage work, catamarans and boats, which are often used with a dual purpose. However, despite all the alleged multifunctionality and technology, most of the vessels of the -scientific fleet of the Russian Federation- were built in the 1970s and 1980s. Soon the Russian Federation will be forced to decommission them without replacing them with new ones. At the same time, anti-Russian sanctions have significantly narrowed Moscow's opportunities to modernize and equip -scientists-. Thus, in the report of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation -On the state of national security of Russia in maritime activities- for 2017, it was emphasized the terrible condition of research vessels, the average wear of which already exceeded 80%, the average age was 34 years, and the technical condition of the majority of vessels was assessed as unsatisfactory. As reported by ArmyInform, the SSR believes that -z-pozyczyi-syly/->pressure from the USA and a negotiating track -from a position of strength- are predicted in Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/agresor-vykorystovuye-svij-doslidnyczkyj-flot-dlya-dyversij-proty-krayin-nato-szr/	2025-01-09T09:21:08-08:00

It was implemented by our team and we hope to multiply its gains, including at the expense of frozen Russian assets in the EU in 2025,- said Hleb Kanevskyi. As ArmiyaInform reported, thanks to the implementation of the -Danish model- of support for the defense industry of Ukraine, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have already received weapons for 538 million euros.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/zakupivlya-zbroyi-dlya-zsu-v-minoborony-hochut-aby-ukrayinskyj-opk-finansuvavsya-za-rahunok-zamorozhenyh-rosijskyh-aktyviv/	2025-01-09T09:17:21-08:00

The Ministry of Defense responded to criticism regarding changes to the charters of procurement agen...	The director of Radio NV told about this in an interview with Radio NV. Gleb Kanevskyi of the Procurement Policy Department of the Ministry of Education and Culture. According to him, in April 2022, changes to the Law on State Property were adopted, according to which the management entity is obliged to monitor and warn of risks to national security during the management of state-owned companies. The -Defense Procurement Agency- and the -State Rear Operator- are just operating in the form of state-owned companies. -The Ministry of Defense has developed a management policy for state-owned companies. Over the past year, the charters of six strategic enterprises have already been changed. They precisely contained the rule that in the event of risks to National Security during martial law, the governing body has the function of monitoring and preventing the threat and taking measures. Including personnel,- said Hleb Kanevskyi. He emphasized that this norm applies only during martial law and only under conditions of threats to national security. -How do we see it in the Ministry? Well, first of all, this is not the provision of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the war with a critical range of goods. But there is one problem. Threats are not clearly defined by law. And perhaps this is what worries the public,- noted Hleb Kanevskyi. Now, according to the Director of the Procurement Policy Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, there is active communication with the heads of the Supervisory Boards of the -Defense Procurement Agency- and the -State Rear Operator- in order to formalize and make more specific what the threats to National Security in the field of providing the Armed Forces may be during martial law. To make it more concrete, and so that it does not cause unnecessary criticism from the proactive anti-corruption public.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/u-minoborony-vidpovily-na-krytyku-shhodo-zmin-statutiv-zakupivelnyh-agenczij-zminy-napraczovuyut-z-naglyadovymy-radamy/	2025-01-09T07:02:42-08:00

These funds are the result of agreements concluded in 2024 with the Danish Ministry of Defense regarding the financing of arms procurement projects from Ukrainian manufacturers. The sources of funding are the governments of Denmark (125 million euros through the Danish national Ukraine Fund), Sweden (20 million euros), Iceland (2.7 million euros) and interest from frozen Russian assets (390 million euros). In 2024, Ukraine started with Denmark a new mechanism for financing the procurement of weapons for the Armed Forces, which was called the -Danish model-. It provides for the financing of Ukrainian defense enterprises by the Danish government. Ukraine forms a list of projects that need financing, and Danish specialists check the recommended companies, evaluate their capacity and experience in fulfilling contracts. -We are grateful to Denmark for its leadership position, steadfast support and effective implementation of the -Danish model- of cooperation with the Ukrainian defense industry. Purchased equipment is already proving its effectiveness on the battlefield, strengthening our ability to confront the enemy and bring victory closer. We hope that the example of Denmark will inspire other countries to take similar initiatives, because it will help to make a joint contribution to the future security of Europe and the world,- said the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov. -I am very proud of the cooperation between Denmark and Ukraine within the framework of the -Danish model-. I am also impressed by the speed that the Ukrainian defense industry can provide. Support already on the front line or on the way is important, and I hope that more countries will consider supporting Ukraine through its defense industry. Denmark will continue to lead,- said Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen. At the first stage of implementation of the -Danish model-, Ukraine received self-propelled artillery installations -Bohdan-. Subsequently, the production of long-range drones, anti-tank and anti-ship missiles was financed. Purchasing from the Ukrainian defense industry has significant advantages: In addition, such purchases support the Ukrainian economy in times of war, allowing to preserve jobs and promote the development of domestic industry. Denmark does not stop supporting Ukraine. 135 million euros have already been reserved for further purchases in the Ukrainian defense industry in 2025. In addition, approximately 43 million euros are planned to be sent from Norway.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/danska-model-pidtrymky-oboronnoyi-promyslovosti-ukrayiny-zsu-otrymaly-ozbroyennya-na-538-mln-yevro/	2025-01-09T02:08:51-08:00

We find them, destroy them. Attacks, if we take these days as extreme, then we observe such a tendency that the enemy tries to use the weather conditions themselves. In this regard, if it is snow, fog, small assault groups of 2-5 people try to advance towards the Defense Forces. We find them and destroy them. Therefore, the situation is completely under control at this time,- the officer emphasized. At the same time, he added that the weather also affects the use of drones, which are mostly not used due to strong winds. -What FPV, what &#8220;Lancets&#8221; much less when there is wind or fog, snow - they become much less.

-Headquarters on wheels-: the trophy Russian -Linza- became a brigade command and headquarters vehic...	-During the fighting in the Sumy region, Ukrainian defenders seized a trophy from the Russians - the newest sanitary armored vehicle -Linza-. April 2022. Defense forces destroyed Russian columns and knocked out the enemy from Kiyanitsa settlement of Sumy region. It is a few kilometers from the border with the Russian Federation. Our soldiers attacked the racist machine with large-caliber machine guns, and the occupiers sharply maneuvered at the turn. Given that the car is not stable at speed and has nuances in handling, it turned over on its side. Then the Russian crew was also captured. For some time, the Lens was used as an evacuation vehicle for our wounded defenders. But she showed herself very badly. The command decided to reformat it into a command and staff vehicle to perform the functionality of -staff on wheels-, control of -battalion-brigade- level troops. Now this trophy vehicle is used for the needs of 117 separate heavy mechanized brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Russian equipment is very heavy - 15.5 tons, has large dimensions: length 7.1, width 2.5 m, and height is 3.5 m. -Linza- is built on the platform of the Russian armored KamAZ -Typhoon-K-. All-wheel drive, automatic transmission, electronics, all possible functions are available to improve off-road driving, anti-mine protection of quite high quality. Accurately withstands hits from large-caliber machine guns and hits even from a grenade launcher. It was checked in practice - machine guns failed to penetrate the car's armor and windshield. As for more powerful weapons, it has not yet been tested in practice. A comfortable driving speed on the highway is about 70 km/h. It is difficult to tell on rough terrain, because the car is not stable, high speeds cannot be in it in principle. Yes, it is -passable-, overcomes obstacles, but it does not have off-road speed. That is, 20, 30, sometimes it can be 40 km/h. This is if the road is straight, normal and level. And it is very difficult for her. After all, it has a lot of weight and a high center of gravity, so it is not maneuverable. -Lens- has a very high suspension above the ground, plus armor and a heavy rear compartment, and all the weight in it is located not closer to the bottom, but in the center - closer to the top. Therefore, it is very dangerous -on bends-. It is necessary to have a very experienced driver who knows how to drive this car with confidence. Of interest, there are also tire inflation, hydraulic brakes, a winch in front of the car, and a crane installed in the back. the Rashists used it to load their wounded into the car. This crane can also be used to assist other vehicles. The car is quite economical, fuel consumption is more than 20 liters per hundred kilometers in more or less calm driving conditions. First of all, a local communication network based on ASL-SAN devices is installed inside for crew communication. Previously, this was not the case, in fact, it was impossible to contact the driver on the move. How the Russians communicated with each other is not clear. Five workstations are equipped: desktop, screen, radios and laptops. Equipped workplace of the brigade commander. Plus, the work is provided by two -starlinks-, one in the automotive version to provide communication directly while driving, and one is completed as a regular -starlink- for already stationary deployment. There is, of course, a generator, its own autonomous power supply. The machine has the option of installing cryptographic protection devices. To provide secure communication during battle management or during unit communication and interaction. It is not always possible to deploy a stationary command post, such as a battalion or brigade, in a timely and operational manner. At this time, the command and staff vehicle assumes the role of this command point, can move, constantly change its location. And with it, a brigade commander or chief of staff can conduct quality management of troops. It can also be a maneuvering vehicle during some assault operations. The commander can be on it relatively close to the front line and competently manage his subordinate units. As much as this car, due to its large dimensions, attracts a lot of attention, you can't get too close to the collision line. Usually, this distance is 20-30 km, it can be even closer. If, of course, there is a need for it. Everything depends on the conditions and circumstances at the front. The work in this machine is built on the principle of a standard command and observation post of a battalion or brigade. There are main screens with a video image, on which any broadcast, for example from a UAV, is displayed for the commander. At his workplace, he sets tasks for subordinate units through communication channels. Next to the commander at the workplaces according to the directions are, for example, air defense, EW, artillery, reconnaissance, UAV control, etc. That is, people from the appropriate departments or services of the brigade also join the crew, work here, manage the battle and provide all the necessary information to the commander. The armed brigade has Roshel Senator armored vehicles, some of them are also used as command and staff vehicles. They were transferred as part of international military-technical assistance from Canada. If these machines are compared with the Russian -Linza-, they are ahead of it in some technical parameters. For example, Canadian combat vehicles are much lighter, weighing around 8 tons depending on equipment and upgrades. -Rochelles- are faster, more maneuverable, lower on the road and, most importantly, less noticeable. They are much better than -Lens- in the context of engine electronics. Because here in the Russians, everything is built on the basis of KAMAZ, plus their engineers tried to develop some -their own- engine control units and on-board computers for it. But it all looks very primitive like most all the built equipment of the Russians. It doesn't work quite as logically as it should. More time is spent to master it. Simply put, the -brain- is technologically not enough. In -Rochelle- this is all much easier to implement, because in fact it is a Ford. And this is the top level. The car is built on a Ford F-550 chassis. Seven-liter diesel engine, automatic transmission. -Canadian- is not as noticeable as this -Lens-. But at the same time, it is smaller, because of that there are fewer jobs. The landing compartment provides for 6 places. Also, the car is less armored, it has a maximum protection against a 7.62 mm machine gun. Mine protection in Rochelle is not of a very high level, unlike the Rashist machine. Due to the fact that the -Lens- has a V-shaped bottom of the case and is raised above the ground, it is more resistant to explosions. But the Roshel Senator is equipped with a system of protection against weapons of mass destruction. The car is equipped with a system that can counteract chemical, biological, radiological attacks, generating clean air inside the sealed cabin. This is definitely a big plus.- Oleksandr from Poltava. Before the large-scale invasion, he worked in areas close to the IT industry and communications. Entered the ZSU at the end of 2022. The -military commissars- flatly refused to call up, the state of health did not allow. But the boy was very persistent. At first, he served in the 5th tank brigade, over time he was transferred to the 117th brigade, which was just being formed. Back then it was just a mechanized brigade. The call sign -Turetsky- was given to Oleksandr by the commander of his unit. -It's a bit of a funny story. We lived together with the commander at the same location. Once, before the first combat deployment, I spent the whole night watching some Turkish TV series, it was a melodrama. For some reason, I was tired of action movies about war and I decided to watch something -light-. Commander in the morning: -You will be -Turkish-! That's how it took root,- Oleksandr told Komvzod.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/shtab-na-kolesah-zatrofeyena-rosijska-linza-stala-brygadnoyu-komandno-shtabnoyu-mashynoyu/	2025-01-08T21:07:02-08:00
-One mine destroyed three enemies at once-. The story of -Norman- from the 23rd OMBR	-Managed the position of the detachment, skillfully organized the all-round defense, maintained the stable and morale of the subordinate personnel in the position,- - say about this sergeant of the Armed Forces in the higher command. So let's get to know -Norman- better: about how he got into the army, about his combat path, interesting and funny memories from the war and a lot more - the military man told in a conversation with the correspondent of ArmiyaInform. Before the start of the full-scale war, he worked for 15 years at the insurance company PZU Ukraine in his native Kryvyi Rih. For the last 5-6 years, he was the head of the department. -We were engaged in motor insurance, housing, corporate sector insurance, medical, personal property, as well as long-term life insurance. We cooperated with banks, car dealerships, and large and medium-sized enterprises of our city,- he recalls his civilian experience. Joined the Armed Forces of Ukraine on March 3, 2022. -Then I got a call from the Military Commissariat (I already had a term of service behind me) and was offered to come to issue a summons. He passed the medical board in one day, and two or three days later he was already in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I was sent to the Kryvyi Rih automobile battalion, which transported fuel and ammunition to the front. I was in the security company, which was engaged in the protection of transport,- he recalls. At first, the service was in Kryvyi Rih, then in Kharkiv region, then in Donetsk region. This is how the first two years of the full-scale war passed. In April 2024, he was transferred to the 23rd separate mechanized unit, where he still serves. At the BZVP, he recalls, they taught exactly those things that would be needed in battle. -There were no old -scoop- methods of fighting, such as -cover-run- and so on. There were practical things that would save my life and help me in real battles,- states the serviceman. Once, in the area of ​​the combat mission, -Norman- during the repulse of the attack, thanks to the ability to use the available weapons systems, destroyed 6 military personnel of the aggressor's army, while preserving subordinate personnel. -I don't think it's a feat - we were just doing our job. There were four of us. We occupied two SPshkas that were practically next to each other. I divided the people: so that two experienced fighters were in the front SPshka, and the young fighters were behind us. I consider the key to our success to be the fact that, thanks to our competent position, we were practically invisible to the enemy -birds-, so the enemy, entering our positions, practically did not see us. We also installed three anti-personnel mines of the fragmentation type, with which we managed to destroy three enemies at once with one mine,- recalls -Norman-. And he continues: -Then six grenades, thrown in the direction of the enemy, finished their work. Three other Russians were leaving the landing from 12:00, where we let them as close as possible and destroyed them&#8230; The main thing is to prepare the boys, to give them an understanding of who and what to do, to tell what actions everyone should take if the enemy approaches from one side or another. When people understand what they need to do and what to expect, then they are more confident and calm,- the interlocutor emphasizes. We ask how the military manages to support the morale of the soldiers. -I don't know, it somehow works out that way. The fighters see me, my calm expression, and probably feel less nervous too. Even if I'm nervous or tense, it doesn't show in any way, so the fighters feel a certain confidence in me. I have no other explanation,- says the soldier with a smile. He emphasizes: -You have to remember that thoughts materialize. If you think good and good, so it will be. If you set yourself up for a bad scenario, it will wait for you at the end. I understood this a long time ago, in everyday life - when, for example, you drive into a supermarket parking lot and already draw in your head a parking space for your car - and yes, it appears! Or a car pulls away, and your parking spot is waiting for you. It's the same in the army: I program in advance how my combat exit will be: OK, let's get to the position, we won't have any -birds- above us, or if they fly, they won't see us. But the problem with today's guys who get into the Armed Forces is that they want to get injured as soon as possible and go to the hospital for treatment.- On the same note, we ask -Norman- about the recipe for a successful commander. He modestly replies that he is not a commander, but he has the vision of such a commander. -He should be close to the fighters, breathe their life, understand their problems and what awaits them there. He himself had to go through everything that boys go through. After all, the boys' lives depend on his decisions. And subordinates should remember that their lives also depend on their actions in battle, on how they behave. You need to give your all, do everything that depends on you, as they say, -we will always manage to give up.- He recalls -Norman- and his most vivid memory, which will forever be etched in his memory - when he carried his first wounded. -We came to the dugout into which the mine landed and saw there one alive and one wounded out of four fighters. Others, unfortunately, have already died&#8230; So we saved this soldier with the call sign -Ternopil-. It was the first wounded person that I carried out of the battlefield, so I think it is like the first girl - it will be remembered for the rest of my life.'' There are also happy memories of the war - although few, but the interlocutor admits, sometimes a smile still appears on his face. -I remember Chasiv Yar, we hide from drones in the private sector. Not all locals left, some -Zhduns- lived there until the last. Almost all the houses were damaged and destroyed. Only a few survived. And so we hide from the drones, look out the window, and see a picture: a grandmother runs with a bucket through the water, crosses the road in front of her, and an FPV drone flies behind her. He only made sure that she was a civilian and flew on. But the way the grandmother christened the road,- Norman laughs. And after catching up, he tells another story: -Or we remember two local drunkards who met us before going to war. One with a bandaged head, the other with roses&#8230; Apparently, they were going on a date. Petal mines are scattered underfoot, landing pits are everywhere, and they are on a date&#8230; Sad and funny are next to each other.

Command of time: Britain plans to increase the submarine fleet with the help of unmanned submarines	As the authors of the French naval defense write edition Naval News, a team of British engineers based in Portsmouth, successfully demonstrated a new type of autonomous submarine designed specifically for military use off the southern coast of England, reports ArmyInform. BAE Systems reviews ultra-large autonomous underwater vehicle with wide customization and modification capabilities (XLAUV) Herne (-Эрн-, - Ukrainian) as a flexible platform, adaptable for various operations, including anti-submarine warfare, reconnaissance, surveillance, intelligence and electronic warfare. Commenting on the development, Scott Jamieson, BAE Systems Maritime Managing Director, said: -This will be the first time any British company has tested its advanced autonomous capabilities in this industry and I am very excited to be working with Cellula Robotics.- He further emphasized the goal of creating a system that would be -faster, more functional, more flexible and cheaper for customers-. underwater infrastructure, as well as intelligence. -We are very excited to work with BAE Systems and look forward to a demonstration that will pave the way for the future of enhanced underwater security and intelligence,- he said. a target=-_blank- rel=-nofollow- href=-https://www.baesystems.com/en/product/nautomate->Nautomate, a high quality autonomous military management system naval surface and underwater vehicles. She was successfully tested on a surface vessel earlier this year. The vessel is built within a lightweight aluminum frame that maintains a total weight of 8-10 tons, depending on payload and energy storage configuration. The Ern is 12 m long and its body has an approximately 1.7 m square cross-section. It does not have the single cylindrical hull found in typical submarines, instead the bow and stern sections are sealed, and payload bays fill freely. Therefore, items carried in payload bays must be sealed in their own pressurized containers. Payload bay modules are easy to remove and replace. The entire space of the Herne UAV could theoretically be quickly swapped out for new payloads and power packs in less than an hour. There are forward and aft payload bays, each with a volume of 2.5 thousand liters The power modules are centrally located between the bays, but the layout can be changed to create a single 5K bay. liters for larger items. These could be anti-submarine torpedoes, small UUVs, sensor arrays, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUGVs), or an anchor for anchoring to the seabed. Erne can also winch deploy fine-line towed arrays or deploy flanking sonar for anti-submarine detection/tracking missions. The vessel is designed to have neutral buoyancy and cells filled with foam to provide buoyancy , approximately equivalent to its empty weight. There are also sophisticated passive and active ballast systems to keep the vessel afloat and compensate for weight loss when payloads are deployed from the vessel underwater. In the event of a major malfunction, the Herne can be programmed to fail-safe mode, forcing the drone to ascend to the surface or sink to the bottom. The movement of an unmanned submarine is provided by two electric motors that independently drive two propellers, which provides a measure of redundancy in the unlikely event of engine failure or propeller damage. The maximum speed of the sprint is 8 knots, although it usually develops a speed of about 3 knots. Herne's diving depth reaches 3 thousand. meters, which is much deeper than any SSN or SSK. The vessel, which was originally designed to work on underwater energy infrastructure, is highly maneuverable, equipped with two sets of lateral and vertical thrusters. Power is provided by a set of lithium-ion batteries, which guarantees its operation for approximately 7-10 days . Additional batteries carried in the payload bay will allow for increased sprint speed if needed. Cellula has tested a solution where the batteries are replaced by hydrogen fuel cells, which provides a range of 5,000 km. km and 45 days of work. Due to this coverage of the water area, -Herne- has a real potential to participate in the fight against UAVs in the depths of the ocean. For example, a small Herne fleet permanently stationed in the GIUK Gap could provide a continuous guard with greater persistence and with much more lower costs than manned platforms. A successful anti-submarine weapons mission does not necessarily require sinking a submarine, but rather deterring and disrupting their operations. Such vehicles could reportedly give the military the ability to control large underwater areas without crew restrictions. span> Herne unmanned submarine.

-And the voices, -not in the topic-: propaganda voiced the American talk show in its own way. Anothe...	At first glance, the video looks like a typical fragment of a television broadcast: two presenters in the studio are commenting on something with a smile and sarcastic notes in their voices. For Russian propaganda, this is a -perfect blow- to Ukraine: they say that even our allies are already tired of the war and consider us -expendable-. But behind this -sensation- hides a rather trivial and at the same time dangerous disinformation mechanism&#8230; Wait! Let's take a closer look. The attention of disinformation researchers immediately focused on the inconsistency between the presenters' lip movements and the text behind the frame. The voice sounds -off topic- and this is the first signal to the disclosure. It turns out that this video is a mix of two completely different sources. The first component is a real excerpt of a talk show, but without context, where the presenters comment on a curious case in the United States. The second is a fabricated audio track created using deepfake technologies. Russian -fake masters- put a new soundtrack to give the video a completely different meaning. Russian propaganda uses the weakness of human thinking: we tend to believe what we see with our own eyes. The montage looks so natural that most people don't even think about checking the source. In addition, the video is focused on emotions: indignation, anger, a sense of betrayal. In an emotional state, we are less prone to critical thinking. The fact-checkers' investigation revealed that the American journalists depicted in the video did not even comment on the situation in Ukraine. At most, they publicly expressed support for our country. And the -sensational statement- about the losses of the Armed Forces is just a lying audio track created to incite despair among Ukrainians. This situation reminds us that information warfare is not just part of modern warfare. This is a front where even fake laughter becomes a weapon. And if you come across a -sensational- video, do not rush to share it on social networks. Better take a closer look, think about it, ask yourself: -Who benefits from me believing this?- If we all pay attention, we can protect the truth, no matter how loud and sharp the lies.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/a-golosy-to-ne-v-temu-rospropaganda-ozvuchyla-amerykanske-tok-shou-po-svoyemu-chergovyj-deepfake/	2025-01-08T20:11:48-08:00

-Stopped, unwound- — remote mining helps our soldiers repel enemy assaults	About this on the ArmyTV stream on January 8, the commander of the unmanned systems battalion of the 30th mechanized brigade with the call sign -Prosecutor- told . -They are not guided by resets, but by remote mining. Our forces are on active defense and that is where our attention should be focused. Constantly mine, mine and mine. At the base of our battalion, there are engineering and explosive workshops that can afford to manufacture munitions for remote mining. Because if the enemy is not stopped and he enters the rear zone with a column, then big problems will begin there. And when mines stop him on the way, the enemy suffers losses and abandons planned actions. And then everything goes like clockwork, we destroy them in the fields,- the -Prosecutor- said. According to him, the enemy in the Kramatorsk direction behaves defiantly, constantly carries out assault actions, both in small infantry groups and with the support of armored vehicles. Actively uses buggies and tries to go to the rear with subversive and reconnaissance groups. As reported by ArmyInform, in Kharkiv Oblast there are 30 OMBR units repelled the assault, which was carried out by the forces of the company with the support of equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/zupynyly-rozmotaly-dystanczijne-minuvannya-dopomagaye-nashym-bijczyam-vidbyvaty-vorozhi-shturmy/	2025-01-08T11:42:11-08:00
The unholy trinity - a group that took up to $12,000 for crossing the border will be tried in Kyiv	This was reported on January 8 by the specialized prosecutor's office in the field of defense of the Central region. The specified persons are accused of aiding and abetting the illegal transportation of a person across the state border of Ukraine, receiving an unlawful benefit for influencing the decision-making by a person authorized to perform state functions, evading conscription for military service, abuse of influence (Part 3 of Article 332, Part 3 Art. 28, Part 1 Art. 369-2, Part 5 Art. 27, part 3 of article 15, article 336 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). According to the investigation, an ex-employee of the Metropolitan Military Commissariat involved in the criminal scheme of transporting conscripts across the state border a current official of the RTCC and a doctor of the city hospital. The medical worker provided the men with fake medical documents, and the employee of the RTCC facilitated the passing of the military medical commission. As a result, conscripted men were given the opportunity to go abroad. During the pre-trial investigation, the receipt of such -services- by the suspects was documented by four conscript men, one of whom crossed the state border of Ukraine using the conclusion of the VLK and the -Temporary ID of a Conscript-, with the specified data regarding his exclusion from military registration. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/nesvyata-trijczya-u-kyyevi-sudytymut-grupu-yaka-brala-do-12-tysyach-za-peretyn-kordonu/	2025-01-08T11:37:24-08:00

While working in the barracks, I thought that no one was watching me and put things of the Russians in my pocket. My fault is that I did not follow the command of the Commander-in-Chief and stole an item belonging to another country. This could cause serious consequences for our commanders. I will no longer trade other people's things. I will heroically advance in the front ranks and destroy the enemies,- wrote Hyong Hong Jong. -While the soldiers of the SSO continue to destroy the troops from North Korea in Kurshchyna, our specialists are engaged in the translation of other records from the trophy notebook.

His story told in the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the MOU with reference to Lyudmila Havrylyuk's interview for -We are Ukraine-. -After consulting with our brothers, we decided to stay because there were people staying,- said the man. After the capture of Novaya Kakhovka by the enemy, Serhiy left home and went into hiding. Collected and communicated critical information for the Defense Forces. The Russian invaders were hunting him - they had lists of participants in the Novaya Kakhovka ATO on the second day of the occupation. -On the third of May (2022), I got a call at 6:45 a.m. and they said, 'Surrender.' I answered that I was not in the city, that I was far away: -Look.- Well, that's how we started the game,- the man recalled. For several months, Serhiy continued to monitor the occupiers, the movement of their equipment, and passed on important information. On Independence Day, August 24, 2022, the man was detained by the Russians. He stayed in the torture chambers for 35 days. -For the first day, they scored so much that I was already saying: 'Kill,' because I couldn't take it anymore,- Serhii said. The GUR noted that the occupiers were not able to extract any confessions. After a month and a half, the man was released - he began to look for ways to leave the occupied Nova Kakhovka. I even considered the option of waiting for spring and swimming across the Dnieper. Or make your way to your relatives through the village of Krynky. Meanwhile, in Kyiv, the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of Ukraine Hayde Rizayeva learned about Serhiy Davydyuk from a mutual acquaintance who asked for help. Preparation and planning of the evacuation operation has begun. -It took me a few days to map out a common route. It was necessary to wait for certain rotational moments. It was necessary to determine the psychotype of Serhiy himself, because not every person can psychologically master the passage of enemy roadblocks,- said Heide. They were developing evacuation routes. The man had to issue a Russian passport to leave the occupied territory. On October 8, he went to Rostov-on-Don and was filtered in the city of Taganrog. Then Sergey went to Belarus and then to Ukraine. Earlier ArmyInform told the story of Serhiy with the call sign -Bear-, a soldier of the Sumy OTCC and SP, who served in the 31st separate mechanized brigade in the position of a unit commander - a combat vehicle commander and participated in battles in Donetsk region, from Rivnopil to Kostyantynivka.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/veteran-sergij-35-dniv-probuv-u-kativnyah-rf-vyjshov-zvidty-j-pokynuv-okupovane-misto-zavdyaky-operacziyi-gur/	2025-01-08T03:42:52-08:00

According to them, a unique approach should be used for each specific task. -Regarding the BC we use&#8230; It is cumulative if we are talking about any armor. We have cumulative-fractional ones, high-explosive ones, if we need to fly into the house, dugouts&#8230; High-explosive detrital, simply detrital&#8230; Termites also, if something needs to be set on fire. A rich assortment&#8230; If it is infantry, you can -crush- it with shrapnel the first time. If these are some EW installations, antennas, if they are densely located in landings, then one or two drones will go there. Everything depends on the skills of the pilot,- the fighters say. At the same time, they note that enemy technologies do not stand still either. -We are well staffed, but the antennas are constantly failing, some signals are constantly changing there, or the EMS is not on site. Somewhere you pass better, somewhere you don't&#8230; This is a game of -bunnies-: the enemy uses EW of different frequencies - we use drones of different frequencies. And we start to play,- summarize the Ukrainian defenders. For more information on how Legion fighters hone their skills and what they did before the war, see plots GUR.

The Ministry of Defense has approved new standards of pre-medical training for servicemen	About this notified in MOU. The document includes two main standards: The first standard is designed to be used primarily in basic military training and covers training to provide care for critical bleeding, respiratory failure, chest, head and eye injuries, burns and fractures.

The second standard expands the list of knowledge and skills compared to the first, as it was created for the training of paramedic riflemen and their corresponding officers and sergeants, military specialists. Training units lasting from six hours focus on providing care in an adverse environment, techniques for moving victims to shelter, ensuring the patency of the airways, assessment and support of breathing and circulation, as well as features of care during evacuation. Training according to both standards involves the format of lectures with multimedia support, practical classes in small groups and simulation classes in field conditions with imitation of a combat situation. Certified instructors must use informative-evidential and explanatory-illustrative methods, as well as interactive tools, including computer equipment and educational mobile applications. Assessment of knowledge and skills will be carried out with the help of special sheets combining theoretical questions and practical tasks. Military personnel who demonstrate high potential may be recommended for further professional training in medical and military accounting specialties. -We hear the needs of the front, and one of them is quality training. The skills and knowledge required to successfully provide pre-medical care must be regulated. We formed new standards taking into account the unique combat experience of our medics and soldiers, gained in the fight against Russian aggression, and the standards of partner countries. Thanks to the implementation of this practice by the Ministry of Defense, servicemen will receive more relevant practical knowledge and skills that will help save lives on the battlefield,- said Oksana Sukhorukova, director of the Department of Health Protection of the Ministry of Defense. Implementation of these standards will ensure a high level of military training, which will allow them to effectively provide first aid in combat and other extreme situations, saving the lives and health of their fellow soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/minoborony-zatverdylo-novi-standarty-domedychnoyi-pidgotovky-dlya-vijskovosluzhbovcziv/	2025-01-08T00:44:21-08:00

However, the reality turned out to be completely different - he woke up already under artillery fire. -I managed to run into the dugout when the shelling started. And the guard was less lucky - his leg was immediately torn off, and another was pierced through the calf. There were a lot of explosions, artillery was constantly working.- Without proper training and equipment, the conscripts witnessed the Ukrainian offensive, during which the commanders fled, leaving them to fend for themselves. -Our platoon leader said that we are not the first ones here, everyone is going home.

The occupiers in Luhansk region raised fines: new rules hit the wallets of TOT residents	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. The fines officially increased by one and a half times, but the occupation authorities simultaneously reduced the discount for their payment during the first 30 days from 50% to 25%. As a result, the total amount of fines actually doubled. For example, if earlier a person had to pay 500 rubles in the first month for a violation worth 1,000 rubles, now a similar fine is 1,500 rubles, with the amount in the first 30 days — 1,125 rubles. The new rates include, in particular, a fine of up to 7,500 rubles for speeding or driving into the opposite lane, as well as 45,000 rubles for driving while intoxicated. In addition, in Severodonetsk, due to the lack of mobile communication and the Internet, residents call emergency services using payphones or radio communication. Several payphones installed by the occupation administration are available during the day. At night, during the curfew, townspeople use radio transmitters to communicate with the Russian ambulance or police on the UHF range. These changes cause significant difficulties for the local population, especially in critical situations.

The Armed Forces explained why the occupiers cannot reach Robotyny	The head of the communications department of the 118th of a separate mechanized brigade, Senior Lieutenant Dmytro Pelikh, commenting on the situation in the Orihiv direction. -We do not detect large enemy assault groups, the defense line is stable. We do not give a single meter of Ukrainian land to the enemy, but this does not mean that he does not take any actions against our forces,- he said. According to the military, the occupiers are forming small assault groups that try to storm the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine several times a day in order to find some weak points in their defense in order to carry out some more massive strikes on these points in the future. However, due to the peculiarities of the local landscape, all attempts of the enemy to reach Ukrainian positions will fail. -They are very bad at it. These assault groups of theirs are disposable, quite often they do not even reach their front lines, because our gunners work very well. There is such a terrain here that you can see for almost two dozen kilometers. Even from the moment the occupiers advance to our positions, we have the opportunity to see them and, accordingly, work with all available means. And to walk one and a half to two tens of kilometers towards our positions is quite a difficult task,- Dmytro Pelikh explained. According to him, the same applies to the enemy's attempts to advance with the help of armored vehicles. -In our direction (Russians - ed.) armored vehicles have not been used for a long time. Here is a rather specific place, which is mined very densely. It was replaced by the occupiers themselves back in 22-23 years. Our Defense Forces also carry out demining every day,- added the representative of the Armed Forces. As reported by ArmyInform, on the Pokrovsky direction the enemy continues its pressure, trying to bypass the city.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/u-zsu-poyasnyly-chomu-okupanty-ne-mozhut-dijty-do-robotynogo/	2025-01-07T23:09:10-08:00
A severed nerve, art--badminton-, revenge on the enemy dance and the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi: t...	Awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky III degree. What tasks did you perform during the anti-terrorist operation? But how did he get injured in 2022? This is what the officer told our correspondents. -After the end of the first contract, he resigned and rejoined the Armed Forces after mobilization in 2015. After distribution, he took the position of platoon commander in the 25th Parachute Brigade. At that time, it was the only brigade and the only military formation in Ukraine, which was able to carry out landings not only of personnel, but also of equipment. I did not have time to visit the hot spots because I got to the 25th in September 2015. At first, we performed tasks in Donetsk region. Later, we were sent to the Perekop district, to the administrative border with Crimea. And the main task there was to make throws to the dividing line. In this way, we found out what the enemy had on the other side. And on that side there was a lot then&#8230; If I'm not mistaken, at the factory in Armyansk there was, as a minimum, the enemy battery -Gradiv- and the D-30 division. And it was all reinforced by tanks, helicopters and their airborne units. &#8230;When you are a platoon leader, in my opinion, you should treat people the way you want to be treated. This, first of all. And secondly, you can't ask your staff to do something that you can't do yourself. Well, for example, during a large-scale invasion, when it was necessary to make wire lines of communication, to throw them directly along the front edge, then I, as the commander of the battalion communication group, brought soldiers from the communication platoon there and showed what should be done. When a commander walks with his staff, it inspires people. This is a first. And secondly, people see that if the commander leaves, he owns the situation: if something was wrong there, he would not leave. In 2016, I resigned and was enrolled in the operational reserve of the first line. In my personal opinion, OR-1 are those people who later in 2022 joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and thanks to whom, among other things, we are talking here now. &#8230;On February 24, 2022, of course, I returned to the army. Most of the people who came to the TCC at the beginning of the large-scale invasion were guys from OR-1, people who passed the ATO. And they had fighting spirit. Like hunting. They were predators. In a good sense of the word. Because the most dangerous predator on the planet is man. And a person who is motivated to kill as many enemies as possible brings more results. Many people then used their own automotive equipment. Most of the people who came came with their own gear. I ordered my plate carrier, for example, as far as I remember, in December or January. Because I thought it would all start in January. Because all the signs were there. And then at the beginning of a large-scale invasion, I found myself in the 95th Airborne Assault Brigade. The intelligence and sabotage group -Bravo- was formed there, and I joined it. She performed one of the tasks in 2022 in the Kyiv region in the area of ​​Kopylyv and Motyzhyn settlements. Thanks to the work of the group, many enemy armored vehicles were burned in that direction. I also want to add that our 3rd Battle Tank inflicted the main damage and liberated such settlements as Korolivka, and then Kopyliv and Motyzhyn, where the Bravo reconnaissance group worked before that. &#8230;In the summer of 2022, I performed tasks in the Kherson direction, already as part of the 46th Airmobile Brigade. I was the head of a communications group in one of the battalions. -At zero- time passes in a completely different way. You've been there for, say, two weeks, but it feels like you've been there for months. Probably because it is constantly on adrenaline. Every day then, about 100 enemy shellings took place on our site. Even on the KSP, you could not sleep properly, because this artillery -badminton- was constantly happening over you. Because we were also responsible. Initially, I had a concussion in that direction&#8230; I was leaving the room and about ten meters from me I saw the first break of the enemy NURS, and the whole package lay diagonally from me. Later, at the KSP of the battalion - and he was almost in combat formations - I received a greeting in the form of a fragment of a high-explosive shell from an enemy tank. His crew, by the way, acted very competently. Before that, I tried to destroy it with the help of our artillery for about a week and a half. But on that day, an enemy tank hit a tree with a shell near the KSP, where we were. The deputy combatant and I flew the most. It immediately felt as if the legs were dipped in boiling water and left there. The bulk of the debris passed through the notebook in the side pocket and entered the leg. It's like a shot from a shotgun at close range. And two fragments passed below the knee, cut the nerve responsible for sensitivity&#8230; But the most important thing is that we destroyed that dance after all.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/pererizanyj-nerv-art-badminton-pomsta-vorozhomu-tanchyku-ta-orden-bogdana-hmelnyczkogo-istoriya-kapitana-tkachuka/	2025-01-07T23:07:08-08:00

After a long drone attack on one of the advanced Russian positions and under the cover of fire from their comrades, two soldiers of the 79th brigade came forward for an assault. Having come close to the enemy dugout, paratroopers with the callsigns -Genie- and -Dummy- threw several grenades at its entrance. The occupants realized that they would not be able to get out of the hole alive and decided to surrender. They immediately put down their weapons and left the dugout. 14 representatives of the -second army of the world-. -Jin- and -Dummy- handed over the prisoners, and then returned to the cleared positions of the Russians. There, our soldiers found many more enemy weapons - 13 assault rifles, a machine gun, about 500 loaded magazines, grenade launchers and cartridges. The paratroopers set up a position and held the defense for another five days, repelling enemy assaults. -They approached us at a distance of 20 meters, we -two hundred- them. They gassed us, we had to wear gas masks a couple of times,- says the 48-year-old -Mannequin-, who has been at the front for about a month and a half. -The sector was constantly fired upon, there were drops from drones. We are not backing down, we are on the defensive,- adds 38-year-old -Jin- from Cherkasy.

It became known how many Ukrainians voted for members of the Public Anti-Corruption Council	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informs about this. Despite the DDoS attack, the technical team protected the voting process. Attempts to influence the course of the competition were stopped. It was because of such attacks on the Ukrainian IT infrastructure that voting was available only to users of Ukrainian networks. Some users noticed a significant number of votes from the same IP address. This is explained by the fact that the Ministry of Defense uses Cloudflare services to protect against cyber threats. Similar technologies can also be used on users' devices with enabled software tools that anonymize traffic (for example, Private Relay on macOS or iOS). As a result, the IP address 127.0.0.1 was registered in the voting logs for a number of users who voted. The identity of each user was verified through authorization through partner services BankID and Diya.Signature, and a specially appointed rapid response team monitored the transparency of the process. Special attention was paid to ensuring the possibility of voting for military personnel at the front. Thanks to access to the site through Starlink terminals and technical support, defenders were also able to participate in the elections of the anti-corruption council. The results of the online voting have been submitted to the Competition Commission for verification and will be officially released within 5 working days. As reported ArmyInform, last week 717 citizens applied to the recruiting centers of the Ukrainian army with questions about entering the military service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/stalo-vidomo-skilky-ukrayincziv-progolosuvaly-za-chleniv-gromadskoyi-antykorupczijnoyi-rady/	2025-01-07T21:06:10-08:00

How to shoot down an X-101 missile: a master class from anti-aircraft gunman Andrii Panchokha	How it is to shoot down air targets from an anti-aircraft gun and from a MANPADS system, the defender of the sky told the correspondent of ArmiyaInform: -The portable anti-aircraft missile system -Igla- is a simple weapon, nothing complicated, as far as I'm concerned. You just need to -capture- the target. And given the characteristics of the weapon, understand whether you will get it. Of course, you are given a command, a colleague with an aerial situation tablet in his hands tells you from which direction the target is coming, what is the azimuth, course, range&#8230; And you are already scrolling through your head, taking everything into account. So I worked on November 17 this year. A lot of rockets were flying by the enemy at that time. The rocket enters behind. I can see her clearly. The platoon commander shouts to me: -Shoot!-. Two seconds - and my anti-aircraft missile enters the target. I'm waiting I see that I hit it. Russian cruise missile shot down and falling. And then there was the effective combat work of December 13. Our mobile fire group moved into position. We have already been informed that enemy missiles are flying in our direction. Proved course and direction information. It was seven o'clock in the morning. I see that the enemy missile is coming, and I instantly make a -stab-, that is, I activate the power battery on the MANPADS. They just gave the command that it is possible to fire from MANPADS. The target enters. I launch, knock down and she falls. It all took one minute. After searching for the wreckage and analyzing the combat work, it was established that in both of these cases, the mobile fire group shot down the Kh-101 missiles. &#8230;In order to become a MANPADS anti-aircraft gunner, I learned to use the complex on a simulator. In my opinion, it is more difficult to hit a target on a simulator than in real air combat. In total, four missiles were shot down in my combat account. We destroyed the first two with anti-aircraft guns and small arms. I joined the Air Force in 2014. Then it was time to go to the army. They left together with a friend. He came to serve in the same unit where he once served his military service, in the anti-aircraft missile regiment. Participated in the defense of Donetsk Airport as part of the -Wild Duck- unit. It was a combined unit of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which defended the position of -Zenith-. Later, I was promoted to junior sergeant. He was the commander of the ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft installation department, the head of the radar station. Over time, he became the chief sergeant of the platoon. I'm on vacation now. When I hear about the launch of enemy missiles, I want to go on duty as soon as possible and hit some target again.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/yak-zbyty-raketu-h-101-majster-klas-vid-zenitnyka-andriya-panchohy/	2025-01-07T20:50:04-08:00
Heavenly punishment and a hot hunt for the invaders: -Fury- helps destroy the enemy at the front	Correspondents of ArmiyaInform visited the positions of the crew of the unmanned aerial reconnaissance and fire adjustment complex of the -Fury- artillery of the 148th separate artillery brigade of the Zhytomyr DSHV of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. By the way, the complex of Ukrainian production, which has deservedly earned the reputation of one of the most reliable and effective at the front. The positions of the boys are hidden in a Ukrainian village in the Donetsk region that was destroyed by the occupiers. The -place- is carefully disguised. Inside, there is a small room, a couch, a work table, and places to store UAVs. Let's get to know the crew: they are senior cameraman Oleksandr, pilot Mykhailo and signalman Bohdan. The guys talked about the combat capabilities of the drone, why reconnaissance of the front edge and the depth of the enemy's battle formations is important, at what distance the -Fury- can adjust the fire of our artillery on the targets of the anti-aircraft guns, and whether it really works in the mode of operation of enemy EW. The complex consists of three UAVs, three day payload modules and two night payload modules, a ground control and information processing station, an antenna and additional equipment. Oleksandr, the senior operator of the -Furia- complex, says that there is no way at the front without this UAV. Its main purpose is to conduct reconnaissance and identify the locations of the enemy: artillery installations, heavy armored vehicles, warehouses with ammunition, places of concentration of enemy infantry, etc. Plus the task of providing guidance on hitting targets and adjusting the fire of our artillery units. -Now, any movement on the front line, the approaches to it, as well as in the depth of the enemy's battle formations is almost impossible to hide. Usually, in our area of ​​responsibility, the occupiers use infantry to support tanks and artillery systems. How they mostly operate: to some point in the area, the enemy's armored vehicles deliver new -cannon fodder-, this is far from the line of contact, because they are afraid to go further. We find these places, and then our gunners destroy them. And this is just one of the typical examples of our daily work,- Oleksandr says. The paratrooper is 38 years old. He has been in the Armed Forces for almost a year and a half, mobilized, originally from the Dnipropetrovsk region. In civilian life, he was a simple electrician. -I studied like everyone else -from wheels-. The main thing is a desire to learn and constant training. I worked first on -maviks-, then switched to -wings-. Everywhere has its own peculiarities. Each technique is good in its own way. The pilot controls the UAV, the operator follows the flight, left-right, forward, control the movement. When the weather was normal, 9 flights were made. It all depends on the combat task and the circumstances,- Oleksandr shares. -Here on this section of the front, the flight range is up to 30 km. UAVs, of course, can fly even further. The flight time for this distance is up to one and a half hours. This is to fly to the destination, explore, adjust as needed and return successfully,- says pilot Mykhailo. He is 31 years old, from Ivano-Frankivsk region. Before the Great War, he worked abroad, then in Ukraine. In 2023, he enlisted in the army. He served for a short time in the 95th brigade, just when the formation of the 148th Artillery Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces began. -They said you will fly on wings, control a Furia-type UAV. Although I didn't even know what it was at that time. I said that I don't know how to drive trucks, I was then laughed at and told that it was a drone, not a car. Originally worked on the Estonian reconnaissance drone EOS. A month of training and on combat sorties. Later, he switched to -Furia-, Mykhailo recalls, smiling. Regarding other characteristics. The average speed of -Fury- is 70-80 kilometers per hour. It can fly at 120 km/h. The standard operating height is up to 1.5 km, although the -bird- can climb up to 2,500 meters. The guys say that speed is the main thing in their work, so the time to deploy the -wing- from the transport position is 5 minutes. -Furia- is able to work in semi-automatic and autonomous mode, as well as in -controlled camera- mode. It has protected digital control and data transmission channels, accurately determines the coordinates of enemy targets. Can automatically calculate corrections to adjust artillery fire on detected targets. Regarding installation of payload. These are day and night cameras for conducting reconnaissance. -Fury- works effectively under any weather conditions. Strong wind, rain, snow, frost do not harm her. We ask: is it resistant to the influence of the enemy's electronic warfare equipment. -We will not reveal our actions to the enemy. But I will say that we use some -tricks- in our work and we manage to -bypass- the means of the Electronic Security System of the Russian Federation. We carry out the combat mission in full,- Oleksandr explains. Everything is important here. You have to feel the technique. But the main thing is to navigate in the locality. For example, the pilot must constantly look at the indicators so that the board behaves -correctly-, that is, it acts correctly in the air. Day and night flights are very different. Sometimes a pilot perfectly navigates the area during the day, knows what and how, and at night the situation is completely different. It is necessary to visually remember landmarks and train. Of course, there is a program that significantly helps in piloting. It is very difficult to work when enemy EW suppresses the operation of the UAV. -Might sorties are always difficult, and even more so when suppressing the backup channel, or the video channel, or the -bird- itself. When you lose control of the video signal and so on. And you do not know any indicators, at what height the UAV is, where it is, where it was taken and, in principle, what is happening to it. This is a golden experience,- says Oleksandr. The value of using Fury at the front is obvious. The number of daily destroyed military targets of the Russian Federation in the Kurakhiv direction is a clear confirmation of this. Enemy artillery systems within the limits of counter-battery combat, armored vehicles, BMPs, tanks and even enemy air defense equipment are affected. -We work in close cooperation with all artillery units of the brigade, and sometimes we even adjust the fire of other units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which are equipped with HIMARS artillery systems. Once, during combat duty, an anti-aircraft missile complex of the Rashtites was discovered. The enemy target was located in the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region, more than 20 kilometers from the front line. The crew quickly recorded the coordinates of its location and handed it over to the gunners. The HIMARS calculation instantly reacted and destroyed the enemy's air defense system. In the same way, we help to -disassemble- the places where the Russians are concentrated, guns, self-propelled guns, tanks, and refueling stations. In a word, we are tracking the occupiers everywhere on our land. Once, during one sortie, -Fury- detected three -fat- racist targets: a camouflaged tank, a howitzer, and a -bekha-. This is a job we enjoy. Usually, the enemy hides equipment in forest plantations, in an urbanized area, in destroyed settlements. Masking the equipment doesn't help him much,- emphasize the guys from the crew of the -Fury- complex. But they add: they don't stay in one position for a long time, because you need to change your location often. The enemy also hunts them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/kara-nebesna-ta-garyache-polyuvannya-na-okupantiv-furiya-dopomagaye-nyshhyty-protyvnyka-na-fronti/	2025-01-07T20:32:39-08:00
Three-gun monster: A European consortium is working on a new version of the continental main battle ...	According to the experts of portal Popular Mechanics, after decades of stagnation, the world of main battle tanks is heating up again thanks to the war in Ukraine, ArmyInform notes. Among several new armored vehicles presented at the Eurosatory defense exhibition in Paris was the Enhanced Main Battle Tank, Ascalon Demonstrator Turret 140 or EMBT ADT 140. The EMBT is not only equipped with a 140mm main gun – the largest of any tank – but also mounted it has 20 mm and 30 mm automatic guns. The variety of guns reflects the range of threats that modern tanks face on the battlefield: from drones to fire duels with other tanks. During the presentation in the French capital, the EMBT ADT 140 was painted in contrasting gray-olive and black colors, emphasizing its difference from previous tanks. With its sharp angles and huge gun, it stood in stark contrast to other, more familiar tanks, including the American M1A2 Abrams and even the German Leopard 2A8 on display nearby. In turn, analysts of the Dutch defense site Army Recognition believe that it was developed by a joint venture KNDS, which combines the expertise of Nexter Systems from France and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) from Germany, EMBT aims to meet the current and future needs of European armored forces. This innovative platform embodies the continent's ambition to create a technologically advanced, autonomous defense capability. Launched in 2018, the EMBT project uses the strengths of two iconic battle tanks: the Leopard 2 and the Leclerc. By integrating the reliable and mobile Leopard 2 chassis with the Leclerc automated turret, the EMBT achieves a balance of mobility, firepower and adaptability. This hybrid design aims to redefine the standard for main battle tanks on the world stage, ensuring that they remain effective in the face of new threats. The EMBT design accommodates a crew of four, optimizing operation with two crew members in the turret (commander and gunner) and two in the hull (mechanic driver and combat operator). The tank's modular architecture ensures that it remains adaptable to future technological advances, a critical factor in the rapidly changing field of armored vehicles. The presentation of the EMBT-ADT 140 variant at Eurosatory 2024 was an important milestone. This upgraded version features the ASCALON 140mm cannon, a next-generation weapon designed to exceed current standards in range and destructive power. The developers claim that, thanks to the innovative automatic loader, the tank will be able to fire the first three rounds in 10 seconds, that is, with a record short break of 3 seconds. That being said, it is likely to be a new approach to the system using containers or rather -cassettes- for three shots, which will be fed from the ammunition stack in the aft part of the turret. The first of the secondary guns is a twin 20 mm gun mounted next to the main gun on the turret. Another, perhaps the most interesting, is the optional remote-controlled 30mm autocannon on the turret of the EMBT ADT 140. It also has a much smaller 7.62 machine gun mounted on a mini-turret that sits on the main turret. On the example of the machine, it is worth noting the growing tendency to strengthen the -anti-personnel- potential with an increase in the caliber of paired weapons, which on this machine was implemented in the form of a 20x102 mm automatic cannon with an ammunition of 300 rounds. According to release by KNDS, the tank features sensor fusion, artificial intelligence (AI), cybernetic and hybrid energy applications. However, it should be noted that what exactly it is about has not been made public. Designed with future interoperability in mind, this weapon meets the requirements of the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS), a long-term European defense initiative scheduled for deployment around 2035. To counter modern threats on the battlefield, the EMBT must incorporate modern defense technologies. They include active and passive armor, complemented by the Trophy Active Protection System (APS), which intercepts incoming projectiles before they hit. Additional features such as the E-LAWS laser warning system and GALIX smoke grenade launchers increase survivability by cloaking the tank in response to imminent threats. Multipurpose sensors provide 360-degree situational awareness, which is critical to countering challenges such as kamikaze drones and precision-guided munitions. The high-performance 1,500 horsepower EMBT engine provides an impressive range of 460 kilometers. Its adaptability to different environments, from open plains to urban environments, positions it as a versatile solution for modern warfare. Despite its technological promise, the EMBT program faces significant challenges. High development and production costs combined with system complexity may limit widespread adoption, especially among countries with limited defense budgets. The need for intensive crew training further complicates its deployment. Political and industrial differences between France and Germany also proved to be potential obstacles. Differing views on arms export policy, industrial sovereignty and the program's timeline could delay progress or require compromises that could affect the tank's ultimate capabilities. Recent trials of EMBT have demonstrated its operational relevance. The tests confirmed exceptional mobility in different terrains and proved the accuracy and power of the 140 mm ASCALON gun. The integration of advanced protection systems and sensors has proven effective against today's threats, enhancing EMBT's potential as an interim solution until the MGCS enters service. As told by /a> ArmyInform, in April 2024, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius and his French counterpart Sebastien Lecornu distributed national responsibilities for specific technologies within the framework of the MGCS. A total of eight components were identified: a platform with a chassis and automated navigation — under the leadership of the Federal Republic of Germany; In addition to France and Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Poland are interested in the project to varying degrees. Apart from its technical achievements, the EMBT is a cornerstone of European defense cooperation. In an uncertain geopolitical climate, the project underscores the strategic value of pooling resources and expertise to meet shared security needs. Bringing Nexter and KMW together, the initiative is an example of how collaboration can overcome national differences to achieve tangible results. The EMBT program is more than a next-generation battle tank; it is a testament to the potential of joint defense efforts in Europe. Its innovation and modular design make it ideal for today's operational needs, laying the foundation for future advancements. However, the success of the program will depend on overcoming financial and political obstacles to ensure its smooth progress. As Europe seeks to strengthen its strategic autonomy, the EMBT could become a defining element in the modernization of the continent's armed forces. Its development demonstrates the power of multinational defense cooperation, setting a precedent for future initiatives aimed at ensuring Europe's collective security in a rapidly changing global environment.

Bloody Pokrovsk in the style of Hollywood: Russian screenwriters write fake action movies	Such an accusation seems so absurd that it is difficult to take it seriously. But let's figure out why exactly this fake appeared, how it is spread and what goal the Kremlin masters of disinformation are trying to achieve. We are all already well acquainted with the tactics of Russian propaganda, when events are twisted so much that they become unrecognizable. One of their favorite tricks is to accuse Ukraine of allegedly carrying out terrorist attacks or mass crimes under the guise of Russian actions. This time they chose Pokrovsk, a city that is at risk due to constant Russian shelling. The propagandists decided to declare that the Armed Forces -plan to kill the civilian population- so that later -blame it on Russia-. However, they did not explain why Ukraine, which is constantly fighting for the trust of the international community, suddenly needed such self-discrediting. - was spread through Telegram channels controlled by the Kremlin. According to the standard set of manipulative techniques they use, this time the key ones are: - Links to -anonymous sources -. As usual, the propagandists do not provide any real evidence. All allegations are based on -reports- from unknown persons. - Engagement -experts-. So-called military analysts join the propaganda, convincing viewers that -the Armed Forces are capable of everything-.. span> - Using video without context. Fake news often publishes photos or videos that have nothing to do with Pokrovsk or the Armed Forces, but are accompanied by manipulative captions. - Link to emotions. Propagandists tell gruesome thriller-style details to sow panic and fear. Pokrovsk is close to the front line, and its residents face the consequences of Russian aggression every day. The choice of this city to create a fake is not accidental: Russian propaganda is trying to undermine the trust of local residents in the Ukrainian military, which protects them from the invaders. Such statements are also part of a wider disinformation campaign aimed at creating the impression that -Ukraine is a threat to its own citizens-. The main purpose of spreading this a fake is to divert attention from one's own crimes. After all, while Kremlin propagandists paint scenarios of fictitious -crimes of the Armed Forces-, Russian troops continue to shell civilian infrastructure, kill civilians and destroy Ukrainian cities. In addition, Russia is trying to undermine the credibility of Ukraine in the international arena, showing it as a state that -poses a threat- to its own citizens.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/kryvavyj-pokrovsk-u-styli-gollivudu-rosijski-sczenarysty-pyshut-fejkovi-bojovyky/	2025-01-07T20:06:53-08:00

-Five kilometers... This is a marathon of courage and brotherhood- — the story of -Bear-, who carrie...	His story was told in the operational command -North-. -I remember hearing the whistling of a mortar shell, then an explosion. Opening my eyes, I saw blood dripping from my shoulder onto my body armor, and every movement caused excruciating pain, and my comrade was wounded in the legs. I put tourniquets on him and put him on my shoulders,- said the fighter. According to him, every step seemed infinitely difficult - the bulletproof vest was pressing, his hand was shaking from pain. -Five kilometers&#8230; In combat conditions, this is more than distance. This is a marathon of courage, faith and brotherhood. Time passed, each new meter seemed like the last. We fell to the ground near the evacuation point - exhausted but alive,- the man recalled. For his courage and successful performance of tasks during the battle, Serhiy was awarded an honorary badge from the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the medal -Indomitable Heroes of the Russian-Ukrainian War-. As reported by ArmyInform, a Ukrainian F-16 fighter pilot during a massive attack by Russian troops in December 2024destroyed six enemy cruise missiles in one sortie. This is the first time in the history of the use of the American Fighting Falcon fighter.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/pyat-kilometriv-cze-marafon-muzhnosti-j-braterstva-istoriya-vedmidya-yakyj-na-plechi-nis-pobratyma-do-punktu-evakuacziyi/	2025-01-07T11:58:26-08:00
- We were stormed by both pros and homeless people or convicts - fighter Roman told about Robotyn's ...	His story was told at the General Staff of the Armed Forces. In the first days of the full-scale Russian invasion, he voluntarily joined the TCC, however, due to lack of military service, he was not accepted into the Armed Forces. In April 2023, Roman again volunteered and became a soldier of the 128th OGSHBr. -I got to the front line just before the counteroffensive in the summer of the 23rd, took part in the assaults, was the commander of a unit. It was hard fighting, but our company took a strip 1,200 meters wide and entrenched itself in the captured positions. the Russians have repeatedly tried to recover what was lost,- he said. According to him, he and his comrades held two points, one of which was a former Russian dugout. -And the enemy tank began to methodically -disassemble- them - in the morning, at noon and in the evening. Lupane from one position and hides, then from another position and hides again. They knew the location well,- Roman noted. During one of these attacks, a projectile hit an anti-tank mine in front of the bridge. -I was lying down and there was an explosion with a bright column of flame. Two comrades were sealed against the trench wall by the blast wave. One of them, coming to himself, shouted: -Elephant, where are you?- And then he saw my torn pants and said: -That's it, there is no Elephant-. I hear this and answer - here I am, everything is fine. I only got a concussion,- he recalled. Roman said that at night they were changed in their positions. -When we were leaving, my friend noticed two shrapnel holes in my hood. I always put a hood over my helmet, it's made of a strong, slippery fabric and it saved me - the shrapnel ricocheted instead of penetrating the helmet. I was very lucky then. And there were many such situations,- he assures. Roman has the most difficult combat memories from defending Robotyny. At that time, Ukrainian infantrymen withstood constant Russian assaults with the support of armored vehicles. -We were stormed by both pros and some homeless people or convicts without body armor and automatic weapons, with only grenades. We took many prisoners then. There were a lot of enemy corpses from past battles lying there - only bones and Russian jackets remained, no one took them away,' Roman remarked. Recently, classes with newly arrived fighters have been added to his duties. Before being sent to combat positions, everyone undergoes special training in conditions close to combat. -I immediately see how ready a person is. Sometimes, a beginner starts to get lost, he may, for example, not take the machine gun by the fuse and turn the barrel at his comrades. You have to work with them additionally. A significant part of the recruits understands where they got to, they will be useful. Although training is one thing, combat missions are another,- he remarked. Before each exit, Roman asks his group if everyone is ready. -Sometimes a fighter says he's ready, but I see he's not. Then I say wait, you will go next time. -I don't need problems at zero,- said the man. Carrying out difficult and dangerous combat missions made Roman a cold-blooded and sensible person. He treats young, healthy men who are resting and having fun in the rear without emotion. -If he doesn't want to fight, then there won't be much of him here. I personally will not take such a person to the position, because he cannot be relied on in a critical situation. I will tell you about such a case. One of our fighters successfully passed the training, but when he first got into combat positions, he couldn't do it - it didn't work for him. For some time he performed various tasks in the rear, was in another platoon, then he got to me. We talked periodically on different topics, and then I asked - are you ready to fight or not? -Ready,- he says. And he was able, he succeeded, he even became the commander of the department&#8230; Each of us has a fear, I was also afraid,- Roman emphasized. He has a comrade with the callsign -Bumper-, who was injured during a combat trip, after which he cannot fight. -Very good attack aircraft. He returned to us and is engaged in security, for which he is respected. But he will not go on combat tours due to his health. This is how one good person falls out, the other&#8230; New ones come in their place, and everyone has to find their own approach, start all over again. This is war&#8230;-, Roman summed up. As reported by ArmyInform, a Ukrainian F-16 fighter pilot during a massive attack by Russian troops in December 2024destroyed six enemy cruise missiles in one sortie. This is the first time in the history of the use of the American Fighting Falcon fighter.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/nas-shturmuvaly-yak-profi-tak-i-yakis-bomzhi-chy-zeky-boyecz-roman-rozpoviv-pro-oboronu-robotynogo/	2025-01-07T11:21:33-08:00

Oleksandr Danylenko also noted that during the last enemy attack, in which the enemy used ten units of equipment, five units were destroyed, and another five were hit. -After that, the occupiers decided to try again and advance under the cover of fog, but we detected them and destroyed 4 more vehicles, including a tank and three BMPs,- he added. As reported by ArmyInform, during the past day at the front 218 combat clashes were recorded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/tanky-tanut-u-tumani-syly-oborony-rozpovily-pro-vtraty-voroga-na-kupyanshhyni/	2025-01-07T03:32:14-08:00
- Creeping tactics of the invaders: why the Russians emphasize the use of infantry	told about this on the telethon -Edyny Novyny- > Orest Drymalovskyi, representative of the press service of the 79th Tavrian Assault Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to him, compared to the end of November and the beginning of December last year, when the Russians used armored vehicles more actively, now their assault actions are mostly limited to infantry. -The occupiers use creeping tactics.- They are trying to advance in small groups of up to 7 people in order to infiltrate our forward positions unnoticed. These groups try to bypass minefields, but it is extremely rare to break through our defenses. To get to the front edge, they have to have several lives at once,- explained Orest Drymalovskyi. At the same time, the Russian group in the Kurakhiv direction is one of the largest and has a lot of manpower to continue attacks. In particular, units are constantly replenished with mobilized personnel to maintain a high offensive intensity. -Now, one of the largest groups on the entire front line is located in the Kurakhiv direction. Russian units consist mainly of conscripts who undergo two weeks of training and go into battle. Also, the invaders maintain a high rate of rotations in order to constantly attack. However, most of these units quickly lose their combat capability, and they are forced to enter additional reserves,- explained the representative of the press service of the 79th brigade. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Kurakhiv direction of the Forces -kurshhyni/->defenses repelled 26 attacks on the positions of our troops near Slovianka, Srybny, Andriivka, Petropavlivka, Kurakhovo and Dachny.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/povzucha-taktyka-okupantiv-chomu-rosiyany-roblyat-akczent-na-vykorystannya-pihoty/	2025-01-07T03:18:25-08:00

-Breath-taking specifically-: soldiers shared their impressions of the ground combat drone -Rage-	This was reported by StratCom of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This domestically produced reconnaissance-strike robotic complex easily overcomes various landscape obstacles, and can also be equipped with a machine gun to destroy enemy infantry and work on its firing points. In addition, thanks to some improvements, this drone, which the fighters affectionately nicknamed -Butterfly- due to its small size, can be used to evacuate the wounded and deliver ammunition and provisions. -The wonderful appearance and small dimensions of this baby can easily mislead and, at first glance, it seems as if you are in front of a child's toy on the control panel. But when you follow the front-line work of the -miracle machine-, it takes your breath away: we have pride, the enemies have fear,- the Armed Forces emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, earlier the Defense Forces conducted testing about 100 Ukrainian drones, checking their speed and braking characteristics, as well as noise level, passability in difficult terrain and water resistance.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/podyh-perehoplyuye-konkretno-voyiny-podilylysya-vrazhennyamy-vid-nazemnogo-bojovogo-drona-lyut/	2025-01-07T02:41:32-08:00
A lawyer from the capital was detained with 15 phones in his hands: an intelligence group was collec...	informs the Security Service of Ukraine about this. The Russian special service remotely recruited a lawyer from the capital, who led a group of agents. He involved in criminal activities several accomplices from different regions of Ukraine. Criminals carried out covert surveillance of their objects using optical devices. For observation, the resident agent group set up observation points on the roofs of buildings located next to the offices of international officials and volunteers. The obtained data were summarized and transferred to the curator from the FSB of the Russian Federation. The investigation established that the agents also adjusted missile strikes on objects of the defense industry and energy infrastructure of Ukraine. During the searches, 15 mobile phones, which were used to communicate with Russian curators, as well as optical devices and flash drives with evidence of their criminal activities were seized from the detainees. The perpetrators were informed of the suspicion of treason committed by a group of persons under martial law (Part 2 of Article 28, Part 2 of Article 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). Currently, all members of the agent network are in custody. Detainees face life imprisonment with confiscation of property. Investigations are ongoing to identify and bring to justice all those involved in criminal activity.

The Ukrainian F-16 pilot set a historical record by shooting down six cruise missiles in one sortie	wrote the head of public relations service of the Air Command wrote about this Colonel Yuriy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Ignat. As Yuriy Ignat noted, the massive shelling took place on December 13, 2024. The enemy launched almost 200 drones, as well as dozens of ballistic and cruise missiles. The main target of the Ukrainian fighter was cruise missiles, the interception of which is a difficult task. The Ukrainian pilot used all four air-to-air missiles on board the F-16 to shoot down four cruise missiles. However, seeing another target, the pilot decided to use the aircraft gun. -Shooting down cruise missiles with a cannon is very risky because of the high speed of the target and the danger of detonation. But I acted as the instructors in the US taught me, and I managed to hit. As it turned out, two missiles flying next to each other were destroyed at the same time,- the pilot said. This case became unique: for the first time in history, an F-16 pilot destroyed six cruise missiles in one flight, two of them with the help of an aircraft gun. After the successful completion of the task, the pilot was greeted with applause at the airport. His success caused admiration not only among the Ukrainian military, but also in the United States. Although not the most advanced F-16 modifications were transferred to Ukraine, Ukrainian pilots demonstrate exceptional skills every day, using the available equipment to the maximum. This record is proof of their professionalism and fighting spirit. The Ukrainian Air Force expects even more modern weapons, in particular the F-35, which together with experienced pilots will become a powerful force in deterring aggression in Europe.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/ukrayinskyj-pilot-f-16-vstanovyv-istorychnyj-rekord-zbyvshy-shist-krylatyh-raket-za-odyn-vylit/	2025-01-07T01:48:35-08:00

Effective procurement: fuel and lubricants for the Armed Forces have become cheaper than the average...	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. -The procedures that DOT specialists began to apply in 2024 made it possible to make the procurement process more transparent and improve its efficiency. Thanks to this, the DOT purchased PMM at prices lower than the average market, which allowed the Ministry of Defense to save significant funds,- noted the director of the Internal Audit Department, Colonel Oleksandr Tytkovskyi. In particular, it was analyzed that in 2022-2023 DRZ specialists conducted purchases without regulated and substantiated approaches to determining the size of the expected cost of fuel and lubricant materials. This indicator was determined on the basis of the provided price offers of suppliers, with whom contracts were subsequently concluded. Taking into account the absence of competitive procurement procedures, this led to an overestimation of the cost of purchased products. For its part, the DOT Ministry of Defense uses a regulated and justified approach to determining the size of the expected cost of the PMM. In addition, the -State rear operator- ensured the conduct of competitive procedures using the electronic procurement system in 97% of cases. Thanks to this, price overpricing in the purchase of fuel and lubricants has not been established. Moreover, this indicator was lower than the average market prices. And according to the results of the auctions, the actual prices were lower than the announced size of the expected value by an average of 5.4%. -The DOT's implementation of competitive procedures for the purchase of fuel and lubricants from the beginning of 2024 to September ensured budget savings in the amount of over 867 million hryvnias. At the same time, the expenses for the activities of the DOT in this direction were reduced to less than UAH 60 million,- stated Colonel Oleksandr Tytkovskyi. As reported by ArmyInform, DOT purchased dyed diesel fuel for the needs Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/efektyvni-zakupivli-palyvno-mastylni-materialy-dlya-zsu-staly-deshevshymy-za-serednorynkovi/	2025-01-07T01:22:31-08:00
Defense forces destroy the enemy in the Kupyan region: Novomlynsk under the blue-yellow flag	About this on the air -Society.News- Captain Yury Fedorenko, commander of the battalion of unmanned attack aircraft complexes -Achilles- of the 92nd Assault Brigade named after Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirk, said. -Adverse weather conditions are something that the enemy tries to use as much as possible. With any kind of precipitation, fog, strong gusts of wind, the effectiveness of reconnaissance UAVs, both for us and for the enemy, decreases. However, during the three years of full-scale war, the Defense Forces learned to operate in all weathers. In adverse weather conditions, we use other means of detection and observation, so today we managed to inflict fire damage on the enemy's infantry, which was trying to accumulate and carry out shock-assault actions in the direction of Lozova and Zagryzovo,- Yuriy Fedorenko noted. Despite the enemy's activity, the Defense Forces of Ukraine are holding their positions. In particular, the units successfully blocked the attempts of the occupiers to move upstream in the direction of Kolesnikivka. And on the left bank of Kupyansk, near Kupyansk-Vuzlovoy, the enemy did not manage to realize their plans, even despite numerous assaults. -The enemy is trying to take advantage of the weather conditions to use boats to cross to the right bank of the river in the Dvorichny area. However, our units detect the enemy around the clock and inflict fire damage,- Yuriy Fedorenko said. According to him, Ukrainian forces continue to drive out the occupiers from settlements in the Kupyan region. In particular, Russian troops have completely lost control in Novomlynsk, and a blue-yellow flag is already flying over the village. -In general, the situation in the direction remains dynamic, but the enemy does not manage to implement their plans,- concluded Captain Yury Fedorenko. As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy continues to actively operate in the Vovchan direction, but his attempts u-vovchansku/->to break through the defense remain unsuccessful.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/syly-oborony-znyshhuyut-voroga-na-kupyanshhyni-novomlynsk-pid-syno-zhovtym-praporom/	2025-01-07T01:12:23-08:00

How the TCC crushed Russian paratroopers — the story of the Poltava Wolf from the -Odin- squad	One such example is the story of Lieutenant Dmytro Vovka from Poltava, which shared operational command -North- of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He joined the defense of the Motherland from the first days of the full-scale Russian invasion. -On the morning of February 24, they told me to come with my things. I reported at work, went home to park the car and arrived at the TCC. I understood that the unit to which they wanted to send me was no longer relevant. Because in the first days, no one understood where the Russian troops would reach, where they could and could not pass. That's why I was enrolled in the security company of the regional TCC,- the fighter recalls. At that time, a separate combined assault unit -Odin- was formed under the Poltava district TCC and SP, as part of which Dmytro went on his first combat mission in the Bakhmut district. -At the end of June, we were already in position in the trenches, in a landing near the Vuglehirskaya thermal power plant. Then I saw war for the first time. We drive into Bakhmut — I see -mushrooms- of explosions. I think, well, it's a war, no big deal. They were in position for 7 days. There were no battles as such - the enemy shot at us, but from afar. This may have saved us, because it was the first experience for most of us,- the soldier shared. In the future, Dmytro Vovk visited various areas, including Lymanskyi, repelling enemy positions in Serebryansk Forestry. -I received the task to go in with my platoon and change the assault group in the positions where they were entrenched. We stayed there for six days. We were intensively stormed, the unit suffered losses. Unfortunately, it was not possible to collect all the dead. This is my personal pain&#8230; The soldier carrying the property and weapons of the wounded asked for help. We loaded everything into the car, and when we were leaving, for the first time in my life, I saw a KAB fly to the position,- the officer said. In general, the -Odin- detachment was in the Limansk direction for almost two months, and its opponent there turned out to be well-trained Russian paratroopers with a wide arsenal of weapons. -They used aviation, &#8220;Hradi,&#8221;, artillery, mortars against us. They simply went to the assaults, lined up in a chain. Of course, there was an understanding that either we or they. And we already had combat experience, so we managed to repel assaults. I am proud of my boys! Even then, I told them: if the Ivanivsk paratroopers knew that they were being crushed by the TCC, they would be very ashamed,- Dmytro jokes. At the same time, he expressed regret that there are still people in society who do not understand how much responsibility has fallen on the shoulders of the Ukrainian military, in particular, representatives of the TCC. -Sometimes they tell me to go and fight alone.- I answer that I fought while they lived comfortably in the rear. And the answer is -it's a bad fight if you talk.- In these people, I believe, fear speaks. They are afraid to change something in their lives, they cannot dare to act as an adult citizen. There are those who later change their minds, but not all, unfortunately. They also ask -why me?- I say, look: I went alone so that you would have these rights and freedoms. But you also have responsibilities. And no, then Russia will come, establish a totalitarian regime, and no one will even communicate with you,- explained the fighter. As reported by ArmiyaInform, with the beginning of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine, many citizens who had no relation to the army and connected their lives exclusively with civilian professions came to its defense. href=-https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/02/redaktor-perekladach-nyshhyt-vorozhu-tehniku-dobrovolecz-zsu-rozpoviv-pro-polyuvannya-na-rosijski-tanky/->among whom it turned out and an editor-translator with the call sign -Rumin-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/yak-tczk-kroshylo-rosijskyh-desantnykiv-istoriya-poltavskogo-vovka-iz-zagonu-odin/	2025-01-07T00:49:57-08:00

Ruins against tanks: why the occupiers' equipment is powerless in Vovchansk	About it on the air -Social.News- Oleksandr Danylenko, head of the media interaction group of the -Hart- brigade, said. According to him, Russian troops carry out up to five assaults every day. However, none of the attempts to break into the city were successful. -In the direction of Vovchan, up to five assaults take place every day, but all the enemy's attempts to break through to the city are unsuccessful. Units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine effectively detect and destroy the enemy,- Oleksandr Danylenko said. Despite regular unsuccessful assaults, the enemy does not stop attacks and increases the use of various weapons. -The enemy is actively dropping guided aerial bombs (UABs), their number has now slightly increased. Artillery is also active, FPV drones are used,- Oleksandr Danylenko added. Also, according to him, the destruction that Vovchansk suffered due to the actions of Russian troops turned against the occupiers themselves. The destroyed infrastructure does not allow them to hide heavy equipment and infantry groups. -After the detection of enemy equipment, artillery and drones immediately work on it. Therefore, now the enemy's equipment is not very effective - they protect it and keep it on a leash,- Oleksandr Danylenko explained. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Kharkiv direction, our troops napryamkah/->repelled three enemy attacks in the Vovchansk region. The invaders carried out airstrikes with anti-aircraft missiles on the regions of the settlements of Orishanka, Zolochiv and Uda, and air strikes with anti-aircraft missiles on Graniv, Kharkiv region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/ruyiny-proty-tankiv-chomu-tehnika-okupantiv-bezsyla-u-vovchansku/	2025-01-06T23:06:02-08:00
A moment of silence in Ukraine	-In order to honor the bright memory, civic courage and self-sacrifice, strength of spirit, resilience and heroic deed of the soldiers who fell during the execution of combat missions to protect the state sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, civilians who died as a result of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine , decree: to start a national minute of silence every day at 9:00 a.m. for compatriots who died as a result of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, which should be announced in all mass media, regardless of the form of ownership,- the document says.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/v-ukrayini-hvylyna-movchannya-45/	2025-01-06T23:00:03-08:00
DOT purchased dyed diesel fuel for the needs of the Armed Forces	informs about this State rear operator. In order to maintain transparency and competition, DOT insisted on the identification of at least two independent manufacturers of paint additives. This allowed bidders to choose between different partners to provide fuel painting. This approach significantly increased the competitiveness of procedures, promoting a fair fight among participants. Special attention was paid to checking the physical and chemical properties of dyes and studying their effect on fuel. The conducted tests confirmed that dyes do not deteriorate the quality of products. Coloring makes it possible to identify and trace fuel that was purchased exclusively for the needs of the Armed Forces, and reduces the possibility of its illegal sale. The purchase was made with additional proven financing in December 2024. The DOT team quickly prepared and executed procurement through Prozorro. Thus, it ensured the availability of transitional fuel residues at the beginning of 2025. This made it possible to ensure a continuous supply of fuel for the military to carry out missions. The state rear operator demonstrates a successful combination of flexibility in planning, transparency and competitive procurement, which are important factors in the effective supply of the military. As reported by ArmyInform, the procurement agency of the Ministry of Defense -State rear operator- -na-zakupivlyah-mastyl-dlya-zsu/->saved UAH 2.26 million during the purchase of lubricants for the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for 2025.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/dot-zakupyv-farbovane-dyzelne-palne-dlya-potreb-zsu/	2025-01-06T22:51:20-08:00

Five months of the Kursk operation: the enemy lost more than 38,000 soldiers and hundreds of pieces ...	This was notified by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The operation of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation, which began on August 6, 2024, became the next stage of the resistance to Russian aggression and the struggle for the independence of our state. For the first time in 11 years of war, hostilities were transferred to the territory of Russia. The General Staff of the Armed Forces emphasized that the Kursk operation was aimed at preventing the enemy's offensive in the Sumy region and creating a -buffer zone-. The operation forced the Russian occupiers to transfer significant resources to the Kursk region, weakening their positions in other areas of the front. The invaders brought some of the most combat-ready units of the airborne troops, marines and special forces there. Also, Russia was forced to urgently ask for help from North Korea, which sent almost 12 thousand of its soldiers to the Russian Federation. About 4,000 of them have already been liquidated, and some units have lost their combat capability. During 5 months of active hostilities, the occupiers lost more than 38,000 lives, of which about 15,000 were killed. Ukrainian soldiers destroyed: During the operation, Ukrainian forces captured 860 Russian soldiers, significantly replenishing the exchange fund. This made it possible to return home hundreds of Ukrainian defenders who were in Russian prisons. More than 2,000 Ukrainian servicemen were awarded state awards for their heroism and successful actions during the Kursk operation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/pyat-misyacziv-kurskoyi-operacziyi-vorog-vtratyv-ponad-38-tysyach-vijskovyh-i-sotni-odynycz-tehniky/	2025-01-06T21:01:17-08:00
Digital video signal, homing and… cruise control: FPV drones with artificial intelligence will soon ...	A platoon of engineers is required to test and, in the vast majority of cases, refine, rework, and reprogram the resulting FPVs to meet current needs and combat realities. — This is the room where we collect all the batches of drones we receive. We sort them by size, control frequencies, video signal frequencies. This is necessary to understand where what lies for further work specifically with each drone. Here are -sevens- at 5.8 GHz, here -sevens- at 1.2 GHz, here -tens- at 5.8 GHz, etc., says Oleksiy, showing one of the rooms where the engineering platoon works. 5.8 GHz and 1.2 GHz are the video transmission radio frequencies. -Seven- and -ten- is the size of FPV drones, which is measured in inches across the diagonal of the UAV. Seven-inch ones have a diagonal of almost 18 cm, ten-inch ones - a little more than 25 cm. Its carrying capacity and flight range depend on the size of the drone and the power of the engines. A larger drone can lift a heavier and more powerful battery and, accordingly, ammunition, which can weigh up to 4 kg. Almost all drones that the unit receives from various sources - both from the state and from volunteers - need to be improved. Such that the UAV can be launched immediately, just by taking it out of the box, almost does not happen. — There is almost no such thing as making the drone work out of the box. It's like when the manufacturer asks what and how we need to produce right now and we give him a detailed description. Then the drone already arrives ready, it is enough to check it, fly around it and go into battle. But it is not often possible to do this - usually we finish the FPV already here, - says the platoon commander. This does not mean that the drone is completely rebuilt - it is about installing or replacing one or two parts, such as an antenna or a video transmitter, as well as downloading a package of necessary programs. The task of the -engineer- is to give FPV pilots ready to use In another room away from the warehouse, work is boiling - several specialists are soldering, removing and installing parts, choosing antennas, programming and testing the assembled drones. The complete setup of one UAV takes about 30 minutes on average. Military personnel do everything necessary to ensure that pilots on the front lines worked with maximum efficiency and at the same time had a minimum of additional work. Each of the specialists has a strong engineering and IT background, so they pick up any new information on the fly. — We solder everything ahead of time, install everything. The pilot can only work in software. If necessary, if the drone suppresses the enemy's EW, it can directly change signal channels from the remote control, switch and fly to others, - emphasizes the platoon commander, - says Oleksiy. — Here there is an outdated frequency for control, but it is not suitable for us in combat conditions. Therefore, we install others - depending on the specific day when the FPV will go to combat work. We are also installing a program that allows the pilot right in the dugout on the front line to change frequencies - and the drone will fly to the ones that are needed - shows one of the UAVs Oleksii. This is one of the typical situations where it is necessary to change the frequency of the signal, because a batch of drones manufactured earlier is no longer relevant to the existing requirements. Also, sometimes manufacturers who work with small batches of UAVs install parts on them that cannot be used in combat conditions. — But more work needs to be done here, because video transmitters are installed on these drones, which are no longer suitable for combat conditions. Firstly, it is not powerful, and secondly, it is easier for the enemy to intercept the pilot's video with such components. That's why we take them out and put in ones that are suitable for combat work, the specialist explains. Before sending the drones to the front line, specialists must check them in the field - install -props- (propellers) and fly the drones on the training ground. This makes it possible to make sure that UAVs do not have hidden defects or to eliminate them if found. — We conduct drone stress tests — fly far, fly with weight. We check the revolutions of the motors and see where the -props- are spinning. This is very important, because it happens that something goes wrong with the speed controller - you start the drone, and the propellers spin in different directions. Then it does not take off and turn over - and God forbid that this should happen with an already installed BC, - explains Oleksiy. So, after working with drones in the workshop, we then go to the training ground to test the operation of the UAV. Usually, such test and training flights are attended by combat crews of pilots who are taken from the front line for rest. This allows at the same time to teach pilots the basic skills needed to repair or adjust a drone in a dugout environment. - Every engineer is a good pilot, and every pilot is a good engineer. Of course, everyone has to do their job, but pilots should be able to quickly fix some of the simplest problems with the drone. -We have pretty cool guys with good engineering schools, so they pick up all the information quickly,- says the platoon commander. Now there are no pilots with us, so the engineers test the UAV on their own, confidently demonstrating a high level of piloting. The drones rapidly rise into the sky and, after flying several hundred meters in a few minutes, return to the starting point. With and without weight, all FPVs tested today perform almost flawlessly. — In case of fixing problems, we hand over the drones for revision, but this happens rarely, because the guys are already in the workshop preparing them very well. Small defects that sometimes occur are -fixed- already within the framework of the flight, says the engineer. The drone experiences the greatest load during takeoff, especially with significant weight. It is at this time that the battery -sags- as much as possible. Sharp maneuvering also leads to a significant loss of charge. Therefore, to preserve the battery, the pilot should go to cruising altitude and speed and avoid excessive movements of the drone. — When the FPV has already gained momentum, it is much easier to fly and the battery discharges gradually and evenly. The pilot must monitor the charge level, because in the event of a sudden discharge of the battery, the protection may activate, it will turn off and the drone will simply fall, - explains Oleksiy. You should monitor the on-board indicators especially carefully in winter, because the battery charge is lost faster in low temperature conditions. Therefore, until the moment of going to the target, you should save the charge as much as possible, which will be needed for fast and sharp maneuvering. Another important technical detail is when the charge detonation initiation board is turned on. This should be done at the moment when the drone flies past the forward positions of the Defense Forces in order to maximally protect the Ukrainian military in the event of force majeure. In the event that a drone with an activated initiation board accidentally falls into enemy territory, the combat unit will immediately detonate and prevent the enemy from taking possession of the entire ready-to-use Ukrainian UAV and investigating it. — The general rule is that the initiation fee is reduced as soon as we fly our positions. Then, if the drone falls or is shot down, the warhead will definitely detonate, because it is in the -gray zone- and in the territory of the enemy, says the platoon commander. The next extremely significant -feature- is to take off at minimum video signal power. This does not allow the enemy to catch the signal and see the place from which the drones launch the UAV. If the drone takes off at maximum power, it will make the task easier for the enemy and put the servicemen at unnecessary risk. In addition, the safety of the pilots is guaranteed by the so-called -Curtain- - a special program that blocks the video signal during the take-off of the drone. With her help, the military, raising the UAV into the sky, -closes- the video on the screen. When the drone flies to a safe distance, the -curtain- can be removed, because the enemy will no longer be able to see and calculate the place of take-off. — This is a program of a Ukrainian developer, it is used by many units, not only us, — says Oleksiy. Finally, to increase the range of the radio horizon, repeaters are used, which are raised on a mast or installed on an auxiliary drone on the basis of an Autel quadcopter. It can rise to a height of several meters and significantly increase the range of radio signal transmission. — The maximum working height is 150 meters, but it all depends on the altitude map in a specific sector. We usually put the repeater on Autel, because it has a higher load capacity, fly a few hundred meters away from the dugout - and we can already work, says the military man. Such a simple trick greatly expands the radio horizon within which FPV drones can operate. In combat conditions, this greatly helps drones to hit the enemy in their rear at the maximum possible depth from the line of battle. Among the promising innovations that can radically change the capabilities of FPV on the battlefield, Oleksiy mentions the transition to the provision of digital video communication, the spread of automatic guidance of the drone to the target with the help of artificial intelligence, and the so-called cruise control. Digital video communications are virtually impossible to jam and absolutely impossible to intercept. Nothing needs to be changed in it, because it itself -automatically jumps frequencies at an extremely high speed.- An adversary can see that a data packet is being transmitted, but cannot interfere with it in any way or use it for his own benefit. — We have drones where several sets of video frequencies are implemented, which we will not reveal to the enemy, as well as how this is implemented. But when they think they push the video and it works, we have some trump cards that allow us to control the flight further and hit the targets. They think that they are -suppressing- our video, because their suppression works, and we fly further, because we now have a digital camera that is almost impossible to suppress, - explains Oleksiy. Another innovation that is already being used on the battlefield and will soon become more widespread is an automatic homing system based on artificial intelligence. It allows you to hit targets protected by powerful EW devices. - These are boards for the case when the target needs to be destroyed by any means - a drone with artificial intelligence and a homing system. There is a computer here, I won't say which one, a special camera, it can capture a target several hundred meters away and you can already transfer control and then it hits the target on autopilot, says the military man. The only downside to digital video communication and AI homing is the higher final cost of an FPV drone. However, these are relatively small amounts in terms of benefits from combat work. Oleksiy does not reveal all the secrets, but he reports on another innovation - the so-called cruise control, which allows the drone to fly on autopilot in a given square despite being suppressed by enemy EW means. - There will be a new release soon, where a super convenient feature for pilots is added - cruise control. This is when the coordinates are given to the drone and it goes to them in autopilot mode on its own - it flies past all the REBs, any suppression, - says the platoon commander. He predicts the mass distribution of these and a number of other innovations at the front in about 5-6 months - already at the end of spring or at the beginning of summer next year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/czyfrovyj-videosygnal-donavedennya-ta-kruyiz-kontrol-fpv-drony-zi-shtuchnym-intelektom-skoro-na-peredovij/	2025-01-06T20:49:45-08:00
Bridges are not afraid of tanks: Sweden ordered a batch of amphibious bridge crossings M3	As the portal European Security &amp; The defense contract was signed by the Swedish procurement agency Försvarets Materielverk (FMV) with the amphibious systems manufacturer General Dynamics European Land Systems (GDELS) — Bridge Systems, ArmyInform reports. The deal is part of a project to deliver 25 bridges between 2025 and 2027 under a SEK 400 million ($39.2 million) contract. -It's extremely positive that we were able to take advantage of this opportunity,- said Jonas Lötsne, chief of operations at the Swedish Land Forces' Defense Materiel Administration. -This means that the combat units of the Army get a rapidly built communication system, more than for a single brigade. And it will happen much sooner than we thought possible.- The M3 amphibious bridge vehicles are used for a variety of missions, from combat to civilian, including during flooding to guide crossings or evacuation. The M3 system consists of self-propelled amphibious ferries on wheeled chassis with an integrated deployable bridge span. The M3 system has a load capacity of MLC 85 (77.11 tons) for tracked vehicles and MLC 132 (119.75 tons) for wheeled vehicles. In particular, it can support the weight of main battle tanks, including the Challenger 2, Leopard 2 and M1A2 Abrams. The M3 Amphibious Bridge and Ferry System can carry all NATO vehicles and military equipment and is capable of forming a 100m floating bridge in less than 10 minutes. On the march, the equipment works as a 4×4 wheeled vehicle with a maximum road speed of 80 km/h. The M3 self-deploys on a follow path to create a crossing. Before it is launched into the water for the amphibious operation, two large aluminum pontoons detach and deploy along the hull of their transporter. The amphibious system is operated by a crew of two. The crew exits the vehicle cab to maneuver the pontoon using controls located on the top of the transporter body. When moving through the water, the M3 is propelled and controlled by two fully movable pump nozzles at speeds of up to 14 km/h. These transport vessels will be equipped with -Arctic kits-, which will allow them to be operated in cold climatic conditions. Interestingly, the Swedish armed forces tested the M3 system 20 years ago, but due to geopolitical changes (the global war on terrorism) and the shrinking economy, the project was later postponed. FMV experience gained during these tests is now mainly implemented, reports Polish portal Military Magazine. Currently, M3 kits have also been delivered to the armed forces of Germany, Great Britain, Indonesia, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Latvia and Slovakia.

Matzka hysterit: Turkish bairaktars are not friends with propaganda	Turkey, as a manufacturer of advanced unmanned aerial systems such as the Bayraktar TB2, plays an important role in strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities. However, such cooperation causes significant irritation of the Kremlin, which in its traditional manner resorted to information attacks. The latest data indicate that Russian special services have launched a large-scale campaign aimed at discrediting the Ukrainian-Turkish partnership. The main goal is to create tension between Kyiv and Ankara, question Turkey's reliability as an ally and undermine trust in its technology. Now we propose to consider the key narratives of Russian propaganda. Propagandists are spreading fake videos with alleged -evidence- that the Bayraktar TB2 does not live up to expectations on the battlefield. These materials are actively disseminated through the Kremlin-controlled media, as well as on social networks and Telegram channels. In the information space, the perception of Turkey's -double game- is being actively created. They said that Ankara supplies drones to Ukraine, but at the same time trades with Russia in energy resources, which allegedly calls into question its sincerity. the Russian mass media manipulate facts about the financial aspects of cooperation, trying to convince that Ukraine is allegedly unable to fully pay contracts with Turkey, due to which the latter has lost trust in its partner. For the Kremlin, Ukraine is not only an enemy, but also an example of resistance that is not included in the plans of Russian imperial policy. Turkey, as an ally of Ukraine, prevents these plans by helping the Armed Forces to increase its combat capability. In addition, Turkey is developing joint projects with Ukraine in the spheres of space, shipbuilding and the production of new types of weapons, which significantly increases Ukraine's defense capabilities. The success of such a partnership undermines Russia's position in the geopolitical arena. In order to expose Russian information attacks, it is important: Russia is not only waging a war on the battlefield, but also an information war, trying to discredit everything that strengthens the defense of Ukraine. The campaign against military-technical cooperation with Turkey is another attempt to weaken our country. However, this disinformation wave only emphasizes the importance of the Ukrainian-Turkish partnership. Only by joining forces will we be able to overcome this challenge and continue the path to victory.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/maczkva-istyerit-tureczki-bajraktary-ne-druzhat-z-rospropagandoyu/	2025-01-06T20:21:04-08:00
-Christ is baptized- in Donetsk region: paratroopers celebrated the frontline Epiphany	ArmyInform visited the glorious 46th Brigade at the Vodokhreshche front. This year's Epiphany or Jordan - these are the traditional folk names of the holiday - the paratroopers met near the battle line in Donetsk region. Today's celebration of Jordan among paratroopers is organized with observance of not only church rites and folk traditions, but also strict military discipline. Despite the fact that we are quite far from the front, only a few people gather at the same time on the shore of a small reservoir. &nbsp; Fighters come in twos or threes to read a common prayer and chat with the chaplain, dive into a pre-cut hole in the thin ice, and quickly get dressed and warm up in a heated tent. As it should be in Vodokhreshche, it is frosty outside, so hot tea with sandwiches is very appropriate. - Today we remember how Jesus Christ came to John the Baptist and was baptized by him. For Christians, this is one of the great holidays - on this day we remember the origins of the Christian Church, because it was on this day that Christ appeared to people as the Messiah and Savior. At the same time, it is a reminder for every Christian why we were baptized, what we promised God and how we should live, explains the meaning of the holiday, military chaplain of the 46th brigade, Dmytro Semko. About ten people gather at the same time for joint prayer after a short sermon. Among them are not only military personnel, but also local residents who came to share with the paratroopers the joy of the bright holidays of the Epiphany and the Baptism of the Lord. All other volunteers have already come and will continue to come to the reservoir, which symbolizes the biblical Jordan, individually and in small groups. Despite the absence of lavish celebrations with a large gathering, the front-line Epiphany touches the warmth of the Christian and front-line unity of people in their faith with the Lord and among themselves. Today, in the midst of the terrible tragedy of war, stern, fire-hardened and iron-tested paratroopers smile and joke kindly, as if following Christ's command to become like children. -Christ is baptizing!-, we remember the traditional Ukrainian folk greeting at the Epiphany. -In the Jordan River!- - we hear the answer. Today, in Ukraine, every consecrated body of water is a symbolic Jordan. The paratroopers of the 46th separate airmobile brigade of the Russian Air Force, who celebrated Epiphany in 2025 at the front, also have their own Jordan.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/hrystos-hreshhayetsya-na-donechchyni-frontove-vodohreshhe-vidznachyly-desantnyky/	2025-01-06T12:02:47-08:00

Due to the war, the Russian economy has already lost 1.5 to 1.7 million able-bodied citizens	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The forecast for the development of the situation on the labor market in the Russian Federation in the long term is also negative - by 2045, the employment market in the Russian Federation will decrease by 7–10 million people from the current 76 million employed citizens. The deterioration of the situation on the labor market leads to the deepening of stagflation processes in the Russian economy - an increase in the level of inflation due to an increase in wages, a decrease in the level of production, and bankruptcies of a number of enterprises. The deficit of the working-age population of the Russian Federation is also one of the factors that prevent the Russian authorities from announcing a new wave of mobilization.

How to vote online for members of the Public Anti-Corruption Council: instructions from the Ministry...	About this informs the Ministry of Defense. Open nationwide online voting will take place from 09:00 to 21:00 on the official resource of the Ministry of Defense. You can also read the full list of candidacies on the website. The council will include 15 candidates who will receive the most votes. The results will be published on the information resources of the Ministry of Defense within five working days. Over the next two years, members of the Anti-Corruption Council will help assess corruption risks in the Ministry of Defense and will contribute to the formation of relevant anti-corruption measures. It is the votes of the citizens of Ukraine that will determine which of the represented persons will join the council. Therefore, the Ministry of Defense calls on citizens to participate in voting. All citizens of Ukraine on the territory of Ukraine are invited to participate. Authentication will take place using the BankID or Action.Signature service. Taking into account the enemy's constant attacks on the Ukrainian IT infrastructure, you can vote only from the territory of Ukraine. Each member can vote only once. Up to 15 representatives can be elected from 40 candidates. Candidates for participation in the contest were submitted by public associations whose statutory activities are related to the prevention and combating of corruption. Only NGOs whose state registration took place at least two years before the announcement of the competition were admitted. The list was approved by the Commission for ensuring the holding of the competition, created by order of the Ministry of Defense. The composition of the Commission included representatives of the Public Anti-Corruption Council itself, NGOs and advisory bodies. Representatives of the Ministry of Defense do not have the right to vote in the meetings of the commission. All NGOs provided a public report on their activities, indicating the sources of funding for the last year. All candidates are checked for compliance with the qualification criteria defined in the Regulations on the Public Anti-Corruption Council under the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. 42 candidacies were submitted to the competition. Among them, one candidate refused to participate, another was not admitted to the competition due to the submission of documents from a non-public association. Last time, during the voting, there were significant technical failures /a> in particular, the unstable operation of the site, as well as authorization errors through partner services BankID and Diya.Signature. Therefore, the results were annulled, and the voting was scheduled for a new date. The Ministry of Defense is taking all necessary measures to eliminate technical problems and to ensure the stable operation of the system throughout the voting process. For the new vote, the Ministry's team developed software for high load readiness, conducted thorough functional and load testing, and developed human-oriented scenarios for solving emergency situations. In addition, on the day of the vote, a rapid response team of three administrators has been appointed to monitor the transparency and democracy of the process. All digital systems of the Ministry of Defense are protected according to state and international cyber security standards. All sensitive data in the voting process are securely encrypted and processed in a secure data center for official electronic resources of the Ministry. If your chosen bank or Diya.Signature has technical problems, this may be due to a large number of simultaneous requests to these services and their bandwidth. The Ministry of Defense has no influence on the functioning of partner systems. However, you can still vote by choosing a different login method (Bank or Action.Signature) or try logging in later. This means that the server could not authenticate the request. This limitation occurs in secure web systems that strictly control the security of requests. This situation is usually temporary and easily resolved: try to log in from another device or clear cookies. Cookies are created by websites you have visited before and store information about your visit. You can clear them in your browser settings (Chrome, Safari, Opera, etc.). For example, to delete cookies from Chrome on Android devices: To delete cookies from Safari on iOS devices: The Ministry of Defense has dedicated large-scale cloud resources to the reliability of online voting. However, there may be more simultaneous requests. A large team of specialists will take care of the serviceability of the technical part in real time. If an overload does occur, specialists will immediately start restoring the system. So try to vote later. This means that your current IP address is different from the one recorded by the site's server when you logged in or made a previous request. The stability of your IP address allows the system to make sure that you are not a bot and that your session has not been intercepted. This is an important factor to protect users and votes from potential threats. In order to participate in voting, IOU recommends logging in again and making sure that your connection is stable and that the device does not reconnect to the network or change the network. If you use a VPN/proxy, turn it off for the time of voting. Such a message means that the set time limit for the end of voting has passed. The system is configured for increased security, so it is necessary that the session originates from a stable IP address and remains active. This is done to avoid outside interference. The MOU advises to refresh the page, if necessary, to re-authorize. Such a message appears if there is a conflict between the ID.GOV.UA system and the browser or Internet connection on your device. The MOU recommends changing your Internet connection or trying to log in from another device. These are not internal logs. This is what the voting chain and protocol looks like. They are made public so that the public can see the framework by which the process is carried out. For the Ministry of Defense, the implementation of the right to vote of every resident of Ukraine is a priority. The use of an open chain and voting protocol ensures the transparency of the competition, the possibility to check the vote counting procedure. So each person who took part in voting can check how his vote was counted, as well as count the number of votes for each candidate. The open protocol does not contain personal data of citizens, therefore it does not allow to specifically identify the identity of the voter.

A Russian jailer who tortured Ukrainian soldiers came under suspicion	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on January 6. We are talking about a citizen of the Russian Federation, Oleksiy Khavetsky, the deputy head of the -correctional colony No. 7-, which is located in the Volodymyr region of Russia. According to the case file, at least from the end of May 2023 to February 2024, the official personally participated in the torture of captured Ukrainian soldiers who were imprisoned in a Russian prison. In the cells, the victims were tortured with electric currents and sentry dogs, which were used by the Rashists to guard the perimeter of the regime facility, were pointed at them. Also, on the instructions of Havetskyi, his subordinates regularly beat prisoners, and then left them for a long time without food, water, and medical care. Another common way of abusing the victims was to keep them without warm clothes in frozen cells without heating or at low temperatures in the open air. Using torture, the jailer tried to -extract- from the victims the -confessions- needed by the occupiers in pre-fabricated cases against Ukrainian defenders. In addition, he used physical violence and psychological pressure on prisoners in order to force them to cooperate for the benefit of the Russian Federation in the war against our state. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed Khavetsky in absentia about the suspicion under part. 2 Art. 28, ch. 1 Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (war crimes committed by a group of persons based on a prior conspiracy). Despite the fact that the perpetrator is in Russia, comprehensive measures are being taken to find him and punish him. As reported by ArmyInform, the prosecutors of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office sent to the court an indictment against a Russian serviceman on the fact of brutal treatment of a civilian population, committed by a group of persons based on a prior conspiracy (Part 2 of Article 28, Part 1 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine in the 2022 edition).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/pidozru-otrymav-rosijskyj-tyuremnyk-yakyj-katuvav-ukrayinskyh-vijskovyh/	2025-01-06T07:04:43-08:00

He said that during the last combat sortie of the -RAROG- unmanned systems battalion, three tanks and two BMPs were destroyed. And over the past few weeks, the number of destroyed equipment has been increasing. The press officer said that there were no significant changes in the enemy's tactics. As before, the occupier bets on manpower, small assault groups. -If earlier there were five, trying to get involved in shooting battles, now the groups are smaller, maybe two people each. But the number of such groups can increase and they can act simultaneously. From time to time, the enemy tries to use the technique, especially in bad weather, when the number of drones decreases,- said Ivan Petrychak. As reported by ArmyInform, on January 5, in the Kramatorsk direction, the occupiers -napryamku-i-na-kurshhyni/->attacked seven times in the area of ​​Chasovoy Yar, Stupochky and Predtechny.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/vorog-tysne-na-chasiv-yar-masoyu-ale-vtrachaye-i-soldativ-i-tehniku/	2025-01-06T06:51:16-08:00

In the end, the patience of the Ukrainian fighters turned out to be not infinite, as a result of which a few more drones flew to the insolence, which sent him after hundreds of thousands of the same ill-mannered invaders. As ArmiyaInform reported, there are also more prudent invaders who, after being wounded, prefer to lay down their arms immediately and surrender to the Ukrainian military, as happened to the Russian, captured captured during the clearing of a building in Toretsk by the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/pogani-manery-mayut-naslidky-okupant-poplatyvsya-za-serednij-palecz-u-bik-ukrayinskyh-bijcziv/	2025-01-06T06:43:39-08:00

-Wholesale- destruction of occupiers, city battles, hiding places of Russians: the Defense Forces sp...	On January 6, the spokesperson told about this on the broadcast of -Society News- Major Viktor Tregubov of the strategic group of troops -Khortytsia-. -They are really trying to break through the city center, while the Ukrainian troops stop them and destroy them. Heavy urban battles have been going on for more than a week. The city itself, from which the population had already been evacuated, turned into one big arena. And it caused damage to buildings and infrastructure,- Viktor Tregubov said. In the Pokrovsky direction, the enemy carries out the most offensive actions, in particular in the areas of Elizavetivka, Vozdvizhenka, Myrolyubivka, Promin, Lysivka, Pishchane, Solone and Novovasylivka settlements. -This is most likely south of the city, although the enemy would not mind going west of it. Everything is logical here, he does not want to interfere in direct battles in the city of Pokrovsk itself. This is a sufficiently large and protected city, so he is trying to bypass it, cover it from the same western side,- he said. According to him, Ukrainian defenders are trying to slow down the enemy and stop his advance. He noted that the enemy is more actively using armored vehicles in the Vremivsk direction, as there are fewer buildings there. -Actually, there are villages there, not a city, so the enemy is trying to advance more actively there and will launch combat operations more dynamically,- noted the spokesman of the -Khortytsia- OSU. However, he assured that the Defense Forces are destroying a sufficiently large number of enemy personnel and armored vehicles there. -Because when they're advancing in more open terrain, when some of the equipment that's advancing is just blown up on minefields or hit by FPV drones, it's, I would say, such wholesale destruction,- he explained. The enemy is also trying to cross the Oskil and reach its right bank. -It is north of Kupyansk. He tries to infiltrate in small groups there, tries to concentrate them in landings, so that later, when a certain amount is accumulated, he can advance further and take another landing. The intensity is much lower there, but there are certain threats,- Viktor Tregubov emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, on Vremivsk, Kurakhivsk and other directions, the enemy -v-taktyczi-voroga-na-riznyh-napryamkah/->changes tactics, trying to adapt to the situation. However, even such attempts as attacks with manual mines do not bring the desired results.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/optovi-znyshhennya-okupantiv-miski-boyi-hovanky-rosiyan-u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-pro-sytuacziyu-na-shodi/	2025-01-06T06:17:04-08:00
More than 7,000 people remain in Pokrovsk, enemy drones reach most areas of the city	Serhiy Dobryak, head of the Pokrovsk MBA, told about this on the air of -Suspilne Novosti- . -About 7,300 people still live in the city. And for those people, shops are still open here and there, several pharmacies are open, specialists from our territorial center are working, a small number of them are persuading the elderly who are still staying to evacuate after all,- the official said. He also emphasized that the city is constantly under attack by various means of attack, including artillery, guided aerial bombs and drones. According to the head of the MBA, currently only 15% of Pokrovsk remains inaccessible to them, while in the rest of the city, Russian operators are organizing a real hunt for civilians. -There is one small area, they don't fly there yet, let's put it that way. But it's a matter of time,- Serhiy Dobryak noted. However, despite the difficult situation, recently the Pokrovsk community managed to restore the stele at the entrance to the city, destroyed by the occupiers last week. As reported by ArmyInform, on January 5 in the Pokrovsky direction our defenders stopped 51 assault and offensive actions of the aggressor in populated areas points Elizavetivka, Vozdvizhenka, Myrolyubivka, Promin, Lysivka, Novy Trud, Pischane, Solone, Novovasylivka, Novoelizavetivka and Yasenove.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/u-pokrovsku-zalyshayutsya-ponad-7-tysyach-lyudej-vorozhi-drony-distayut-do-bilshosti-rajoniv-mista/	2025-01-06T06:08:01-08:00
the Russians brought electricians from Chuvashia to TOT	This is reported by Center of national resistance. In 2022, the Russians liberated part of the south from civilization, economy and freedom. As a result of inefficient management by self-appointed individuals from the ROA, there are constant blackouts in the south, despite the absence of attacks on generation facilities. The reason is the inability of the Russians to maintain the energy infrastructure. Due to the lack of personnel, the Russians import energy workers from various regions of the Russian Federation on a rotational basis. In particular, this time from Chuvashia. The inability to recruit personnel for the TOT due to the departure of Ukrainians and unwillingness to cooperate with the enemy is an eloquent testimony to the real indicator of the -popularity- of the occupiers in the region. As reported by ArmyInform, in one of the industrial districts of Lysychansk, near the old mine, the occupiers set up a military training ground.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/rosiyany-zavezly-na-tot-elektrykiv-z-chuvashiyi/	2025-01-06T05:56:12-08:00

The introduction of a new financial instrument in the largest banks (which are also -systemically important- credit organizations) indicates an attempt by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation to increase their solvency in order to avoid a -crisis of non-payments- in the Russian banking system. As reported by ArmyInform, against the background of the escalation of the energy crisis, the authorities of the Republic of Moldova significantly increased the tariffs for heat and electricity for the population.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/v-rf-prydumaly-novyj-sposib-vyluchyty-koshty-v-naselennya/	2025-01-06T05:34:44-08:00

According to Dmytro Lubinets, January 3 near the village of Neskuchne, Volnovasky district, Donetsk region, the Russian occupiers committed a terrible crime — they probably shot three Ukrainian prisoners of war. According to DeepState, the Russians tied their hands and shot them in the back of the head. -We are once again witnessing atrocities that show the true face of the aggressor state.

Dmytro Lubinets said that he immediately appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations. -These organizations should condemn this crime and put pressure on the Russian side to stop such acts. Ukraine maintains its commitment to observe humanitarian law even in times of war, but we will not allow Russia to turn the world into a territory of lawlessness. The guilty must be punished,- the ombudsman emphasized.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/okupanty-jmovirno-rozstrilyaly-troh-ukrayinskyh-vijskovopolonenyh-dmytro-lubinecz/	2025-01-06T05:23:32-08:00
-The weather is quite stormy-: the storm scattered protective structures near the Kerch bridge	This was reported on the air of the telethon by the spokesman of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk . According to him, the enemy is currently trying to find any opportunity to restore the damaged buildings. -Of course, the period of storms is quite long in the Black Sea, in the Kerch Strait. Also, the weather is quite stormy. In this sense, it makes adjustments to the plans of the Russian occupiers. But, of course, they take maximum measures to protect this building. And so far, there are no trends to decrease their activity,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. He also noted that the Kerch bridge remains a strategically important object for the enemy. -You see that they saturated this facility with echeloned air defense systems as much as possible&#8230; The number of fuel tankers has increased. This is also not a coincidence. This is also a consequence of the use of the so-called Kerch bridge for fuel supply. Because you see the ferries are no longer running. It was the main tool. Accordingly, they should use more cities,- added the representative of the Armed Forces Navy. As reported by ArmyInform, in December 2024 the number of protective barges near the Kerch bridge reduced to 18 units due to storms.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/pogoda-dovoli-burhlyva-shtorm-rozkydav-zahysni-sporudy-bilya-kerchenskogo-mostu/	2025-01-06T05:17:59-08:00
-They go wave after wave- - in Kharkiv Oblast, the enemy sends 100 infantrymen on assaults every day	On January 6, Mykola Volokhov told about this in the air telethon -Edyny Novyny- , commander of the -Terra- unit of the Third Separate Assault Brigade. -In the area of ​​responsibility of the Third Separate Assault Brigade in Kharkiv Oblast, not a single meter of Ukrainian land has been surrendered. We keep a firm defense. Our assault mechanized battalions, anti-tank and tank battalions all perform their work in accordance with the commander's order,- he assured. According to him, the enemy began to use armored vehicles less. -The weather is such that it is difficult to use armored vehicles. They try, but where we work with our FPV drones, it's objectively very difficult to do. Because everything that goes, it burns: we destroy it quite effectively,- Mykola Volokhov explained. He noted that the Russian invaders continue to actively advance with infantry. -They decided it was more efficient to go on foot now. Of course, they don't lose a hundred people every day, but they can afford to launch up to a hundred people on assaults. They come wave after wave,- Mykola Volokhov said. In his opinion, the purpose of such assaults is to deplete the defense of the Ukrainians and reduce the amount of munitions. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Kharkiv region, the Russian infantry continues daily assault operations, even if it does not have the support of its drones and other types of weapons.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/vony-jdut-hvylya-za-hvyleyu-na-harkivshhyni-vorog-shhodenno-vidpravlyaye-na-shturmy-po-100-pihotyncziv/	2025-01-06T05:02:17-08:00

the Kremlin is using the energy crisis in Moldova against Ukraine	About reports the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. At the same time, the country's government is working on diversification of gas and electricity supply sources. In January, the Moldovan government plans to cover 62% of electricity needs through imports from Romania, about 30% will be provided by thermal power plants and local producers of energy from renewable sources. Moldova received the right to increase the electricity import quota from the EU from 315 MW to 600 MW, if it is not used by other importers. Currently, the total quota for Moldova and Ukraine is 2,100 MW, of which 315 MW belongs to Moldova. Prime Minister of Moldova D. Rechan stated that the energy crisis provoked by Russia is aimed at using the Moldovan crisis against Ukraine in particular. In the Transnistrian region, the situation in the energy sector remains extremely difficult. At the same time, the so-called -leader- of the region in Krasnoselsky called the situation -under control- and called on residents to -warm themselves with firewood.- For its part, the management of JSC -Moldovagaz- offered JSC -Tiraspoltransgaz- assistance in purchasing gas through European platforms at market prices. However, the Transnistrian -leadership- rejected the proposal and hopes for the restoration of gas supplies by the Russian -Gazprom-. Most likely, Russia will use the deepening of the energy crisis to restore gas transit to Europe through the territory of Ukraine and bring pro-Russian forces to power in Moldova. In this way, the Kremlin hopes to use the situation with the supply of gas in the Transnistrian region to further blackmail European countries. How to ->reported ArmyInform, Ukrainian fighters conducted an operation to clear a building captured by the Russians in Toretsk, Donetsk region, during which they managed to take alive one of the invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/kreml-vykorystovuye-energetychnu-kryzu-v-moldovi-proty-ukrayiny/	2025-01-06T03:31:35-08:00

The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on January 6. 4 members of the Russian intelligence network were detained, who were preparing to detonate explosives at the entrance to the building where one of the units of the Defense Forces is stationed. According to the investigation materials, the improvised explosive device was in a tactical backpack, which was to be delivered to the regime facility by a minor agent of the Russian special services, dressed in a Ukrainian-style military uniform. The enemy tracked his movements online and planned to detonate explosives as soon as the young man entered the premises. At the same time, the agent himself, who was supposed to be blown up, did not know that a fatal end was being prepared for him. He thought that the SVP would be detonated after he left the building. Counter-intelligence of the SBU detected the enemy's plans in advance and took a series of measures to prevent a terrorist attack. As a result, a minor terrorist and 3 other agents involved in planning this crime were detained. As the investigation established, with this terrorist attack, the Russian special services wanted to destabilize the socio-political situation in Ukraine and create the appearance of a conflict within the Defense Forces, when one -military- detonates others as a sign of protest. According to the investigation materials, all four involved acted separately from each other, but had a common curator from the Russian Federation. One of the agents turned out to be a 16-year-old student from the Kirovohrad region. He received the coordinates of the cache from the occupiers, in which he took explosives and a military uniform. Another member of the network is a 19-year-old young man who, according to preliminary data, transported explosives and military uniforms from the -initial hiding place- to a cache, where they were taken by a 16-year-old agent. The -initial cache- itself was arranged by 2 residents of the Vinnytsia region. According to video instructions from a representative of the Russian special services, they made an explosive device and hid it in a designated place. During the searches, mobile phones with evidence of their cooperation with the aggressor were seized from the detainees. Also, 1.5 kg of an explosive mixture for the manufacture of a home-made weapon was seized from one of the agents. Investigators of the SBU informed the defendants of the suspicion of crimes committed under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: Detainees are in custody without the right to bail.
