In the Russian Federation, a decrease in the export of agricultural products is recorded	This is reported by /a> Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. At the same time, the import of agricultural products increased by 4.9% to 30.6 billion US dollars. Despite Putin's goal of increasing exports to $55 billion by 2030. USA, the real volume of agricultural exports will most likely amount to 36.3 billion dollars. USA, which gives a decrease of 34%. A reduction in exports will reduce customs duties, which will negatively affect the financing of unprofitable industries such as breeding, genetics, dairy and poultry. With this in mind, Russia revised the forecast for the growth of agricultural production in 2024: 1.5% per year is expected, instead of 3%, as previously forecast.

Exploits of tankers — Heroes of Ukraine: one against a convoy, surrounded battles and a risky maneuv...	Despite the statement of some experts that with the advent of new anti-tank weapons, the life of a tank on the battlefield is a matter of minutes, to this day the tank remains the most protected and well-armed combat vehicle. Ukraine has become one of the few countries that develop and produce tanks - it is enough to mention that the best tank of the Second World War, the T-34, and the first main battle tank, the T-64, were developed in Kharkiv. During the war with Russia, Ukrainian tankers discovered and continue to discover your skill and heroism by destroying the enemy. Thousands of tankers were awarded orders and medals, individual servicemen became Heroes of Ukraine. ArmyInform reminds which of the tankers was awarded the highest state award. His brothers nicknamed him -Adam- because he was always the first to go into battle. He was one of the first to destroy Russian tanks in the defense of Donetsk Airport in the fall of 2014 year, each time fighting to break through to the terminals, where the defense was held by Ukrainian servicemen. Risking his life more than once and more than twice, Yevhen Mezhevikin applied many tactical innovations and became the first tanker to be awarded the Hero of Ukraine Golden Star. With the beginning of a large-scale invasion, he created and became the commander of a tactical group -Adam-. Then, in late February 2022, the volunteers who had been fighting under his leadership since the start of the war rallied around him. Adam repaired two training tanks, an infantry fighting vehicle and went into battle with them. Task Force Adam was created on 14 March 2022. There were battles for the Kyiv region (Irpin, Bucha), then the group worked in the Bakhmut direction, took part in the Kharkiv offensive operation. It also took part in combat operations in different directions - Balakleya, Liman, Bakhmut, Kreminna, Serebryansky Forest&#8230; Now he is the deputy head of the Main Department of Doctrine and Training of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is impossible not to mention the feat of Colonel Yevgeny Sydorenko, who drove alone against the Russian column in the battle near Ilovaisk on the T-72BV trophy tank. There are very few such cases in world history. And almost all of them were during World War II. Yevhen Sydorenko, after repelling the Russian attack on August 29, 2014, went in a convoy to break away from the encirclement. It is his tank led the breakthrough after the death of Colonel Oleksiy Hrachov. For that battle, he was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, Ukrainian tankers have repeatedly demonstrated their courage and heroism. So, one of the first titles of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to a 23-year-old platoon commander Yugen Palchenko with the call sign -Song- - in the first days of the large-scale invasion, he was under Kherson covered the exit of the brigade from the environment, saving the lives of his comrades. Having broken through the ring of Russians, three tanks under the command of Palchenko took up the defense near the Antonivsky bridge and enabled the brothers to break through. About two thousand Ukrainian soldiers and equipment came out of the encirclement. On March 2, 2022, Lieutenant Yevhen Palchenko was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine by Presidential Decree for personal courage and heroism. Captain's company Ponomarenka accepted the baptism of fire within a few hours after unloading near Barvinkovo, and since then tankers of the 3rd separate tank brigade of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces almost continuously defend Kharkiv Oblast from enemy attack. In one of these battles, Serhii won Ukraine's highest state award. That day, tankers together with paratroopers made an attempt to storm the village of Topolskyi, which was captured by the enemy, near Izyum. Six Ukrainian tanks approached the village from two directions, but it turned out that the Russians had more than two dozen tanks there. But the training and experience of Ponomarenko's subordinates turned out to be better: the destruction of nine Rashist tanks was confirmed. One of the Ukrainian T-72s was damaged by several hits at once. In order to save the crew, Captain Ponomarenko decided to break into the firing line again in his own tank, so as not to endanger others. The crew supported their company, and Ponomarenko's tank successfully performed a risky maneuver, suppressing the enemy's fire points with well-aimed shots, and then the brave men under fire took the wrecked car in tow and pulled it out of the battlefield. On April 2, 2022, Captain Serhii Ivanovich Ponomarenko was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine with the award of the Golden Star Order.

Why the infantry rules in this war: about 24 days at -zero-, a path in -petals- and rescuing the wou...	They walked, orienting themselves by the silhouettes of bushes, pits, rips from the arrivals. The eye was already used to the darkness, and the terrain was familiar - they had gone to these places on more than one combat sortie. Just then, in the velvet silence of the night, an explosion rang out. Ivan with the call sign -Lucky- is the chief sergeant of the company of the mechanized battalion of the 44th separate mechanized brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He is 30 years old, originally from Chernihiv Oblast. ArmyInform recorded the story of a serviceman - about people and equipment in the army; about our army and training in Britain; about own motivation and approach to subordinates; about the evacuation of the dead soldier, about 24 days in the positions and much more: -I well remember the dawn of February 24, 2022: I was on the route on the way to Kyiv. Worked at a gas station, went to work. Basically, I'm a builder - it's my hobby! Don't feed with bread, but let bricks be laid (laughs - ed.). Then, on February 24, I read the news: shelling of Odesa, Kyiv&#8230; And I went to the Military Commissariat. I was sent to territorial defense. Teroborona is mostly a routine, we've been testing people. They stood at checkpoints, drove closer to the border, worked in the forests. Various information was checked, including about suspicious people. It was interesting because I found a lot of new acquaintances. My previous military experience is a term of service in 2015-2016, but in the National Guard of Ukraine. Therefore, the ZSU as a structure was a little unclear to me at first, but after a few days it became like cheese in butter (smiling - ed.). Then, when the Russians were expelled from the Chernihiv region, I joined the ranks of the ZSU - in the 44th brigade. I have been in this brigade since March 2023. Came to the position of commander of the department - the commander of a combat vehicle. &#8230; Why did I then go to the Military Commissariat? I'm not going to beat myself up and say what a great patriot I am, but I understood what I had to do. And I left. And he did not regret his decision one bit. I went to study in Britain in the summer of 2023. I thought it would be hot, but it's 21 degrees maximum (laughs - ed.), it's cold! After training, he returned to the position of platoon chief sergeant, and in September he became company chief sergeant, and now, in addition, I temporarily perform the duties of a battalion sergeant. The British military has a wonderful attitude towards Ukrainian soldiers. They do their best to teach us something. The classes were very interesting, they arranged quests for us, we walked through the woods, and, like pirates, looked for treasures&#8230; It was interesting. But the British have their own vision of how the war should continue, it is radically different from what is happening in our country. We also advised and advised them. Personally, I took a lot of useful things, especially regarding work with personnel, organization of work with people (approach to everyone, manner of communication, system of incentives). How do I encourage personnel?... I'll let you in on a big secret: The best incentive for military personnel is to see family. Therefore, yes, when there is an opportunity, I always tried to make maximum efforts so that the person was allowed to go home at least for a day or two, I could take care of this in front of the commander, etc. Because neither money nor diplomas can compare with a trip to relatives. &#8230; I'm generally reserved, but I can raise my voice - there are cases when it is proved&#8230; But I don't -bark- at subordinates on a regular basis. But the best recipe for understanding people in the army is communication. People are all different: someone from the city, someone from the village, from different regions. All this should be taken into account. In principle, I have not yet had such cases when, whether at the front or when the unit was in the rear, it was not possible to solve any issue. You just need an individual approach to each person. Recently, we went on a recovery from the difficult Kupyansk-Svativsk direction. We went there at the beginning of July 2023, the task was carried out for almost a year and a half. What are the most difficult tasks during this time? Probably holding positions that were difficult to reach, to which there is no approach, and when the enemy is just around the corner. This was the most difficult. Because, even elementary: in order to provide people with water, it was necessary to connect drones that would drop water and food for people. Therefore, to enter or exit these front lines intact was another quest. Now is a drone war. I personally had a case when the guys got lost, and I was just at that moment in a position where there was communication and I had the opportunity to see the picture. I contacted the UAV and asked them to find these guys. He told the boys that now our bird will take them to follow her. So, with the help of drones, we took out two fighters who got lost at night. They came out by the sound. Somehow I spent the maximum 24 days in the leading positions. It was the first time for me and it was a difficult experience. Because until now they entered the positions only for evacuation, or for 2-3 days (to see the situation, tell the guys something, or something). And 24 days is my maximum. During that time, I realized the best thing: a shower of wet wipes is such a thing (laughing, thumbs up - ed.). What is the most delicious exercise on the enemy's personnel?... It was with the help of drones. The UAV calculated where the enemy BMP and three buggies were. It seems that they imported BC&#8230; And then, with the help of Browning, two drones with resets and one RPG, we just poured it in there! Detonated everything! There were fireworks! And it was the most effective of what I saw with my own eyes. Adrenaline surges every day when you perform combat missions. You won't feel like you're there. I remember how I had to lead two soldiers to a position, they didn't know the way back then. The night was dark. I had a specific path there that led to a position on the middle line. I have met them and I am leading them. It is not possible to shine, so I oriented myself in the space - a bush, a hole, a gap from the arrival - we are walking, so to speak, by the devices (laughs - ed.). And then I hear one of the soldiers who followed me blow up. I did not understand what happened, because the drone was not heard. I took out a red flashlight and shone it. The path was strewn with -petals-. All Stupidly stuffed. We carefully approached the military one, threw it on us, and for another 200 meters made our way along that path literally by a millimeter - so as not to be stepped on. Then the enemy drones began to direct artillery at us, it started to slurp-slurp-slurp (simulates falling shells - ed.). We have already put up tourniquets in the shelter&#8230; If we talk about my worst experience, it was last year, unfortunately, we had to evacuate one of our dead comrades, a soldier. It took a day, with stops and rests, because the movement in the forward positions takes place only in the dark or gray hours of the day. We drove in at night, it took us some time to reach the position, to him, by morning. They have already started to appear gray. The distance was up to 5 kilometers. We spent the whole night on it. But leaving it there is not an option. A group of volunteers gathered, I led it, the armor dropped us and we left. When I found out that the unit was going to rebuild?.. Oh, it was shock content (laughs - ed.), like a bolt from the blue. There was a meeting and the company commander proved it&#8230; He arrived with his eyes wide open and says, -You won't believe it, you STILL WON'T BELIEVE IT!-. We asked what the matter was. And he was frightened: -On the way, they are taking us out.- When the boys heard it, they almost ordered the orchestra! They could not decide what to take with them and what to leave. The team was prompt and we got together pretty quickly. Everyone was so happy, as if&#8230; the war is over. Everyone hoped that maybe it would be possible to go home for a day or two. What was the first thing I did when I found myself in the -civilian- world? I went to the supermarket, bought myself the most expensive sweet water and pizza. And came out, inhaled, and it was a cool feeling. Nothing buzzes or explodes overhead&#8230; Now there is an opportunity to communicate more with relatives, call friends, because there is no such opportunity. What will be the end of the war for me?.. At least information about the ceasefire that is coming from their side. And there are guarantees from the authorities that it will stop for now. It is also important for me to understand that all this was not in vain, that all my brothers died - not in vain. I want people in the frontline and frontline villages to start sleeping peacefully. Because there are villages where there are a few elderly people left and they simply do not have the opportunity to leave somewhere. They don't even have a store in the village. It's painful to watch. And when they start to sleep peacefully - yes, it would be happiness for me. The borders of 1991?.. I think it is unlikely and unrealistic now. I would, of course. But it is hard to believe. So even if the fire and bombing just stopped, that would be cool. I would really like that. Fear of war?.. Everyone is afraid. And I'm afraid. But when you're already in the team, it's all much easier to digest. And these fears simply become something commonplace. For me, the worst thing is, for example, to lose the opportunity to see even more loved ones&#8230; But all those who are afraid just need to understand that sooner or later this fear can become their joy if it comes to them (when they find themselves in the ranks of the Armed Forces - ed.). The more we unite now , the more of us there are, the easier it will be for us. Adaptation to the army is very fast. Therefore, there is no need to be afraid. Yes, everyone is afraid. But you need to understand that this fear will live with you forever and constantly. Sometimes, simply, something will go into the background, then some adrenaline appears, then there will be successes that will switch you. Why do infantry rule this war? Gosh, it's so simple. Infantry is the hardest. Infantry units are the most difficult because it is direct contact with the enemy. These can be weeks spent in positions. I'm not downplaying the achievements of other units, but infantry is the hardest. Even take into account the fact: you are going to the position and you need to take food, water, BC with you for a week. And it's easy to put it on the position. Only for this, I believe, people need to shake hands and hardly carry on their hands. Infantry are the ones without whom we would lose territory. Without infantry, it is impossible to maintain a defensive line. Yes, there are drones, there is technology. But it is people (infantry!) who enter the position, establish themselves and keep it. Without these people, we would simply crumble.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/12/chomu-pihota-rulyt-u-czij-vijni-pro-24-doby-na-nuli-stezhku-u-lyepestkah-ta-poryatunok-poranenogo-istoriya-laki/	2024-12-11T20:55:22-08:00
At the forefront of technology: the European manufacturer of anti-ship missiles presented a new vers...	As highlighted in the presentation release MBDA (Matra BAE Dynamics Aérospatiale), an industrial company in the aerospace and defense sectors, a European leader in the development of missiles and missile weapons, -the ability to successfully launch an anti-ship missile at any time of the day or night, in any weather, and regardless of electronic warfare conditions has always been vital to the Navy,- the ArmyInform document quotes. -In addition, the ability of surface ships to detect a submarine has increased significantly over the years due to technological improvements, which has led to the emergence of a new generation of anti-ship missiles,- state the manufacturers of the warhead. The ammunition, named SM40, was created in France and became the last representative of the Exocet family, writes the Defense News portal with a link on company representatives. The material says that the main differences of the new anti-ship missile from its predecessor, the SM39 missile, are the use of a new J-band radar, improved algorithms for working under conditions of high combat load, as well as a doubled radius of attack. According to Pierre-Marie Bellot, MBDA's Head of Strike Missile Development, the SM40 missile has a range of up to 120 km, which is made possible by a new turbojet engine. According to him, the significant increase in the damage radius is designed to increase the possibility of conducting a battle at a safe distance in the conditions of anti-submarine warfare. Bello also noted that the SM40 is designed exclusively for submarines produced by the French company Naval Group, which provides for the compatibility of the new missile with submarines used by a wide range of customers of the French shipbuilder on the international market. As Defense News writes, the predecessor of the new missile, the SM39 model, is already in service with the navies of several countries, including France and India. The new variant of the ammunition, in addition to effectively hitting well-protected warships and invisible targets, also has the ability to hit ground objects, which allows, for example, to attack ships in the port. According to the developer, the SM40 uses a launch method similar to the previous model: the missile is placed in a special underwater container with an engine that is controlled and accompanied during the underwater movement stage, and then ejects the missile to the surface, launching it. The new design's more compact airframe reduces fuel consumption compared to the MM40 Block 3/3c naval round. However, MBDA believes that the SM40 will still achieve its 120km range targets, which is double that of its predecessor. In addition, SM40 will retain the current launch area of ​​SM39, which includes the possibility of launches from the sea depths. Like the MM40 Block 3/3c, the new missile can hit coastal targets (such as moored ships inside a naval base). In addition, Naval News believes that the MBDA envisions additional sets of potential targets for the SM40. The SM40 has not yet been put into mass production, but, according to an MBDA representative, since it is built on the basis of already existing and proven technologies, the time to market will be minimal. Information: -Exocet- (fr. Exocet - flying fish) is a cruise anti-ship missile. Developed by the French company -Aérospatiale- in 1975. It is in the armed navies and air forces of more than 25 countries of the world. It is the most common PKR in the West. The missile has a traditional aerodynamic design with cross-shaped wings in the middle part of the body and the same rudders in the tail compartment. The rocket is launched from a sealed container. During launch, the distance to the enemy object and the bearing of the target are indicated. At a distance of 10 km to the target, the missile descends to a minimum height (8 m from the surface) and turns on the GOS radar. The warhead has contact and non-contact detonators. Exocet's main competitors are the American Harpoon, the Italian Otomat, the Israeli Gabriel-V, the Swedish RBS 15, and the Chinese Yingji series. Presentation of the SM40 Exocet cruise missile.

A new fraudulent scheme: Ukrainians are offered fake aid from UNICEF	To make the -dumping- look more believable, the swindlers even painted the categories of people to whom this aid is supposed to belong. But if you think about it, almost every Ukrainian falls under one of them. What is the point -people with a monthly income of less than 28 thousand hryvnias- worth? And this is in a country where the minimum wage is more than three times less than the specified amount. Obviously, this is being done to scam as many people as possible. The fraudulent scheme has already been warned on the official account of UNICEF Ukraine on Facebook: -We emphasize that we do not accept applications for such humanitarian kits. So be careful, do not go to third-party resources and do not share your personal data! According to the data of /a> of the -On the other side of the news- resource, fraudulent posts were spotted on the -Switch | Kyiv | Light- to which more than 100 thousand people subscribed. If you click on the link, you will be directed to the Unicef ​​Humanitarian Free Kit Telegram bot. Then you need to press -Start!-. As soon as you do this, you will be bombarded with dozens of messages. First, you will be asked to confirm your city. Whether you do this or not, you will then be threatened that you were -spotted on a Russian server 18 minutes 32 seconds ago.- Therefore, you will not be registered until you confirm your citizenship. And they write it in an ultimatum tone. However, even without this, you will receive an invitation to a -free humanitarian kit from our organization- (spelling correct). In short, you won't have time to blink an eye, and you will already be subscribed to a bunch of dubious Telegram channels. Specifically on -[substitute city] | Time-. This is a network of channels that covers all regional centers controlled by Ukraine. To understand the scope: only to the channel -Kyiv| 351,000 Ukrainians subscribed to Time! Actually, this is the main purpose of the scam scheme - to lure people to their channels. The more followers, the more advertising and money.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/12/nova-shahrajska-shema-ukrayinczyam-proponuyut-fejkovu-dopomogu-vid-unicef/	2024-12-11T20:26:47-08:00
About drones, EW and vacancies in a special battalion: combatant Kucher told how the enemy is having...	When will ground-based drones become commonplace on the frontline? What are the advantages of a separate special purpose battalion and what tasks does it perform? How to get into a special unit and what should be done to stay in the chosen position? Which branch of the special battalion of the presidential brigade is vacant? The commander of the 21st separate special purpose battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, Major Oleksiy Kucherenko with the call sign -Kucher-, told ArmyInform about this. - What is the difference between a separate special purpose battalion and a separate presidential brigade? - First of all, one should consider the advantages of a separate battalion as a whole over line battalions. This is greater autonomy, this is the availability of services - from cars to UAVs. This is the ability to independently carry out recruiting, the ability to make purchases, receive support from higher authorities not only from the brigade itself, but also directly. It is about the very benefits of an individual organism. A special purpose component allows us to perform various specific tasks. As of today, our tasks are closer to those of infantry — primarily to hold the line, destroy the enemy. But there are also quite specific tasks - for example, jump on a -Hummer- close to the enemy's positions and directly into the entrance to the house, throw -TM-ki- (anti-tank mines - ed.) into the dugout and watch , as the enemy flies into the air. There are different stories, extreme evacuation tasks, when there is no longer a walking route, and no access at all to that position. That is, there is a whole series of tasks with an increased level of risk that the special purpose battalion performs. - Not everyone can do such tasks. Who serves in the battalion, because the Armed Forces are, first of all, servicemen, people. Who serves in the battalion subordinate to you? How do you get to it - are there any special requirements? - Since the battalion was formed in March 2022, the vast majority of personnel are primarily mobilized. Recently, thanks to the opportunity to engage in recruiting, the number of contract workers in the unit has increased. However, the vast majority are soldiers who came to us for mobilization from training centers. If taken as a whole, more than 2/3 of the personnel are mobilized, and another 30% are those who found information about the battalion on media resources, on bigboards, on Reserve+, through recruiting centers. Those who self-mobilize are able to choose the position that best suits their desires and civilian experience. In the battalion, there is an opportunity to choose a direction for yourself, and not so that everyone goes under the same comb and it does not matter whether you were an agriculturist or a small businessman or worked on the railway. Everyone will be able to get a position according to his skills. If you're a great driver and you know how to fix an engine, you'll be a driver, my friend. If you have skills in the IT field, we also have suitable tasks. For example, there are UAV workshops, where we ourselves repair and improve large and small -birds-, configure kamikaze drones. Do you want to become a pilot - no questions, we will show and tell. Even if you do not have experience and skills, there are a number of experienced warriors in this field, there are a lot of training centers where everyone will find a position according to their calling. - Is there a guarantee that a person who has passed according to the necessary criteria for a certain position will serve in that position? - Absolutely. If she confirms her qualifications and shows results, not only this serviceman, but also everyone around, primarily the command, will be interested in her continuing to perform tasks in this particular position. But there are also nuances. It will not be the case that if a person comes and does not show results in this position, then he will remain in this position forever. If you don't manage, you don't show results, you're lazy, then the trust credit ends - and then please do what they say. Then I'm sorry, my friend, if you don't cope, then in this case another military approach will already be applied and you will be transferred to a position that corresponds to your level of knowledge and skills, and which is now critically needed specifically in the battalion. — Now the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were able to independently recruit new recruits without the mediation of the TCC and SP. Is it practiced by the 21st separate special purpose battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade? - Of course, we practice. You can learn about us directly on our Telegram channel, on battalion Facebook pages and Instagram. Just enter the name of the battalion in the search engines and you will immediately find our page with a description of the combat path of the unit, information on how to join the battalion and vacancies. Aggregate vacancies in the Armed Forces of Ukraine from ArmiyaInform There are also vacancies in various platforms such as Work.ua or the newly created application Rezerv+, where you can mobilize directly. — In the ten years since the beginning of the open armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have gone through a very significant path of powerful modernization. Are these changes visible at the battalion level? What are they? — I have seen these changes personally — not from the outside, but in the army, because I have been serving for much longer than 5 years. I remember how the fighters still hemmed the -oak-. Therefore, the changes are very noticeable - starting with elementary issues of providing property, equipment, its quality - and ending with the conduct of hostilities. Material security is the first component that has changed very significantly for the better. The second component is how we now fight. For example, drones, real-time communication and data transmission, software that allows for operational control have given a very big boost and huge change to the tactics of warfare. We now have a variety of drones, from large UAVs such as Vampires and Bats to ground-based drones, both kamikaze and logistics drones. With the help of drones, it is now possible to provide supplies to advanced positions, as well as to deliver or drop large -bombs- directly on the enemy's head (smiles - ed.). And this is not to mention the many other high-quality Western weapons such as Javelin or NLAW, LAVR or MaxxPro armored vehicles and much more. It's one story when you drive a pickup and all your protection is an icon on a torpedo, and it's quite another when you fly in an armored Hummer with a Browning machine gun on the roof. - You mentioned ground drones. Despite the fact that their appearance on the front is no longer news, they still continue to be perceived as a certain novelty compared to UAVs. Can you say a few words specifically about ground unmanned complexes and their tasks? - As for ground drones, this is a really new branch of development for our division. However, it is extremely promising because there are specific tasks, especially in urban areas, that ground-based drones can perform best, and for which these tools are designed. For example, to deliver cargo without risking the lives of soldiers. Or drive a kamikaze drone directly into the enemy position and detonate four TMs to completely destroy it. All this allows, first of all, to save the lives of our soldiers and, secondly, to save a significant amount of ammunition that would have to be spent to fire damage to these positions. I will not reveal all the secrets about ground drones, because this component is still developing and has not gained much popularity. But, I think that in about half a year, ground drone crews will not be a novelty, but will become as commonplace as UAV crews and will appear in all units. They will perform tasks just as successfully and become as indispensable an integral part of operations as aerial drones. Nowadays, videos of FPV kamikazes or bombers with resets will not surprise anyone, instead, they are doing extremely important combat work. Thanks to this simple, already familiar element, we save a lot of lives of infantrymen who do not have to engage in direct combat with the enemy. Combat work of drone operators of the 21st special purpose battalion of the Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi Drones, heavy night bombers are 5 to 10 drops per night. This is a minus of the enemy's logistics, it is a deprivation of his ability to accumulate before assault actions. There were times when the enemy tried to build up on the front edge before attempting to storm our positions. We worked on them for a day with various drones, both kamikaze and heavy bombers. In the end, the commander of the assault group of the Russians refused to obey the order, turned off the radio station - and we listened to their conversations - and, judging by everything, left the position. The assault did not take place. They refused to storm, because every 20‒25‒30 minutes something would definitely come at them from our side. —The combat work of the UAV is very vivid, it is shown in countless videos. However, there is something that remains behind the scenes - providing battle management, establishing and maintaining communication, the work of EW. We understand that it is not possible to talk about everything in detail, but at least in general terms, what can be said about this -invisible- component of combat operations? - Communication is generally a key component of fighting, fire control. There will be no connection - there will be nothing. You will not be able not to give a command, you will not be able to adjust the means of fire, you will not be able to simply manage a unit. Without communication, any unit at any level will simply be incapacitated. It will be a group of people with weapons, with some skills, but it will not be a single fist, it will not be a single military body. So is the EW - it's invisible in the video, but just as important as kamikaze drones and bombers. The enemy uses FPV drones as actively as we do. Therefore, without REB, without providing reliable protection, no task can be performed now. Currently, no vehicle will be allowed into the combat zone without a REB, as this is an unjustified risk to personnel. Covering with electronic devices is also very relevant now. By the way, our battalion has recently created a separate department for the provision of REB. As of today, there are many vacancies in it, so if any of the readers of this interview have relevant knowledge, experience and see themselves as a specialist in radio-electronic warfare - welcome.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/12/pro-drony-reb-ta-vakanty-v-osoblyvomu-bataljoni-kombat-kucher-rozpoviv-yak-koshmaryt-voroga/	2024-12-11T20:11:06-08:00

Tangible property, fuel and food products: details of new purchases for the Armed Forces for 2025	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense on December 11. In particular, tenders were initiated for food products for UAH 24.4 billion, tangible property for UAH 9.5 billion, and fuel and lubricants for UAH 314.7 million. These measures are part of the policy of the Ministry of Defense to implement modern approaches to the organization of defense procurement, which are based on the principles of transparency, responsibility and timely delivery. -In general, in 2025, we plan to allocate more than UAH 67 billion to rear property. Purchases have already been announced for about half of this budget. In the midst of war, we cannot afford any delay. Early contracting is a guarantee that the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be provided with everything they need,- Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov emphasized. For his part, the Director of the Procurement Policy Department of the Ministry of Defense, Hleb Kanevskyi, noted that the forecasted procurement procedures and sufficient time for their implementation will give Ukrainian business the opportunity to fulfill large volumes of orders in a high-quality manner. -By the end of this year, the Prozorro system will hold auctions for the purchase of 550,000 pairs of summer boots and one million summer field suits, which will allow early preparation for the spring-summer period,- he said.

Why it is more difficult to return deported children than military children: the President's explana...	He told this in an interview for SBN. -You exchange the military for the military. Yes, unfortunately, sometimes the Russians block it, but it happens. Sometimes there is a possibility of returning civilians. And we understand the tool by which we return civilians. What about the children? It is very difficult with them, because we cannot trade children for children,- he stated. Volodymyr Zelenskyi noted that there are no stolen Russian children in Ukraine. -We didn't steal anyone, we didn't deport anyone. Our operation in the Kursk region is proof. It cannot be said that there are simply no Ukrainians on Russian territory, and therefore we did not touch anyone. No, we operated in the Kursk region. Not a single person was stolen, not a single civilian was killed by us, not a single child was harmed there. That's the difference,- he emphasized. According to him, the Russians stole 19,500 verified Ukrainian children. -These are the children who are verified by our institutions. But pay attention to the fact that officially, it seems to me, in 23 years, the Russian ombudsman reported that they are keeping 700 thousand Ukrainian children. This is their official data. I don't know how true this is, but it's terrifying. They are proud to have stolen children,- the head of state said. The President of Ukraine said that children can be returned only thanks to partners and joint pressure. -Now we are returning children through the mediation of Qatar, through the mediation of the Vatican, and certainly there are examples where this or that country can help with a small number of children. To date, we have returned 1,030 children. 1,030 out of 19,500 verified,- he said.

Slavic spy: a Russian agent leaked data on the artillery of the Armed Forces	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. As the investigation established, the man was recruited by the Russian special services through social networks. The main task of the agent was to identify the positions of the main and reactive artillery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which tracks the assault groups of the invaders in the Slavyansk direction. He also searched for the coordinates of checkpoints on key highways in the region. To collect information, the attacker traveled around the area, secretly recorded the location of the Ukrainian military and transmitted the data to Russian curators through a liaison. He turned out to be a former resident of Lyman, who after the occupation of the city joined the armed groups of the Russian Federation and is currently fighting on the Eastern Front. After the attacks, the agent was supposed to conduct reconnaissance and correct repeated attacks. SBU employees caught the traitor red-handed when he tried to hand over another batch of intelligence.

The commander of the platoon of unmanned aircraft systems of the 92nd separate assault brigade said this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- named after the kosh chieftain Ivan Sirko Mykola with the call sign -Kitty-. — If we take into account the change in weather conditions, the enemy no longer uses frontal attacks, because the shore along the reservoir has become exposed. And moving infantry groups across that shore is almost always a 100% negative for the enemy. So they shifted the vector more towards flanking [attacks],- he said. The military reported that the Russians are trying to storm the area of ​​the settlement of Strelecha of the border Lipetsk community of the Kharkiv district. — Attempts of active assault actions near the settlement of Strelecha. But also the enemy does not experience any strategic results, it is detected by our unmanned systems, artillery systems are used, and the result is always in our favor so far, and it will continue to be so, - said the commander of the drones. The officer told about the composition of the enemy's forces. — Now motorized rifle units are fighting directly in our direction. We are also currently monitoring the Africa Corps group. These are, in principle, fighters of the former -Wagner group- and the contingent from Syria, who were called to fight the -colonial policy- of the West, he said. The military assessed the level of training and skill of the enemy. — People from the -African Corps- are more prepared, they are ready for adverse weather conditions, for difficult conditions of combat operations. Therefore, we have certain surprises from such guys, he said. However, Ukrainian fighters are also ready for difficult weather conditions. — As for work, this is not the first winter. We adapt to the weather conditions. We know certain types of weapons, namely unmanned systems, which should not be used with quality now. We're low on humanity, we're also low on cloudiness. Therefore, certain types, such as the long-range reconnaissance wings, are currently ineffective. Therefore, we perform these tasks with the help of FPV drones, explained the commander of the drones. He described the tactics used by Ukrainian drone pilots. — We fly out on reconnaissance directly with ammunition, one might say, on a hunt. If the movement of some equipment or manpower is detected, or we simply find something disguised as a result of reconnaissance, then a defeat occurs. If we don't find targets by calling, if we don't see something on this hunt that could be hit, then we simply work on targets already known in advance, so-called planned targets, - he said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the north of Kharkiv Oblast, the occupiers are fighting marginally, needlessly with prisons and North Korea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/11/kolyshni-vagnerivczi-z-syriyi-diyut-na-pivnochi-harkivskoyi-oblasti-okupanty-atakuyut-z-flangiv/	2024-12-11T01:56:44-08:00

This is reported by the Command of the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Especially brutal murder - Article 105. Killed a pedophile who raped a 13-year-old girl from an orphanage. The sentence is 22 years and 3 months of strict regime,- says Danylo. From this term, Usov managed to serve only 1 year. Agitators for the SVO appeared in the colony. He says he didn't want to sign, but was threatened with violence. -One by one, we were brought to the chief's office, where there was a representative from the Russian Armed Forces. Those who refused were proved in the evening that -it will be necessary. They pushed me papers and told me to sign everything,- the Russian continued. Usov signed the contract without hesitation. Propaganda said that they were going to fight against foreign legions and NATO because -there are no more Ukrainians in the Armed Forces.- -For refusing to sign, prisoners were threatened with -press houses-. They assured me that I would not make it to the colony. And after the -press house-, where people were broken, everyone and everything signed,- Danylo added. On the same day after signing the contract, Usov was sent to Barnaul from the pre-trial detention center. There they were dropped off from the bus depots, where other prisoners were already waiting. -We gave out dry rations of water and put them on buses to Novosibirsk. They said that there are two days and you can meet with your relatives. Mom left, but she didn't have time to get there, they told us that we were flying out urgently. We never met. -Mom used to say, 'It would be better for you to sit and not go to SVO,'- said the former prisoner. Usov and other convicts were brought to the first training ground, where they were engaged in construction work for 2 weeks. -They dug, sawed, built, laid electricity. There was no training. I've been building cars because that's what I know. Once they were taken to the training ground, but only because television came. They gave out 15 rounds per machine gun, like we are training here,- Danylo noted. Usov broke his leg during one of these -training sessions- at the Zoryanyi training ground near Luhansk. He says that prisoners were shot and thrown with grenades. This is how the instructors instilled courage in the newly minted fighters. Three weeks later, they were sent to a training ground in the Kursk region. There, they were taken to an abandoned factory, where they passed a medical examination, worked on racks, and disassembled weapons. Over the course of a month, prisoners were transferred to different villages of the Kursk region. In one of them, Usov and other paratroopers were pelted with drops from drones. For several days, Usov, along with other wounded convicts, hid in the basements until they were captured by Ukrainian paratroopers. -Our commanders abandoned us. The boys and I assumed that in this way, when we were working, our command calculated the enemy's artillery. Each prisoner, on the eve of the military exit, was issued one grenade for suicide. They said that it is impossible to surrender to captivity. One fellow blew himself up, but I couldn't. -I probably didn't have enough courage,- said the Russian. As reported by ArmyInform, the fighters of the 80th Halych Assault Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces repelled another unsuccessful enemy assault and took captured 11 Russians from the 11th Assault Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/11/ubyv-pedofila-zmusyly-jty-na-svo-daly-granatu-dlya-samogubstva-istoriya-polonenogo-rosiyanyna/	2024-12-10T23:37:52-08:00

Miracle armored personnel carrier of the Viking marines: how amphibious all-terrain vehicles are use...	The BvS-10 (short for Bandvagn Skyddad, -protected tracked vehicle-) is a Swedish-British tracked amphibious armored personnel carrier. In service with the Marines since 2023. This technique was transferred by Great Britain. Amphibious all-terrain vehicles consist of two parts: the first car is for the commander, driver-mechanic and gunner, the second is for transporting the landing party. Accommodates up to 12 people. The machines have excellent maneuverability, are able to overcome water obstacles and operate in flooded areas. This is possible thanks to the wide rubber track (has a Kevlar insert), which is not heavy on the swamp, and on the sand of the APC. There is an automatic transmission, it moves quite quickly on dry land, accelerates to 70 km/h. The guys tried more - they took 75 km/h. Of course, overcoming water obstacles is much slower - 5 km/h. It dives into the water at 1.25 m and moves there with the help of caterpillars. The Viking is well armored, equipped with a 12.7mm Browning M2 machine gun and special grenade launchers to create smoke screens. The combat module rotates 180 degrees, also protected by an armor plate. The equipment is very light and convenient to use. Cummins turbocharged diesel engine produces 285 horsepower. The mechanical power of the engine is transmitted to the rear of the car, meaning it is fully four-wheel drive. The weight of the front link is 5000 kg and the rear link is 3500 kg. Unlike our MTLB and BMP, these machines are much simpler and more economical. Fuel consumption 6.7 liters per 100 km. Like a normal car. The range is 500 km. That's quite a lot. Our mechanics-drivers mastered this miracle of technology for more than a month at the training ground in Great Britain. Tactical and technical characteristics, equipment and combat capabilities were studied in detail. Theory, followed by practical training in all weather conditions. Driving lessons are the base. British instructors showed all the technical intricacies and features of armored vehicles. They taught the basics of -first aid repair-. Of course, marines consolidated their knowledge on tests. Plus, auxiliary courses on improving work on this technique are periodically organized in Ukraine. When the brigade fought in the Kherson direction, Viking was used less for its intended purpose. Here, in Donetsk region, these machines are already in full use. -The tasks are diverse: delivery of amphibious combat groups through difficult terrain and their landing, including overcoming water obstacles, evacuation of the wounded from the battlefield, delivery of provisions and water. They even carry ammunition. Our engineers also had to deliver explosives to the area of ​​combat missions. In short, everything that can be delivered to the front edge of our guys, we deliver. Due to the small dimensions of the armored personnel carrier, it is inconspicuous, the enemy often does not see it because of plantings or large bushes. Once the amphibious all-terrain vehicles were attacked by the Russians with their FPV drones: -They hit the landing compartment, but the machine continued to move and, most importantly, no one was hurt. I believe that MTLB could hardly withstand this blow. Not to mention the amount of shrapnel that comes in during shelling. Katsaps try to hit APCs with mines, but usually they do not hit on target. A meter or two from the cars.- -Of course, there have already been cases when several cars were hit, but the crews remained completely unharmed. Somehow I even remember: there was a collision with an anti-tank mine and no one was hurt. Imagine! Did anyone even have a concussion? The Viking rink was only damaged, so he could not go any further. Then the next car left and picked up the boys. They independently all plunged into the amphibious landing and evacuated. The armor is solid so far. Of course, if there is a direct hit by a large-caliber projectile, you understand.- In order for the knocked-out APC to burn completely, the Katsapas used as many as 10 FPV drones. That's 10 direct hits to completely destroy the tech. -Bird- says: there are no particular problems with spare parts. -If necessary, the British deliver them to Ukraine. They have a lot of such equipment under conservation there. They send tracks, engines, other mechanisms. We repair cars in our repair units.- What's interesting? According to the crew of the machine, due to its compactness, the Viking is less likely to be blown up by mines. The secret is that the limited weight is distributed over the wide surface of the rubber tracks, making mines less likely to detonate. This is the survivability of these APCs. -For example. Again, the track on the MTLB is not wide and there is a much greater load on the mine. That's why there was an explosion there immediately.- Vyacheslav is 36 years old, originally from Pervomaisk, Mykolaiv region. Awarded the Order -For Courage III degree-. In the army since the beginning of the large-scale invasion. -In Mykolaiv, they were just recruiting for the marines. It was necessary to form units to support our troops in the Mariupol region. I am a sergeant, I have a term of service in the internal troops. At first he got into the reserve company of the 36th Marine Brigade. They worked in the Volnovakha district. He fought in 2022 in various places of the Volnovasky district. He got into the environment with his brothers. Lost connection. Russian equipment and occupiers were already all around. It was possible to get out and join other marine units. In the 38th brigade since 2023, he received a promotion to the rank of officer and the opportunity to lead an airborne assault company. We ask: for which combat episode was awarded the Order -For Courage III degree-. -Bird- replies: -This is a collective award from all the guys in my unit. Their heroism is incredible. At that time, the intensity of hostilities in Mariintka, Pisky, and Vodyan was such that every day and everyone in the positions could be awarded orders. No one felt sorry for themselves and, in general, often, unfortunately, did not count with life.- &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/11/chudo-btr-morpihiv-viking-yak-na-fronti-vykorystovuyut-vsyudyhody-amfibiyi/	2024-12-10T21:03:36-08:00
Armored monster on the water: the Korean car manufacturer will create the most modern tank	Not without a certain amount of boasting declared by the development company, this next-generation main battle tank surpasses all capabilities of modern MBTs, providing more effective performance tasks with the help of the latest technologies for future warfare, ArmiyaInform reports. As considered by the experts of the defense portal Army Recognition, a collaboration between Hyundai Rotem, the Development Agency of Defense of the Republic of Korea and the Korea Research Institute for Defense Technology Planning and Improvement is a significant technological breakthrough that brings the country closer to the introduction of hydrogen vehicles for military purposes. The K3 is expected to be equipped with hydrogen fuel cells, advanced electric motors and batteries, making it an environmentally friendly alternative to diesel engines. This innovative system not only reduces emissions, but also allows the tank to operate almost silently, greatly increasing its stealth capabilities, a significant strategic advantage in modern warfare. The expected design of the K3 offers significant performance advantages, including the ability to navigate difficult terrain and steep slopes. In addition to the hydrogen fuel cells, the tank will have a 130 mm smoothbore gun, which is a significant upgrade from the K2's 120 mm gun, improving its firepower. Hyundai Rotem also revealed plans to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into the tank's fire control system. This neural network-based feature aims to improve the K3's aiming and accuracy capabilities, giving it an edge in pre-emptive strikes and rapid threat assessment on the battlefield. Production of the all-hydrogen K3 tank is planned for 2040. As an interim solution, Hyundai Rotem will initially present a hybrid model combining diesel and hydrogen systems. This transition phase will allow the South Korean military to take advantage of some of the benefits of hydrogen technology in preparation for a full transition to this energy source. Hyundai Rotem officials confirmed that this hybrid version will soon be put into service, supporting South Korea's strategic goals of reducing emissions while maintaining reliable military performance. The development of the K3 tank is in line with the wider trend towards the use of hydrogen fuel in the global defense and transport sectors. Hyundai, already recognized for pioneering work in the field of fuel cells, is expanding its expertise in military technology by contributing to the development of hydrogen-based mobile solutions. For example, the company has previously worked with Chinese firm WeRide on autonomous water-powered vehicles. Similarly, in the United States, advances in hydrogen technology are making waves in commercial and military maritime transport, with projects such as -Sea Change-, the first hydrogen ferry approved by the US Coast Guard, which is soon to be launched in San Francisco. A hydrogen fuel cell works by converting hydrogen and oxygen into electricity, water and heat through an electrochemical reaction. It consists of three main components: anode, cathode and electrolyte. The hydrogen stored in the tank is injected into the anode, where it is split into protons and electrons with the help of catalysis. Protons pass through the electrolyte to reach the cathode, while electrons unable to cross the electrolyte travel through the outer circuit, generating a useful electrical current. On the other hand, oxygen, which is normally drawn from the air, ends up at the cathode, where it combines with protons and electrons to form water, a net byproduct of this reaction. This technology, which produces only water and heat, provides a sustainable energy source that does not pollute the environment, ideal for applications in vehicles that require low acoustic and heat signatures, such as stealth military operations. In modern military operations, a hydrogen tank would have significant strategic advantages, particularly in terms of stealth, autonomy and operability in a hostile environment. Due to the low temperature signature, the hydrogen tank would be more difficult to detect by infrared surveillance systems, facilitating discrete maneuvers, night patrols and infiltration into enemy rear areas. The increased autonomy of such military equipment will also allow armored units to penetrate deeper into enemy territory without frequent refueling, which is a valuable opportunity in areas with complex logistics supply chains. In addition, producing only water vapor with no polluting emissions will make the tank resistant to degraded or polluted environments typical of war-torn urban and industrial areas. By reducing dependence on fossil fuels, this type of vehicle will ease logistical requirements and protect supply lines, which are often vulnerable to targeted enemy attacks. Finally, the silent operation of hydrogen technology will provide a decisive advantage for ambushes or defense in wooded or urban areas, allowing the tank to remain undetected until combat. Thus, the hydrogen tank can meet the unique challenges of today's conflict, offering a combination of caution, autonomy and environmental resilience that will greatly enhance operational capabilities on the ground. Projects on the development of hydrogen military vehicles are gaining momentum around the world, although South Korea is at the forefront with its K3 tank. Other countries and defense companies are also exploring the potential of hydrogen for military applications, although efforts are generally less advanced than Hyundai Rotem's. In the United States, the military is evaluating the viability of hydrogen as part of its Next Generation Combat Vehicle program (NGCV). General Motors Defense, for example, has developed a prototype ZH2 , a hydrogen-powered all-terrain vehicle designed for the US Army. This model aims to test the stealth and autonomy of hydrogen technology for defense missions. In addition, BAE Systems and Oshkosh Defense, two major defense contractors, are also exploring hybrid and hydrogen technologies for future applications, although for now they are mainly focused on hybrid vehicles. In Europe, the MGCS (Main Ground Combat System) program, which is detailed told our editors in one of their publications and which jointly led by Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) and Nexter, is the flagship project for the development of the future European main battle tank. However, it is still at the specification stage: hybrid and hydrogen options are being considered to reduce emissions and increase stealth. Rheinmetall, another major player involved in the high-profile project, is also exploring alternative propulsion solutions, but a final decision on the Germans' implementation of hydrogen technology has yet to be made. Japan is also interested in hydrogen fuel cells for armored vehicles through Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The industrial conglomerate is exploring the possibility of using hydrogen technology for its future battle tanks, responding to the Japanese Ministry of Defense's requirements for solutions that increase autonomy while reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is focusing primarily on prototypes and performance testing in difficult terrain to evaluate the applicability of hydrogen in its combat vehicles. Israel is another potential player interested in the benefits of hydrogen for missions that require low acoustic and thermal signatures. Israeli companies such as Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) are conducting research into stealth defense vehicles and are considering alternative power solutions to meet the specific needs of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), although no formal hydrogen programs are currently was launched. Summarizing the analysis of the arms market, it is believed that although several countries and defense companies are actively engaged in research into new power technologies to reduce the impact of military equipment on the environment, few of them have made hydrogen an immediate priority. The Hyundai Rotem K3 project puts South Korea at the forefront of hydrogen-powered battle tank development, offering a roadmap for other countries. This innovation could prompt European, American and Asian players such as BAE Systems, General Motors Defense, KMW, Nexter and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to accelerate their own hydrogen programs as they continue to explore the technology's potential for military realities. The company Hyundai Rotem from the Republic of Korea is engaged in the development of the newest main battle tank K3.

Was -Funny-, but became -Smiley-. The story of a tanker whose life was saved by his mother's call	How to go through the path of an artilleryman, an infantryman and eventually become a tankman in a short period of time, and what advantages the Leopard 1A5 has on the battlefield, a serviceman told the correspondent of ArmiyaInform. Serhii entered the Armed Forces of Ukraine two months before the start of the large-scale invasion — in December 2021. -I wanted to go to the military service. My grandfather told me since childhood that every man should serve. But I didn't have time for the fall draft. And I had a choice. Either wait for the spring of 2022 or go for a contract. I signed the contract,- recalls Smiley. Sergey became an artilleryman in the 72nd separate mechanized brigade. At the beginning of the invasion, he defended Kyiv region. In particular, he participated in the battles for Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel. -The first tangible moment was February 27, 2022. We then worked at the SAU. A rocket flew about 5 meters from her. I don't know what it is, but it's very powerful. I was lucky then. For some reason, I really wanted to call my mother. I left to pick her up, and at that very moment it flew by. A funnel formed 2 by 4 meters,- Smailik recalls. After Kyiv region, there were battles in the East. First in the Bakhmut direction, then in the Ugledar direction. -I received the first wound in the direction of Bakhmut. I was in the infantry at that time. The tank and the BMP worked on our position. A shell hit a tree above us. And the debris hit me. I stayed in the hospital for a week and then came back. Later we were transferred to Ugledar. And there, during one fire contact, a VOG flew behind me from the -undertray-, says Serhiy. After treatment, Serhiy was transferred to mortars. And later he got into the 44th separate mechanized brigade, which was being formed at that time. He was supposed to be a mortarman there, but it turned out differently. -A certain number of people were retrained as tanker drivers. Sent to study in Germany. It lasted for 2 months. After that, they returned, got the equipment and went to Kharkiv region,- says Serhiy. -Smileyk- affectionately calls his car a kitty. He says that at first it was difficult, because everything is new and unclear. However, already during the battles, the tankers quickly gained experience and consolidated their skills: -Already now, when leaving the position, we only need 2 minutes to work out 13 essential shells and then roll back. Most often we work in dugouts and trenches. They worked on tanks, armored personnel carriers, BMPs. A friendly crew once left to work on an enemy tank. They hit with the first shot. It was, I think, a T-90.- All in all, if everything is set up and calibrated correctly, the Leopard 1A5 is a very accurate gun. -We had a moment - at a distance of 3.5 kilometers, our gunner hit a machine gun DOT. The projectile flew right into the window,- recalls Serhiy. In addition, the tank is equipped with high-quality aiming devices, which are also used on the more modern Leopard 2. -Once it happened that they went to work in the Kupyansk direction. We reach the firing position, and the gunner says: -I see a tablet.- That is, he saw in the crosshairs through the night vision system that one of the Russians was sitting and clicking something on the tablet. Well, they started to -pour- right there,- recalls Serhiy. Because of its origin, the tank constantly attracts the attention of the enemy, says -Smileyk-. And as soon as he is noticed, the hunt for him begins. The most enemies are in the sky. In particular, these are FPV drones and Lancets. Although active armor, -barbecues- and EW devices have appeared on the cars, this does not always help. Therefore, tankers try to do everything as quickly as possible. -Leopard 1A5 helps a lot in this regard. They are very maneuverable. Much more -lively- than Soviet tanks. There was a moment when we shot back and the enemy started working on us. We started to roll back. Usually the tank accelerates to 60 kilometers per hour. But here the mechanic-driver gained more speed. He shouts at me: -Smiley, I'm going 67 kilometers!-. In addition to speed and maneuverability, the tank also has armor. In particular, the Leopard 1A5 -Smileyka- withstood the impact of two anti-tank missiles. -Last year, when we were working with direct fire, 2 ATGMs flew into the -mask- on the tower. But the tank survived. We were still able to leave on it. The crew was injured. But everyone survived,- Serhiy says. During Serhiy's service, not only his specialty changed, but also his call sign. At first, while in the infantry, he received the nickname -Funny-. Although the situation at that time was not at all fun, says a serviceman: -We are lying in a trench, and they are working on us with everything they have. It was so scary that it was a slipper. Also, in the morning and until the evening, the enemy constantly tried to approach in order to engage in fire contact. Well, I thought that it was necessary to at least somehow raise the spirits of my fellow citizens. And he began to make various jokes about the fact that the Russians still cannot hit us. Then they told me I was funny. And that's how it stuck. And when I was transferred to mortars, they asked for my call sign. He said that -Funny-. But there was a foreman who called him something else - -Smiley-. -Smailyk- speaks succinctly, but without hesitation, about his motivation to serve in the ZSU: -I would rather be here than the enemy would be at my home.- I would rather die than have the enemy do anything to my family. No one here fights for deputies, politicians. Everyone fights to protect their family.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/11/buv-smishnyj-a-stav-smajlykom-istoriya-tankista-yakomu-vryatuvav-zhyttya-dzvinok-materi/	2024-12-10T20:32:32-08:00
The situation is under control: the Russian army simply imagined that it had breached the border in ...	In fact, this information is not true, and the situation at the border remains under control. Andriy Demchenko, the spokesman of the State Security Service of Ukraine, stated this on the air of the Kyiv24 TV channel: -The positions held by the border guards are not located directly along the border line. But if we talk about that aspect, then the border units did not record any attempts to enter, nor any attempts at hostilities. The area there is characterized by wetlands, so it will be difficult for the enemy to gain a foothold there or develop their actions.- Andriy Demchenko noted that directly on the territory of Russia, in the Kursk region, the enemy is trying to advance in order to knock our forces out of their positions. The Sumy OVA also denied the information about the alleged -breach of the border- by the Russians: -Currently, there are no data from the military regarding the change in the situation at the border, the situation is under control,- said the head of the administration, Volodymyr Artyukh. It should always be remembered that the border line with Russia is actually the front line, where our Defense Forces hold their positions to counter any enemy attempts to enter our territory. The Defense Forces of Ukraine call on citizens to trust only official sources of information and not to succumb to enemy manipulations aimed at destabilizing the situation in the region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/11/sytuacziya-kontrolovana-prosto-armiya-rf-uyavyla-shho-prorvala-kordon-na-sumshhyni/	2024-12-10T20:12:58-08:00

The horrors of the occupation in Izyum: two Russians who tortured the mother of a Ukrainian law enfo...	The Office of the Prosecutor General informs about this on December 10. The suspects are the assistant shooter of the grenade launcher of the 1st rifle division of the 3rd rifle platoon of the 1st rifle platoon of the 3rd rifle company of the 204th rifle battalion of the -DNR- regiment and the commander of the intelligence group 607 of the special purpose center of the North Caucasus District of the Federal Service of the National Guard of the Russian Federation. According to the investigation, in July 2022 in Izyum, the suspects together with other occupants broke into the house where a woman - the mother of an active Ukrainian law enforcement officer - lived. They detained her and took her to the torture chamber set up on the territory of the railway hospital. -DNR militant systematically raped a woman and committed sexual acts against her. In addition, he exerted psychological pressure on the woman: he threatened to kill her, as well as strip her completely, tie her in the square, take a photo and send the photo to his son, a law enforcement officer,- the report states. During one of the interrogations, the occupiers attached wires to the victim's legs and turned on the current. The victim was in severe physical pain, fell to the floor several times, but was forced to stand up and repeatedly shocked. -Also, the occupiers put handcuffs on the woman's hands, a gas mask on her face, hung her handcuffs from the ceiling and beat her with a belt. The suspects held the victim in a torture chamber from July 1 to July 10, 2022. During the period of illegal imprisonment due to the inflicted mental injuries, the woman attempted suicide,- the law enforcement officers said. The issue of declaring wanted suspects is being resolved. The identification of all the occupants involved in the crime is ongoing. Two occupiers were informed in absentia of the suspicion of cruel treatment of the civilian population and committing other violations of the laws and customs of war by a group of persons in a previous conspiracy (Part 2 of Article 28, Part 1 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine).

-For money? No!-: a woman from Lviv tried to pay a bribe for illegal travel abroad	About this reports State Border Service of Ukraine. The woman was looking for clients on the Internet, offering her services for an amount from 7 to 10 thousand US dollars. One of these clients was a 43-year-old man from Lviv who was planning to leave for Spain. The organizer received $10,000 from him and promised to assist in illegal border crossing. The woman planned to hand over part of the money, namely 7 thousand dollars, to the border guard of the 7th Carpathian border detachment. However, the employee refused the bribe and reported the crime to the competent authorities. The organizer was detained while trying to transfer money. She has already been informed of the suspicion under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: ch. 1 Art. 369 (granting an undue benefit to an official) and ch. 3 Art. 332 (illegal transportation of persons across the state border of Ukraine).

Propaganda hero and informant: Gauleiter from Kozachai Lopan was exposed	Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. According to the investigation, in March 2022, the accused, who previously worked in the internal affairs bodies of Ukraine, and later in the -militia- of the so-called -LPR-, arrived in the village of Kozacha Lopan in the temporarily occupied part of the Kharkiv region.

Occupation budget: -lnr- exists at the expense of Russian handouts	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. According to the draft budget, the revenues of the so-called -LNR- are planned to be 144.8 billion rubles. Of these, 92.6 billion rubles, or almost two-thirds, are interbudgetary transfers from the Russian budget. The rest of the income, including subsidies and subsidies, provides only a little more than 50 billion rubles. The largest source of own revenues remains the tax on the income of individuals - it forms 83.4% of this part of the budget. However, the arrival of investors that could improve the economic situation has not yet been observed. In addition, the Russian authorities established control over the housing and communal economy of the occupied Luhansk Region. Until 2028, non-governmental organizations are prohibited from managing apartment buildings. All functions in this area have been transferred to Russian state organizations, despite the possible objections of local residents. These facts once again demonstrate that the occupied territories remain economically unsustainable and completely dependent on external funding from Russia. As reported by ArmyInform, in occupied Aydar (former Novopskov) ->Russian troops continue raids and restrict exit from the settlement. In particular, three exits from the city remain closed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/okupaczijnyj-byudzhet-lnr-isnuye-za-rahunok-rosijskyh-podachok/	2024-12-10T10:47:40-08:00

The overthrow of the Assad regime in Syria: significance for Ukraine	This is how the more than half-century rule of the Assad family ended in Syria and one of the important stages of the civil war that has been going on since 2011. About the significance of the overthrow of the Assad regime for Ukraine, we talk to Oleksandr Chupak, an expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Studies-: -Syrian opposition forces succeeded in triumphantly realizing -Aleppo in three days- and -Damascus in eleven days-. They drove the Assad family out of the country, which had held power for 53 years. Syria was and remains a theater of war, where two states hostile to Ukraine are actively involved: Russia and Iran. They have both invested significant resources in Syria, making it a testing ground for modern warfare tactics. However, recently the focus of their attention has shifted to other directions: Russia has stalled on the fronts against Ukraine, and Iran is waging an active proxy war against Israel. In fact, in Syria, the scenario of Afghanistan in 2021 was repeated, when the hopes of the foreign contingent on the local armed forces completely failed. In the case of Syria, the government troops surrendered the territories to the opposition even faster than the Afghans to the Taliban,- says Oleksandr Chupak. Russia, the main ally of the Assad regime, did not provide him with the necessary assistance at a critical moment. Despite the fact that Putin threatened in 2017 that -if the terrorists raise their heads, we will deal them such blows that they have not seen before,- and Moscow Patriarch Kirill said in 2015 that -the Russian operation in Syria will lead the Russian Federation away from any - what evil-. Now, apparently, evil has approached the Russian Federation again. -For Russia, Syria is an important logistics center, in fact, the only unimpeded exit to the Mediterranean Sea through the port of Tartus. This path guarantees Moscow access to the Balkans and North Africa, where Muscovites traditionally have a significant presence. Depriving Russia of Syrian ports would mean weakening, if not losing, its contact with spheres of influence in the said territories. And while the Russian-Ukrainian war continues, the Kremlin will not have access to the Mediterranean either through the Bosphorus or through Gibraltar. The failure in Syria is evidence that the war against Ukraine is draining Russian resources. In previous years, it was the presence of Moscow's private military companies with air support that allowed Assad's army to control most of the major cities without any apparent risk of losing them. Now, due to the need to transfer forces to Ukraine, the government army is left alone against its enemies. There is a widespread opinion that the elimination of Yevgeny Prigozhin, formerly the main organizer of the Russian PMK, was fatal for the Syrian contingent. Of course, the failure in Syria does not mean that Russia will immediately fall on other fronts. However, it demonstrates that the Russian military machine is not all-powerful and is capable of collapsing under the blows of well-armed and organized troops. The logical continuation of the Syrian scenario should be the expulsion of Russia from other places where it has a military presence: Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Africa and, ultimately, from the territories occupied by it, which are now part of the Russian Federation (Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, and many others).- Oleksandr Chupak notes. Now the events in Syria are developing dynamically - the Russians are withdrawing their troops, and Israeli armored units, on the contrary, have crossed the demarcation line on the Golan Heights and are advancing towards Damascus. Oleksandr Chupak is sure that the establishment of a Western-friendly regime in Syria will contribute to the establishment of trade in energy carriers between the countries of the Persian Gulf, Turkey and Europe. And the laying of the pipeline here will allow many countries to finally abandon Russian oil.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/povalennya-rezhymu-asada-v-syriyi-znachennya-dlya-ukrayiny/	2024-12-10T09:01:17-08:00

Electric current, pipes and threats: a Ukrainian woman tricked the people of Akhmativ and escaped fr...	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. This time it is about Magomed Uzdorbiyev, a fighter of the special rapid reaction unit of the Rosguard -Akhmat-. At the beginning of the full-scale war, his unit took part in the capture of the village of Makiivka, Svativ district, Luhansk region. In order to establish an occupation regime there, the Rashists carried out so-called -clearances-, which were accompanied by the kidnapping of local residents and the looting of private property. According to the investigation, on April 12, 2022, a group of -Kadyrivets-, which included Uzdorbiev, broke into the residence of the local headman. After the occupiers found patriotic pro-Ukrainian photos on her computer, they tied the woman up and took her to a torture chamber set up in a captured gymnasium on the territory of the community. In the cells, Uzdorbiev together with his accomplices tortured the victim with electric current and beat her with a metal plastic pipe. Then the Rashists kept the woman handcuffed to the battery for several hours. During the torture, the -Kadyrov- demanded that she provide them with the residential addresses of the families of Ukrainian defenders. Also, the person involved -knocked out- from the victim information about the places where she hid the Ukrainian flags that she took from the gymnasium during the capture of the village. Late in the evening, the occupiers let the woman go home so that she could collect the -necessary- information for them under the threat of death within a two-day period. However, the victims managed to secretly get out of the village to the territory controlled by Ukraine, without providing the occupiers with any information about the Ukrainian soldiers and their families. Forensic medical examination confirmed that the victims suffered severe injuries as a result of torture. On the basis of the received evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed Uzdorbiev of the suspicion for h. 2 Art. 28, ch. 1 Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (cruel treatment of the civilian population and other violations of the laws and customs of war committed by a group of persons in a previous conspiracy). Comprehensive measures are underway to find and punish the war criminal.

The horror of Syrian torture camps: the President of Ukraine compared the regimes of Assad and Putin	He wrote about this in his Telegram channel. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the Assad regime relied exclusively on violence for decades, and Russia uses the same methods. The President emphasized that the Russian occupiers created similar torture chambers and prisons in every occupied territory of Ukraine. Atrocities began in Crimea in 2014, when repressions affected Crimean Tatars, journalists and politicians. Later, similar practices spread to Donbas, in particular in the infamous Isolation prison, and after a large-scale invasion in 2022, they became even larger and more brutal. The president emphasized that Assad and Putin are not just vassals and overlords, but accomplices in violence. Dictators like Assad cannot survive without the support of dictators like Putin, who, according to Volodymyr Zelenskyi, will surely seek revenge for the fall of Assad. -There must be punishment for terrible atrocities and violations of human rights. In fact, Putin and Assad should end up in prison, not those innocent people whom they have been imprisoning for years,- the head of state emphasized. The President called on the international community to unite and support Ukraine in the fight against the Russian dictatorship, stressing that this will help protect other regions of the world from violence. As reported by ArmyInform, for the retreat from the Syrian Republic Russians attracted a caravan of military transport ships, on which the remnants of troops, weapons and military equipment are loaded techniques	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/zhahy-syrijskyh-kativen-prezydent-ukrayiny-porivnyav-rezhymy-asada-i-putina/	2024-12-10T06:49:26-08:00

About this on the broadcast of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- the spokesman of the OTU -Kharkiv- told - lieutenant colonel Yevhenii Romanov. According to Yevgeny Romanov, it's all because they are trying to advance where their artillery and aviation have already worked. It is difficult for them to maintain defense in these destroyed areas. The defense forces, on the other hand, effectively destroy the attack aircraft. -It is very difficult for them to bring ammunition supplies there. Replace people. Evacuation of the wounded. The dead are not even mentioned. And getting new forces there is another task, since they move on foot, they do not use armored vehicles,- said the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU. Armored vehicles are not used, in particular, also because this resource is limited. As is the human resource. -Professional soldiers are worn out in 10 years of war. They already use such a resource that they have caught or lured with money, collected from prisons. This is not an army, this is a meeting place,- Yevgeny Romanov said. Earlier ArmyInform reported, in the Kharkiv direction, the enemy is storming in the districts of Staritsa, Tykhoi, Vovchansk and in the direction Cossack Lopan.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/ne-vijsko-a-zbigovysko-okupanty-voyuyut-marginalamy-nepotrebom-z-tyurem-ta-pivnichnoyi-koreyi/	2024-12-10T06:11:47-08:00
Losing contact and getting lost: how Russians avoid participating in -meat-attacks	This was reported on the Army TV stream by the commander of the fire support company of the 5th Kyiv Assault Brigade Mykola Zinko. -Very often such interceptions happen, when the Russians refuse to go on the attack, and they are forced. They say that they will be -zeroed- if they go back. Such people later get lost somewhere, turn off their walkie-talkies, they try to find them, because if one does not leave, the others also start to refuse,- said Mykola Zinko. According to him, Russians are greatly affected by the sad fate of those who went on assaults earlier. -They understand that the previous group went to the same end, we destroyed it, that's why their motivation disappears,- Mykola Zinko said.

In Zhytomyr Oblast, criminals were detained who demanded money from a wounded soldier for -obschak-	reported this on December 10 Office of the Prosecutor General According to the investigation, a man who has a criminal record for robbery attack, organized a scheme to extort money from a wounded serviceman. He involved his acquaintance and the victim's neighbor. The suspects learned that the Ukrainian defender received monetary compensation for a serious injury in the war zone. Currently, the soldier is undergoing rehabilitation at home and his wife is taking care of him. They understood that the man's legs were injured, so he would not be able to resist. Accomplices came to the couple's home late in the evening and demanded to hand over $3,000 to the so-called -thieves' club-. In case of refusal, they threatened with physical violence. For two weeks, the suspects put psychological pressure on the victims, came with a knife and threatened to kill them. The soldier's wife, fearing for her life, gave them 10,000 hryvnias. After that, a 15-day deadline was set for paying the rest. The law enforcement officers detained the accomplices after handing over the stipulated amount of funds. Their property and mobile phones with evidence of illegal activity were confiscated. All suspects are currently in custody without bail.

Erased to zero, then replaced: Russian reserves stand in line on a huge conveyor belt of death	&nbsp; Oleksandr Borodin, spokesman, told about this on the air of the -Suspilne Novyni- telethon Third Assault Brigade. According to Oleksandr Borodin, the occupiers' grinding of their units in senseless attacks are not separate episodes. This is a conscious strategy. -It should be understood that this is along the entire length of the front - they are trying to beat exhaustion in this way. And they developed such a reserve mechanism. This is how they built the production of both drones and ammunition in order to constantly take endurance. And see who can hold out longer,- said Oleksandr Borodin. How to ->reported ArmyInform, it is steadily difficult in Kharkiv Oblast—the enemy is rushing the banks of Oskol and Borov. The third assault unit repulses -rolls-, counterattacks and destroys the reserves in the rear of the invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/styrayut-v-nul-a-todi-zaminyuyut-rosijski-rezervy-na-stoyat-u-cherzi-a-velycheznomu-konveyeri-smerti/	2024-12-10T02:37:43-08:00
Checking the roads several times a day: how our fighters fight remote enemy mining	This was reported on the Army TV stream by the commander of the fire support company of the 5th Kyiv Assault Brigade Mykola Zinko. -Very often the Russians use FPV drones to mine our logistics. Enemy drones simply land on the road with ammunition. It can even be a TM-ka (anti-tank mine). But here our sappers work perfectly, and those areas where our logistics routes pass, they pass several times a day,- said Mykola Zinko. According to him, there are also enemy drones that drop -petal- mines on the roads. -They are anti-personnel, but their explosion is quite enough to puncture a tire and the like,- remarked Mykola Zinko. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 5th Kyiv assault brigade hit a Russian bomber RBU-6000 -Smerch-2- in the Kramatorsk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/perevirka-dorig-po-kilka-raziv-na-dobu-yak-nashi-bijczi-boryutsya-z-dystanczijnym-minuvannyam-voroga/	2024-12-10T02:23:29-08:00
Hit in the head - our drones hit either a very dumb or a deaf occupier	The video of combat work was released on December 10 on the brigade's channel. Two Russian soldiers were walking along the road when our FPV drone flew up to them. For some reason, the occupiers did not try to react to him at all: they did not run away and did not evade. Then the drone was able to fly up and hit one of the Russians directly in the head. The second invader, not at all impressed (in every sense of the word), simply moved on. -Sudden death overtook the occupier,- the brigade commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, in the 68th hunting brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush demonstrated three cases of powerful explosions, which sappers were supposed to make it difficult for the enemy to advance.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/udarylo-v-golovu-nashi-dronari-urazyly-abo-duzhe-tupogo-abo-gluhogo-okupanta/	2024-12-10T02:04:14-08:00
Panic escape - for evacuation from Syria, the Russians brought in a whole caravan of planes	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on December 10. Several An-124 and Il-76MD aircraft are scheduled to fly from the Khmeimim airbase on routes to the Ulyanovsk, Chkalovsky and Privolzhsky airfields. Also, the aggressor state attracts additional fleet objects: in particular, the city of Baltiysk was ordered to prepare the dry cargo ship Sparta II and the large landing ship -Alexander Shabalin- for the departure to Tartus. The large amphibious ships of the Northern Fleet of Russia -Alexander Otrakovsky- and -Ivan Green- headed for the Mediterranean Sea. The enemy frigates -Admiral Gorshkov- and -Admiral Golovko- are also participating in the -Syrian retreat- operation. In the port of Tartusa, the Russians are carrying out emergency dismantling of equipment and military property. Several hundred Russian special forces have already arrived there to ensure the safety of the retreat. Probably, the aggressor state is counting on agreements with anti-government forces regarding an unimpeded exit from Syria. Even the representatives of the so-called Moscow diplomacy no longer call the rebel groups against the Assad regime -terrorists-, but demonstrate a neutral, even -sweet- public rhetoric. Meanwhile, frustration and oppression continue among the remnants of the Russian contingent in Syria - Muscovites even express dissatisfaction with their leaders and commanders, in particular with their organizational incompetence. One of the military bases with Russian troops is under siege. As reported by ArmyInform, Volodymyr Zelensky commented on the events in Syria and the presence of the -Wagnerians- in Africa.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/panichna-vtecha-dlya-evakuacziyi-iz-syriyi-rosiyany-zadiyaly-czilyj-karavan-litakiv/	2024-12-10T01:49:44-08:00

Mykola Volokhov, commander, told about this on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- of the -Terra- unit of the 3rd separate assault brigade According to Mykola Volokhov, it is quite normal for the Russians to spend dozens of people to try to capture a normal landing. -The armored vehicles are on fire, the infantry is going to the ground. Unfortunately, the enemy has an extremely large resource. And he does not regret it, it happens that the platoon, and sometimes the company. So that you understand, an infantry platoon is 30 people, an infantry company is 100 people,- said Mykola Volokhov. For the enemy, his infantry is expendable. The enemy command can kill its stormtroopers just to check something. -Just to see what it will be like. If, for example, you try to swim across that Oskil. Try to swim in different ways. Look. And if those infantry are lost, they believe that this is the normal state of affairs,- said the commander of the Terra unit of the 3rd separate assault brigade. As reported ArmyInform, winter only slowed down the Russians a little, but they are now ready to lay a hundred people a day on the battlefield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/bronetehnika-goryt-pihota-jde-na-farsh-na-harkivshhyni-okupanty-po-durnomu-vytrachayut-svoyih/	2024-12-10T01:46:48-08:00

In Cherkasy region, they wanted to throw bombs at a wounded soldier and his volunteer wife	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on December 10. According to the results of a special operation in the region, a criminal group was neutralized, which tried to blow up volunteers right in their house with the help of improvised explosive devices. According to the case materials, the motive for the attempt was the refusal of the victims to pay the fictitious debt for repair work in their house. To commit the crime, the perpetrators prepared 4 improvised explosive devices, which they equipped with gunpowder, nuts and ignition cords. In the future, they planned to throw explosives into the bedroom where the volunteers were supposed to rest. The security service exposed the criminal group in time and arrested two of its members red-handed when they were preparing to break into the victims' homes. During the searches, improvised explosive devices, components for making explosives and mobile phones with evidence of the crime were seized from the suspects. Currently, two organizers of the group have already been notified of suspicion under part. 3 Art. 15, ch. 2 Art. 115 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (premeditated murder committed by a group of persons according to a prior conspiracy).

-Half a hundred of those who are not spared are thrown to the ground-: the enemy does not stop storm...	Oleksandr Danylenko, head of group of interaction with the media of the brigade of the State Border Service -Hart-. According to Oleksandr Danylenko, it is absolutely impossible to let them do this. After all, if the occupiers cross the Vovcha River, it will create the prerequisites for their further advance in the Kupyan direction. And that is why there are constant assaults in Vovchansk. -About ten every day. And the enemy attacks in small groups, and so-called meat assaults. They throw, relatively speaking, half a hundred of those who don't feel sorry for it - and maybe they will manage to capture some such locations,- said the head of the media interaction group of the State Border Service -Hart- brigade. If such one-time attack aircraft manage to capture positions, follow them more professional fighters are coming. -They are covered by artillery, mortars, and the same drones. But these attempts are unsuccessful, unsuccessful. The enemy is trying to make his way through the ruins of what is left of the city, but they are already waiting for him,- assured Oleksandr Danylenko. How ArmyInform reported that the situation in the Vovchan direction is stable and tense.

Fake diagnoses, bogus marriages, personal escorts - the most popular schemes of crossing the border ...	The State Bureau of Investigation reported this on December 10. Statistics of criminal proceedings show that illegal schemes for transporting people across the state border are mainly created by officials, employees of the TCC, MSEK, doctors and law enforcement officers. Most often, criminals use the mechanism of removal from military registration due to fake diagnoses of unfitness for military service. Also, the employees of the DBR began to identify cases where they tried to make money from conscripts directly at the checkpoints. Personal escort services to the border, sham marriages, etc. appeared. During the investigation of such proceedings, only the amount of documented bribes amounted to UAH 11.4 million. In fact, the amounts are much higher and will be established during the investigation. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/pidrobleni-diagnozy-lypovi-odruzhennya-osobystyj-suprovid-nazvani-najpopulyarnishi-shemy-perepravlennya-cherez-kordon/	2024-12-09T23:46:58-08:00

The most famous Middle Eastern -heavyweight-: Israeli gunsmiths improve their drone	As stated in a statement on the official portal of this aerospace giant, combining UAV characteristics and missiles, the Harop has long been a formidable barrage munition equipped to hunt high-value targets such as unmanned surface ships, command points, supply depots, tanks and air defense systems, ArmyInform reports. Using an electro-optical homing head and no pre-reconnaissance plans, the Harop has a 9-hour airborne endurance to search for targets in a defined area, locate and identify them, plan an attack route, and then strike from any direction, shallow or steep diving At the same time, according to the data developers of kamikaze drones, Harop overcomes difficulties in communicating with control points thanks to its immunity to GNSS jamming. As a guided weapon system, Harop is controlled by man-in-the-loop remote control and its combat mission can be interrupted if necessary. Launched from containers mounted on trucks or naval vessels, the Harop is easily deployed in a variety of terrains and environments. One of the key features of the Harop is its homing system. It is equipped with electro-optical and infrared sensors that allow you to find targets in difficult weather conditions and at night. As soon as the target is identified, the drone heads towards it, destroying it by detonating the built-in warhead. AI Harop has impressive technical parameters that make it versatile: — Flight range: up to 1000 km. — Flight time: 6 hours. — Maximum speed: 417 km/h. — Weight of the warhead: 16 kg. - Hit accuracy: less than 5 meters error. These characteristics make the Harop effective against a wide range of targets, including radars, command posts, armored vehicles and ships. IAI Harop has already entered the armed forces of countries such as Israel, India, Azerbaijan, Singapore and Morocco. Its capabilities are valued for high accuracy and flexibility in modern warfare. In addition to the basic version, there is a smaller Mini Harop model, which is designed for tasks at shorter distances and is more compact. Barrage munitions such as the Harop are becoming increasingly popular due to their cost effectiveness. Unlike traditional missiles or drones, these UAVs are able to stay in the conflict zone for a long time, waiting for the right opportunity to strike. This greatly increases their tactical value. Barrage munitions, such as Harop, are becoming part of a global trend towards the development of autonomous weapons systems. They provide a strategic advantage on the battlefield, minimizing personnel risks and increasing the accuracy of strikes. In the coming years, it can be expected that their use will only expand and technologies will improve, making these systems an even more important part of the arsenals of the leading military states.

Danish F-16s — after Syria to Ukraine: where they fought - Fighting Falcons - Royal Air Force	Where the Danish F-16 Fighting Falcon multi-purpose fighter jets managed to fight before reaching Ukraine, ArmyInform reminds. The first serial -Fighting Falcons- entered service with the Royal Danish Air Force in the spring of 1980. Gradually, they replaced the already significantly outdated at that time second-generation fighters F-100 D/F Super Saber and F-104 Starfighter. By the mid-1980s, they were adopted by four squadrons - 727 and 730 at Skrudstrup Air Base and 723 and 726 at Aalborg Air Base. Subsequently, in 2005, all Danish Fighting Falcons were assembled into 727 and 730 squadrons at Skrudstrup air base. Before the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the main task of the Danish F-16 was the protection of the territory of Denmark and integrated participation in the defense of the countries of Western Europe within the framework of NATO's general strategy. Since the 1990s, the set of tasks of the Royal Danish Air Force has changed significantly. In 1999, the Royal Danish Air Force was reorganized into an -expeditionary- force capable of supporting international operations around the world. Danish combat and transport aircraft began to be deployed and used in a number of international military operations. For the first time, F-16s of the Royal Danish Air Force took part in the NATO bloc's military operation -Allied Force- during the war in Kosovo on the territory of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The operation lasted from March 24 to June 10, 1999 and became the final stage of the Kosovo War. During it, F-16s became the first military aircraft of the Royal Danish Air Force to take direct part in combat operations. At that time, a total of nine F-16 fighters of the Royal Danish Air Force from the 730 squadron took part in the mission of missile-bombing of military facilities on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Before, during and after Operation Allied Force, units from all four squadrons of the Royal Danish Air Force visited the Balkans. Denmark's combat aircraft were based at the Italian Grazzanise Air Base. Soon, Danish F-16s took part in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. In this operation against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in 2001-2003, six -Fighting Falcons- from the 727th squadron took part. Taking off from the territory of Kyrgyzstan, they carried out 743 missions, conducting reconnaissance and bombing terrorist targets. It was at this time that the F-16s proved their unique ability to rapidly deploy and be based almost anywhere in the world. The infrastructure of the airfields (Ganchi, Manas, Kant) of the former Soviet republic, and then also of Afghanistan, turned out to be quite suitable and sufficient for the placement of these fighters. After the accession of the Baltic states to NATO, F-16 fighters of the Royal Danish Air Force took part in patrolling the airspace of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania within the Baltic Air Policing. Based at the Šiauliai International Airport in Lithuania, from July to October 2004, five Battle Falcons flew 48 sorties defending the new members of the North Atlantic Alliance. Subsequently, Danish F-16s took part in the surveillance and protection of the airspace of the Baltic States also in 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2014, and also patrolled the airspace over Iceland in 2009, 2010 and 2015. In 2009, Danish fighters flew over Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Iceland at the same time. In 2011, six Danish F-16s from 727 and 730 squadrons took part in NATO's joint operation -Unified Protector- in Libya. Being stationed at the Sigonella Air Base in Sicily, the fighters of the Royal Danish Air Force flew 599 sorties from March 20 to October 31, 2011, dropping 923 high-precision guided aerial bombs on military targets. In just the first 12 days of the initial Odyssey Dawn operation, Danish F-16s flew 41 sorties and dropped 102 bombs. In total, during Operation Unified Protector, the Danish -Battle Falcons- flew approximately 1,300 sorties. This was about 5% of the total sorties by NATO aircraft, which flew a total of 26,435 sorties. The last combat mission of the Danish F-16 before arriving in Ukraine was the participation in the operation -Inherent Resolve- against the Islamic State (ISIS) in Iraq and Syria. From October 2014 to October 2015, seven Combat Falcons from Denmark were based at Ahmed Al-Jaber Airfield in Kuwait, flying 547 sorties over Iraq and dropping 503 aerial bombs. In the next phase of the fight against ISIS, seven Danish F-16s operated over Iraq and Syria, based at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. From June 17 to October 5, 2016, fighters of the Royal Danish Air Force flew 166 sorties, striking 231 targets. After the Royal Danish Air Force adopted the Combat Falcons, progress significantly accelerated, software and hardware made a significant leap. This led to the need for a technological upgrade of the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The Danish F-16s have undergone significant modernization, largely carried out in cooperation with Danish industry. The Fighting Falcons were updated under the Mid-Life Update program, designed to maintain the effectiveness of existing aircraft in the middle of their service life. Thanks to this, the aircraft that Denmark handed over to Ukraine are significantly technologically improved. Engine improvements give them more power while using less fuel, and new and updated instruments and weapon systems provide better pilotability and weapon accuracy in difficult combat conditions. Currently, even a relatively small number of F-16 Fighting Falcon available in the Air Force of Ukraine -povitryanyh-czilej-zbyly-bojovi-sokoly/->makes a significant contribution to airspace protection country. Thanks to Denmark, the increase in the number of Ukrainian -Combat Falcons- will be able to significantly increase the effectiveness of these combat aircraft in the Ukrainian sky.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/danski-f-16-pislya-syriyi-do-ukrayiny-de-voyuvaly-bojovi-sokoly-korolivskyh-povitryanyh-syl/	2024-12-09T21:01:26-08:00
-I came to the TCC, although I had armor-: about repelling the attack of 15 invaders and the -repair...	How did you manage to repulse the assault near Nevsky in the winter of 2023? But who else from Valery's family has also now joined the defense of Ukraine? The sergeant told our correspondent about this: -I myself came to my TCC on March 6, 2022. Although I, as a railwayman, had armor. Two months passed and my eldest son followed me to serve. From our family, now we are both fighting. I can remember one of the combat episodes. It was in February 2023. It was necessary to repel the attack of the assault group, where there were a lot of occupiers. It was near Nevsky in Donetsk region. At that time, we had already been in those positions for a month. Constant shelling, assaults&#8230; That day again, before the assault, there was heavy shelling. We saw a group of 15 people. They opened fire from small arms on them. At the same time, we adjusted our mortars, they helped us a lot then. The enemy has never attacked us with such a number at the same time. But then we fought back. Although the enemy managed to approach us by 50 meters. In general, during that period it was such that we lost some positions, but over time we still repelled them. And when another unit replaced us, we transferred all the positions we had taken at the beginning, we did not lose a single one. During all this time, I had many injuries. The last time the air ambulance came, it damaged my inner ear, ruptured the eardrum. But already more or less, the doctors repaired it. Now I have transferred to the management of the company as a material support sergeant. Because over time the commander saw in me a manager. In general, before the large-scale invasion, I was a civilian, working on the railways since 2009. He started as a track fitter, then an engineer, and when he entered the war, he was the chief mechanic of the enterprise. Maybe that's why they transferred me to the office, because they saw that I can work with documents and people. I am currently serving as the Battalion Headquarters Logistics Group Officer.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/ya-pryjshov-do-tczk-hocha-j-mav-bron-pro-vidbyttya-ataky-15-okupantiv-ta-vidremontovane-vuho-serzhanta-zaliznychnyka/	2024-12-09T20:31:44-08:00
Kremlin media attacks on the Armed Forces: why the enemy continuously demonizes Ukrainian soldiers	In the draft state budget of the Russian Federation for 2025, more than 137 billion rubles ($1.4 billion) is provided for financing state propaganda, which is 13% more than this year. For comparison: in 2023, this amount was 58 billion rubles ($500 million). Propagandists on different platforms tailor their messages to their target audience. For example, some sites use emotional and negative language, which grossly violates journalistic standards. At the same time, more restrained lexemes and constructions are applied to others. This variety of communication approaches caters to the needs of different categories of readers: for some, open language of hostility is presented, for others, more veiled rhetoric. However, identical messages and images aimed at discrediting Ukraine and Ukrainians are consistently promoted on all platforms. Russian media often -attack- soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Their messages are almost always accompanied by aggressive clarifications about -Nazism- or demonize the fighters, which contributes to the formation of a negative image. In addition to dehumanizing the image of the Ukrainian military, the Russians fuel the rhetoric of -victims- by constantly generating different stories with the same scenarios, where it seems that the Ukrainian military kills, abuses, affects mothers with children, etc. This cements in the mind of the domestic consumer a persistent association that armed forces and violence are identical. Thus, over the past few days, Russian sources have been circulating new batches of fakes about the alleged killings by the Ukrainian military of civilians in Donbas and throwing bodies into wells, about the destruction of drinking water sources, the destruction of churches, etc. Propagandists, of course, do not provide any evidence for these stories. All these publications refer either to the -testimony- of the Russian military, or to the words of residents of the occupied territories, who recount something that they seem to have heard from others. The purpose of such fakes is to discredit the Defense Forces of Ukraine and an attempt to justify their own numerous war crimes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/ataky-kremlivskyh-media-na-zsu-dlya-chogo-vorog-bezperervno-demonizuye-ukrayinskyh-voyiniv/	2024-12-09T20:16:22-08:00

It didn't happen as expected: the thieves of military vehicles wanted money, and now they can get 10...	About this informs December 9, the Security Service of Ukraine. It is noted that all those involved were recruited by the occupiers when they were looking for quick money in Telegram channels. For example, in Kyiv, law enforcement officers arrested two criminals aged 17 and 20 years old who set fire to a military pick-up that was being inspected after completing combat missions in Donetsk region. Also, in the Transcarpathian region, two suspects were arrested who set fire to the administration building of one of the village councils of the Mukachevo district. Then, as a result of the event, the fire damaged the door and window of the state institution. -After that, the attackers tried to burn the generator that powers the mobile operator's base station. However, they were caught -in the act- when they were about to commit a new crime,- the report says. In Poltava Oblast, law enforcement officers exposed a 16-year-old local college student who set fire to an SUV of a combat brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine fighting on the Eastern Front. After carrying out the arson, the suspects hoped to receive money from their Russian supervisors, but instead received suspicion under the following articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: Criminals are in custody. They face up to 10 years in prison. As reported by ArmyInform, the Security Service of Ukraine gathered a large-scale evidence base on four high-ranking Russian clerics who spread the Kremlin regime on the temporarily occupied part of the territory of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/09/ne-tak-stalosya-yak-gadalosya-paliyi-vijskovyh-avto-hotily-otrymaty-groshi-a-teper-mozhut-sisty-za-graty-na-10-rokiv/	2024-12-09T11:06:07-08:00

About saidin his evening address on December 9. -The personnel changes took place precisely in order to reboot the training system of our soldiers. Oleg Apostol and Mykhailo Drapaty will deal with this. Today was the beginning of a corresponding discussion at our Stavka. I have instructed the next Stavka to prepare a detailed report,- he declared. For now, he said, they have to do an audit of what things need immediate changes, what exactly needs to be fixed and who else needs to be replaced. -Everything that is needed can be provided both at the organizational level and at the financial level. It is the quality of the training of soldiers that determines the effectiveness of our soldiers in battles and, of course, the preservation of the lives of our boys,- the President assured. He also listened to the report of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrsky, about the events at the front, the defense of Ukrainian positions, and the Kursk operation. -There was also a separate report by Pavel Palisa regarding the sums of direct funds to the brigade directly - for the additional purchase of drones. Recently, a decision was made on the amount of such direct money. But now I see that even that amount is not enough,- the head of state said. He instructed the Prime Minister to increase funding for the brigades in the coming days. In addition, the President emphasized that Ukraine is grateful to France, President Macron for the preparation of one brigade. -Now we will talk with the French side about the preparation of the second brigade. Also now in Germany, the American side is preparing a Ukrainian brigade. And we also talked with our partners, with the Nordics, with the countries of Northern Europe, that they, together with the Baltic states, can also prepare another brigade,- the head of state said. We will remind that Volodymyr Zelenskyi met with the Prime Minister of Estonia Kristen Michal, who is on his first official visit to Ukraine, and discussed with him continuation of military aid. The President of Ukraine also discussed military aid and steps to establish a just peace.

Volodymyr Zelenskyi commented on the events in Syria and the presence of Wagnerites in Africa	The head of state wrote about this on December 9 in social networks. -Assad's regime fell not only because of the strength of the opposition. This also happened because there are not enough Russian troops there. Why? Because the entire combat-ready Russian army is on the territory of Ukraine. And this says precisely that the entire army of this pseudo-empire is fighting against the Ukrainian people today,- he assured. According to him, the same is already happening in Africa. -We know that the Wagnerites were there. And we know how many -Wagnerians- were destroyed in Ukraine. -Russia wants its regimes in Africa, which would influence the African continent, and for this they used the Wagnerites,- the President noted. In his opinion, that is why it is very important today that all countries that value a world without war and security - European countries, the United States, other countries of the world, world leaders - understand this perspective: now and right here, a lot is being decided. -The strength of Ukraine depends on whether the Russian army is strong. Because if Ukraine falls, Putin will return to Syria to take revenge, and to Africa, and to many other regions that interest him. And it seems to me that this is the most important thing that everyone should understand: in this union around Ukraine, success is the general success of the world,- he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, Russia suffered a geopolitical defeat in the Middle East. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Syrian National Army, the Free Syrian Army and other rebel groups have established control over almost all of southwestern Syria. Captured Palmyra, Homs and Damascus.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/09/volodymyr-zelenskyj-prokomentuvav-podiyi-v-syriyi-ta-prysutnist-vagnerivcziv-v-afryczi/	2024-12-09T09:46:42-08:00

Air defense, equipment of brigades, EU and NATO membership: the President of Ukraine met with the Pr...	About this informs December 9, Office of the President. -We are very grateful to your people, your government, your parliamentarians. You supported Ukraine from the very beginning of the full-scale invasion of Russia and provided great support with over 700 million euros in military and financial aid. Thank you very much,- said the head of the Ukrainian state. It is noted that against the background of constant Russian attacks on Ukrainians and critical infrastructure objects, Ukraine needs to strengthen air defense in winter. Separately, they discussed the urgent needs of Ukrainian soldiers, the staffing of brigades and the possibility of Estonia's participation in the purchase of defense products from domestic manufacturers. This will help strengthen Ukraine on the battlefield and bring a just and lasting peace closer. -We thank your country very much for the fact that you are very forthright and speak very clearly about Ukraine's future both in the EU and in NATO,- the President noted. The meeting also discussed Ukraine's progress on the path to joining the EU and the importance of reaching a consensus among allies on the invitation to NATO. Particular attention was paid to the invitation for Ukraine to participate in the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) summit, which will be held in Tallinn this month. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked for the invitation and noted that Ukraine has every reason to become a member of this important organization. The Prime Minister of Estonia assured that his country and people will continue to support Ukraine in all possible ways, because they consider Russia a common enemy. -We made it clear: Ukraine is part of Europe and should be part of NATO. Because if we want to have a just and lasting peace, we need both. Because if Putin wins and changes the borders by force, it will send a signal to, for example, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and everyone else to continue doing similar things. So for Europe, what Ukraine is doing is a struggle for the freedom of Europe, and also for the freedom of the entire democratic world,- said Kristen Michal. As reported by ArmyInform, Volodymyr Zelensky told about the results of his visit to France, where he had meetings with the current French President Emmanuel Macron and with the future US President Donald Trump.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/09/ppo-komplektuvannya-brygad-chlenstvo-v-yes-i-nato-prezydent-ukrayiny-zustrivsya-z-premyer-ministrom-estoniyi/	2024-12-09T09:21:04-08:00
Volodymyr Zelenskyi and Friedrich Mertz discussed military aid for Ukraine	About informs December 9, the Office of the President. -I want to thank you for your support. Germany's aid is very serious - the second in the world after the United States. In general, the financial support of our army, humanitarian support is about 37 billion euros. We are very grateful for that. We believe that this aid will not stop and that Germany will support Ukraine. We are counting on stronger, decisive actions by Germany from you personally,- the head of state said. The President noted friendly relations between Ukraine and Germany. In particular, this is confirmed by recent negotiations with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Kyiv and a meeting with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier in Paris. Volodymyr Zelenskyi and Friedrich Mertz discussed increasing the financing of military aid to Ukraine for the next year. This is critically necessary to protect lives in Ukraine, as the country suffers from Russian strikes every day, and every show of support saves lives. The increase in aid also directly strengthens Ukraine's position to bring a just and credible peace closer. One of the key topics of the meeting is the Victory Plan. The parties agreed that Ukraine can be strengthened by long-range capabilities and an invitation to NATO, and the achievement of a just peace will have an impact on global security. Ukraine's integration into the EU, ensuring unity in Europe and its role in strengthening Ukraine were also discussed. The President supported the idea of ​​the leader of the CDU/CSU to create a contact group with the participation of Germany, France, Great Britain and Poland with the aim of restoring a just and lasting peace for Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy proposed to include Denmark in this group. Particular attention was paid to the issue of Ukrainians who left for Germany due to the full-scale Russian invasion. The head of state announced that the visit of the Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of National Unity of Ukraine Oleksiy Chernyshov to Berlin is already planned. Friedrich Merz noted that there is an intense debate in Germany about the details of military support and what kind of weapons to transfer to Ukraine, but there is a consensus in principle about providing aid to end the war and establish a just peace. -The position of our faction is clear: we want to give your Armed Forces the ability to reach military bases - not the civilian population and infrastructure, but so that you can achieve the very objectives from which the war against your country is being waged. I spoke about this a few weeks ago in the Bundestag. By limiting the range of weapons, we force you to fight with one hand behind your back,- he emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, Volodymyr Zelensky told about the results of his visit to France, where he had meetings with the current French President Emmanuel Macron and with the future US President Donald Trump.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/09/volodymyr-zelenskyj-i-fridrih-mercz-obgovoryly-vijskovu-dopomogu-dlya-ukrayiny/	2024-12-09T09:08:04-08:00

Provision of the largest army in Europe: the DOT spoke about the results of the work	Arsen Zhumadilov, general director of the Procurement Agency of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine -State rear operator-. According to Arsen Zhumadilov, this result is due to the fact that the agency managed to build the right procurement process. As it should be. -We have planning, we have normal interaction with the consumer, on the one hand. On the other hand, we have interaction with the market. This means that we understand exactly what the consumer needs and when, and we place appropriate orders in a timely manner through the Prozorro electronic procurement system,- he said. According to the general director of the -State rear operator-, they provide the largest army in Europe, one of the largest in the world. It is a very large system in itself, in which there are many components. Now the agency has signed contracts for the total amount of 75 billion hryvnias — they closed needs with a total cost of 92 billion hryvnias. 17 billion hryvnias were saved. And all because of the predictability of the process and competitiveness. -Already in November of this year, we are purchasing what will be delivered in the next one. That is, it was not the case when we started at the beginning of this year - we needed to ensure the supply of goods under the contracts that we entered into at the beginning of January, so that the deliveries under these contracts would be in January,- said the general director of the procurement agency. The digital algorithms used by the DOT allow both to control suppliers and to interest them. -Previously, an average of 45-60 days passed between the delivery of goods and payment. Now, due to the fact that this entire process has been digitized, including all additional invoices, documents, etc., from the delivery of the product to the payment for this product takes an average of 10-15 days,- Arsen Zhumadilov stated. DOT responds to all problematic moments as quickly as possible and solves them systematically. As for failures, here the general director of the agency is adamant. -Regarding failures. Nevertheless, I will say that in 24 we managed to avoid them. As of today, we do not have any -material- failures, that is, everyone changed clothes for the winter in a timely manner. Not for fuel and lubricants - the equipment is moving, it needs to be refueled. No in terms of nutrition,- assured Arsen Zhumadilov.

Putin does not want this war to end. Therefore, he must be forced - the President	The President wrote about this on December 9. -I emphasized to both President Macron and President Trump: first of all, you will see that Putin does not want this war to end. Therefore, he must be forced. It is possible to force only if Ukraine is strong. A strong Ukraine before any diplomacy is strong on the battlefield. It's a strong army, it's weapons packages, etc., it's long-range systems, certainly -atakams-, and -taurus-, and -storm shadows-, and -scalps-. We need all this very, very much. And yes, exclusively for strikes on military targets, we emphasize this,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy assured. According to him, security guarantees are also important. -Now we cannot be in NATO, but we can be invited to NATO. And we already need such security guarantees. And we talked about that. And this is exactly how I formulate our opinion. As for the invitation to NATO, it is difficult to talk about it with President Trump today, because he is not yet in the White House, he does not have all these legal rights,- explained Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He said that he is going to call President Joe Biden in the near future and raise the very issue of the invitation to NATO. -Because Biden is currently the current President of the United States, and a lot depends on his position. And it makes no sense to discuss with President Trump what today, while he is not in the White House, does not depend on him,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. He also thanked the United States and Joe Biden, bipartisan support for the recent package, which the President called very important and serious support for Ukraine. -If there is a pause while Ukraine is not in NATO, and even if we had an invitation, but we would not be in NATO, and there is a pause, then who will guarantee us some kind of security? We can think and work on Emmanuel Macron's position. He suggested that some part of the troops of one or another country should be present on the territory of Ukraine, which would guarantee our security while Ukraine is not in NATO. But before that, we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the EU and when Ukraine will be in NATO. Understanding our future, these would be very effective guarantees,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyi.

The pace slows down a little — in the Kharkiv region, the enemy is preparing new mechanized rolls	Oleg Romanov, the commander of the anti-tank battalion of the 3rd separate assault brigade. According to Oleg Romanov, the enemy is creating a bridgehead and, most likely, will use the tactics of mechanized rolling as soon as the ground freezes. However, now the intensity of attacks has decreased somewhat. -In my opinion, the pace is already getting a little lost. Perhaps, before winter, the mobilization capabilities fall. But we will see. We will not run ahead, so as not to provoke,- said Oleg Romanov, the commander of the anti-tank battalion of the 3rd separate assault brigade. How reported ArmyInform, it is steadily difficult in Kharkiv Oblast — the enemy is rushing to the shores of Oskol and Borov.

- My sons did not even serve a term...-. The story of the Savostyanov family, which chooses victory ...	But no calls ring in his apartment. Neither apartment nor telephone numbers. He understands that he will never again sit down with his son at the table and talk to him. In such moments, when he is enveloped by indescribable sadness and does not want to live, he drips Corvalol, trying to calm his heart. But where is there!.. Tolya Savostyanov, like most Ukrainians, learned about the large-scale invasion of Russians from television news broadcasts. And the arrivals of -Iskanders- and -Calibers- that -visited- the city once again confirmed this information. And on February 26, when thousands of residents of Dnipro continued to leave their homes, fleeing from the war, a man went to one of the city's territorial recruitment centers with a single request - to be allowed to defend both his city and the whole of Ukraine. There they asked if he has experience in army service, what military specialty he has and where he would like to serve. — I know about the army from movies and the stories of my father, a personnel officer, he sincerely admitted. — And where would you like to serve? And anywhere. The main thing is to be in action&#8230; After a short conversation, he was sent to the 234th Battalion of the 128th Territorial Defense Brigade. Sagittarius -Later, the son said that thousands of our compatriots came to the brigade assembly point in those February days and he was proud that he was among them,- continues the father. — Our units entered the battle after a month and a half and stopped the enemy's offensive in the spring of 2022 on the border of Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions. Over time, all of them took part in operations to liberate Kharkiv region, Luhansk region, and Donetsk region. The son, who had never even held a machine gun in his hands before, admitted to me that he had learned military craft from his brothers who had passed through the ATO/OOS. And there were quite a few of them in the unit. He has been to many hot spots in this damn war. The hottest is Kurakhovo district in Donetsk region. There he survived a lot of artillery and rocket attacks, when it seemed that his life was about to end. However, he survived by some miracle. What I heard from my son is difficult for an adequate person to understand. From his words, I know that Putin's scoundrels simply wiped off the face of the earth both the city and the people - its residents. No, bastard katsaps are not at war with us, but are destroying us and our children, as Ukrainians were destroyed by their ancestors at the beginning of the 30s of the last century. The only difference is that those were dying of hunger, and these are being beaten with Calibers and Daggers. When it came to the danger that befalls our boys at every step and I asked my son to be careful, Tolya said that the Lord God himself was helping him. But one day ended tragically for him: he received an injury that, as doctors later said, was incompatible with life. But his brothers quickly took him to a mobile hospital, where doctors stabilized his condition. Anatoly Sevastyanov was treated in many military hospitals, including the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Clinical Hospital, through which thousands of our soldiers have passed and where the best doctors are gathered. He underwent cranial trepanation, several of the most difficult surgical interventions in the head area. The duel with the skeleton lasted almost a year. Unfortunately, she prevailed and he passed away this summer. -Anatoly was a real soldier, although he did not wear a soldier's uniform until February 2022,- says one of his brothers. — If you want to hear about him as a person, then I will say one thing: he was ready to sacrifice his own life for the sake of the lives of those around him. Anatoly went to the TCC on February 26, and his brother Oleg on April 9, telling his father that he was ashamed to sleep at home, knowing that his brother was fighting. To Serhii Anatoliyovych's suggestion to think it over, he answered with a categorical -no-. He happened to serve in the 55th Zaporizhzhya Sich Artillery Brigade, armed with 155-mm French self-propelled artillery. Together with the same guys, more than once and more than twice he terrorized the occupiers, accurately destroying both manpower and equipment. At first he was a gunner, but over time he retrained as a -KRAZ- driver, providing batteries with shells. Oleg, by the way, learned the driving trade at the Society's Dnipro driving school. And mastered it properly. Fellow gunners say that only because of Sevastyanov's remarkable driving skills, his car, which was repeatedly tracked by enemy UAVs, did not become a target of the Russians. Talking with retired Major Serhii Savostyanov, I asked him what his greatest wish was, to which he replied: — First of all, I want the death of my son Anatoly to become one of the bricks in our victory over the enemy. I want to wait for Oleg to be alive and well. Then we will gather both his brothers and the fallen Anatoliy at the same table. And we will remember my son, and tens of thousands of other sons, fathers, brothers, whom fathers and mothers, children and wives did not wait for, not with an angry, silent word, as the poet wrote. Eternal to all of them!..

Our naval drones worked on Russian helicopters and airplanes near the Crimean Bridge	About this reported on December 9 Security Service of Ukraine. The Russian pilots considered themselves hunters and counted on easy hunting, but they became the prey, because the naval drones opened fire in return. The newest -Sea Baby- were equipped with large-caliber machine guns with ballistic programs for automatic guidance and automatic target acquisition. Intercepted Russian radio communication indicates that there are dead and wounded on board the helicopters. The helicopters themselves received significant damage and now require major repairs. SBU drones also hit a barge that was transporting military equipment and equipment for the repair of the Crimean bridge, which the occupiers are still trying in vain to restore after previous bombings by the Ukrainian special services. -Sea Baby- is our multi-purpose platform, which can accommodate various weapons: both missile systems of volley fire, and flying drones and heavy machine guns. The main thing is that it once again proved its effectiveness. The results of our work are actually much more than we can show now, but everything has its time,- the SBU said. These water drones were produced as a result of the joint fundraising of several foundations and volunteer communities in February of this year.

Martens, leopards and cobras: the expert told about a German zoo that helps Ukraine	-Only if you go through the most important classes of weapons, then Germany is definitely in at least the top five (those who provide assistance - ed.). So let's figure it out. Excellent Leopard 2 tanks. In my opinion, there is nothing better in tank building. Despite this, there is also Leopard 1. Of course, there is a slightly weaker 105 -millimeter gun, but as an infantry cover weapon works just fine. Very successful Marder (Ukrainian marten) infantry vehicles. They are surpassed only, in my opinion, by combat Swedish CV90s and, of course, the M2 Bradley. There is no need to talk about the Iris-T air defense system. This is the only system with a medium range of up to 50 km, which has one hundred percent damage to the target: and all possible, both cruise missiles and unmanned systems. Not to mention such, at first glance, seemingly banal things, but very, very necessary - demining machines. We understand that our country is currently the most mined country on planet Earth. Further. Beautiful grenade launchers Panzerfaust 3 - after AT-4 and after Instalaz C90 and Carl Gustaf are probably the most massive and best grenade launcher. Plus much needed stuff like DM-31 anti-tank mines and the like, with a huge amount of small arms, a very nice Heckler automatic rifle &amp; Koch. Yes, I would very much like to see a good Taurus long-range missile appear (in Ukraine - ed.), but there are also certain nuances here. The Germans produced up to 600 of them in total, and they have about 125 in their arsenal. Even if 30 of them conditionally appear, they fundamentally do not solve anything. Some fat target will definitely be destroyed, but it is not necessary to talk about the fact that this is a war-breaking missile. Plus one more very important detail also matters. This is a huge amount of microelectronics and especially optics. The Germans have always been famous for very high-quality optics of all types and aiming systems. Not to mention the fantastic COBRA counter-battery machine. The Russians don't have anything like that. And most of all, we can safely say that this is almost the best class of weapons that exists. Even American systems of various purposes, say, AN/TPQ-36, 48, 50, are not equal to this particular machine&#8230; Therefore, it is definitely not correct to throw stones at our strategic ally on the European continent.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/09/kunyczi-leopardy-ta-kobry-ekspert-rozpoviv-pro-nimeczkyj-zoopark-yakyj-dopomagaye-ukrayini/	2024-12-08T21:03:11-08:00
-Cowboy Duel- on MSDS: how -Drone- on -Hurricane- is seconds ahead of the invaders	The acting commander of the artillery platoon of the 48th separate artillery brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, junior sergeant Andrii with the call sign -Drone- told ArmyInform about his military career and combat work - the importance of the speed and coordination of the crew's actions, the -sharp vision- of drones and the accuracy of shots -. The call sign -Drone- has been attached to Andrii since the beginning of the service - as early as 2020. The military man says that he is not connected with the UAV, but with the abbreviation of his name. Andriy - -Andron-, -Dron- - that's how it happened between the brothers. — I entered the Armed Forces of my own free will back in 2020, signed a contract, passed the basic combined military training and studied in one of the artillery brigades. In January 2021, he received the -hundredth VOS- and was sent to the zone of joint military operations (Operations of the United Forces - ed.), where he served for 8 months and returned for training in his profession, the soldier says. In 2020, Andrii just turned 20 years old. At that time, it seemed to many Ukrainians that the war in the East of Ukraine had stopped forever, and to end it once and for all, it was enough to simply stop shooting. Instead, -Drone- was sure that if you wanted peace, you should prepare for war. — Studied in 2014. I was 14 years old then, and although of course no one drafted me into the army, even then I thought and wanted to go and serve as a volunteer - to defend my land, family and friends from the enemy. For me, the war began at the end of 2013, when the Maidan began, repressions began against students, against ordinary people, - explains the gunner. At the educational center, Andrii not only studied, but also taught himself. As the most motivated and responsible cadet, he was appointed deputy commander. And since there were not enough instructors, -Drone- often conducted classes with his brothers himself. — I have been interested in and engaged in -military- since childhood. I watched historical and documentary films, read books about war, studied weapons and battle tactics. That's why he had certain theoretical knowledge, says Andriy. The military adds that despite the limited training time and the lack of instructors, they trained and prepared for combat operations in a high-quality manner. Then, in the zone of OOS, it was possible to significantly improve the acquired knowledge and skills, because it was necessary for the daily performance of combat and special tasks. — In the OOS zone in our area of ​​responsibility for a long time, everything was generally quiet and peaceful. Several times we went on duty for three days. Of course, there was a tense situation on the front line, there were shelling. At that time, we were preparing, sharpening our skills, knowledge, and gaining practice, the fighter recalls. — Already from November to December 2021, it became finally clear that a full-scale invasion would inevitably take place. -Russian troops were approaching the border with Ukraine, and we were sent to artillery training,- Andriy says about the eve of the start of the great war. Then he began training to be an anti-tank platoon commander, mastered the MT-12 -Rapir- gun, the -Grad- MLRS and the -Uragan-. I had to continue studying already in combat conditions - practicing with rocket artillery on columns of Russian invaders in the Sumy region. In 2022, -Dron- fought in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions, took part in the expulsion of the occupiers from the North of Ukraine, the successful offensive of the Defense Forces of Ukraine north of Kharkiv at the end of April - in May, and the famous Slobozhan offensive operation in September-October. — In the Sumy region, we worked mainly on columns of Russian equipment. And in the Kharkiv region, they have already begun to work on base camps, on the accumulation of manpower and equipment, on the placement of equipment on firing positions. In September, we worked from the Kharkiv side towards the border with the Belgorod region of Russia. They hit enemy positions in the area of ​​the village of Liptsi and neighboring villages, Andrii recalls. — In jet artillery, there are several types of projectiles, which are used depending on the target on which it is necessary to inflict fire damage. There are explosive devices, there are cassettes. We can hit infantry, fortifications, columns or clusters of enemy vehicles. We can remotely mine the area with anti-tank mines to prevent the enemy from advancing, says the gunner. The most memorable for the military was the well-aimed strikes on enemy anti-aircraft guns - -Hrad- and -Smerch-. There were cases when, thanks to the timely receipt of information from intelligence, it was possible to hit the enemy right at the firing position even while he was starting to deploy and prepare for firing. — If the intelligence worked on time, provided quality data, then there is nothing complicated about it — we just have time faster than them and know exactly where to hit, -Dron- explains. To an outside observer, it reminds one of the famous cinematic cowboy duel, in which the faster and more accurate wins. However, here the enemies are not several meters apart, but tens of kilometers, and their weapons are not Colts and Winchesters, but deadly long-range salvo missile systems. High-quality and timely further intelligence allows you to stay ahead of the enemy by seconds. To practice on the target, gunners are given coordinates, after which they begin to perform a combat mission. - A full pack of 16 shells can be fired in a very short time - from 8 to 20 seconds. It is necessary to prepare for shooting in a few seconds, one and a half minutes maximum. And it is necessary to roll twice as fast - in 45 seconds maximum. If a well-coordinated crew is working, then this is all done very, very quickly, explains the -Drone-. Later, being in a safe place, the -reactive women- will learn about the results of their work. The results of the objective control are proved to the gunners by sending a photo or a short video. This can be done by real drones - -quadriks- or -wings-, which record fire damage to enemy targets. Andriy says that he and his brothers are always pleased to learn that they worked exactly on target, inflicting maximum damage on the occupiers. Thus, the -sharp vision- of the drones and the skillful, fast and coordinated actions of the crew allow you to accurately hit the invaders under the most difficult conditions. The gunner says that in the almost three years since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the war has changed several times and requires constant training and improvement from Ukrainian soldiers, because the enemy does not stand still and learns from its own mistakes. — In 2022, the Russian was very defiant, walked in columns, did not prepare enough. Now the enemy is learning no less than we are. Their FPVs are also developing more, and their -wings- are developing, and their artillery also began to work better. They have already learned to fight, says Andriy. However, the biggest problem, he is convinced, is not this, because the Ukrainian military still surpasses the enemy in terms of training and is ahead in innovation. The threat is a change in attitudes in society, which has begun to perceive war as routine and many speak of -war fatigue- and do not want to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine. — Many civilians for some reason believe that the war is already over for them, that the enemy will settle for some conditions and cease hostilities. However, this will not happen, the war will reach everyone anyway. The military needs to be replenished, we need to be replaced on the front lines with fresh, trained units, those who have been fighting for many months, years should be given a rest, the defender explains. He is convinced that there is no other way for Ukrainians than the nationwide support of the Defense Forces of Ukraine and the personal participation of all citizens in the defense of the country. After all, the gunner claims, he and his comrades are not fighting for politicians, as some claim, but for their own families and their home, which was invaded by the Russian invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/09/kovbojska-duel-na-rszv-yak-dron-na-uragani-vyperedzhaye-okupantiv-na-sekundy/	2024-12-08T20:56:53-08:00
Missiles have reached the micro level: the development of miniature missiles for drones has been com...	As declare the authors of the portal of the Spanish Defense Industry Association TEDAE, this development, carried out by the Pyrenean firm Aertec in cooperation with the General Directorate of Armaments and Materiel (DGAM), is part of the ARPA project aimed at equipping remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) of its own production with high-precision weapons, ArmyInform reports. Aertec worked with DGAM to redesign its Tarsis-W platform, an armed variant of the Tarsis 75 UAV, as part of DGAM's Coincidente program. In this collaboration, Aertec contributed 70% of the funding and DGAM provided the remaining 30%. The contract with DGAM covered design, prototype production, development and a series of successful ground firing tests, including the launch of a fully guided missile with a warhead. These tests, conducted at the San Gregorio test site in Zaragoza and the Las Bardenas test site in Navarre, demonstrated the missile's readiness for the next stage of qualification. In 2025, Aertec plans to conduct up to 100 additional firings in the -ground-to-surface- and -air-to-surface- launch options to assess the missile's viability for integration with the Tarsis-W platform. As inform the experts at the defense portal Army Recognition, the Tarsis 75, Aertec's Class I UAS system, is a light tactical unmanned aerial vehicle an aerial system (UAS) designed for reconnaissance, surveillance and integration with its light weapons. The UAV has a maximum take-off weight of 75 kg, can carry up to 12 kg of payload and has a maximum flight time of 12 hours. The drone has a wingspan of 5.2 meters, a length of 3.8 meters and can operate from different runways and locations. It has integrated catapult launch options, emergency parachute landing and a back-up satellite communication system. The UAV operates autonomously for the full flight plan, including take-off and landing, while maintaining the ability to manually operate if required. It can reach a height of up to 5,000 m. meters and has an operational range of 70 to 150 kilometers, making it suitable for the deployment of the Fox I micro-missile. The Fox I micro-missile, also known as μASM A-Fox, is designed specifically for use with small RPAS and has intermediate inertial navigation together with a semi-active laser guidance terminal. It has a length of 900 mm, a weight of 3 kg and a range of up to 4 kilometers, capable of hitting a variety of mobile targets and objects equipped with counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS) sensors. Aertec's Fox I relies on an in-house developed high-performance homing kit and a laser homing gun for precision targeting. The warhead of the missile and the rocket engine were developed in cooperation with the Spanish defense equipment manufacturer Instalaza. The warhead, adapted from the C90 Instalaza munition and equipped with a specially designed fuze, is intended for use against designated targets. The rocket motor is designed to fit the compact scale of the warhead while maintaining stability in flight. INTA's Ground Systems Directorate supported the project with testing resources and engineering assistance. In addition, the modular design of the Fox I micro-rocket allows it to be integrated into various flight platforms with minimal software modifications. Optimized for Class I UAVs such as the Tarsis 75, the missile's size and flexibility make it suitable for a number of light aircraft platforms that incorporate precision attack capabilities. The potential of micromissiles such as Aertec's Fox I for drone applications is to equip small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) with efficient, lightweight and adaptable precision strike capabilities. These micro-missiles allow you to hit lightly armored targets with minimal side effects. Their modularity and small size allow it to be integrated with different types of drones, maintaining flexibility between missions. In addition, their adaptability allows drones to provide close air support to their own units and conduct combat operations beyond line of sight using onboard sensors and targeting systems, facilitating operations in high-risk environments. This capability provides cost-effectiveness by reducing the need for larger drones or conventional munitions for specific tactical scenarios, from counter-UAV to direct fire support.

The Russians invented a fake about the instructions on how to meet the fallen defenders from the fro...	For example, Kremenchug schoolchildren are given instructions on how to properly kneel when meeting fallen defenders from the front. The corresponding poses are shown on the postcards. A reverse image search leads to similar pictures on several photo stocks (photo sales sites). It is signed in English, literally -a set of soccer players kneeling to protest racism and police brutality for Black Lives Matter.- The original drawing illustrates how football players and athletes protest by kneeling and raising their hands up. This gesture became global after the killing of African-American George Floyd in May 2020 in the United States, which caused a wave of protests around the world. And it was first used by American football player Colin Kaepernick, when in 2016 he knelt with his hand raised during the playing of the US national anthem before National Football League (NFL) games. The gesture signified disagreement with racial inequality and police violence. It is interesting that a fragment of the poem -On the Shield- by Oksana Lesyk-Paduchak is printed on the fake instructions. It is likely that Russian propagandists used it to create the illusion of greater resemblance to the truth. And also to show the -Nazi image of Ukrainians-, since the poem uses a trigger word for Russians - -Banderivskyi-. In addition, the -news- does not contain any specifics - where did it become known, in which school it was noticed, comments of eyewitnesses. Taken together, all this indicates that this is a Russian fake. In fact, in many cultures, people kneel: to pray, ask for forgiveness, or honor the memory of the dead. In Ukraine, fallen soldiers are commemorated by getting down on one knee. It is a gesture of respect, completely voluntary. But Russian propaganda gives it a negative connotation. After all, in their understanding, kneeling symbolizes submission to the ruler. They still often kneel down when addressing their Kremlin dictator. The fake was created in order to cause negative emotions towards the Ukrainian authorities, to undermine trust in education and to impose certain stereotypes that are not characteristic of Ukrainians.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/09/rosiyany-vygadaly-fejk-pro-instrukcziyu-yak-zustrichaty-zagyblyh-zahysnykiv-iz-frontu/	2024-12-08T20:04:31-08:00

-I saw a shot from an RPG-7 fly in front of my eyes and hit a barrel with fuel- — the story of a fig...	His story published byState Border Service. Yuriy is from Luhansk and since childhood dreamed of becoming a soldier. After graduating from college, he joined the State Border Service. -On June 2, 2014, we were raised by another alarm. They thought it was a training course, but they saw a red rocket signal. At the same moment, bullets flew from all sides. They hid on the territory of the car park, behind the cars, then ran to the inspection pit for vehicles, in which some mobilized man was already wounded in the leg,- the man recalled. According to him, there were few bullets, but they fired intermittently from a hole in the forest strip, in which the enemy's shots flared. -I looked out - I saw how a shot from an RPG-7 flew in front of my eyes and hit a barrel with fuel. It was like a slow motion movie! The fire was very intense. We had to move to the nearest building. They began to cover us with mortars, and we could not understand where the fire was coming from in order to respond with underbarrel grenade launchers,- said -Artist-. He remembered the movie -Saving Private Ryan-, in which Tom Hanks searched for enemy positions with the help of a mirror. I found a mirror in one of the offices, crawled to the window, saw a flash behind the greenhouses along the track. -Oh, and we showered them with gifts! But I was also -burned-. He was wounded in the stomach by a direct hit from a cumulative shot. In an hour and a half, I was evacuated to the Luhansk hospital, then on a helicopter to Kyiv,- Yuriy said. He underwent rehabilitation in Israel, at the Hadassah medical center in Jerusalem. Within two weeks, he started visiting the day hospital on his own. It was necessary to drive almost through the entire city. -The most difficult thing was to accept that I would no longer be able to run like before, one hundred percent. I returned to the army, because the uniform suits me! But, seriously, since 2018, we have been fighting for the right to military service for persons with disabilities who received it during the defense of the homeland,- explained the -Artist-. In 2021, the law was passed and it was reinstated. As an officer of the special projects department, he currently draws various illustrations, situations and comics for the social networks of the State Border Service. The man has the Order -For Courage- of the III degree and the award of the President of Ukraine -For participation in the anti-terrorist operation-.

There is currently no threat surrounding Toretsk: the Defense Forces spoke about the fighting in the...	About this on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- the deputy chief of staff - the head of the planning group of the staff told the audience Mykhailo Stoykevich of the 49th separate assault battalion -Karpatska Sich-. Despite the tactics of fighting in urban areas, according to the officer, the enemy periodically resorts to the use of artillery damage and the use of anti-aircraft guns. Thus, he exposes his own soldiers to danger. -And they never counted their soldiers. And for those groups that seep into the city, such trips are almost always a one-way trip. Moreover, we do not even record the attempts of the Russians to evacuate their wounded,- the Ukrainian military officer emphasized. In turn, our units are actively using unmanned systems to fight enemy groups. -The invaders are trying enter the city in small groups and occupy some buildings. We track them and attack with FPV drones after dark, thereby hiding the occupiers under the ruins of buildings,- said Mykhailo Stoykevich. The officer noted that our units have an advantage in night attacks thanks to more modern bomber drones , equipped with the appropriate dark-adapted surveillance systems, and the enemy is actively developing a fleet of fiber-optic UAVs. -Such drones on wires are very difficult to suppress with electronic warfare. It is almost impossible to neutralize them until they are damaged,- Stoykevich assured. However, under the current weather conditions, the use of drones is becoming more and more problematic. According to the deputy chief of staff of -Karpatska Sich-, drones -don't like- rain and frostbite. However, the enemy also has such problems. The officer of the Armed Forces informed that the enemy made several attempts to bypass the city of Toretsk in order to surround it. However, all such forays of the Russians ended in failure: their groups were defeated in small villages located near this settlement. And at the moment there is no extraordinary threat to the surroundings of the city. As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy concentrated his offensive efforts in the districts Toretska, Dilyivka, Leonidivka and Shcherbinivka, where seven clashes took place, currently three more clashes are taking place.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/zagrozy-otochennya-toreczka-narazi-nemaye-u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-pro-boyi-u-misti-na-donechchyni/	2024-12-08T08:28:33-08:00
Illegal arrests and forced mobilization: the Russians put pressure on residents of the occupied terr...	informs about this on December 8, Ivan Fedorov, the head of Zaporizhzhya OVA. According to him, numerous cases of illegal arrests and sentences are recorded. In particular, in Energodar, an employee of the Zaporizhzhya NPP was convicted on trumped-up charges of attempted sabotage. Torture and imprisonment have become common methods of intimidation. Residents of the occupied territories are also forcibly mobilized and sent to the front. -Many are forced to participate in a war against their own state. Despite this, some find an opportunity to surrender to the Ukrainian military,- said Ivan Fedorov. He emphasized that anyone forcibly mobilized can use the state program -I want to live- and surrender to captivity. This guarantees safety and saves lives. As reported by ArmyInform, during the day the occupiers made 269 strikes on 11 populated areas of the Zaporizhzhia region, as a result of which a 65-year-old man died in Vasylivskyi district.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/nezakonni-areshty-j-prymusova-mobilizacziya-shho-vidomo-pro-sytuacziyu-na-okupovanyh-terytoriyah-zaporizhzhya/	2024-12-08T07:47:11-08:00
They are not worth the price - the enemy still has enough reserves for attacks on Chasiv Yar	About it in TV Andrii Polukhin, press officer of the 24th mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, told Suspilny. -The situation remains difficult, the enemy is trying to storm the positions of our defenders, is making attempts to bypass them and is using small infantry groups as a sort of DRG, which are trying to impose a battle in the rear behind the backs of our defenders,- noted Andriy Polukhin, analyzing the events last week According to him, the enemy is actively shelling the territory of the city from various fire systems, as well as inflicting damage with aerial bombs. At the same time, according to the military, the Russians have not recorded the arrival of new units. -The reserves that they accumulated earlier are still enough for offensive activity. At this time, there are no special changes in the tactics of the Russians. Not particularly affected by their maneuvers and weather conditions, since this is an urban lane. In many places there is asphalt, there are still places where you can drive without problems on any vehicle, despite the weather,- stated Andriy Polukhin. According to Polukhin, at the moment, the biggest problem for the occupiers is not the weather, but the successful work of Ukrainian drone fighters: the -Rarog- battalion, as well as units of unmanned systems in the battalions of the brigade. Among the problems faced by the soldiers of this military unit is the presence in the city of civilian residents who, for reasons known only to them, bypassed the evacuation and remain in Chasovoy Yar. Andriy Polukhin pointed to the fact that Russian saboteurs quite often use civilian clothes to disguise their intentions, and therefore the movement of a group of citizens who are not invaders through the streets complicates the combat work of Ukrainian soldiers -At this moment, indeed, local residents still remain there . Somehow they don't have a drastic effect, but the understanding that they can be in certain places where combat operations need to be carried out somewhat constrains the movements of our troops,- Andriy Polukhin said. As reported by ArmyInform, the drones of the -Rarog- unmanned systems battalion of the 24th mechanized brigade named after King Danylo showed footage of the liquidation of the army kombat Russian Federation Yevhen Smirnov, known by the call sign -Yermak-. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/za-czinoyu-ne-stoyat-vorogu-poky-vystachaye-rezerviv-dlya-atak-na-chasiv-yar/	2024-12-08T07:23:18-08:00

The army of the Russian Federation flees from Syria by planes and ships - GUR	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on December 8. The rapid process of overthrowing the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria was marked by the shameful flight of the Russian contingent from the territory of the Arab republic. In the Syrian capital, Damascus, the dictator's residence, government buildings and the central office of national television are under the control of anti-Assad forces. After losing control of Damascus amid a continued offensive by opposition forces in the provinces of Latakia, Hama and Tartus, the Russian army withdrew its warships from the naval base in Tartus, which Assad had previously lent to Moscow in return for its security. On December 8, the frigate -Admiral Grigorovich- of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation and the cargo ship -Engineer Trubin- of the Northern Fleet of the Russian Federation left Tartus in the Mediterranean Sea. Also, the Russians are transferring the remnants of their weapons and military equipment from Syria by military aircraft from the airbase in Khmeimim. -After the capture of Damascus, the forces opposed to Assad are moving to the coast - Russia's probable loss of military bases in Tartus and Khmeimim will finalize the Kremlin's defeat in the Middle East,- GUR believes. As reported by ArmyInform, soldiers of the GUR destroyed the enemy -Hurricane- in the Zaporozhye direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/armiya-rf-tikaye-z-syriyi-litakamy-ta-korablyamy-gur/	2024-12-08T06:44:27-08:00

A video about it was released on December 8 on the unit's channel. -Today is just a crazy day, a lot of fpvishok were launched, but there is one caveat&#8230; this bunch of fpvishok was launched on us. We shot down almost all the enemy drones, but there were also missed ones. Due to the fact that the enemy flew at high frequencies, it was not possible to land them with EW. Not all weapons can shoot back effectively either. So we specially filmed a small review and told how and with what we fought back and on what frequencies the enemies are currently flying in Donetsk region,- the unit commented on the video. In particular, -Sharp Cartridges- questioned the effectiveness of using shotguns against kamikaze drones, since the shot does not cause serious damage to enemy copters. As reported by ArmyInform, operators of the -Sharp Cartridges- unit of the National Guard we filmed a drone cleaning of a house with Russians, by the forces of our attack aircraft.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/drib-ne-bere-krashhe-z-avtomata-nashi-piloty-vidbyly-ataku-desyatka-vorozhyh-fpv/	2024-12-08T06:04:46-08:00
Marines of a sick person - in Kurshchyna, the Russians attack with a brigade of -freaks-	About on the air of the telethon -Edyni Novyni- announced the press officer of the 47th mechanized brigade Anastasia Blyshchyk. According to her information, the main force of the Russians, which conducts the assaults, is the 155th Marine Brigade of the Russian Army. -And this is a really elite unit of the Russian Federation. They are really prepared, they are well equipped, that is, they are not some mobilized people who are simply thrown for meat. It is clear that each of their assaults is planned. That is why they are motivated to fight here, and we are motivated to eliminate them. The brigade of these marines are really -repulsed-, they are finished bastards who document their crimes, how they kill Ukrainian prisoners, torture them. We eliminate them in battle,- emphasized Anastasia Blyshchyk. Using the example of a specific battle, the press officer noted that the units of the brigade were opposed by well-prepared and well-equipped enemies. -In particular, they were dressed in camouflage robes. This is special white clothing, it is spotted to blend in with the snow. They also used armored vehicles, they were also amphibious assault vehicles, and they were also MTLB. They were met by our anti-tankers, who were firing from the Stugna ATGM, and also worked as UAV operators. And a huge thank you in this situation to the engineers who very competently placed the mine barriers,- Anastasiya Blyshchyk emphasized. She noted that before the mentioned combat, in the last 2-3 weeks, the Ukrainian infantrymen had not seen enemy heavy equipment on the battlefield at all. If anything was observed, it was motorcycles, ATVs. -And more Russians used this type of transport for logistics. But just now they became more active. I don't know if they will try to advance with equipment again, or if they will return to infantry assaults, we will see,- Anastasiya Blyshchyk said. As reported by ArmyInform, the unmanned systems battalion of the 47th mechanized brigade daily causes colossal losses to the enemy, supporting our infantry in Kurshchyna. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/morpihy-hvoroyi-lyudyny-na-kurshhyni-rosiyany-atakuyut-brygadoyu-vyrodkiv/	2024-12-08T05:46:13-08:00

They sighed - in Slobozhanshchyna, the combat activity of the enemy has decreased	About it at telemarathon and -The only news- said the spokesman of the operational-tactical group of troops -Kharkiv- lieutenant colonel Yevhenii Romanov. -We are observing a decrease in Russian assaults. Twice they tried to advance in the Vovchansk region, but they failed. In general, we observe that the number of shelling and attacks has really decreased. Over the past 24 hours, the occupiers have carried out two strikes using four guided aerial bombs, Yevgeny Romanov stated. At the same time, according to the speaker, during Saturday, the enemy struck 17 kamikaze drones and carried out 199 attacks on the positions of defenders of Ukraine. -But this is twice less than the statistics for the period of a week and a half before-, Yevhenii Romanov said. He noted that the soldiers of the units of the Defense Forces respond adequately to all actions of the enemy. -Yesterday, the enemy was still without 56 soldiers. Of them, 26 occupiers suffered irreversible losses,- Yevgeny Romanov noted. At the same time, according to Yevgeny Romanov, in recent days in the Kharkiv direction there has been a decrease in the number of attacks by guided aerial bombs (UABs) from the enemy, which may be due to the fact that the enemy has concentrated its resources on other areas of the front or faced limitations in their use -This resource (KAB) is limited for them. Therefore, they are forced to save on flights, and the CABs themselves. Or they don't have the ability to carry out air attacks,'' Evgeny Romanov stated. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the operative-tactical group -Kharkiv- told about the fighter Serhii with the call sign -Kosii-, who not only managed to save himself, but also destroyed enemies, who brutally executed his fellow prisoners. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/vyzdyhaly-na-slobozhanshhyni-bojova-aktyvnist-voroga-zmenshylasya/	2024-12-08T04:45:22-08:00

Creating Controlled Chaos: In the south, the enemy continues to terrorize the civilian population	About this on the air of the military TV channel said Serhiy Bratchuk, the spokesman of the Ukrainian Volunteer Army -South-. -According to the speakers of the aggressor, they are going to launch an attack on Zaporizhzhia, or the Zaporizhia direction, and then, as it were, shift their forces in order to force the Dnieper and reach the right bank, create a bridgehead and, accordingly, attack the regional center of Kherson. And all this was scaled in the information space with the use of appropriate publics, appropriate introductions. And, of course, that this worries people,- said Serhiy Bratchuk. However, according to him, the situation, from the side of the Ukrainian command, is fully controlled, no matter how difficult it was. Although the enemy's movements are quite intense. -At least the task that faced the Russians for more than a month is an attempt to enter our islands located on the Dnieper. With these islands, in fact, they are trying to achieve an increase in the gray zone and an increase in fire pressure on the right bank, on those communities that are near the Dnipro,- stated Serhiy Bratchuk. He stated that we are talking about terrorism against the civilian population, because the enemy uses UAVs quite actively. -The enemy absolutely does not shy away from using these drones against the civilian population. Every day we receive reports of attacks on individual citizens and groups of civilians. The occupiers are also hunting for representatives of the National Police, rescuers of the State Emergency Service, and medical workers. That is, I would even say that the enemy is trying to vividly demonstrate its terrorism,- Serhii Bratchuk emphasized. According to him, these signals of terrorism are primarily aimed at our partners as well, they say that Russia has power, Russia is not ready and will stop at nothing, even the killing of civilians. -Well, actually, this is an attempt to create a situation of panic, a situation of controlled chaos among peaceful citizens. Moreover, this is one of the elements of the concept of waging a modern war, which is promoted by the Russian Federation, and they quite actively developed and are developing this direction of their strategy of waging war on the basis of Soviet instructions, where no one spared people. Especially when it comes to those territories that Russia wants to invade,- Serhii Bratchuk is convinced. The speaker also pointed out that now in the area of ​​responsibility of the units in the south, the invaders are actively conducting sabotage and reconnaissance activities along the banks of the Dnipro. -If we are talking about islands and assaults on them, the Russians are trying to enter the island and gain a foothold on boats or other watercraft. Very often they fail to do this, but those who fall over try to get a foothold and wait for the next group. Whether there will be a next group is already a question. Especially since the fire control from our right bank is constant,- concluded Serhii Bratchuk.

One to five: Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the losses of Ukraine and Russia	The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, announced this on December 8. He said that since the beginning of the full-scale war, Ukraine has lost 43,000 soldiers who died on the battlefield. -370,000 cases of assistance to the wounded, and this is taking into account that in our army, approximately 50 percent of the wounded return to the ranks, and all injuries, including light and repeated ones, are recorded,- the head of state said. According to him, one of the key differences between the Russian army and the Defense Forces of Ukraine is the level of development of front-line medicine, which is much higher in the Ukrainian army. -We in Ukraine are grateful for this to everyone who helps develop medicine in our army and saves our wounded, carries out rehabilitation. Since September of this year, Russia has been losing people on the battlefield in a ratio of 5 and even 6 to 1 in our country. That's how they want to seize more land before the pressure of the world on them can increase to an unbearable level,- the President said. In addition, he urged not to forget about the Ukrainians who are in Russian captivity - there are thousands of people, military and civilians, and some of them have been in captivity since 2014, when the occupation began. As of February 24, 2022, Ukraine managed to return 3,935 Ukrainian people from Russia: 3,767 soldiers and 168 civilians. -We have to get everyone back and it's still a lot of work. And we must establish the truth about all our missing people. Let's not forget about the children deported by Russia from Ukrainian land: the Russians themselves say that there are hundreds of thousands of such stolen children, and Russia scatters them across its territory,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. According to him, getting them back is the hardest part. At least several million people remain in the occupied territory of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/odyn-do-pyaty-volodymyr-zelenskyj-oprylyudnyv-vtraty-ukrayiny-ta-rosiyi/	2024-12-08T03:13:21-08:00

Not only tanks - our fighters work so hard with -Stugna- on infantry that the enemy is scattered	The video of the injuries was published on December 9 on the brigade's channel. The anti-tankers demonstrated the destruction of several groups of invaders that were approaching our positions with -Stugna- anti-tank missiles. -They are patiently waiting for the right moment to strike. Their main mission is to protect their brothers and to destroy the forces of the Russian occupiers as much as possible,- commented the work of their anti-tankers in the brigade. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 60th mechanized Ingulets brigade together with their comrades from the 66th mechanized brigade named after Prince Mstislav the Brave with well-aimed blows stopped another enemy assault.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/ne-lyshe-tanky-nashi-bijczi-tak-praczyuyut-zi-stugny-po-pihoti-shho-vorog-azh-rozlitayetsya/	2024-12-08T02:04:12-08:00
The weather is bad, but the enemy is even worse - our pilots have learned to work well in difficult ...	Maksym Bilousov, the head of the communications department of the 60th brigade, told about this in the stream on the military TV channel ArmyTV. -Now there is a slight lull in our area of ​​responsibility precisely from the point of view of the involvement of armored vehicles. The enemy is not using it as actively now as it was a week ago. But he does not stop constant assaults with the participation of infantry,- Maksym Bilousov said. According to him, enemy infantrymen have different degrees of combat training. From time to time there are very worthy opponents. According to Maksym Bilousov, they have an idea about regrouping the unit, about conducting the battle in sectors. But a considerable number of Russian soldiers practically did not undergo any thorough training. -They don't even know where they got to. One of the prisoners said that they were, so to speak, trained at the training ground for just a couple of days, and then they were transferred to the front. And he got to us because they told him: -Take some water and take it to the front.- He took his burden, left and came out ... to us,- Maksym Bilousov said. In the certain absence of enemy armored vehicles on the battlefield in the area of ​​​​responsibility, their operators of unmanned systems organize a hunt for both Russian infantrymen and firing points. In particular, mortar calculations of the invaders. -As a recent example of a successful hunt, there is a video that we posted. Our aerial scouts found a mortar nest of the occupiers. Somehow they didn't hide it very well. And the soldiers from the unit of combat UAVs — FPV drones quickly hit the position of the invaders. Because mortars are still such a thing that can cause a lot of damage. And hitting a mortar is, I think, such a very good and good bonus for us,- Maksym Bilousov emphasized. According to him, the pilots of the kamikaze drones find a way out even in bad weather, fly between the clouds and then work in a very organized manner on the enemy's positions. As reported by ArmyInform, aerial scouts of the 60th mechanized Ingulets brigade noticed a Russian lying on the ground with a weapon. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/pogoda-pogana-ale-vorogu-shhe-girshe-nashi-piloty-navchylysya-dobre-praczyuvaty-u-skladnyh-meteoumovah/	2024-12-08T01:46:59-08:00
- I remember the sparks that flew from their bulletproof vests - Serhiy killed the Russians who shot...	The story was made public on December 8 by the operational-tactical group -Kharkiv-. Serhiy comes from Chernihiv Oblast. During the war, he went through all the circles of infantry hell. He was hunted by mortars and drones, poisoned with gas and tried to kill at close range during assaults. He survived where there seemed to be no hope left. Otherwise, Serhii does not call it a miracle of God. -This happened during the defense of a small, completely destroyed Donetsk village. There were very fierce battles, for three days we were -covered- with everything possible. We are tired, wounded, hiding in the basement among the ruins from shelling and drops. We were left without a portable REB. We sit and wait for the boys from neighboring positions to bring. Suddenly we hear someone approaching the basement. They asked for the password, but they are Muscovites! Experienced, careful - they do not go to us, they only throw grenades and shout: -Surrender!-. I have a wound in my leg, my Achilles tendon is torn, I'm bleeding a little. The boys are contused and injured. They decide to leave, and I stay until the last. I hide in mattresses, rags that lie on the floor. Suddenly I hear automatic rounds: the guys who came out to surrender are being shot. The Russians begin to descend to the basement. Two. One says: -There were more of them!-, the other denies: -No, we killed them all!- Two things saved me: firstly, it was dark in the basement, secondly, they didn't shoot the space before the event,- recalls Serhiy. The invaders acted quickly, in a businesslike manner: they began to barricade the entrance in case of our drones. -Weapons were put away for convenience, and one of them threw a machine gun almost into my hand - I even felt the heat from the receiver. Then he acted on reflexes: he grabbed the -Kalashnikov-, checked. The Muscovites were trained: after shooting, they changed the magazine to a full one, a charge in the chamber. He emptied the machine gun at the enemies in turns. I remembered the sparks that flew from their bulletproof vests... He automatically changed the empty magazine to his full one and somehow crawled out into the yard. It turned out that one of the boys who were shot by Muscovites was alive: the bullet hit his face, there was a lot of blood, so they decided that he was dead. The two crawled to the shelter, called for help. We had to wait more than four hours. All this time we pretended to be dead, because enemy drones were circling above us. His brothers were the first to be evacuated, it was easier with him - he could go by himself. They came after me a little later. At first they dragged me, then they carried me, finally they picked up a bicycle in the village and rolled me on it. Thank God, it was delivered. Then - the hospital, numerous operations, rehabilitation. I recently returned to my unit, but I no longer fit in the attack aircraft: you can't run without an Achilles tendon. Scandibai slowly, but I plan to continue to serve, to do something useful, to pass on experience. It's a pity - now I can't drive a car&#8230; In general, I was very lucky then. What is the moral of all this? Guys, never trust the Russians, don't surrender, they will definitely shoot you. It is necessary to fight to the last, this is the only chance to survive. Don't allow yourself to be killed, it's better to kill the enemy first,- Serhii advises. ArmyInform told the story of a fighter with the call sign -Bridge-, who bijczya-na-psevdo-most/->was completely surrounded, but destroyed the enemy group.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/pamyatayu-iskry-yaki-letily-vid-yihnih-bronezhyletiv-sergij-vbyv-rosiyan-yaki-rozstrilyaly-jogo-pobratymiv/	2024-12-08T01:27:35-08:00

-Bats- in the service of the Coast Guard: American law enforcement officials are betting on the late...	According to distributed information by the United States Coast Guard Command, V-BAT drones (one of the variants of the translation into Ukrainian - -Bat- - author) are able to take off vertically and do not need airstrips, which makes them less vulnerable to detection and enemy attacks, ArmiyaInform reports. With a flight range of up to 370 km and the ability to stay in the air for a long time - up to 11 hours - they give law enforcement an important advantage in the form of reconnaissance, long-term surveillance and reconnaissance. In particular, units of the US Coast Guard will use patrol ships already available in this structure to launch drones. In particular, on the National Security Cutter or Legend class vessels. After all, V-BAT is able to take off vertically and land on a field of only 4x4 meters. The drone weighs 56.5 kg and can carry up to 11 kg of payload. Equipped with a powerful optical-electronic system with a thermal imaging sensor and artificial intelligence, V-BAT ensures effective detection and recognition of targets. The duration of the drone's flight is up to 10 hours. The fuselage of the V-BAT measures 9 feet (2.74 meters) with a wingspan of 9.7 feet (2.95 meters). The system works with Hivemind's own Shield AI technology, which allows it to fly autonomously in the harsh conditions of the activity of enemy air defense assets without GPS or communication. This software supports control of four V-BATs and a software application is currently being developed to increase the number of drones for use in swarms. The UAV is powered by a 24-horsepower twin-cylinder engine that provides a top speed of 56 miles (90 kilometers) per hour and an altitude of up to 20,000 feet (6,100 meters). The UAV can be transported in a pickup truck and assembled by two employees in less than 20 minutes, making it a true expeditionary system designed for dynamic movement and fluid mission sets. So far, Shield AI produces about 120 machines a year, each of which costs about $1 million (although the price will be lower when buying in bulk). As for the future of the unmanned system, according to Brandon Tseng, president of the Shield AI startup, the next stage of development is the integration of missiles into the V-BAT. -We put into production a Northrop Grumman missile called Hatchet, which is a laser-guided munition that will be released at the end next year,- Tseng reported. At the same time, V-BAT is one of the contenders for participation in the Pentagon's FTUAS project, which should replace drones. 7_Shadow->Textron RQ-7 Shadow. The final decision on this program is expected in 2025, and the introduction of the drone into the troops in 2026. V-BAT Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) presentation.

-Nona- in action: how to hit with the first shot. The story of the gun commander from the legendary ...	He is currently a gun commander in the 25th Separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade. How to hit a moving tank with a 2C9 gun? But is it possible to destroy an enemy assault group with the first shot? Yuriy told our correspondent: -I have been at war since the first days of the large-scale invasion. He came to the TCC, was assigned to the 25th separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade. Our calculation is fighting on a 2C9 gun, it is a 120 caliber. I started as a gunner, now I am a gun commander. As an interesting fact, I can tell about one case. Somehow art reconnaissance could not work with us due to bad weather conditions. And our infantry on the front edge saw the gap we gave on the objective. They gave us the coordinates of this gap. We adjusted accordingly and hit the target. It was an enemy assault group. There was another case. We started working. We received a reply. We quickly rolled over and found our way from a new place almost without preparation and achieved the goal we started working on from the previous place with the first shot. And it was also an enemy assault group. We have 120 calibers, which, as a rule, we work with on the front edge. Rarely do we technically shoot. Recently, we have been working with mines at short distances, 4-5 kilometers. Why mines, because the 2С9 is a self-propelled mortar gun. Can work both as a mortar and as a cannon. Simply put, this is a rifled mortar. Well, 2C9 is a self-propelled, tracked. She is better known by the name -Nona-. It was still made on the basis of BMD. Can -swim-, by the way. I really like this gun. Shoots well. Although the barrel is not very long. I still remember the incident. This is August 2022, Bakhmut direction. First morning, our next objective is an enemy stronghold. Once an enemy BMP drove up to him. And we hit her with the second shot. The next morning we are again given the same objective. And another BMP arrives at the same place. And we impress her again!.. This is really memorable. We were sent a photo report later. That cheered us up. Then, during the Lyman offensive, things got interesting in October 2022. It is in the area where the reservoir cascades along the Zherebets River. The enemy was on the left bank in Terny. And we hunted a tank there. And of course he was moving. And somewhere from the tenth shot we got him. We didn't see it, we were just given the coordinates: -plus 10 meters-, -to the left 0.01-. And in a couple of minutes we were informed that it had caught fire. It was not destroyed, but it was disabled. At some point, we even wanted to drop this tank without shooting at it. But with the last shot they did hit. In order for your calculation to work well, it must be prepared. When there is free time, for example, with a gunner to -pull up- certain moments that you noted during combat work. It is also very important to analyze the results of shooting. And, of course, the consistency of the calculation is important. Everyone should be like one family. So that there are no quarrels in the team. Because sometimes for two weeks we sit together in our cannon, in a closed space. Therefore, it is important that there is psychological compatibility. It is also necessary for the gun commander to always have a leadership position. Because there are various stressful situations at the front, when your subordinates can get confused and at this moment they just need to be told what they should do. The support of the commander in such episodes is very important.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/nona-v-diyi-yak-vluchyty-z-pershogo-postrilu-istoriya-komandyra-garmaty-z-legendarnoyi-25-ky/	2024-12-07T20:48:02-08:00
Rospropaganda is already in Denmark: a fake booklet - gives advice - how to deal with TCC in Ukraine	However, it is a fake. The Embassy of the Kingdom of Denmark stated that the embassy does not provide similar recommendations to its own citizens. Publication -Vox Ukraine- z-ttsk-video->approached for a comment to the Embassy of the Kingdom of Denmark in Ukraine. In response, the representative of the diplomatic institution explained that the Embassy never provided such -recommendations- and did not participate in the creation of this video. In addition, the fake text is poorly written in Danish and does not correspond to the official communication style of the Danish authorities. TCC and joint ventures are one of the favorite topics of Russian fakers. Every day they launch another fool into the information space, which aims to disrupt the mobilization in Ukraine in any way possible. Earlier ArmyInform reported about a fake, the British Embassy allegedly provides its citizens with leaflets advising them to avoid TCCs in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/rospropaganda-vzhe-v-daniyi-fejk-pro-buklet-daye-porady-yak-povodytys-z-tczk-v-ukrayini/	2024-12-07T20:21:02-08:00
The Ukrainian military man - Sei- played one of the main roles in the world-famous game S.T.A.L.K.E....	The game has become a true quintessence of Ukrainian meanings and context. At least take into account the fact that in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl used 420 (!) Ukrainian songs of the main and secondary characters of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was embodied by Ukrainian theater, film and dubbing actors, and, in particular, those who joined the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. One of them is Oleksandr Laptiy with the call sign -Sey-. A theater and film actor, since 2023 a serviceman of the 1st Special Forces Battalion of the 12th Azov Special Forces Brigade. The soldier of the National Guard became the prototype of one of the main characters - Scar. During an interview, ArmyInform asked a serviceman about how he joined the team of game creators, how fellow gamers reacted when they learned that a colleague had joined the creation of a cult product; about personal permission for filming from Brigadier General Denys Prokopenko, about how S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 sharpens the perception of the Ukrainian context in the world community, as well as how he joined the ranks of the Defense Forces, using his official position (although he had armor from mobilization). - Please tell us how this story started: that you became the prototype of one of the main characters of the Stalker game. - This story began in November 2021. Before the full-scale invasion, I was a professional actor, drama theater director, and Ukrainian cinematographer. And one day I got a message on messenger from a casting director working on S.T.A.L.K.E.R. And then she says that she wants to invite me to the casting, I still didn't know what character it was about. At first I thought it was a prank. Because S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - my favorite game that I played ten years ago and I was waiting for the second part! And here is the message! I actually thought it was a joke. But: why not try? I went to the central office of GSC Company group, met the casting director, the person who wrote the scripts, and they gave me a text with the words: -Let's try.- And I saw that my prototype was Scar. And it is an iconic character for all gamers who play S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Everyone who played the first part of the game -Clear Sky- knows that it ends with intrigue, and it is not clear whether Scar died. The global gaming community wanted to know if Scar survived. And then they give me texts. And I find out that Scar survived - but I'm signing hundreds of non-disclosure documents at the same time, and I'm not even allowed to say that I'm somehow involved with S.T.A.L.K.E.R., not to tell some storylines(laughs - ed.). Then I realized that everything is serious, me they said that I was suitable for them and that I should expect a call to the filming site. But first, as is appropriate in computer games, a 3D model is made. This is quite an interesting process: you enter a room that is simply hung with cameras, cameras, more than three hundred of them. You sit down, you are photographed from different angles, you act out several emotions, which will then directly become the prototypes of Scar's emotions. Then, in February, the shooting process began. I had quite a few shooting days, but after several shoots that took place on the 19th of February, the next one was supposed to be in the 20th of February. But everything ended. And even later, when I joined the ranks of Azov, I received a message that the work continued and that the developers would like me to voice my character. I'm like, wow! But now everything depended on the command. - Was the command consulted before this, or was it in favor? Do you mind? Were there agreements? — There was no command against. Of course, there was a lot of agreement. I immediately came to the combatant and said: -I have such a request for you, friend combatant, it is unusual. I need KZV (short-term release of a serviceman), but not for family reasons.- I told this story and that I needed to be in Kyiv for a few days, for the first session. The combatant replied that it should probably be decided by the brigade commander. He was just going to see him on business, and he promised to ask about me. An hour later, he returned with the answer: -Radish has gone haywire. Pack your things in the evening - fly to Kyiv in the morning.- - Was it for you an image and a thrill that you became a part of this legendary game, because you said that you were already familiar with this game? - Of course I played. In the process of preparing for filming, I went through the first part again to remind myself of the plot. Scar has changed during this time, as the story has been 10 years in the past and he has survived several radioactive releases. In the second part, Scar became a rather impulsive and expressive character, although in the first part he was mostly silent. Yes, it was valuable for me to participate in the creation of this game. First of all, when you read the script, you have incredible emotions. After all, I knew the answer to the question of whether the Scar was alive or not, but I could not say about it. This is a secret that I kept until the release (laughs - ed.). - Do people in your unit play this game, acquaintances, friends? When they find out that you were involved in the creation of a new -Stalker- - how do they react? It's very emotional, because some people don't like the Internet, others like a laptop. Yes, there are fans of the game in the unit. When they found out that I was involved in the creation process, they constantly asked when the keys would be available, they said: -There is a promotional version, give me the keys- (laughs - editor). I asked them to wait a little, because then they won't be interested if I spoil something, the intrigue will disappear, and this is the whole excitement for a gamer: to keep tension while playing the game. This is very cool! - When did you first admit to your brothers? - I didn't say that I was playing Scar, but our brigade media service made a clip where they said that an Azov was involved in this game. And everyone's like, -Oops!- (laughs - ed.). There were a lot of questions. But I asked to wait for the release. —The first part of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. many associated it with the Russian Federation, thought it was Russian. Now there is a clear realization that this is a Ukrainian product. In your opinion, is Ukrainianness advancing in the world because of this game? — Yes, I heard such an opinion that, they say, the first S.T.A.L.K.E.R. was kind of pro-Russian, but this is not a completely correct statement, in my opinion. Because the basis of the game is the real events of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Then there was the Soviet Union, and for some reason Russia took and appropriated the history of the USSR, although it is the history of specific republics. Therefore, this was another attempt by the Russians to appropriate and steal our history. Of course, the first S.T.A.L.K.E.R. was Russian-speaking at that time, because the Russian market is much larger. But I think it was purely a marketing ploy to attract a larger audience of gamers. This should be taken into account. But I will not say that the game was -pro-Russian-. This is just a fictional world that is built on the history of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. And to think that the Russian Federation is a descendant of this history is not correct. And now that all-out war has broken out thanks to the Headmasters, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. became a purposeful promotion of Ukrainian content not only throughout Europe, but also throughout the world. Russia was completely forgotten, and it's great, it was simply taken and cut off. I watched the streams of foreign bloggers (Americans, Germans, French, Koreans), and they all advise not English dubbing, but rather Ukrainian, because it is more emotional and closer. When I was working on the voice over, I was of course shown the English material. And I heard the voice of the person who voices my character in the English version. And for him the word -Pripyat- is just a word, he does not know what it is. I am from Chernihiv. I remember this disaster. I know what Pripyat is, the exclusion zone, the red forest&#8230; For me, these are close words, and this is the Ukrainian context. More than once I have heard that even those people who do not understand the Ukrainian language are advised to turn on Ukrainian dubbing with subtitles. And the music is powerful, this is also a big plus. - Games are a whole culture, a separate universe. Do you have the feeling that you will Ukrainianize this direction? What are you doing with information on Ukraine at a time when a large-scale and informational confrontation is going on?... — Yes, definitely. The war is hybrid, and an important application of this, shall we say, soft influence on the Western world. This is how we advance our narratives, our war, that we are in now. We introduce the Western world to our culture so that they see that it is fundamentally different from Russian culture and art. — Tell us about yourself: when did you join the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine? Why -Azov- in particular? — This, by the way, is the first question that is voiced at an interview. When you walk into a recruiting center and the person representing Azov asks: -Why Azov?- I thought I should give some kind of non-standard answer, according to my civilian profession. And I answered as follows: -Azov- is a subdivision that organically combined one of the principles of ancient philosophy: kalokagatia. This is a combination of physical qualities and moral and ethical ones. They looked at me carefully and answered: -It's not that simple, but we're not on the way to it.- But I am sure that Azov is the realization of the principle of kalokagatia. Just look at the commanders: Redis's friend, Kalina's friend, Gandalf's friend. These are people with an incredible education, with an intellectual base, they are constantly developing. This is the real Ukrainian elite that builds the idea of ​​the Ukrainian nation. They asked me how old I am. I answered that it was 49. They said that they take it up to 45. I answered that at the age of 49 I passed BZVP and did not ring the bell. It was in June 2023. Although the 20-year-olds were knocking. But I'm hardened by the 90s, I'm going strong-willed until the end (laughs - ed.). - And until June 2023, what were you doing? - When in February 2022 year, the enemy was in Chernigov district, I immediately took my family out and stayed in the city. They worked on improving the defense capability. Then, when the enemy left, I received an offer to become an adviser on issues of culture, arts, tourism, and religion to the head of OVA Vyacheslav Anatoliyovych Chaus. A bunch of tasks were cut there, they had to be done. But at the same time, when the information campaign on the creation of offensive brigades began, I began to think that I should somehow be involved in this process. I applied to several divisions, but I received feedback only from Azov. Then I went to the governor and said: -In 3 days I will be called to the basic course.- He was a little stunned, but generally supported my decision. That's how I joined Azov. — What is the most vivid memory of your service in -Azov-? When was it dangerous, when was it scary, and when was it fun? War is a point of contact where everything mixes: tragedy, comedy, life, death, dark humor, tears, disappointment, elation. It's always scary when it flies. When KABU rustles and you don't know where exactly it will fly. One of the bright moments happened to us in the area of ​​concentration, we were then standing in the direction of Serebryan Forestry near Liman. Three rockets arrived, 150 meters from us. There was a big fire, urgent evacuation of property. And we had several kittens (now in the war, they are born in packs). And here's my brother standing with two kittens in this chaos, during the re-detonation, when everything explodes&#8230; He stands holding them both under his arms, and they just hang like two -sausages- and do not understand what is happening. I then thought that if boys in such a dangerous situation are still thinking about kittens, then they are cool boys. We then evacuated the kittens too. All are alive, only the boys had severe contusions, and the property burned down. —Many people do not join the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine due to a number of fears about mobilization. Did you have any fears and how did you deal with them? What would you advise civilians who have not yet joined the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine - as a person who also left their comfort zone at one time? , I used my official position(slyly smiles - ed.). I just had armor from mobilization. But I called the head of the TCC, introduced myself as an adviser to the head of the OVA and described the situation that I had to be in the unit in two days. I was accompanied by a person and everything worked out. This is how I once used my official position. And about fears&#8230; They arise from the fact that many people do not know how it is organized: how the army is organized directly in the conditions of war. For some reason, people think that if you get into the army, you will definitely go to the trenches. But now everything is arranged in such a way that a person is given the opportunity to choose a specialty and a position according to the skills of civilian life. If you are, for example, an electrician or an auto mechanic, you will be taken with your hands in any department, because the equipment is like consumables, it constantly needs to be repaired, and there are not enough people to fix this process 24/7. The army needs people. And the fear of the army comes from ignorance. Communication is a very important issue, and a very difficult one. Information removes any fears. Yes, war is scary, of course. But don't be afraid only of fools. - What for you will be a victory in the Russian-Ukrainian war? - A difficult question. This is a very difficult question&#8230; I think the big break will be a win for me. There is a great silence inside me. And, probably, there will be men's tears&#8230; Because at first you keep this list of guys (dead brothers - ed.), and then you understand when there are more than 40 of them&#8230; Therefore there will be silence inside me. And thanks to those who gave the most. And you will remember everyone by their call sign&#8230; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/ukrayinskyj-vijskovyj-sej-zigrav-odnu-z-golovnyh-rolej-u-vidomij-na-uves-svit-gri-s-t-a-l-k-e-r-intervyu/	2024-12-07T20:03:08-08:00

Eggs for less than 17 hryvnias, women's uniforms and inclusive dry rations: the state operator of th...	The state rear operator managed to save 17 billion hryvnias for the year, said the General Director of the agency Arsen Zhumadilov. According to him, the need for the total cost of 92 billion hryvnias was proved to them. It was closed with almost 700 contracts worth 75 billion hryvnias. The saved 17 billion was redirected to cover additional needs. -We bought almost 163,000 body armor. This would be enough to fully supply the armies of Hungary, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Belgium, and Sweden combined,- &#8211; noted Arsen Zhumadilov. The Director General of DOT also recalled that this year clothing and protection for female military personnel were purchased, inclusive dry rations were developed (halal, kosher and plant-based rations) and the DOT chain system was implemented, which reduced the duration of movement of documents in food for the Armed Forces by 4 times. There were also certain problems. For example, scandals involving the supply of low-quality stew and a batch of meat in which a needle from a syringe was found. According to Arsen Zhumadilov, the agency reacted to these cases and implemented additional measures to control suppliers so that such problems do not occur again. At the beginning of next year, the State rear operator plans to introduce its own NPS tool &#8211; collect and analyze feedback from suppliers, brigades, individual units and military personnel. Currently, DOT supplies food, clothing, fuel and lubricants, and IT technologies for the needs of the Armed Forces. We remind you that exactly one year ago the Ministry of Defense fundamentally changed the approach to providing for our military.

- We are constantly working to ensure that the lands along the state border, in accordance with the ...	He stated this during the telethon -Edyny Novyni-. Along the length of the border, this shade can be from 30 to 50 meters. And if we talk about the border with Belarus and Russia, this section can be wider - up to two kilometers, but it is not necessary that all this land is transferred to the property of the military units of the DPSU. It is necessary to understand that the lands can be state property, communal, private, and there are also lands along the border belonging to the nature reserve fund. And if we talk about the last category, then they can be of state or local importance. And it is precisely in order to transfer the lands of state reserves to military units that there should be a Presidential Decree. Therefore, the relevant Decree of December 5 reduces the land of the Chernobyl reserve and the land with a width of 45 meters along the state border is transferred to the ownership of the military units of the DPSU for the arrangement and maintenance of engineering and fortification facilities. This will allow us to continue increasing the engineering arrangement of the border, maintenance of crossings, border signs, equipping technical systems of terrain control, video surveillance systems. So that we have proper arrangements on the state border in a direction that is threatening to us. We continue to strengthen the border with Belarus along its entire length, because this is a threatening direction for us as long as Belarus remains under the influence of Russia. We must have strong defensive positions there to repel any attack should the situation change. At the moment, Russia does not have a sufficient number of units, forces and means on the territory of Belarus that could pose a threat to us. We remind you, situation in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Khortytsya- military defense unit, it remains tense, but controlled by the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/my-vedemo-postijno-robotu-shhob-zemli-vzdovzh-derzhavnogo-kordonu-vidpovidno-do-zemelnogo-kodeksu-buly-peredani-do-vijskovyh-chastyn-dpsu-andrij-demchenko/	2024-12-07T08:12:57-08:00
the kremlin drags on the war with a cheap mortgage	This is reported by Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Despite huge budget payments to ordinary Russians for those who volunteer to sign a contract to participate in the war, the Kremlin faces a steady decline in the number of people willing to fight. Instead, high losses require a constant supply of manpower. Under such circumstances, the Russian authorities invent new and new forms of encouragement that would force the residents of the Russian Federation to go and kill Ukrainians. Subsidized mortgages are another attempt to solve the issue of reducing army recruitment. Currently, the mortgage rate without benefits reaches 35% in the Russian Federation. There is also a so-called preferential -family mortgage-, where the rate is about 6%, but this program is constantly underfunded from the budget. Because of this, the first installment on a preferential mortgage has already been raised to 50%, which makes it unaffordable for most Russians. We remind you that EU countries on the eve of Donald's inauguration Trump's initiative to create a fund for joint defense projects and arms purchases is being discussed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/kreml-zatyaguye-na-vijnu-deshevoyu-ipotekoyu/	2024-12-07T07:53:13-08:00

Nazar Voloshyn, spokesman for the -Khortytsia- OSU. -Of course, the situation is changing dynamically, and in our area of ​​responsibility, 150 clashes with the enemy took place per day. The enemy attacked the Pokrovsky, Kurakhivskyi and Vremiivskyi directions the most. There were 48 enemy assaults in the Pokrovsky direction, 35 in the Kurakhivskyi direction, and 21 in the Vremiivskyi direction. Also, during the past day, the enemy in our area of ​​responsibility carried out 5 airstrikes, dropped 8 guided and aerial bombs, carried out more than 3,200 attacks on populated areas with various types of weapons and 250 strikes with kamikaze drones,- he emphasized. Already this day, 11 enemy assaults took place, which carried out more than 300 attacks on positions and populated areas using various types of weapons. The enemy is trying to carry out active offensive actions, but the Defense Forces restrain the offensive, inflicting considerable losses on him both in manpower and in equipment. The Kurakhiv direction is important for the enemy to align the front line. This will allow him to regroup, withdraw some units for recovery, and then, having accumulated resources, conduct further offensive actions. The Vremiiv direction in the northwest of the Donetsk region is also a priority for the enemy, because it is one of the elements of the Kurakhiv-Pokrovsky offensive. The day before yesterday, the enemy was more active there, there were 37 enemy assaults. However, the Defense Forces, having recaptured the settlement of Novy Komar, improved their tactical position. In the Pokrovsky direction, the formations of two Russian combined armies are concentrated against us. These are the 2nd and 41st armies of the -Center- troop group. In the Kramatorsk direction, near Chasovoy Yar, the 98th Airborne Division, which was twice defeated by our defenders, and which was repeatedly replenished with personnel, is standing against us. In the Pokrovsky direction, one of our brigades restrains the assaults of four motorized rifle brigades of the Russian army at once, one of which is the 74th motorized rifle brigade. The enemy is trying to move its personnel and equipment between directions in the east of Ukraine. In particular, in the Pokrovsky, Kurakhivskyi, Vremiivskyi and Toretsk directions. Where he suffers a significant defeat, he tries to compensate for the lost forces and resources from other directions. We remind you that Oleksandr Syrsky released the video, on which our drones destroy enemy equipment and infantry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/sytuacziya-v-zoni-vidpovidalnosti-osuv-hortyczya-zalyshayetsya-napruzhenoyu-vtim-kontrolovanoyu-sylamy-oborony/	2024-12-07T07:31:33-08:00

Prosecutors proved that during the occupation of Shevchenkive village of Kupyan district, the former policeman voluntarily went over to the side of the enemy.

Collaborators at the maintenance of Luhansk region prepare children for -their-	This is reported by a> Center of national resistance. The main condition for victory was the ability to control drones. According to the -educators-, it was the control of the drones, as well as the best results in the dress and song competition, that showed that the children were continuing the age-old Cossack traditions. -After all, such talents demonstrate the readiness of young men and women to join the ranks of the Kremlin army at any moment,- the organizers said. The students of the fake Luhansk Cossack Cadet Corps won. Distorting the historical truth, brainwashing is the Kremlin's tradition, which criminally takes root in all territories where the occupiers set foot. The topic of Cossacks is particularly distorted for propagandists. And it is mostly used in schools. Cossacks in Ukrainian schools in the temporarily occupied territories have already become teachers. For example, in the Kherson region, these representatives of the occupation forces conduct lessons on so-called political information. Children are told about how Russian peace is being implemented on Ukrainian lands destroyed by them, films are shown about the beauty of the Russian Federation and how important it is to become a part of Russia.

The Russian occupiers' use of the labor of the unprotected population of the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine is a -normal practice-. Since the beginning of the year, the Luhansk character of the Kremlin program has been actively implemented in the schools of the Luhansk region.

But luckily for us, they have no success, painstaking combat work is going on every day,- noted -Enei-, the spokesman emphasized that they do not ignore any Russian occupier, they understand this, that's why many of their infantry go to deserters. -The enemy is trying to land those who are left closer to our positions so that they somehow conduct combat operations against such legendary brigades as ours and neighboring ones,- the speaker noted. The specificity of the work in the Kursk region is that maneuver work is carried out - both defense and offensive. -This is used by both the enemy and us. However, many enemy infantry do not even reach the point they were assigned. And because of the great losses, they are not morally ready to fight even in the Kursk region, not ready to perform the tasks that their leadership sets them,- Eneis summarized.

The process of replacing the document will continue until the end of December 2025. If the farmers do not fulfill the new conditions of the Russian terrorists, their equipment will be confiscated. Meanwhile, in the temporarily occupied Zaporizhzhia, Putin's henchmen began to fight hysterically over possible farmers' riots.

The occupiers have blocked exits from Aidar and are simulating the restoration of factories	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, head of the Luhansk OVA. The invaders organize queues of cars and check local residents and guests according to their lists. This time, they are looking not only for ATO/OOS members, but also for their relatives, even distant ones. According to Artem Lysohor, this is how Russian law enforcement agencies try to achieve -results- for reporting at the end of the year. At the same time, the occupation authorities announce the attraction of investors to the industrial enterprises of the front-line cities. However, in reality, no activity was observed on the destroyed objects. During the two years of occupation, demining of the territories has not even begun. It is known that the launch of the -Azot- chemical plant in Severodonetsk has been postponed for the -next few years-. Currently, the occupiers are trying to restore only one of dozens of shops, which has been operating as a separate enterprise since the 1990s. Raids and imitation of industrial recovery become a cover for repression and attempts to create the appearance of economic activity in the occupied territories.

Not so effective drones and DRG in the rear: what winter has changed at the front	Oleksandr Danylenko, the head of the group of interaction with the media of the State Border Service -Hart- brigade, told about this on the -Social News- broadcast. In particular, in Vovchansk, the enemy storms up to ten times a day. However, the border guards of the -Hart- brigade repulsed the enemy, intelligence revealed the movement of the enemy, attempts to set up positions. Enemy DRGs are also trying to sneak into the rear, but our guys detect them. Therefore, the situation is under control. -Regroupings associated with fairly large losses occur constantly among the enemy. The number of manpower and equipment is kept at approximately the same level, but this is enough to make breakthrough attempts in the area,- Oleksandr Danylenko noted. In addition, snow and frost leave their mark. At low temperatures, drones, of which there are many, fly less because the batteries drain faster. And when it snows, visibility becomes worse, drones become less effective. -Also, due to the low temperatures, thermal imagers can see people and equipment better, and tracks are better visible on the snow. And this must be taken into account in order to be invisible to the enemy. And the enemy, unfortunately, also takes this into account,- the spokesman noted. Oleksandr Danylenko noted that every day our servicemen with artillery, mortars, and drones destroy enemy positions, equipment, guns, vehicles, mortars, personnel, and destroy their fortifications. -The enemy is suffering significant losses both in manpower and equipment. It's not very easy for him here, that's why he sits and waits, and with the help of the DRG he tries to feel our weak points, but he has no success,- the speaker added. As reported by ArmyInform, in the direction of Kurakhiv Russians maintain their large presence and do not lose their ambitious plans to move forward. However, they are hindered by the successful combat operations of our fighters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/ne-taki-efektyvni-drony-ta-drg-v-tylu-shho-zminyla-zyma-na-fronti/	2024-12-07T02:09:00-08:00

Armored toy for Kim Jong-un: North Korea inspected a new tank	Arms market experts interviewed by reporters of the American magazine Newsweek say that North Korea has introduced a new main combat tank (OBT), the design of which is similar to modern Western counterparts. Tianma-2 -resembles modern Western and American main battle tanks very much,- the Army Recognition Group, a Belgian company, said in turn , which conducts military analysis. Experts from a group that studied images of the Tianma-2 released by the North Korean news agency compared the tank to the German Leopard 2A7/A8, known for its advanced and modern armor, firepower and digital systems. Experts in the basics of tank construction have determined that the layout of the North Korean MBT involves the placement of the driver-mechanic at the front on the left, the turret located in the center, and the power plant located at the rear. The tank is manned by a crew of three, supported by an automatic loading system for the main weapon, a 125 mm smoothbore gun. The turret design includes modular composite armor that provides improved protection against kinetic energy projectiles (APFSDS) and cumulative charges (HEAT projectiles). The modular design allows for quick replacement of damaged armor sections in the field, which is characteristic of many modern main battle tanks. In addition, dynamic armor (ERA) covers the front and sides of the hull, and special wire protection is installed in the rear to protect against rocket-propelled grenades and other cumulative charges. One of the most striking updates of this model of the North Korean battleship is the integration of an active protection system (APS), which is similar to the Trophy APS from Israel and its European counterparts. The Tianma-2's APS system includes radar sensors on each side of its turret for threat detection, as well as countermeasures designed to intercept incoming anti-tank missiles and projectiles. To further strengthen the tank's defenses, the turret roof is equipped with an anti-tank launcher to combat drones, reflecting North Korea's emphasis on countering new aerial threats. The upgraded Tianma-2 turret also includes a Remotely Operated Warfare Station (ROWS) equipped with a 12.7 mm heavy machine gun, as well as launchers capable of firing anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs). The tank is equipped with a panoramic sight system for observing the battlefield and conducting the battle by the commander and gunner, which provides enhanced opportunities to capture targets with their subsequent escort. Originally unveiled as the M2020 during a military parade on October 10, 2020, the Cheonma-2 has undergone significant changes since its first public appearance. It was officially named Cheonma-2 after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's visit to the Defense Development Academy on May 29, 2024. The original Cheonma-2 demonstrated North Korea's desire to modernize its armored forces, and the new Tianma-2 builds on that prototype by integrating advanced technology and improved battlefield survivability. According to Army Recognition experts, the exhibition presentation of Tianma-2 emphasizes that North Korea continues to focus on the development of local military technologies capable of competing with global standards. The inclusion of advanced features such as APS, modular armor and counter-drone capabilities signal a shift to equipping your forces with tanks designed for the high-intensity scenarios of modern warfare. Defense market experts noted that given the technological leaps demonstrated in its design, the appearance of the Tianma-2 in North Korea's arsenal is likely to attract close attention from regional and global military analysts. Although North Korea has not provided official specifications or performance data for the new MBT, visual evidence from the exhibition underscores its desire to create a powerful and modern main battle tank. The event adds a new dimension to the regional security landscape, as Tianma-2 could potentially strengthen North Korea's armored forces, influencing tactical and strategic calculations on the Korean Peninsula and beyond. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xM_Rm2m7bA Video: Presentation of the new main battle tank of the DPRK Tianma-2.

What awards are in the system of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the Armed Forces of Ukraine	Awards are primarily a moral value, because they testify to the recognition by the state and society of a person's real merits. After 2014, with a review of the war in Ukraine, the entire award system of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the Armed Forces of Ukraine was compositionally and ideologically modified to reflect the historical progress of the Ukrainian military. The Department for the Development of Military Symbols and Heraldry of the Central Directorate for the Development of Material Support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is responsible for the development of military awards, which, in response to ArmyInform's request, reported what awards are in the system of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the Armed Forces of Ukraine and what are the principles and ideology of creation modern Ukrainian military awards. Awards in the system of the IOU and ZSU are divided into four main complexes. The first is the departmental incentive awards of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The current decorations of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine are established by the Order of the Ministry of Defense No. 392 dated November 21, 2022. According to it, servicemen and employees of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as other persons, can be awarded the badges -Cross of Special Merit- and -For Exemplary Service-, as well as medals: -Iron Cross-, -Knight's Cross-, -Military Cross-. , -Cross of Valor-, -For Wound-, -Cross of Honor-, -Golden Trident-, -For Strengthening defense capabilities-, -3rd point of the military brotherhood-, -Defender of Ukraine-, -For assistance to the defense-, -Cross of the Ground Forces-, -Cross of the Air Forces-, -Cross of the Naval Forces-, -Cross of Special Operations Forces-, -Cross of the Forces Territorial Defense-, -Logistics Forces Cross-, -Support Forces Cross-, -Medical Forces Cross-, -Airborne Assault Forces Cross-, -Cross Communications and Cyber ​​Security Troops, Cross of the State Special Transport Service, Peacekeeper Warrior, Service Veteran, 20 Years of Faithful Service, 15 Years of Faithful Service, 10 Years of Faithful Service. The second award complex is the incentive awards of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine -Cold weapon- and -Firearm-, established by the order of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine No. 693 dated 10/23/2012. According to this order, the -Firearms- badge is a pistol, a revolver and a hunting firearm, and the -Meadow Weapons- badge is a saber, broadsword and a club. The third award complex is the Honorary Badges of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, established by the order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine No. 187 dated 07/05/2023. This order, in particular, established the following badges of honor: -Cross of Merit-, -Cross of the Brave-, -Steel Cross-, -Silver Cross-, -Golden Cross-, -Military Honor Cross-, -3a conscientious service-, -Combatant cross- with the breastplate -Honor and memory- next to it, -For invincibility-, -For life preserved-, -3a contribution of the army-, -The best sergeant (sergeant) of the Armed Forces of Ukraine-, -For combat valor-, -Shield of the winner-. And, finally, the fourth complex is the Commemorative breastplates of military units, established by the order of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine No. 478 of 03.08.2021, which is entitled -Regulations on the commemorative breastplates of military administration bodies, units, military units , institutions and organizations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine-. According to this provision, commemorative badges were established -with the purpose of developing the symbols of military administration bodies, units, military units, institutions and organizations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, increasing the prestige of military service, strengthening military-patriotic education.- Drawings of breast insignia are developed taking into account the specifics of the activity of the military unit, its affiliation to the relevant type of Armed Forces, type of troops (service), history and combat traditions, place of deployment, etc. When creating award systems, specialists were primarily guided by the provisions of Decrees of the President of Ukraine No. 694 dated May 18, 2000. -On streamlining heraldry in Ukraine- and No. 365 of May 30, 2012. -About departmental encouraging awards-. However, ideologically and artistically, awards were created based on the position of continuity of modern awards from the symbols and award traditions of the period of the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917–1921, awards of the UHP government in exile, awards of Ukrainian national emigrant organizations of 1930–1990, awards of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army of 1942–1950 years Some awards are based on historical prototypes. In particular, the -Iron Cross- medal originates from the single combat award of the UNR Iron Cross -For the Winter Campaign and Battles-, established by the order of the Main Command of the Army and Fleet of the UHP dated 10.19.1920, signed by Simon Petlyura, the chief commander of the troops of the UNR Directory. The official incentive award of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine -Golden Trident- originates from the award project of the Western region of the Ukrainian People's Republic, established on April 30, 1919, which was not implemented more than a hundred years ago. A number of insignia of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are based on the awards of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. For the first time, the UPA Main Command introduced the awards system by its order No. 3/44 dated January 27, 1944. The design projects of these awards and the technology of their minting in underground conditions were developed by a member of the regional reference office of propaganda of the OUN Branch of the North-Western Ukrainian Lands, the famous graphic designer Nil Khasevych (1905–1952) and his student -Svyrid-. They were approved by the UGVR on June 30, 1950. An equally important element of the award ideology and award practice was the study of modern phalerist traditions of partner countries and their comparison with the national phalerist heritage. In particular, an in-depth analysis was carried out regarding the military awards of the USA, Great Britain, the Republic of Poland, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the French Republic.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/yaki-nagorody-ye-v-systemi-minoborony-ukrayiny-ta-zbrojnyh-syl-ukrayiny/	2024-12-06T21:03:42-08:00
Mobilization of volunteers in the Transcarpathian way: about -chips- recruiting, monetary reward and...	But the main thing is that they give a 100% guarantee that you will be sent to serve in the military unit in which you want to serve or they will choose the appropriate unit for your specialty. In addition, they also give a monetary reward of 20 thousand hryvnias for the fact that you are called up for service under a contract from the Tyachiv district of Transcarpathia. Active military personnel and their families are provided free of charge with rehabilitation programs and rest in the sanatoriums of Solotvyno in Transcarpathia. How did you manage to establish an effective recruiting mechanism? Why do people believe the servicemen of Tyachiv RTCC and SP and go to Transcarpathia from all over Ukraine? What is their main -feature-? ArmyInform asked the head of the Tyachiv district TCC and SP Colonel Andrii Oleschuk about this: -Our recruiting system works simply and efficiently. About a year ago, we realized that we needed to change our approach to recruiting candidates for military service under a contract. We analyzed our work and formed several important criteria, which gave, in fact, the result of recruiting volunteers. Right now, we are exceeding our contract staffing plan by 300%. So, first, we introduced advertising in social networks, in the media, and created printed campaign products. Social advertising is aimed at different strata of the population and it is conventionally divided into three directions: — Russia has attacked and the Motherland must be defended; — advertising that shows the destroyed cities and villages of our Ukraine; — a social package and state social guarantees: financial support, rewards, vacations, career growth. Plus an additional incentive from us to recruiters in the amount of 20 thousand hryvnias. The first two ads worked well in 2022-2023. People are looking more at cash benefits and social security issues this year. The second is communication with military units. We work with many military units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. First of all, these are the local unit of the TrO Forces, the 128th separate Transcarpathian mountain assault brigade, the 47th separate mechanized brigade -Magura- and many other units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Third, the creation of comfortable conditions, documentary support for conscripts, humane treatment of candidates and their social support. Of course, no lies, work on mutual trust and feedback from the recruiters themselves. This, by the way, is the most important criterion of our work. If the recruiter has a letter of recommendation from a military unit in his hands and he has had experience in military service for the past 10 years, then the process of filing documents together with the VLK (if everything is in order with his health - ed.) goes as quickly as possible. Unless, of course, an additional medical examination is required. If everything is OK: before 12 o'clock and the serviceman is already leaving for his military unit. Is it fast, I think so. Very often there are situations when people come from other regions, because at the local TCC it takes more time to process documents and send them to the army. And guys don't want to wait. For example, in Kyiv, one man was processed for 5 days, as soon as he learned about the speed of work of Tyachiv RTCC and SP, he immediately went to us with the documents. In general, they come from different regions of Ukraine. From Kherson, Kyiv, Dnipro, Ivano-Frankivsk, Lviv, Chernihiv, etc. We estimated that almost 60% of the people who came to us could not register for service in the TCC and SP at their place of residence. Next, if, for example, a person who has never served, but wants to join the ranks of the Marines, then together we will find him the unit in which he wants to go. This applies to all majors. Sapper, signalman, paratrooper, tanker, anti-aircraft gunner, stormtrooper, medic, cook, military sailor, etc. Again, it doesn't matter how long the search itself takes. The recruiter lives, eats and rests on weekends as much as necessary. The main criterion is that a person should be satisfied with the choice and be sure to serve where he wants. We had an incident. A man who worked in civil aviation arrived. Well, we spent a month and a half looking for a suitable specialty for him and a part in which he wanted to serve. And all this time he lived here in Tyachevo. We take people where they want to go. And we guarantee them that they will get to serve there. There are, of course, isolated cases when recruiters, who already come to the Training Centers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to pass the BZVP, are not always assigned to the military units to which they wanted. We, for our part, can no longer influence these things. Financial support is provided by the Tyachiv District and Transcarpathian Regional Council. These are primarily united territorial communities, private entrepreneurs and philanthropists from our area, who renovated sleeping quarters, toilets and showers. That is, they provided normal living conditions for volunteers. Plus, they provide funds for a cash reward of 20,000 hryvnias to everyone who enlisted from us to join the army. Food itself: purchase of products, their delivery, cooking itself. This is all for the charity funds of our entrepreneurs. And what is interesting, military personnel who have already served some time on the front lines can come here to us on vacation with their families and undergo rehabilitation in sanatoriums and recovery centers in Solotvino and other places located in Tyachiv district. Plus recreation centers in Khust. Military personnel even come to us after being wounded. There are rehabilitation centers with hot salt springs in Solotvino. With the permission of recruiters: we organize watching movies in cinemas, swimming in pools, hiking in the mountains. This is all absolutely free for our defenders who voluntarily went to serve under a contract. All candidates for contract service take a course in tactical medicine at our RTCC and JV in cooperation with the national resistance center of the Transcarpathian region: they learn to provide first aid, work with tourniquets. At the end of the course, everyone is given a first-aid kit with the necessary drugs free of charge. Plus, they take classes on national resistance. These are the basics of military affairs. They are also taught the basic skills of handling weapons. For this, we have the appropriate weapon models. If we take young people, they are interested in the newly created units of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Unmanned Systems. About 40% want to serve there. Older people, who have already served in the army, are more likely to choose those specialties in which they completed their military service or those in which they fought during the ATO/OOS period. There is another category of recruiters who are ready to fight in assault brigades. In principle, it does not matter to them which VOS to obtain. Or those who only want to join the Army or the Marines. And there are quite a few of them. I remember, even a year ago, there was a huge lack of trust in the work of our RTCC and SP. After all, society, unfortunately, has developed a negative attitude, in principle, towards the work of TCC and joint ventures. There was a stereotype - they say that even volunteers are deceived, they do not get where they want to serve. In addition to the long processing of documents and VLK, quality is a problematic issue, people lose hope and lose the desire to protect the state from the enemy. This is where our -main chip- lies. We undertook to reverse this negative trend with the recruitment of volunteers and to show that RTCC and JV can work effectively. At the same time, creating the necessary household and social conditions. Everything for people - comfort and service. People who voluntarily went to this terrible war to defend Ukraine from the enemy deserve special respect. This is the key point. Yes, step by step, we fixed the system and it worked. Feedback from military units helped us a lot in this. Who recommended us to potential candidates to come to us and get registered quickly. I remembered one incident. A volunteer with a letter of recommendation to one of the mechanized brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We called the representatives of the unit, they say, they say, -make arrangements, but we don't believe that he will get to us.- We, in turn: -ok, when the military comes to you in the unit - go on a video call for confirmation.- At that time, the team was really surprised. After that, even more volunteers were called to that part through our RTCC and SP. Gradually, the principle of -word of mouth- worked for the very recruiters who signed a contract with us. These are hundreds and hundreds of real testimonials. Here, we can say, came a turning point in trust in our work. Next, our authority was already working for us. Plus a monetary reward of UAH 20,000, it also worked effectively. There are people with different social status. Many people come to us without money. There is an important nuance here. Everyone knows that in the Armed Forces, monetary support is calculated for the actually served last month. And what to do with those military personnel who undergo BZVP in Educational Centers. That is, they have no money in the first month of training. We are solving this problem with the help of these 20 thousand hryvnias. These funds are received by our volunteers in Tyachevo, before being sent either to Training Centers or directly to military units. All volunteers receive monetary incentives without exception. In addition, we provided proposals for the implementation of the mechanism for the purchase of cars for personal use by servicemen who entered into the first contract. We will remind that contract holders have the right within three months from the date of conclusion of the contract to receive a certificate for the purchase of a vehicle in the amount of 150 thousand hryvnias. The mechanism itself is still under development. We, in turn, offer to ensure communication between the owners of car dealerships and the military. That is, to undertake a commitment and help our defenders buy a car. It is necessary to dispel an absolutely harmful myth, which was successfully launched into the information space of Ukraine by Russian propaganda. It concerns the passing of the VLK of those who are conscripted into the army. For example, the TCC and SP -turn a blind eye- to obvious health problems and seek to drag everyone to the ZSU in a row. This is not true. Once a 45-year-old man from Cherkassy came to us. He was obviously from a poor family. He ate at our place more than three times a day. So, in the course of VLC, he was diagnosed with throat cancer, accordingly, he was informed about the diagnosis and was not invited. They bought a train ticket and he went home for treatment. There was a volunteer, a 28-year-old guy from the Kherson region. A letter of recommendation is in hand. He passed the tests, his blood sugar is high, up to 60. We tell him, boy, go home, get treatment, and then come to us. The part was informed that we could not call him. Many candidates have AIDS and other diseases that make them ineligible for military service. This is all clearly established. Because the most important thing for us is the health and life of people. Therefore, we invite all willing conscripts who are fit for service in terms of health to stand up for the defense of Ukraine. One of the main differences between contract service and mobilization during martial law is the ability to choose a unit and specialty.

The enemy is dispersing the attack on - NATO's plan for the introduction of troops into Ukraine -	In fact, the narrative of the Western -occupation- of Ukraine has been promoted by Moscow since the Revolution of Dignity. It is Russia that has been violating the territorial integrity of Ukraine since 2014, and in 2022 it tried to completely occupy the country. In addition, Russia is dispersing a manipulative -throw-in- as if -Western Ukraine will join NATO separately from other regions, like West Germany during the Cold War- with a reference to the American publication Politico. Actually in the article of the Politico publication entitled -Ukraine's peace plans: Many ideas for ending the fighting, but the sides, as before, are far from each other- there are several models for ending hostilities in Ukraine. One of the options is when Ukraine receives an invitation to join the alliance within its internationally recognized borders, instead security guarantees are extended to those territories under the control of the Ukrainian authorities. Thus, Russian mass media and social media users once again take quotes from foreign media out of context, this time to spread the narrative about the division of Ukraine. Such statements are aimed at causing Ukrainians to mistrust Western allies, shaking the unity of the country and its partners.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/vorog-rozganyaye-vkyd-pro-plan-nato-shhodo-vvedennya-vijsk-v-ukrayinu/	2024-12-06T20:28:58-08:00
-Twice for seven-, or How the master sergeant Red twice led his comrades out of the encirclement in ...	In the ranks of the Ryzhy Armed Forces from the first day of the large-scale invasion: -At 7 a.m. on February 24, I heard explosions and went outside. A comrade drove by in a car, he says, war. I immediately went to the TCC for a military ID and passport. I had a first-line reserve after my military service. They said I was needed. We were put on a bus and we went to Goncharivske. Then I didn't think about anything in particular: they said it must be, therefore it must be.- At that moment, Ryzhy's family was waiting for the arrival of their daughter. The wife saw off with tears in her eyes. Mom was also upset. But the man says that they still couldn't refuse him. Then there was a clear realization: first of all, it is necessary to protect the closest people. In 2022, as part of a rifle battalion, he went to defend the state in Donetsk region. He says that even then the situation was tense, but the enemy had fewer drones at that time. For the most part, the enemy stormed with infantry: -By the end of 2023, they had a lot more technical means. We were constantly under enemy drones: you enter a position under drones, take turns constantly under drones, leave the same way under drones. In winter, everything is complicated by the fact that the leaves fall, so it is more difficult to disguise the position.- One of the episodes that Ryzhom remembers the most happened on December 1-2, 2023. Then a group of enemy infantry consisting of eight people came almost close to the position of the rifle battalion: -There were four of us and eight of them. Landing. From one end of the hole, from the other end of the hole - they haven't had time to dig yet. The branches were used to make a shack so that the fpv wouldn't fly in. It was foggy. A drone hovered above us. While I was contacting the senior to find out if it was our bird or not, I lowered my head and saw the enemy 10 meters away. A battle ensued. They immediately threw us at RGD-5. For a moment, I might as well call it quits. But I realized that I want to live more than they do. And immediately shot two stores in the Somali style, then began aiming fire. The guys and I put 5 of them, one gave up. Two of them were beaten up, they were still shouting: -friend-brother, pamagi-. It was not possible to take those two and to provide them with help - all the time the Russians were firing from grenade launchers and mortars. Therefore, our infantrymen did not come out of the shelter. Instead, the Russian, who surrendered first, even managed to tell a little about himself. However, as it turned out later, the versions about why he took part in the war were made up on the fly: -I remember that he said his name was Vova, he was 40 years old. He went to war so as not to be imprisoned. But when he was brought to our far position, he told a completely different story there. That he was caught, brought by force. They promised that trenches would be dug, but they threw themselves into the storm.- Currently Ryzhy, together with his brothers, performs combat missions in the territory of the Kursk region. Twice he had to remove people from the environment. And twice he was able to get everyone out alive. -The first time, a platoon leader came and said that it was necessary to go on an assault. We went as a group of 16 people on two BMPs. Three tanks moved to cover us. They drove to the place, took positions. It was difficult, many enemy fpvs, three hundred appeared among us. The wounded were evacuated. Reinforcements came to us and we continued our work. But the next day, neither evacuation nor support groups could reach us. We took up a street and a half. The enemy realized that there were not so many of us and began to knock out every house. They worked on us actively with mortars, rockets, and fpv, there was constant shelling from small arms. It was not possible to get us through the windows, because we strengthened them well with boards, beds, and bedside tables. But then the Russians started breaking through the roofs, dropping the so-called -lighters-. And when one house was occupied, it was necessary to move to the next one,- Ryzyy recalls. -When the combatant realized that the equipment could not reach us, he began to take us out in small groups. It turned out that I became the leader of the group. He took out at least seven people. They walked -on brimstone-, through the enemy's street. The commander accompanied us by radio. They walked through the swamp. It was difficult because I was thirsty. Twice the fellows managed to drop half a liter of water each from the drone. I tell the guys: don't drink a lot, wet your lips and move on. As soon as we got out of the swamp, it was easier, but we had to move across open terrain. There was a moment when an enemy drone overtook us, one fighter was injured - shrapnel hit his shoulder blade and leg. But we managed to get to our neighbors, where we were able to rest a little. I drank one and a half liters of water in a minute. Then the combatant got in touch, said to go further. And so he brought us to the evacuation point, from where we were already taken to the place of deployment. The only thing I thought about then was how to get all the people out alive. And also about the fact that I had one RGD-5, one F-1, three stores. I will shoot the stores, throw a grenade. One more remains. Let the enemies come,- says the man. The redhead led seven fighters, brought them all to the evacuation point. Even later, finding himself in relative safety, the first desire was to call his relatives. The husband had not been in touch for a long time, so he understood that the family was worried: -I talked a lot with my daughter. She called everyone home. He told his wife that he did not call because roaming abroad is very expensive. I started joking, because I realized that it was safe, that everything was over. At that moment I was already released.- During the third trip to the territory of Kurshchyna, the man again had to take out his comrades: -A combatant came out to me, around 9 o'clock, told me to leave. Offered at my discretion: either now or in the evening. The guys and I consulted, decided what to expect. Moreover, the enemy BMP had already moved in, unloading the infantry. We decided to go in the afternoon. Just gathered as three drones hovered above us. We waited until they took off, heard that it was quiet, and left after landing. He went out to the commander, asked where to go. The most frightening thing was to move through a clear field, there it was necessary to overcome about a kilometer and 200 meters. Just like the first time, 7 people were taken out, the same way the second time. My lucky number.- Ryzyy is now the chief sergeant of the rifle battalion company. Among his tasks is the training of personnel. Goes to training grounds with soldiers, shares his experience, tells in detail how to prepare for combat. He says this about his motivation: -I have two daughters. Wife. Mother. Three sisters. Brother. If we do not destroy the enemy, he will come to our homes. And if we talk about the Kursk operation, it is better for us to destroy the enemy on his own land than for them to come to us again.- Dina Wong for ArmyInform	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/dvichi-po-sim-abo-yak-golovnyj-serzhant-ryzhyj-dvichi-vyviv-pobratymiv-z-otochennya-na-kurshhyni/	2024-12-06T20:12:13-08:00

Seventeen wounded. Two died. And these are only two Russian strikes on two Ukrainian cities in one day,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyi. In his opinion, the thousands of such strikes that were carried out by Russia during this war clearly state that it is Putin who does not need real peace, he only needs the opportunity to do this to any country - bombs, missiles, all other violence. -It can only be resisted by force. And only through force can real peace be established. I thank everyone who helps Ukraine with this! Eternal memory to all the victims of Russian terror!-, said the President. As reported by ArmyInform, nine people died and six were injured as a result Russian attack on Zaporozhye.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/06/slova-z-rosiyi-nichogo-ne-znachat-ale-yiyi-bomby-j-rakety-vse-kazhut-duzhe-krasnomovno-prezydent/	2024-12-06T10:31:02-08:00
The Minister of Defense of Ukraine discussed the North Koreans in Kurshchyna with the Ambassador of ...	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported this on December 6. -On behalf of Ukraine, I thanked for the significant support we receive from the government and people of Japan. During the conversation, they discussed the strategy of the Russian aggressor, as well as the growing role of North Korean forces in the war against Ukraine. The DPRK has sent 11,000 military personnel to the Kursk region,- said Rustem Umyerov. According to him, this increases the risk of the transfer of modern military technologies from Russia to the North Korean regime, which creates new threats not only for Europe, but also for Asia. -Japan remains our strategic partner. Our cooperation is strengthening in response to common security challenges. Support for Ukrainian industry and new models of cooperation were discussed. He offered Japan to finance non-lethal aid for Ukraine, in particular in the field of demining. We will continue close contacts to strengthen the security of our countries in the face of common threats,- Rustem Umyerov concluded. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense offered large American business projects for investment in the Ukrainian defense industry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/06/ministr-oborony-ukrayiny-obgovoryv-z-poslom-yaponiyi-pivnichnokorejcziv-na-kurshhyni/	2024-12-06T09:58:43-08:00

Let them finish smoking - our pilots gave the enemy attack aircraft a few minutes of life	The video of the defeat was published on the battalion channel. After the defeat of the assault groups, our drones began to hunt for individual surviving invaders. They tried to hide, but it did not save them. Another invader was able to come closest to our positions. And when our drone hovered over him, he smoked a cigarette. The pilots gave him a smoke, and then destroyed him with a targeted hit. -For courage, he chose the right to smoke his last cigarette,- the battalion commented on the video. As ArmyInform reported, a fighter of the K-2 battalion of the 54th mechanized brigade named after Hetman Ivan Mazepa was able to stop the advance of the occupiers along the line of our trenches.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/06/daly-dokuryty-nashi-piloty-podaruvaly-vorozhomu-shturmovyku-kilka-hvylyn-zhyttya/	2024-12-06T09:34:24-08:00
Find in 3 seconds - our drones conducted an investigation and went to the enemy	A video about this story was released on December 6. -Alastor- pilots were conducting routine work of destroying enemy manpower and hiding places when their drone intercepted a video signal from a Russian copter for 3 seconds. The boys kept it and tried to find out the location of the Russian pilots. They found a yard among the residential buildings from which the Russians flew. Our copter went there for reconnaissance and found enemy antennas. The Russians tried to crush our drone with an EW, but it still destroyed the antenna of the Russian drones that launched the FPV drones. The second drone destroyed the antenna belonging to the enemy Mavik operators. So the enemy pilots remained for some time without the possibility of harming us. As ArmyInform reported, the operators of the -Alastor- unit of the 25th Sicheslav Airborne Brigade were able to hit the enemy armored vehicles, despite all the anti-drone protection that the Russians installed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/06/znajty-za-3-sekundy-nashi-dronari-provely-rozsliduvannya-i-vyjshly-na-voroga/	2024-12-06T09:07:33-08:00

The voice of defense: how -Armiya FM- became a radio station for all Ukrainians	To the Day of the Armed Forces, the information service of NSJU prepared a story about the main military radio of our country. The history of the radio station began in 2016 — -Army FM- was called to support military personnel in the area of ​​an anti-terrorist operation. Since then, radio has significantly expanded its audience. Today's -Army FM-, which works as part of the Central Television and Radio Studio of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine headed by Lieutenant Colonel Serhii Zhukovsky, is a radio station that speaks in 37 settlements throughout Ukraine. This is no longer exclusively a radio for military personnel, but for every Ukrainian, because practically every family has a military person. -Army FM- broadcast is structured taking into account the needs of the audience. The main prime time is in the morning and evening hours, when people go to work or return home. From 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., the morning show of the famous radio presenter Serge Gagarin, who tells listeners about important events, communicates with listeners, from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., the evening show of experienced radio host Igor Kozak, and from 8:00 p.m. until 10:00 p.m. — -Evening Poe-, author's program by a famous Ukrainian singer and military serviceman Oleksandr Polozhynskyi. Under the leadership of Major Andrii Davydov, -Army FM- works with the military and political leadership, receives information about the development of the defense complex, what weapons our units are equipped with, how training is conducted. -Army FM- maintains constant contact with the audience through all available communication channels. Communication is especially active during the morning and evening shows, when listeners can join in discussing current topics. The radio station is present on all social networks and messengers, so any listener can conveniently write, express their opinion or ask questions to an expert in the studio. Among the listeners' questions are many about how to get to serve in one or another unit of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. And this despite the fact that nowadays this information can be easily found on the Internet or on street billboards. But on the radio, there is a program with military servicemen who tell how they came to serve in their units, about their military experience, about the combat path of the brigades and joint achievements. The radio also distributes recruiting videos through its social networks, from which you can learn that the army is not only about combat tasks, there is also other work that many can do. The main audience of the radio station is men and women aged 30+: current and future military personnel, volunteers and their family members. It is interesting that before the start of the full-scale invasion, the radio was listened to even in the temporarily occupied territories. Listeners from Luhansk, Donetsk, Makiivka, Debaltseve called and wrote messages. The work of military radio does not go unnoticed by the enemy. The site has been repeatedly attacked by cyber attacks. The most recent case was on the Day of Remembrance of the Holodomor Victims. The site was attacked allegedly from Indonesia, although it is clear that in fact it was from a completely different country. In the front-line territories, the Russians are trying to jam Ukrainian radio broadcasts and broadcast their own. The enemy allocates huge funds for disinformation, has at least twenty years of experience in imperial propaganda. The programming content of -Army FM- is diverse and meaningful. Every day at 4:30 p.m., the program -Stratcom Speaks- is broadcast - an up-to-date summary of the most important military and socio-political events in Ukraine and the world. Captain Kateryna Bilenko's program -There is no reason to worry- is broadcast twice a week, which tells about the legal features of military service. A special place in the broadcasting network is occupied by the program -Timely about- - the author's project of Dmytro Simanskyi. The program discusses global topics: international military cooperation, recruiting and mobilization, energy, political processes. Guests are top officials, military, diplomats and politicians. Verified objective news from primary sources and refutation of Russian fakes is the most important direction of the radio station, which is overseen by Captain Maria Veres and highly experienced journalist Oleksiy Mustafin. Andriy Vyrva provides timely sports news. Every day on -Army FM- you can hear -the same historian from Tik-Tok- Oleksandr Alfyorov, a soldier of the 3rd Assault Brigade, with a unique author's column -A Minute of Ukrainian History-. The radio station always supports a variety of events for military and veterans at all levels. A prime example of this is the partnership with Invictus Games. Its manifestation on the air is the big weekly project -Games of the Invincibles- from the inside. Also, -Army FM- likes to provide media support to interesting initiatives of units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. A lot of attention on the radio is paid to the musical content. Radio presenter, now captain of the ZSU, Serzh Gagarin, who has more than 22 years of experience in radio broadcasting at leading Ukrainian radio stations, joined the Army FM team at the end of 2022 after serving in the Chernihiv National Guard. At the same time, a professional approach to the formation of the program grid and music playlist was applied to the broadcast. The format of -Army FM- is Modern Rock / Power Pop, which is based on rock compositions, recognizable world hits and a large share of modern music from Ukrainian rock artists who have an unblemished reputation. Ukrainian music occupies more than 40 percent of the airwaves. Nobody arbitrarily rearranges songs on the air. The music selection that the radio -plays- is determined in advance, taking into account categories, hours and audience preferences. With the passage of time since the large-scale invasion, the musical preferences of listeners have changed. -Bayraktarshchy- became less. At the beginning, there were a lot of jokes in the style of -what a Cossack you are-, -what a Cossack you are-, -Russian ship-, etc. Now is the time for more serious music that conveys important messages to listeners. Some songs can make you feel sad, and some songs can inspire you for important things and victories. At -Army FM- they are convinced that music can save, -pull out of a psychological pit.- Someone is inspired by Oleksandr Polozhynskyi's -Knight's Cross-, someone likes -Pianoboy- with the song -I can do everything-, someone likes -Surface Tension- with the motivational composition -Tomorrow-, someone likes the group -Pyratyn- and its humorous song -Arta-, someone else the work of the Finnish group -Moon Shot- called -Yes!-, recorded in support of Ukraine, or Yarmak's track -Babylon-. The Ukrainian military believes that today it is important to talk to people about Ukraine's victories - and not only at the front, but also in sports, art, film production, and the IT sphere. All of these parts make up our overall prospective Victory. The radio station is actively developing and planning new projects. I would like to see more programs, but the human resource of the Central Television and Radio Studio of the Ministry of Defense is limited, in addition, military personnel are assigned to combat units on a rotational basis. But from the New Year, some pleasant surprises are waiting for the listeners. At -Army FM- they intend to introduce an international project about global changes, talk about the political component of events in the world, how it affects Ukraine and democratic countries. They are also planning a full-length program on the fight against Russian fakes, they want to talk more about Western weapons and Ukrainian developments. As of now, military radio speaks in 37 settlements, including the big cities of Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Zaporizhzhia, Poltava, Rivne, Kryvyi Rih and others. Also, the -Army FM- signal receives a considerable number of small front-line and border towns and villages, where radio is more or less the only way to receive information, so the mission of the radio station does not lose its strategic importance. Another expansion of coverage and the start of broadcasting in Mukachevo is on the way. There are plans to obtain more permits for temporary broadcasting in order to inform Ukrainians about the state of affairs in the army and the state in general. Today, Army FM is much more than just a radio station. It is an information outpost that reminds every day: together we are strong, together we are free, together we will win. It is a voice that, through music, news and communication, supports the fighting spirit of defenders and the entire Ukrainian people.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/06/golos-oborony-yak-armiya-fm-stala-radiostancziyeyu-dlya-vsih-ukrayincziv/	2024-12-06T08:04:08-08:00

The Russians decided to make a beautiful landing with the BMP, but they were prevented by -Cats- from the 130th battalion of the TRO. At first, they hit the infantry with skirmishes, later they burned the bekha with a direct hit. Then the -Cats- used drones to search for Russians and successively destroy them. The Sturm-S anti-tank missile system was shown for the first time in the Armed Forces. Our fighters are already learning to work with him on training grounds. It is known that -Sturm-S- is adapted and modernized to the needs of modern warfare.

The reason is that there is less need for their services due to a decrease in the pace of construction during the construction crisis that began in Russia. Illegals are threatened with deportation with a ban on entry, instead they are offered to sign a contract and promise not to send them to the front line. However, this is a delusion, because the empire always fights with other people's hands.

He organized the forced mobilization of citizens for the war against Ukraine - the leader of the DNR...	reports this by the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor's Office. On February 19, 2022, with the aim of waging an aggressive war against Ukraine, the -head of the DNR- entered into a conspiracy with the highest political leadership of the Russian Federation. He announced a general mobilization on the territory of Donetsk region temporarily occupied by Russian troops. Following the instructions of the Kremlin, the head of the pseudo-state entity signed a number of legally void -decrees-. At the same time, in order to increase the number of occupation troops, the accused changed the maximum age of conscripts from 55 to 65 years. Thanks to these actions, members of illegal armed formations in the regular army of the Russian Federation carried out a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In compliance with the -decree- of the leader of the pseudo-republic, subordinate employees of the -military commissars- and commanders of enemy units threaten the citizens of Ukraine with criminal responsibility for refusing to fight against our state. All these actions are a gross violation of the requirements of Articles 4, 8, 51, 147 of the Geneva Convention on the Protection of the Civilian Population in Time of War of August 12, 1949, as well as Art. 23 of the Hague Convention on the Laws and Customs of War on Land of October 18, 1907. We will remind, on December 27, 2023, the -head of the DNR- Pushylin was convicted in absentia for encroachment on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine and collaborative activities (Part 2 of Article 110, Part 2 of Article 28, Part 5 of Article 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine) . He was sentenced to 15 years in prison with the deprivation of the right to hold positions in the bodies of state power, state administration, local self-government, related to the provision of public services, the performance of organizational-administrative and administrative-economic functions, for 15 years and confiscation of property .

Illusory victories of the Russian Federation: what the enemy invents to divert attention from large-...	Moreover, the MORF regularly reports on the -destruction- of HIMARS launchers, the number of which has already exceeded that received by Ukraine. About writes Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security. These statements are aimed at supporting the illusion of Russia's -greatness-, because Russian propaganda has always operated on the principle of quantitative exaggeration. For example, back in 2017, Sergei Shoigu reported on the -laying off- of 500,000 km² in Syria, although the area of ​​the entire country is only 185,000. km². At the same time, the real facts remain outside the official summaries. By report of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, in November, the Russian army suffered the largest irreversible and sanitary losses in force since the beginning of the large-scale invasion: during this month, our soldiers -two hundred- and -three hundred- 45,720 enemy soldiers. But this data is overlooked by propagandists who focus on creating their own illusory victories. After all, the Russians can indeed shoot down Ukrainian missiles with oil depots, airfields or military factories. Such fake -reports- not only create a false picture of reality for the domestic audience, but are also designed to divert attention from Russia's large-scale losses and failures at the front.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/06/ilyuzorni-peremogy-rf-shho-vygaduye-vorog-aby-vidvernuty-uvagu-vid-masshtabnyh-vtrat/	2024-12-05T21:02:38-08:00
A serious reason for neurosis in the Kremlin: Germany is waiting for a missile capable of -penetrati...	However, as informs the portal of the influential German publication Der Spiegel, the Bundeswehr does not yet have an appropriate budget for this is an important project, ArmyInform reports. According to the publication, the Ministry of Defense of the Federal Republic of Germany presented to the budget committee of the Bundestag the profile of the corresponding project in confidential documents for the state budget for 2025. Accordingly, from a military point of view, it makes sense to order 600 Taurus Neo cruise missiles for approximately €2.1 billion. The first units of long-range weapons may be delivered in 2029. The decision to develop Taurus Neo, according to German observers, marks a significant step in modernizing Germany's military potential and strengthening its strategic position in a tense geopolitical context. According to German media reports, the Taurus Neo project is aimed at expanding the capabilities of the existing Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missile. In particular, according to German parliamentary sources, the modification involves increasing the flight range, increasing the accuracy of hitting targets and the power of the warhead. The Taurus Neo's technical improvements are expected to include a flight range exceeding 500 km. The guidance system will be modernized, it will integrate advanced technologies of inertial navigation and GPS correction to increase accuracy for detecting hard-to-reach targets. It is also assumed that the missile will be equipped with a more powerful warhead designed to penetrate heavily fortified structures such as bunkers or underground storage facilities. In addition, the Taurus Neo can include anti-missile defense bypass technologies, which increases the missile's ability to evade enemy radars and anti-aircraft defenses. Currently, the German armed forces have at their disposal approximately 600 Taurus KEPD 350 missiles, which are mainly used on Tornado fighters. Although the missile has also been tested on the Eurofighter EF2000, this aircraft is not yet used as a standard launch platform for the Taurus. The upcoming conclusion from the operation of Tornado fighters raises the question of the launch platform for the Taurus Neo. As such, the Eurofighter is the Bundeswehr's most likely option, while integration with the F-35As recently ordered by Germany is unlikely without a full redesign of the missile to match the internal compartment of the American stealth fighter. Experts of the IKK defense portal Defense Express (DE) reminded that the first batch of Taurus missiles in 600 units cost the Germans €570 million, deliveries continued until December 2010. As reported by ArmyInform , Taurus missiles in Germany were repeatedly requested by Ukraine. However, the chancellor of the country, Olaf Scholz, makes categorical statements from time to time that Germany will not transfer these long-range weapons to Ukraine, and the other day he noted that he will not change his position on this issue. As of today, according to data by the authors of the DE portal, Germany does not produce Taurus cruise missiles. Last year, the CEO of MBDA Deutschland, Joachim Knopf, stated that it would take a year to resume production of these weapons, taking into account delays in the delivery of electronics or explosives. As reported, in the long term, Germany could consider integrating the Taurus Neo into the FCAS (Future Combat Air System) is a next-generation fighter project developed in cooperation with France, Spain and Belgium. Despite the fact that in the coming decades, the US Air Force is expected to play a central role in the modernization of European air forces. In Germany, it is believed that the Taurus Neo technology could have significant implications for European defense. As a high-precision, long-range weapon, this missile can enhance deterrence capabilities while offering additional strategic capabilities for the continent's collective defense. However, the financing of the Taurus Neo project remains a serious problem for the German government. So, according to data reporters of the defense portal The War Zone, the budget of the Federal Republic of Germany for 2025 will require include the €350 million required to launch development, and current budget constraints may affect costs in the coming years. However, the support expressed by the government coalition in Germany indicates a favorable outcome for the implementation of the project, despite possible debates in the German parliament regarding the feasibility of prioritizing such costs in difficult economic conditions. The announcement of the Taurus Neo project came just two days after the signing of a historic defense agreement between Germany and the United Kingdom aimed at accelerating the development of a new, more advanced long-range missile than the Storm Shadow. This agreement was followed by the announcement of the UK joining the European Strike Program (ELSA): a French-led initiative that includes Germany, Poland and Italy. As part of ELSA, it is planned to develop a missile with a flight range of 1,000 km. up to 2 thousand km by 2030. Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missile.

-The U.S. military was cool long before 2022-: about the war of the Hornet, Chip and Dale and the fi...	Experienced artilleryman Major Kostyantyn Rymarenko told ArmyInform about what the long years of war in Donbas since 2014 gave the Ukrainian army, why the armed forces were cool long before the large-scale attack of the Russian Federation on Ukraine, as well as why UAVs are critical for artillery with the call sign -Khorunzhiy-. Military -Khorunzhiy- began his career in 2012 with ordinary military service. Then, as a graduate of the Alfred Nobel University in Dnipropetrovsk, he had to serve only 9 months. However, in the end, this short term was only the beginning of a long military career, during which he went from a soldier to a major. To the question about the military department during higher education, the officer answers awkwardly, noting that this is a separate sad story. Unfortunately, during the 1990s and early 2000s, and especially after 2010, the system of training military personnel through military departments at universities was largely disorganized. So the future officer began his service in the army -on a general basis- and now does not regret it. He recalls that during the conscript service, despite the chronic underfunding, outdated material base and remnants of the -Soviet regime-, military affairs were taught qualitatively. - In Divychki, conscripts were taught very well - no worse than officers are taught now. Everything was very well organized, it was very cool training - no questions. Almost everything I know about artillery, how it works, all the basics, I know because of my military service. Really taught very well. Although it was a bit -long- (smiles - author), they taught everything - from A to Z. They laid a very strong base, - says the gunner. All the best from this basis, he believes, allowed the Armed Forces of Ukraine to give a worthy rebuff to the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine in 2014 and became a reliable basis for the further development of the Ukrainian army. The following years before a large-scale attack were also not wasted, so the ASU was already cool well before 2022. Kostyantyn Rymarenko met Russia's attack on Ukraine in the ranks of the Armed Forces, because he signed a contract after the -period-. So we can say that he has been fighting since the very first days of the more than ten-year war. — In 2014, the 25th brigade was the first to leave for Donbas in a convoy, it was the first battalion tactical group (battalion tactical group — author) of the first battalion. On March 10, 2014, we went to the area of ​​the Amvrosiivka settlement. The first 150 km went well - people supported, helped, gave all kinds of -little things-, says the officer. Then the problems began - people in civilian clothes obstructed the movement of convoys of military equipment, blocking roads and chasing traffic. Voyskovyi recalls that the demonstrators were not only extremely decorated due to anti-Ukrainian propaganda, but also well coordinated - it was noticeable that someone was leading them. - Everything was coordinated to the point that they knew the point where it would be most profitable to stop the convoy. Because a convoy is a lot of armor and wheels, it is a military Ural. We often drove on dirt roads, fields - and people in civilian clothes clearly met us where we had to enter the paved road. They already stood at that place in advance, that is, they were coordinated, because they themselves could not follow our movement and understand where exactly we were going, -Khorunzhiy- recalls. The crowd blocking the road could number from a few dozen to two or three hundred people, who had to be bypassed, persuaded or even dispersed by force. It was noticeable that the hysteria among the locals was being specially fanned, and in the crowds you could see trained -activists- provocateurs who organized everything. The further combat path of the gunner lay through Amvrosiivka, Sloviansk, Debaltseve, Shakhtarsk&#8230; The attempt to liberate Donetsk in mid-August 2014 was memorable, during which units of the brigade were supposed to move from Debaltsevo through Nizhnya Kryna in the direction of Khartsyzk. It was then, the officer is convinced, that Russia's first large-scale attack on Ukraine took place. Before that, the Russian Federation operated through special services, organizing, coordinating and supplying weapons to Russian and pro-Russian militants. In the last decade of August 2014, the neighboring aggressor state directly used units of its regular army. Then one group of Ukrainian troops, says -Khorunzhy-, advanced through Nizhnya Kryna to the south, while the second was to go north to Khartsyzk from the side of Ilovaisk. They both had about 7 kilometers to go. — 14 kilometers — and Donetsk would be in a cauldron. But on August 24-25, 2014, the first full-scale invasion of Russia took place, which was hidden. The Ilovai group had an option to come to us to the north, and if we hit each other at the same time, we would meet in Khartsyzka, and everything would be fine, the gunner explains. To prevent this plan, Russia was forced to use units of the regular army, because there were clearly not enough Russian and pro-Russian fighters, and they did not have any tangible support among the local population. Khorunzhiy spent the next six years in a war that many Ukrainians chose not to notice. Meanwhile, soldiers of the Armed Forces defended Ukraine, restraining the enemy in the East of the country. The defenders gave their lives and health, for years they almost did not see their relatives and friends, while the rest of the country continued to live their usual lives. — During the year, we spent 10 months in the ATO/OO zone, then two months at home. Of these two months, we spent one at the training ground, and the other was at the PPD (permanent deployment point - author) and went to training. That is, during my service, I almost did not see my own family, my children, - explains the soldier. However, this time did not pass in vain either for Konstantin himself or for the Armed Forces. -Khorunzhiy- was trained and obtained the rank of primary officer, served in the command and artillery reconnaissance battery, was a platoon commander and a battery commander. And the Ukrainian army has gone through an important path of modernization and gaining combat experience. — In May 2015, I went to study. We mastered the AN/TPQ-48 - studied, disassembled, assembled, repaired. We were well taught in electronics, then there were also courses. After all, in November 2015, I was given the rank of junior lieutenant, - recalls Kostyantyn Rymarenko. The AN/TPQ-48 is an American man-portable counter-battery radar station designed to detect enemy mortar installations. Together with other innovations and assistance from partners, it became very helpful during the war in Eastern Ukraine. In 2020, Kostyantyn Rymarenko resigned from the Armed Forces, hoping to spend more time with his family and recall his civilian specialty as a marketer. However, a large-scale attack by the Russian Federation disrupted all plans for a peaceful life. - From the very morning of February 24, I sent my family to my relatives, and I immediately took my bag - all the military property I had - and went to the military commissariat. When I arrived, they didn't even know what to do and how to do it. And I was already completely gathered at their door. I was quickly taken through all the offices, all the officers - and on the same day I went to the brigade, -Khorunzhiy- recalls. Several days were spent on organizational work, and already on February 27, the officer left for Donbas, where to this day he defends Ukraine as part of his native 25th separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade. — When I put my family in the car and sent them to my relatives, took my bag and went to the military checkpoint, I honestly thought I was going to die. I did not believe that we would succeed. But maybe it's because everyone thought so and everyone left - that's why we survived and are still standing, the soldier explains. He is sure that it was the simultaneous rise and joint efforts of Ukrainians, primarily those who gained military experience during the war in the East in 2014-2022, that allowed Ukraine to withstand the extremely difficult conditions of the first months of the large-scale invasion. Another key to the successful defense of Ukraine is the creativity of Ukrainian defenders and innovation in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Ukrainians brought knowledge, skills, skills and even hobbies acquired in civilian life to the Armed Forces - and this gave a colossal result. — In civilian life, I had a hobby — I flew on FPVs, on quadcopters. Thanks to this, we were the first in the brigade to fly a quadcopter. At the beginning of the large-scale invasion, there was only one Mavic in the division. Three officers flew on it: I, at that time a senior lieutenant and commander of intelligence, also a senior lieutenant - the deputy commander of a battery from the MPZ - and a division commander in the rank of lieutenant colonel, - says the military man. Before that, the gunners had only wing-type UAVs, and they were even afraid to fly on the recently handed over single Mavic, so as not to lose it. However, in the end, the gunners confidently mastered the new technique and ensured an extremely high result. Three officers took turns flying one drone and directly adjusted fire, transmitting data by radio to the gun commanders. This made it possible to quickly adjust fire and achieve significant accuracy. The scaling of the same process and the significant increase in the number of UAVs made it possible to spread the acquired experience to other artillery divisions of the brigade - and drones changed everything. — If we had as many drones at the beginning of the war as we do now, the occupiers would have all died then. We fired about 300 shells without knowing where. We were told the coordinates - we shot there. If the volumes that we fired at the beginning of the war were combined with such direct streams, which thanks to UAVs we have now, it would be possible to simply destroy any position, the officer explains. The military jokingly compares the 25th Sicheslav Airborne Brigade to Chip and Dale from the famous Disney cartoon about the chipmunks. After all, he says, the brigade is often sent to the direction where the biggest problems arise and where it is urgently necessary to -put out the fire-. — The first time this happened was in the Avdiivka region, when we were planned to be taken out for recovery and replaced by another brigade. Our units began to leave, but not even a day and a half passed when those who replaced us began to fall and lose positions. Therefore, we were forced to urgently return and save the situation, the officer says. Then many more times the Czechoslovak paratroopers were transferred to the hottest and most difficult areas of the front, and everywhere they provided the desired result - both in defense and in attack. -Khorunzhiy- fondly remembers the Slobozhan offensive operation, when the Defense Forces managed to liberate a huge territory of the Kharkiv region with a swift thrust. — When we were transferred to Kharkiv Oblast, there were very big doubts, but we fulfilled the assigned tasks and everything was successful. With minimal losses and with a huge amount of trophies, Raisin was liberated. Then, with already greater losses, unfortunately, they reached the Lyman, he says. The military believes that if it was then possible to introduce additional reserves, reinforce and replace the already exhausted Ukrainian military, the offensive could be continued. Victory in the war is just as achievable, he is convinced. For this, the two most important conditions are necessary - nationwide support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and a sufficient number of motivated and well-trained soldiers.

The occupiers created classes of young Russian Guardsmen at TOT	About this informs Center of national resistance. In the temporarily occupied territories, the enemy pursues a policy of militarizing children in order to raise future janissaries from them in the future wars of the empire. In particular, the Russians invented classes of -young Russian Guardsmen-, which were supervised by the police. The children were given -cadet- uniforms and forced to swear allegiance to the occupiers. At the same time, they were given lectures by people who organize torture chambers and kidnap people from the streets. In the future, the children were promised benefits when entering specialized educational institutions. The Kremlin spent hundreds of years building a system in which service to a dictator or in the army is the only chance to build a career if you live in the provinces of the empire. In this way, Moscow ensures control over the captured lands and gains manpower for wars of aggression. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the occupied Luhansk Region they are planning to spend 43 billion rubles on the so-called development of the coal industry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/okupanty-stvoryly-klasy-yunyh-rosgvardijcziv-na-tot/	2024-12-05T11:56:49-08:00

Rustem Umyerov discussed international military aid for Ukraine with attachés of partner countries	This is stated in a post on the minister's Facebook page. The main topic of discussion is international military aid for Ukraine. -I expressed my sincere gratitude to every country that supports us in the fight against the aggressor. It is extremely important for Ukraine and our partners that the transferred weapons and equipment are used as efficiently as possible on the battlefield,- said Rustem Umyerov. Together with the representatives of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence, the participants of the meeting informed the military attachés about the digitalization of military aid records. Before the start of the full-scale Russian aggression, weapons records were kept exclusively in paper format. The Great War showed that such approaches need to be fundamentally changed. This year, the Ministry of Defense made significant progress in reforming the supply of weapons and equipment to NATO standards. One of the key achievements was the implementation of the SAP system, which translates the accounting and provision of the army into a modern digital format, convenient for analysis and control. Thanks to the license transferred by Germany, SAP is scalable to all units of the Defense Forces. Today, the system covers 3,000 users at the tactical, operational and strategic levels. About 300,000 items have already been entered into the database, and in the online mode we monitor key indicators: the number of weapons, their condition and distribution among units. -Such formats of meetings with the military attachés of our allies will be regular. At the next event, we plan to summarize the results of military aid for previous years and define support plans for 2025. Transparency, clarity and accountability are the principles that the Ministry of Defense steadfastly adheres to in cooperation with our allies,- Rustem Umyerov concluded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/rustem-umyerov-obgovoryv-mizhnarodnu-vijskovu-dopomogu-dlya-ukrayiny-z-atashe-krayin-partneriv/	2024-12-05T10:44:21-08:00

In the rear of the enemy: fighters of the special unit blew up a high-rise building with occupiers	The video was published on the page of the National Guard of Ukraine. The building was occupied by enemy infantry, which had to be destroyed. They decided to do this by collapsing the entire structure directly on the occupiers. For this, the special forces approached the building with the enemy under cover of fire. In a matter of minutes, the house was filled with explosive devices, which detonated as soon as the fighters left. In this way, the special forces wished -good night to the occupiers-.

Kharkiv, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions remain the most polluted freed territories. Representatives of the Main Department of Mine Action, Civil Defense and Environmental Security of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported this at the fifth review conference (5RC) on the implementation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and Their Destruction, which was held in the Kingdom of Cambodia within the framework of the Siem Reap-Angkor summit. Representatives of 90 participating countries, 12 observer countries of the Ottawa Convention and almost 20 delegations of various international organizations took part in the event. The Ukrainian delegation told the international community in detail about the crimes of the Russian Federation related to the use of anti-personnel mines against the civilian population. The conference participants were also provided with information about shelling of humanitarian demining groups, which prevent the full implementation of mine action activities. In addition, it was informed about the measures to clean up the territories contaminated by Russian anti-personnel mines and the progress in this area that the units of the Ministry of Defense managed to achieve during 2024. Thus, during the non-technical survey, 35,000 km² of the territory was marked as not containing evidence of the presence of risks. This made it possible to reduce the area of ​​potentially contaminated areas from 174,000 to 139,000 km². As reported by ArmyInform, in 2024 in Ukraine 10 new demining battalions were created. In addition, the fleet of mechanized demining vehicles increased from two units to 52, of which 42 are in the Armed Forces and 10 are in the State Special Transport Service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/zlochyny-armiyi-rf-ponad-1000-czyvilnyh-pidirvalysya-na-protypihotnyh-minah-vid-pochatku-shyrokomasshtabnogo-vtorgnennya/	2024-12-05T09:15:38-08:00
In the Kherson region, three people were injured due to Russian shelling	The Kherson Regional Prosecutor's Office informed about this.

Also, as a result of an enemy attack on the village of Tomyna Balka, a 67-year-old man received acupressure and shrapnel wounds. As a result of shelling, seven civilian objects were damaged in the Kherson region, including private and apartment buildings, cars, etc. Under the procedural guidance of the prosecutor's office of the Kherson region, an investigation into the facts of war crimes was launched (Part 1 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/na-hersonshhyni-troye-postrazhdalyh-cherez-rosijski-obstrily/	2024-12-05T09:44:25-08:00
Increasing the ruble discount rate will not help and it will continue to fall	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The regulator allows its increase to 25% at the next meeting of the board of directors on December 20. Also, according to the statement of the Central Bank, the exchange rate has become a new -pro-inflationary factor-. Price growth remains high, and the slowdown in lending, in particular corporate lending, is recorded. It is unlikely that an increase in the discount rate will help the ruble. High inflation of 8.8% and an increase in the key rate in December create significant risks for the Russian economy. We are talking about a decrease in the purchasing power of the population, an increase in the cost of lending, an increase in the debt burden, etc. The war against Ukraine is finally bringing the Russian economy into the abyss. We remind you that the Russian authorities plan to allow the use of in harmful jobs in the industry of teenagers from the age of 16.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/pidvyshhennya-oblikovoyi-stavky-rublyu-ne-dopomozhe-i-vin-prodovzhyt-padinnya/	2024-12-05T09:26:10-08:00

In addition, it was informed about the measures to clean up the territories contaminated by Russian anti-personnel mines and the progress in this area, which the units of the Ministry of Defense managed to achieve during 2024. Thus, during the non-technical survey, 35,000 km² of the territory was marked as not containing evidence of the presence of risks. This made it possible to reduce the area of ​​potentially contaminated areas from 174,000 to 139,000 km². As reported by ArmyInform, in 2024 in Ukraine 10 new demining battalions were created. In addition, the fleet of mechanized demining vehicles increased from two units to 52, of which 42 are in the Armed Forces and 10 are in the State Special Transport Service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/zlochyny-armiyi-rf-ponad-1000-czyvilnyh-pidirvalysya-na-protypihotnyh-minah-z-pochatku-roku/	2024-12-05T09:15:38-08:00
The Russians are looking for deserters at the TOT of the Kherson region	This is reported by the Center of National resistance In the region, there have been recorded cases of massive non-compliance with orders by subordinates due to low morale and alcohol abuse.

However, practice shows that even such methods do not help. We remind you that border guards together with the police exposed a corruption scheme organized by an active serviceman who promised to place a conscript in a -warm- military service for $5,000 service, avoiding the war zone.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/na-tot-hersonshhyny-rosiyany-shukayut-dezertyriv/	2024-12-05T09:09:05-08:00

Oleksandr Borodin, spokesman, told about this on the air of the -Edyny Novyni- telethon Third Assault Brigade. According to Oleksandr Borodin, the enemy clearly set the task of reaching the Oskil River. Another goal is the city of Borova. This is a common goal of invaders - such logistics centers are very important for the Russians. -They chose the tactics of daily assaults for the constant fatigue of our personnel. But if there is a possibility of rotation, and there are forces and means to ensure these rotations, it is possible to be in such conditions for a long time and protect people,- Oleksandr Borodin noted. The situation is extremely difficult. The occupiers have no problems with reserves, the spokesman of the Third Assault Division points out. The quality of training has fallen, but the infantry, albeit untrained, is sufficient. -They have built logistics chains of people. When one company is destroyed there, there is conditionally another, which stands on the second line of defense. And the third company, which is in the rear area,- said Oleksandr Borodin. How reported ArmyInform, in Kharkiv Oblast, the occupiers are digging underground cities to escape from Ukrainian FPV drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/u-nyh-pobudovani-logistychni-lanczyuzhky-z-lyudej-rosiyany-stvoryly-velycheznyj-konveyer-smerti-dlya-svoyih/	2024-12-05T04:53:49-08:00
In the Russian Federation, they are beginning to involve children in harmful industries	About this informs the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation believes that these changes -will allow enterprises to conclude agreements on paid internships with students of professional educational organizations.- In fact, the goal of such innovations is the desire of the Russian government to solve the problem of labor shortages, primarily at military-industrial complex enterprises. Such a deficit arose in the context of the war against Ukraine, mobilization and attempts to increase the volume of production of weapons and other military products. During the first half of this year, Russian employers sent job invitations to more than 3 million people aged 14 to 18. Propaganda of the Russian Federation tries to justify the involvement of teenagers in hazardous work with examples from the Second World War and the thesis that -work even in hazardous industries is safer for children than being on the street.- The actions of the Russian authorities once again proved the readiness of the Kremlin not to reckon with its own people, in particular with the interests of children, for the sake of aggressive goals in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/v-rf-pochynayut-zaluchaty-do-praczi-na-shkidlyvyh-vyrobnycztvah-ditej/	2024-12-05T04:36:36-08:00

However, the real consequences of the activities of Russian investors, who received mines in the region back in February, remain doubtful. Among the -results- of the work are mass layoffs, salary delays, and dismantling of equipment. Meanwhile, the occupying authorities of Luhansk region blame the destruction of 4.3 thousand hectares of forests around Stanytsia Luhanska solely on climatic conditions. The local forest farm claims that the cause of the fires was an increase in air temperature. Other factors - the lack of preventive measures, the shortage of extinguishing agents and rescuers - are not taken into account by the occupiers. As well as the failure of the disaster relief campaign. Residents of the affected settlements, whose houses burned down, were mostly forced to evacuate on their own.

Ukrainian soldiers also destroyed 13 tanks, 22 armored combat vehicles, 21 artillery systems, 31 operational-tactical UAVs, 97 vehicles and 2 special vehicles of the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/genshtab-zsu-u-kurskij-oblasti-vorog-22-razy-shturmuvav-pozycziyi-nashyh-zahysnykiv/	2024-12-04T22:23:24-08:00
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces: The stability of the army is impossible without volunteer su...	He wrote about this on his Facebook page. Oleksandr Syrsky noted that it is symbolic that this day is celebrated on the eve of the Day of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The volunteer movement, which came to support the soldiers back in 2014, became the most powerful in the world during Russia's large-scale aggression. -Ukrainian volunteers work according to the principle: either you are in the army or you are for the army. Their help is the warmth of the hands and self-sacrifice that every soldier and unit feels,- Oleksandr Syrsky emphasized. He emphasized that the stability of the Ukrainian army in the face of the enemy, which prevails in terms of numbers and resources, would be impossible without the support of volunteers. Thanks to their efforts, the army receives the necessary drones, cars, first-aid kits, trench candles and other assistance. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine expressed his sincere gratitude to each volunteer and wished good luck and health to all who join the joint struggle. -Let's win together!- - concluded the general. As reported by ArmyInform, Oleksandr Syrsky defined the task of stabilizing the situation in threatening directions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/golovnokomanduvach-zsu-stijkist-armiyi-nemozhlyva-bez-volonterskoyi-pidtrymky/	2024-12-04T22:02:59-08:00

Propagandists attack the computer game: what they invented this time	According to the propagandists, the game allegedly collects players' personal data, such as IP addresses, names, locations, even without their consent, passing this information to Ukrainian military commissariats. This fake was accompanied by the use of the Wired logo, which was supposed to give the information the appearance of authenticity. Propagandists also claim that the studio received funding from the Ukrainian government in exchange for such activities. About this writes Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security. In fact, the GSC Game World studio raised significant funds ($800,000) for the support of the Armed Forces with the help of crowdfunding and donated them to the Ukrainian charity -Return Alive-. In response, Russia started a campaign against the game, including statements about its possible ban. This case is another example of the spread of disinformation aimed at discrediting Ukrainian achievements, particularly in the field of video games. It's also a continuation of a campaign similar to Netflix's previously documented fake trailer disinformation campaign dubbed -Matryoshka-. The main goal of such fakes is to undermine trust in Ukraine and its initiatives on the world stage.

Is there gender equality in the military: about the number of women in the army, body uniform and NA...	The ArmiyaInform correspondent asked Diana Kopanytsia, the head of the Department of Humanitarian Support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, about all this and more. — Ms. Diana, can you provide statistics on women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine? How many in total are in the ranks of the Armed Forces as of the beginning of December 2024, of which there are military personnel? What are the statistics on women in genera and species (number of women)? — Over the past three years, the number of women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, compared to the data before the beginning of the large-scale invasion, has increased by more than 20%. As of October, the total number of women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine was almost 69,000, of which more than 48,000 were military personnel. Instead, in January 2022, on the eve of a large-scale invasion, the total number of women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine was more than 52,000. Currently, more than 5,500 women soldiers are on the front line. Among women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, we now also have more than 10,000 officers, more than 13,000 sergeants, more than 23,000 soldiers and more than 1,500 cadets. The number of female servicemen in leadership positions is almost 7,000, and this figure shows a gradual trend towards growth. More than 1,000 servicewomen have been awarded state awards and more than 18,000 servicewomen have already received combatant status. As for the information in the breakdown of the number of women by military branch, the largest number of women is usually in the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as the largest branch of the military, where more than 18,000 women serve. The figures are somewhat lower in the Air Force and Medical Forces, where the number of women in each branch exceeds 6,000 servicemen. A fairly significant number of female military personnel is also observed in the Territorial Defense Forces, Support Forces and Logistics Forces, and the Naval Forces. After all, we also have hundreds of women successfully serving and performing combat missions in the Special Operations Forces and the Unmanned Systems Forces. — Ukrainian servicemen appeal attentionthat sexism in the army is a widespread phenomenon and lack of material support is one of its manifestations. In particular, it is about the form according to the size and shape of the body, anatomical body armor, underwear, etc. What coordinate system are we currently in to correct this situation? What is your administration doing for this? — Prior to the start of the large-scale invasion, security in the Armed Forces of Ukraine was predominantly male-oriented. In particular, at the level of regulatory documents of the Ministry of Defense, only a single uniform standard was approved - men's. The women's uniform was provided only for the formal one - a petticoat, a skirt and high-heeled shoes. There were also no requirements for personal protective equipment and other tactical items for female servicemen. This created problems for female military personnel, who were forced to wear men's uniforms that did not meet their physiological needs and anthropometric parameters. The situation with the material support of female servicemen in the Armed Forces of Ukraine is not ideal, but it has positive dynamics. Every day, with the joint efforts of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff, we work to improve the material support of female servicemen, and at the moment we have the following results in this direction. In December 2023, for the first time, female servicemen received 50,000 sets of summer field suits, which are made taking into account female anthropometric parameters. Such uniform samples contain structural elements that allow female servicemen to feel comfortable while performing tasks in field conditions and permanent deployment points. Field trials of the women's demi-season uniform are currently underway, and the first samples of the winter uniform are ready for research testing. During 2023, women's underwear was also tested, which in 2024 was supplied to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The supplied underwear samples cover a wide range of sizes, and also have a comfortable cut that does not restrict movement and is suitable for use in full equipment when performing combat tasks. Ultimately, in December 2023 and January 2024, the Ministry of Defense certified two bulletproof vests for female servicemen. The corresponding protective equipment has an outwardly curved armor plate, narrowed shoulders and an extended bottom, which helps to adjust the body armor to the anatomical features of a woman. — Where do you see a positive trend regarding gender policy in the Armed Forces during a large-scale war? Where is the critical situation, and where is the most needed point of effort? — A key achievement in ensuring gender equality in the Armed Forces of Ukraine is the removal of legal restrictions on the tenure of women in military positions. Since 2018, Ukraine has managed to significantly expand the range of combat positions for women: there are opportunities to be commanders of infantry units, female snipers, machine gunners, grenade launchers, scouts, and even drive armored vehicles or be a tank gunner. As of today, there are no regulatory obstacles to the occupation of positions by women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Women have the opportunity to serve in positions of their choosing, including typical combat specialties (recon, sniper, machine gunner, grenade launcher, gunner or UAV operator - ed.). And as practice shows, women in such positions are effective. At the same time, we periodically receive requests that, in fact, commanders do not admit female servicemen to combat positions, despite the high motivation of such women and the absence of objective obstacles to the performance of such tasks. We are working together with gender advisers and commanders of the types and separate branches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to minimize such discrimination. — How do you cooperate with partners in the context of gender equality? What do they praise for, and what shortcomings do they point to? — Cooperation with international partners is one of the main areas of activity of the Office, as the direction of gender equality is an important direction. Most of the standards in the field of ensuring gender equality are borrowed from international documents in the field of human rights, as well as the practice of international courts. I also want to note the fruitful cooperation of the management with our Ukrainian partners and experts in the field of ensuring gender equality. Thus, during 2023-2024, more than 250 advisers on gender issues of the Ministry of Defense have already undergone educational training with the assistance of national and international public organizations. The Department also systematically and productively cooperates with the Government Commissioner for Gender Policy Kateryna Levchenko regarding the implementation of the -Women, peace, security- agenda. Thanks to the professional work of these organizations and experts, the advisers on gender issues had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with international approaches to the issues of preventing and combating manifestations of discrimination, gender-based and domestic violence, the foundations of international humanitarian law. - When we talk about -NATO's gender equality standards- - what exactly are we talking about? Explain in simple language. - Put simply, the NATO Gender Equality Standards are a set of rules, guidelines and principles that help ensure equal opportunities, in particular, for women and men in the armed forces of NATO member and partner countries. The goal of these standards is to create an environment where every service member, regardless of gender or gender identity, can fulfill their potential. At the same time, gender equality does not at all mean that we should allocate equal resources to meet the needs of women and men in the military, or fully equalize men and women in terms of rights and responsibilities during service. True gender equality involves the fair distribution of resources and the creation of equal conditions for people, taking into account their gender needs. After all, it is quite clear that the proper material support of a woman who performs combat tasks may require more resources than in the case of creating identical conditions for male servicemen. If we look at this issue from a practical perspective, then in this context we should also mention the initial requirements for the interoperability of Ukraine with NATO, which Ukraine must implement in the near future so that our Armed Forces can effectively interact with the military structures of the member countries of the Alliance and conduct joint military operations. Such requirements include, for example, the introduction of a clear system of gender advisers in the Ministry of Defense system, the removal of legal barriers that prevent the participation and representation of women in security and defense sector institutions, thematic training for gender advisers, the development of prevention policies and responding to sexual violence in the military, etc. — At the beginning of October 2024, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine announced that it plans to conduct a gender analysis and identify institutional obstacles to the implementation of equality programs in the ranks of the Armed Forces. As of the beginning of December - how are things going? - To begin with, it is worth finding out what gender analysis actually is. Simply put, it is the identification and assessment of barriers that exist in law or in practice that prevent equal rights and opportunities for service members because of their gender or gender identity. Gender analysis involves collecting and analyzing data (for example, the number of women and men in different units - ed.), identifying practices or rules that may create inequality (for example, women's limited access to certain military occupations), and ultimately, the preparation of recommendations or draft regulations designed to solve the identified problems. That is, effective gender analysis is a long and painstaking work that requires the processing of a large amount of diverse data. Another important area of ​​our work is the gender analysis of data on military positions held by women and the identification of barriers that prevent women from effectively performing their duties. Our strategic goal is to create all the necessary conditions for women to occupy leadership positions in the army, demonstrating their professional qualities and leadership skills. - What are you planning for 2025 in the context of gender policy in the Armed Forces? - One of the key priorities for the next year is the regulatory regulation of the status and powers of the gender advisor in the Ministry of Defense system in accordance with NATO standards and best practices. We will also continue the gender analysis of the current needs of female servicemen in the army and, based on its results, we will work on improving the physical and material support of female servicemen, in particular, in cooperation with international partners. And, as we have done this year, we will work hard to train our gender advisers so that they can get not only the legal status and powers written in the regulations, but also practical tools to carry out their daily activities, and in the future they can participate in joint operations involving NATO countries. A separate priority is for us to improve the language training of advisors on gender issues, because, as I mentioned earlier, gender issues are of a global nature and are based on international regulatory documents and NATO standards, most of which are written in English.

It was not necessary to go far: the Finnish army ordered new mobile 120-mm mortar systems from a loc...	As stated in the release, disclosed by the manufacturing company on the occasion of the conclusion of the relevant contract, the new mortar system integrates traditional heavy mortar weapons into a modular carriage, which is then mounted on a military truck, reports ArmyInform. The mortar complex, codified by the Finnish Army as the 120 KRH M3, was developed by Patria for the Finnish Land Forces. TREMOS is a modular carriage with a fire control system and recoil compensators. It can use any traditional 120mm mortar and mount on 4×4/6×6/8×8 trucks that have the appropriate container -locks- to secure the cargo. In case of machine malfunction, the weapon can be quickly transferred to another chassis. The module does not require any preparation before firing and can fire directly from the chassis of the vehicle, which greatly increases the mortar's mobility. -Patria has increased the mobility of heavy mortars in excellent cooperation with the Finnish Army and the Finnish Defense Forces Logistics Command, creating a new weapon system,- said Jussi Järvinen, executive vice president of Patria's Finnish division. He emphasized the significant tests carried out and pointed to Patria's legacy of innovative mortar systems, such as the famous AMOS (Advanced Mortar System) and NEMO (New Mortar) turrets, which are the basis of TREMOS development. The artillery system, by its characteristics, does not differ in any way from a similar trailed mortar, which would work traditionally on the ground. The main goal of the project is to increase the survivability of the mortar units of the Finnish ground forces due to better mobility in the conditions of war with an enemy that conducts counter-battery warfare and actively uses reconnaissance and strike drones. The Finnish military command is convinced that in the future heavy mortars will play an increasingly important role in the composition of ground troops as the main means of defeating from closed positions. Currently, the country's ground forces plan to gain experience in the use of such systems on ordered pre-production samples, and later make a decision on possible additional purchases of 120 KRH M3 complexes. -The goal is to start training conscripts with the new mortars during 2026,- said Colonel Ari Lehmuslehti of the Ground Forces Headquarters of the Finnish Armed Forces. However, the experts of the IKK defense website Defense Express (DE) were quite skeptical about this choice of soldiers' weapons countries of Suomi. According to their conclusions, it is a standard 120-mm mortar with manual loading, which was installed on the chassis of a truck, added a digitalized guidance system and a hydraulic recoil absorption mechanism. -The choice of this system may be surprising, because Patria has a much more advanced NEMO, which has a perfect fire control system, the possibility of a -fire raid-, when several mines that were fired from the same vehicle on different trajectories arrive at the same target, and also even the possibility of shooting on the move. It is also worth adding about the mechanization of charging and the fact that it is an armored chassis compared to TREMOS. At the same time, if the wheeled chassis can be replaced by a tracked one, for example, for the US Army, the NEMO mortar system was installed on the AMPV chassis,- noted the IKK DE. It should be recalled that our editors told in detail in one of his previous articles on the NEMO armored mortar system. By chance remind that in the order of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine dated August 28, 2023 on acceptance for armament The 120-mm mortar M/41D, the developer and manufacturer of which is the Finnish company Patria, is indicated in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation of regular samples of foreign weapons. In turn, the authors of the portal European Defense Review indicate that the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Finland concluded the above contract for the supply of a pre-production batch of TREMOS modular mortar systems, which are expected to be delivered to the troops in 2025. The number of ordered units is not named, but the contact amount is €4.7 million. Patria presented this new weapon system at the Future Mortar Systems conference in London on October 29, 2024	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/hodyty-daleko-ne-dovelosya-finska-armiya-zamovyla-novi-mobilni-120-mm-minometni-systemy-u-misczevogo-vyrobnyka/	2024-12-04T21:01:40-08:00
F-16 against Russian cruise missiles: how many air targets were shot down -Battle Falcons-	Since then, Russia has launched three massive combined air and missile strikes on Ukrainian territory — one in late August and two in November. F-16s participated in repelling these large-scale attacks as an air defense tool. Official information on the effectiveness of the use of F-16s against Russian cruise missiles and attack UAVs was collected and the number of enemy air targets shot down by Ukrainian -Battle Falcons- was calculated by ArmyInform. Full statistical information on Russian cruise missiles and attack drones shot down by the F-16 has not been officially made public. Therefore, approximate calculations of enemy targets destroyed by the -Battle Falcons- can be made only on the basis of separate official reports of the Air Force and the General Staff, as well as statements of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. For the first time, F-16s demonstrated their high efficiency in Ukrainian skies during the repulse of a Russian air-missile strike on August 26, 2024. Then the enemy launched 127 missiles of various types and 109 Shahed-131/136 attack UAVs on the territory of Ukraine. It was shot down 201 air targets - 102 missiles and 99 attack UAVs. Unfortunately, the military pilot Oleksiy Mes with the call sign -Moonfish- died in an aerial battle. In the notification of his death, the Command of the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine noted that during the repulsion of the Russian of a massive combined air and missile strike, the pilot destroyed three cruise missiles and one attack UAV Instead, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported, that -during the aerial combat, the F-16 aircraft demonstrated their high efficiency, four enemy cruise missiles were shot down by airborne weapons.- So, on August 26, 2024, F-16 fighters shot down at least four cruise missiles and one Shahed. Russia carried out the next large-scale combined air and missile attack on the objects of the energy sector of Ukraine with various types of air, land and sea-based missiles and Shahed type UAVs at night on November 17, 2024. Then, as reported President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi, F-16 pilots shot down about 10 enemy air targets. The Supreme Commander-in-Chief did not specify exactly which enemy aircraft the pilots of the Ukrainian -Fighting Falcons- destroyed, but their contribution was about 7% of all enemy air targets destroyed at that time. Finally, on the night of November 27-28, 2024, Russia struck Ukraine with 188 air strikes, including 91 missiles of various types and 97 Shahed attack UAVs. Among them the Defense Forces of Ukraine vorozhyh-bpla/->shot down 76 Kh-101/&#8221;Caliber- cruise missiles, 3 guided air missiles X-59/69 and 35 Shaheds. Seven enemy cruise missiles were destroyed by F-16 pilots. Volodymyr Zelenskyi reported this in an interview with the British broadcaster Sky News on November 29. -Seven cruise missiles were destroyed two nights ago. Seven missiles that flew over infrastructure, civilian infrastructure,- he said. Thus, for the second time, the President of Ukraine highly praised the effectiveness of F-16 fighter jets in repelling massive combined air and missile strikes from the Russian Federation. -How are the F-16s doing today? Very good. Great, for the most part,- he emphasized in an interview with Sky News. Also, Volodymyr Zelenskyi partially reported specific data on the effectiveness of the pilots of the -Fighting Falcons-, because it is not excluded that, in addition to cruise missiles, they also shot down several -Shakhed-. At the same time, the Head of State also noted the biggest problem of the F-16 as a Ukrainian air defense tool — their insufficient number. -We have very few F-16s,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an interview with Sky News, emphasizing the need for the Defense Forces of Ukraine both for more of these fighters and for other types of modern weapons. However, despite their small numbers, the Ukrainian -Battle Falcons- undoubtedly proved their high efficiency as an air defense vehicle, destroying about 20 enemy air attack vehicles. Increasing the number of F-16s in the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be able to significantly improve this statistic.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/f-16-proty-rosijskyh-krylatyh-raket-skilky-povitryanyh-czilej-zbyly-bojovi-sokoly/	2024-12-04T20:47:16-08:00

Then wait for some time, then type again and erase again. That is, they do not need to occupy some frontiers, but to put more of their people in,- said Volodymyr. As reported by ArmyInform, the 53rd brigade appealed to the servicemen who voluntarily left their units, with a call to return to service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/shturmuyut-tak-nache-hochut-shhob-shturmovyky-shvydshe-zakinchylysya-taktyka-rosiyan-na-toreczkomu-napryamku/	2024-12-04T11:58:55-08:00
The occupiers are preparing to launch fiber-optic drones at a distance of 15-20 kilometers	About this on the ArmyTV stream, a serviceman of the 4th brigade of operational assignment of the National Guard -Rubizh- Andriy Otchenash, who is located in the Lymano-Kupian direction. -The adversary started using optical fiber. If you watch his telegram channels, the enemy says that he will use copters on fiber optics for 15-20 kilometers. This is a not very pleasant situation, because it will complicate our logistics, because EW devices do not work on fiber-optic drones,- said Andriy Otchenash. He also noted the progress of the Russians in the development of Lancet strike drones, as well as aircraft-type reconnaissance UAVs. -They don't stand still, and that's also a minus.

Relay cabinets of Ukrzaliznytsia were set on fire: 6 citizens were notified of the suspicion	This was notified in the SBU. At the enemy's behest, they tried to destroy substations and energy facilities of Ukrzaliznytsia with the help of flammable mixtures. The occupiers recruited all the participants remotely through specially created Telegram channels, where the rioters offer money in exchange for cooperation. However, instead of funds from the Russians, the arsonists received suspicion from Ukrainian law enforcement officers. Thus, a 33-year-old resident of the capital was detained in the Kyiv region, who, after serving 10 years in prison for theft, went to cooperate with the occupiers. According to their instructions, the recidivist set fire to the Ukrzaliznytsia relay box, which ensures the uninterrupted movement of trains on one of the sections in Kyiv. Another person involved is a 29-year-old resident of Boryspil, a gambling addict who hoped to -cover- his losses on lottery machines with money from the Russian Federation. For this purpose, the intruder also burned down another Ukrzaliznytsia relay cabinet.

He ran away with his -wife- to live with his bride: two pseudo-spouses were exposed at the border	About the State Border Service of Ukraine informs December 4. -At the Krakivets checkpoint, the border guards of the Lviv detachment discovered a 24-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman who got married, most likely, without the intention of creating a real family,- the message reads. At first, the husband said that he was allegedly taking his wife to Germany for treatment of the musculoskeletal system. Later it turned out that he had recently proposed to another girl, who, after crossing the border, was supposed to go to him. In addition, border guards exposed another pseudo-couple at the Sheghina checkpoint. -A 44-year-old native of Ivano-Frankivsk region married a 57-year-old compatriot. In communication with the border guards, the man could not answer a number of questions: where his wife is from and when she was born, he also could not say. The citizen intended to leave for the Czech Republic,- said the State Security Service. On the detection of signs of a criminal offense, responsibility for which is provided for in Art. 332 of the Criminal Code -Illegal transportation of persons across the state border of Ukraine-, operatives of the detachment informed the National Police.

One of the pilots was injured by the recoil, but it was not possible to evacuate him through open terrain. Brothers called Oleg for help as a more experienced fighter. Despite the danger from repeated drops, -Reaper- reached the wounded man and helped save him. -Put on the armor and ran. I worked in that place and knew where he could be dragged. At that moment, it was not scary, I did not think whether they would reset or not. Fear came later. And then we waited for the moment and pulled away together with a friend,- the fighter said. The Ground Forces said that before the war, -Zhnets- was a tractor driver. He joined the army on mobilization. -It was clear to me that it was better to stop the enemies away from home. When the enemy is next to your family, it is more difficult to fight - your head is occupied by something else,- Oleg explains his motivation.

-Maidan- in Georgia and an offensive operation in Syria: Putin is losing influence in the Caucasus a...	Meanwhile, on November 27, Syrian opposition forces launched a large-scale offensive against Bashar al-Assad's forces in Aleppo province in Syria. The Syrian rebels successfully took advantage of the vacuum created by the weakening of Hezbollah, pressure on Iran and Russia's focus on the war with Ukraine. It was the Russians who most helped Assad stay in power since the start of the country's civil war in 2011. Oleksandr Chupak, an expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Studies-, talks about the situation in Georgia and Syria in an exclusive comment to ArmyInform. -Anti-government protests in Georgia cannot but remind us of the events of the Revolution of Dignity in Ukraine in 2013-2014. Pro-Russian oligarchic forces likely hold power through manipulation of the electoral process. The government announces the suspension of the European integration process. Thousands of protests erupt on the streets, which are accompanied by clashes between demonstrators and security forces. Like Yanukovych's regime at the beginning of the protests in Kyiv, the Georgian government exudes confidence that the rallies will lead to nothing. Despite national dissatisfaction with the announced results of the elections held on October 26, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze was not afraid to put the country's rapprochement with the EU on hold on November 28. The move was immediately hailed by Vladimir Putin as an example of -courage-. As soon as the protests broke out, the authorities began to frighten the nation with the so-called -Ukrainian scenario.- The most powerful Georgian oligarch, Bidzina Ivanishvili, who is credited with full control over the current government, has warned of the danger of a second Russian invasion in the event of an overthrow. Despite the mass of the protests, they lack a clear leader. President Salome Zurabishvili, who did not recognize the election results and publicly supported the protesters, is symbolically acting in this role. However, it is not directly coordinating the protestors' efforts. The difference here can be costly, because on the other side of the confrontation, the security forces have not yet shown any signs of disloyalty to the authorities. The lack of a general plan of action does not allow Georgians to organize resistance cells outside the borders of large cities. The government firmly controls the state media, which carries out anti-protest propaganda. Further developments will depend on the ability of various protest groups to unite around a common goal. Having a strong leader or group of leaders with uncompromising views can turn a national movement into a force that the authorities cannot handle. However, the probability of success of anti-government forces in Georgia is still much lower than a decade ago in Ukraine.- -The offensive of the Syrian opposition groups in the north-east of the country is already being compared with the attack of Hamas on Israel last October. Both operations were unexpected by their opponents and brought quick results to the attackers. However, in the case of Syria, the current government is on the verge of a real disaster. In fact, the province of Aleppo was surrendered without a fight, for which complex battles with the involvement of foreign contingents (primarily Russian and Iranian) were fought for years. As of December 4, fighting is underway for the city of Hama, an important logistics center in the center of the country that connects the north (Aleppo), the south (Damascus) and the Mediterranean coast, where the Russian naval contingent is located. Since the rapid advance of the opposition forces has stopped, the front line is relatively stabilized. They name several scenarios for the further development of events, but for Ukraine, the best option would be the intensification of hostilities for a long time, which would force Russia to transfer significant forces to Syria. Currently, we see that the Syrian government army is showing low combat effectiveness, so Assad will rely on the support of his partners. There are already two positive points for us: — the transfer of Russian aircraft to Syria. This can reduce the intensity of shelling of the Russian-Ukrainian front by air defense systems and air defense systems and the general activity of enemy aviation; — increasing costs for the war in Syria will divert Russian forces from the Ukrainian direction and may accelerate the economic collapse of Moscow. Further developments will depend on the presence of forces in the opposition. Obviously, their rapid offensive would not have been possible without the foreign support that Turkey, the United States and Europe could provide. If the supply rate is high (and not the same as for Ukraine), opposition forces will be able to gain a foothold and develop an offensive. The fate of the Russian fleet is the most interesting. Where will he go if the government loses the coast? If Spain does not allow through Gibraltar, there remains a passage through the Bosphorus, if the Turks allow it. Then an exciting trip to Novorossiysk awaits on the ship of the Russian Federation under the strikes of Ukrainian surface drones.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/majdan-u-gruziyi-ta-nastupalna-operacziya-v-syriyi-putin-vtrachaye-vplyv-na-kavkazi-ta-blyzkomu-shodi/	2024-12-04T01:57:24-08:00

Sometimes it happens that one or two get to our trenches, but they are either destroyed there by the infantry, or the drones finish them off,- says Yevnen Alkhimov.

She spied on the defenders of Chernihiv under the guise of taxi rides: a minor was detained	About informs December 4 SBU. -In order to -bypass- the Ukrainian air defense, the agent had to identify and transmit to the aggressor the coordinates of the anti-aircraft missile systems and radar stations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine that defend the border region. For the conspiracy of reconnaissance trips, the girl ordered a taxi in which she drove around the area and secretly recorded the objects she needed,- the SBU said. After such trips, the figure returned home, where she created an intelligence report for her Russian curator in the form of media files with -required- geolocations. The SBU military counterintelligence exposed a Russian agent, documented her crimes and arrested her -red handed- while she was photographing a defense facility. It was established that the person involved was in direct contact with a staff member of the Russian game, with whom she communicated through an anonymous chat in the messenger. During the searches, a mobile phone with evidence of intelligence and subversive activities for the benefit of the Russian Federation was seized from the detainee. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed the accused about suspicion for h. 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law).

Ukrainian missile program: why -Neptune- and -Palyanytsia- are becoming symbols of a new defense era	This was announced by the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov. According to him, April 13, 2022 was a historic day for Ukrainian defense. Just then, using the domestic missile complex -Neptun-, the Armed Forces of Ukraine sank the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation - the cruiser -Moscow-. -Today, when the war continues, missiles become not only a symbol of a technological breakthrough, but also a critically important tool for the defense of our state,- he noted. The Minister of Defense said that in modern warfare, missiles are a key element for striking the deep rear of the enemy. Despite the effectiveness of drones, their power is limited. In addition, the use of foreign missiles often requires coordination with partners. -This is where the strategic importance of own missiles is manifested. Ukrainian cruise and ballistic missiles will allow our Armed Forces to act independently, delivering pinpoint strikes on key enemy targets. This not only strengthens our defense, but also creates an effective deterrent mechanism for the aggressor,- he assured. Rustem Umyerov reminded that this year Ukraine has already produced the first 100 rockets a>. This became possible thanks to the work of the Ministry of Defense, which coordinates both public and private initiatives in missile development. -In particular, serial production of R-360 cruise missiles of the Neptune complex has been restored and scaled up. Modified missiles are now capable of hitting targets at a longer range. Private enterprises are also showing incredible results,- he said. For example, a new startup implemented the Palyanitsa missile project, which has already entered serial production thanks to the support of the Ministry of Defense. -This is a vivid example of how the state and the private sector come together to achieve a common goal,- said the head of the defense department. As Rustem Umyerov noted, Ukraine is not only developing its own potential, but also integrating into the European defense industry. This cooperation makes it possible to localize the production of foreign technologies in Ukraine. Among the key projects: According to the Minister of Defense, these initiatives provide access to advanced developments and create an opportunity for the modernization of the Ukrainian defense industry. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is actively accelerating structural changes, creating conditions for more effective management of the missile program. The new Department of Support for Missile Projects and ABM Means, as well as the Main Directorate for the Development of Missile Programs, will coordinate the efforts of the state and the private sector. -This program will allow not only to provide modern weapons for today's battles, but also to lay the foundation for the defense of the future. Ukrainian missiles will become a guarantor of the security of our state, capable of deterring any aggression,- Rustem Umyerov explained. He emphasized that the Ukrainian missile program is not only about war. It's about independence, self-sufficiency and technological breakthrough. -Our successes in rocketry prove that we are capable of creating game-changing weapons. These missiles will protect our land today. And they will ensure peace in the future. Because in the modern world, victory is not only a question of strength, but also a question of technology,- he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov held a meeting with Ukrainian manufacturers of missile weapons, at which plans for 2025, key areas of cooperation and development of the industry were discussed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/ukrayinska-raketna-programa-chomu-neptun-ta-palyanyczya-stayut-symvolamy-novoyi-oboronnoyi-ery/	2024-12-04T01:13:14-08:00

According to him, the Russians are constantly digging various holes, fox hides and vines between the trenches. -That's why storming such places is difficult. Similar to the experience of the Vietnam War. It is very difficult to clean them at all. Because you don't understand, it can be a deepening, or it can be 10 meters,- said Oleksandr Borodin.

Severodonetsk freezes, young people are sent to the front: the realities of the occupied Luhansk reg...	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, head of the Luhansk OVA. Changes to Russian legislation allow recruits to be sent to a combat zone immediately after being drafted, without the mandatory three-month term of military service. In Severodonetsk, meanwhile, the third winter continues without full-fledged centralized heating. The occupation authorities were unable to fulfill their promises regarding heat supply made in 2023-2024. Despite the launch of one boiler house, its capacity is not enough to heat multi-storey residential areas. In some neighborhoods, the coolant does not reach at all, and in areas with heating, the batteries remain barely warm. Frequent bursts of pipelines complicate the situation, and the number of emergency teams is insufficient for a quick response. As a result, many local residents remain in the cold without receiving adequate assistance. The freezing residents of Severodonetsk are forced to rely on their own strength in conditions where the occupation authorities continue to ignore their needs. As reported by ArmyInform, there is still no mobile phone in Lysychansk connection, which was disconnected by the Russian occupiers. Local residents are forced to travel to Novoaidar or Starobilsk to contact their relatives.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/syevyerodoneczk-zamerzaye-molod-vidpravlyayut-na-front-realiyi-okupovanoyi-luganshhyny/	2024-12-04T00:26:51-08:00

CAESAR doctors: how French self-propelled guns are repaired near the front line. ArmyInform report	Proximity to the front is not just words or geography, it is immediately felt: while we were waiting for the boys, we saw about ten flights from different directions. Only by the smoke rising, it was roughly understood whether it was an anti-tank missile or an anti-aircraft missile. White and focused is the KAB, and black and floating on the horizon is the MLRS. The guys have arrived and we are quickly going to the landing site, one of thousands in Donetsk region. Not the only place where you can try to hide in the steppe. Almost every landing is cut down, injured by enemy artillery or anti-aircraft guns, but saved for our defenders. We've arrived at the Burrow, the camouflaged hideout for the CAESAR ACS and its crew. The machine lives up to its name, the CAESAR is big and majestic. It would be a virtue on parade, but in the steppe it is not easy to hide it to protect it from enemy blows. Driver-mechanics Serhii and Ivan greet the cannon, they are old friends and brothers, and like real doctors, they take suitcases with tools and immediately start inspecting the car. Ivan disappears behind a huge wheel, everyone is anxiously waiting for a diagnosis: whether it will be possible to repair it on the spot, or whether it will have to be taken deeper to the rear, to the repair company. An anxious wait, finally Ivan says that today's problem is small: the tube on the handbrake is broken. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief. From time to time, Ivan's smiling face appears from under CAESAR, a headlamp shines, and Serhii hands out tools, gives advice and cheers everyone up with jokes. Then they conjure something together with the help of a gas burner and tweezers, Ivan disappears again. In 15-20 minutes, satisfied with their work, they say that the car is ready for battle. The calculation quickly gathers and goes on combat duty, leaving the smoke behind, and we behind them, only already in the direction of the contact line. Serhiy is a driver-mechanic. He is 50 years old, he is from the Chernihiv region, he was mobilized back in 2022, he got into the repair department of the brigade. I ask how CAESAR is in terms of repairs. Sergey smiles and shakes his head: - CAESAR seems not adapted to these weather conditions and operating conditions. It's one thing to ride the track, shoot and drive, then it's all good. And when bad weather starts, and you have to drive through fields, then everything becomes much more difficult. On the Zaporizhzhia direction, there was a difficult situation with the brake pipes, because when the mud freezes, it easily breaks the brake lines. We then went around the clock to repair. Because this is a very smart car, all on sensors, and if it shows that the brake fluid is leaking, then the car will not go anywhere. And so we moved twenty-four hours a day from car to car, repairing. Unfortunately, this is a weak point, because the car is like a military one, and the pipelines are made of plastic tubes that cannot withstand any loads. - Perhaps the French created this self-propelled gun for desert conditions? - Most likely, for European conditions. Because we faced the fact that in the summer, when there was no rain and the dust was terrible, then everything also went out of order. For example, the locks on the wedge could not be closed, because the guys try to lubricate everything, but dust gets stuck, and this does not allow the machine to work as it should. The responsibilities of the calculation include the maintenance of a combat vehicle. There are things they have to do after combat work, including cleaning the wedge. Because if it is dirty, the lock does not close, then they cannot shoot, the automation simply will not allow it. If the calculation is not yet very experienced, then it happens that they call - and we repair the car by phone, remotely. - Do you have time for departures? - We try. It happens when you work on one machine, you know that two more machines are waiting for you, then you choose something more difficult that the guys themselves will not be able to eliminate. There are still problems with the electronics. Unfortunately, the further, the more. Because even the powder boxes fall apart from so many shots. Can you imagine what happens to those wires and sensors in the car that they endure? - Do you have enough spare parts? - There are enough critical ones, they are supplied to us. We buy some small things ourselves, because there is no time to wait for elementary things, such as oil seals, gaskets. When there is already a serious breakdown, then the car goes to the factory, and there they already change the parts. —You started with the Soviet self-propelled guns. How different is CAESAR from them? - Very different, especially the -stuffing-. Because CAESAR is packed with electronics. In the Soviet self-propelled guns, everything is arranged more simply: it drives - while it drives, it shoots - while it can shoot. And there are many such nuances that some sensor has worked - and the car has stopped. Like today, when the usual brake pipe broke. It's good that the car was in the hole. And it happens that it is on the way to the fire line, much closer to the front line, and then it is an excellent target for FPV drones, which take apart the car very quickly. There was no such thing in the Zaporizhzhia direction, we did not hear about efpivishkas, except that -Lancets- flew in from time to time. Driver-mechanic Ivan from Vinnytsia region. He was mobilized a year and a half ago. Before mobilization, he worked in the State Emergency Service, was a dispatcher, then resigned, worked abroad, then in construction. — When I was mobilized, I did not have much experience in repairs. Well, except that he was fixing his car at home. Of course, I had no idea about CAESAR then. I saw him for the first time in the Zaporozhye direction and was a little scared at first. But nothing. Day by day sorted it out fine. — Did it take a lot of time? — It takes two or three weeks not to be afraid to approach her. During this time, you can more or less figure out what and why. I was lucky, because as soon as I arrived, I was assigned to work with an already experienced master. And I rode with him for two weeks. He showed me everything, told me everything. I quickly absorbed all this. Here the problem is that YouTube will not help. Almost everything is there, but about CAESAR - nothing. In general. Therefore, only my own experience and the experience of my peers. - Do you remember any such breakdown, which would be called the most difficult? - There were many such breakdowns, you can't remember everything at once. For example, when there was a CAESAR flight that was standing in a hole. It was necessary to quickly evacuate the car from there. We arrived, and everything was cut down. It was necessary to replace the damaged wheels, and try to do this if the nuts were cut by debris! Thank God that not all eight wheels had to be changed, but only on one side and only three. But they are big and heavy. Well, even though the crew helped, because my partner and I arrived, we both take turns. And there was another problem, that it was not land, but a real swamp. We try to lift the car with a jack, and the jack just sinks into the ground. You are constantly lifting, the jack is drowning, you are laying and laying, twisting further. It's as if there is such a thing as changing the wheels, and it took four hours. And it's not in the rear four hours, but where it can fly! And it is there for a very long time. - Do you like this job? - But how can you tell. Unfortunately, this is war. But yes, it's okay. Well, if you know your job, you like it. If there is an order to be transferred somewhere, I will not argue, but if I were given a choice, I would probably go to the CAESAR calculation, and I would try myself there. But that's also normal. Extreme is also enough.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/likari-caesar-yak-remontuyut-franczuzki-samohidky-nepodalik-peredovoyi-reportazh-armiyainform/	2024-12-03T21:07:05-08:00
Benefits for combatants: ArmyInform reminds you of the main ones	A significant part of them really works, although it requires a certain amount of time and nerves to design. And some of them have already lost their relevance. Most of the benefits are regulated by the Law of Ukraine -On the Status of War Veterans, Guarantees of Their Social Protection-. Participants in hostilities (hereinafter referred to as UBD) have the right to: The area of ​​housing for which a discount is granted, when calculating the heating fee, is 21 square meters. m of heating area for each person who permanently lives in a residential building and an additional 10.5 sq. m per family. And for families consisting only of disabled persons, a 75% discount is provided for the use of gas for home heating for double the size of the standard heating area (42 sq. m for each person who is entitled to a fee discount, and 21 square meters per family). By the way, you can get a benefit not only for own housing, but also for rented housing. An experimental project was also introduced, which has to make it easier for combatants and war veterans to receive benefits for paying for housing and communal services. As for travel, it is enough to show the ID card of a participant in hostilities for urban transport. For the most part, this works fine with public transport. But there are problems with FOPs. The fact is that local budgets should compensate them for the transportation of beneficiaries. But this does not always happen. So there are cases when the passage is refused. What to do in such a situation, read in our material /a>. To travel to other regions, for example, by train, you also need a ticket sheet, which is given together with the UBD certificate. The state provides combatants with targeted support for obtaining professional (vocational and technical), professional pre-higher and higher education in state and communal educational institutions: Benefits enjoyed by families of combatants: Of course, this is not a complete list of benefits regulated by the state. But we tried to talk about those that are currently relevant. We also note that having the right to a benefit is not always enough to use it. In many cases, it still needs to be properly completed. How to do this, read here. It is also important to understand that there are currently many initiatives by local authorities or private organizations regarding combatants. There are stores that provide discounts on goods and services for the presence of an ID or even a military ticket. Participants in hostilities in many regions can visit museums, exhibitions, zoos, theaters for free or at a significant discount. Therefore, if you are on vacation, you should always have your ID with you. Certain benefits are introduced by local authorities. For example, in Kyiv and some other regions, children of combatants are provided free meals in educational institutions. Or free parking . There are also material assistance programs for military personnel. Therefore, it is worth contacting the authorities at your place of residence and finding out what options are available to you.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/pilgy-dlya-uchasnykiv-bojovyh-dij-armiyainform-nagaduye-pro-osnovni/	2024-12-03T21:04:24-08:00
The hype surrounding Putin's Oreshnik: the Russian Federation invested considerable funds in the pro...	The direct threats of the bunker fuhrer are joined by Kremlin propagandists, who reproduce many different types of materials, trying to cause panic among Ukrainians. A large number of leaked materials indicate that Russia has invested heavily in a propaganda campaign aimed at promoting its -latest weapon-. However, their reliability raises serious doubts. First, according to the GUR of the IOU, on November 21, Russia struck the territory of Ukraine, using a ballistic missile from the -Kedr- missile complex. Ukrainian air defense can theoretically shoot down such missiles, as well as -Daggers-, about the impossibility of shooting down, which Putin said shortly before the large-scale invasion. Secondly, no confirmation of the -terrible- consequences of the missile strike on the Dnipro was ever provided. Those shots that spread on the network turned out to be an abandoned building in Chita, the St. Petersburg sports and concert complex and the Baikonur Cosmodrome. And the video of the alleged flight of the -Oreshnik- is a plume of exhaust gases from the Soyuz-2.1A space launch vehicle. In fact, Putin's -Oreshnik- turned out to be one big fake, and the hype surrounding it, which alarmed many Ukrainians, has the main purpose of cheering up the domestic Russian audience, frightened by the strikes of Western weapons on Russian military factories, airfields and oil depots. After all, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have repeatedly proven that Russian military facilities are not that protected.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/azhiotazh-navkolo-putinskogo-oryeshnika-rf-vklala-chymali-koshty-u-propagandystsku-kampaniyu/	2024-12-03T20:19:37-08:00
To shoot down a cruise missile or -Shahed- from MANPADS: all about the simulator on which anti-aircr...	At one time, ArmyInform already wrote about the training of anti-aircraft fighters. At that time, the simulator had various aerial targets in its library: airplanes and helicopters of various types. Now, in the conditions of the Russians' use of missiles and UAVs of various types, there is a need for its improvement. As project manager Reserve Lieutenant Colonel Mykola Salamakha said, they had to significantly change the software of the training complex: -The company now produces three types of MANPADS simulators. This is a simulator of the Igla portable anti-aircraft missile complex, the American Stinger MANPAD and the Polish-made Piorun MANPAD. When developing a new package of programs, we took into account that a cruise missile, as a rule, flies at an altitude of 50 to 150 m, unlike airplanes that fly at an altitude of 1-5 km. Therefore, these are completely different algorithms of combat work and a completely different way of training a shooter. The angular speed of the target, the boundaries of optical detection are different, in addition, the time from the detection of the missile to the possibility of launch is significantly reduced. Usually, an anti-aircraft gunner sees a missile at the last moment and needs to orientate himself very quickly and shoot, as a rule, in pursuit. With Shaheds, the situation is somewhat simpler, because its speed is about five to six times lower than the speed of a cruise missile, up to 150 km/h. Although now there are new models with a jet engine and a speed of up to 500 km/h. The simulator program provides simulation of targets at different speeds at different altitudes and in different terrain. According to Mykola Solomakha, in addition to single simulators for an anti-aircraft gunner, simulators for the separation of portable anti-aircraft missile systems have also been developed. In particular, tablets or remote controls are used to receive external information or targeting, as it happens in real life. As experience shows, a person who has undergone training in a training center on simulators and has about two or three hundred launches behind him is able to work properly in a real combat situation. The new simulators also take into account some specific moments of work, says the commander of the anti-aircraft unit, senior sergeant Andriy: -When the launch zone is displayed on the simulator, that is, from the moment when the target is visually detected and the shooter begins tracking the target, when he points the sight and when the head captures the target and begins to give a signal that it is possible to shoot, such a concept as shooting on the parameter should be taken into account. This means that it is possible to miss a hit due to the fact that the anti-aircraft missile will have to make very sharp maneuvers and the missile may simply break due to overload. On these simulators, this moment is taken into account. And there are simulators where there is no such launch zone and the instructor does not understand how correctly the shooter acted when performing the exercise.- After exercises, the simulator automatically assigns a grade. There are also separate explanations for the instructor, who must explain to the cadet how he acted, at what points he made mistakes and why, for example, the grade was lowered. To the question of how much time a person needs to prepare from scratch and to be ready to go on combat duty, Mykola Salamakha answered as follows: -In March, April, May 2022, right here in the workshop, people practiced for several hours during 3-5 classes . During each of them, the serviceman made 8-10 launches. And after a person makes more than 50 starts, sustainable skills already appear in him. According to Mykola, it is important to constantly maintain and improve the skills of anti-aircraft fighters. If there is a trainer in the team, training should take place at least once every two weeks, if more often, then it is even better. If there is no simulator, it is advisable to send the anti-aircraft gunner for retraining at training centers at least once every six months to restore the skills he acquired during training.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/shhob-zbyty-krylatu-raketu-abo-shahed-z-pzrk-vse-pro-trenazher-na-yakomu-gotuyut-zenitnykiv/	2024-12-03T20:54:52-08:00
The caliber is smaller, the ammunition is smarter: Sweden is replenishing its BMP fleet	As informs the defense portal Army Recognition, the Scandinavian country plans to purchase about 50 such weapons to replace the CV9040C models. ArmyInform reports. Reporters said that this machine, which is part of the CV90 family developed by BAE Systems Hägglunds, was presented without the additional armor that will be included in the final version. Similar presentations were held in Denmark, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It is worth reminding that CV90 BMPs are also well known in units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. Batches of these armored vehicles were repeatedly transferred to the Ukrainian military as part of aid from the Western allies, as reported by reported by our editors. The new defense project, which received the international designation CV9035 and Stridsfordon 9035 in Sweden, combines the CV90 MkIII chassis with the turret from the Mk IV version. In May 2024, BAE Systems has signed a contract with the Swedish Defense Material Administration FMV for new CV9035 MkIIIC vehicles, as well as associated integrated logistical support. -These new CV9035 MkIIICs will enhance the capabilities of the Swedish Army and provide aircrews with improved combat awareness, increased mobility, protection and lethality,- said Tommy Gustafsson-Rusk, managing director of BAE Systems Hägglunds, which develops and manufactures the CV90. One of the most significant changes in the new BMPs is the weapon system, where the 40mm Bofors gun used on previous models has been replaced by the 35mm Bushmaster gun. This gun upgrade is expected to maintain effectiveness through the use of programmable ammunition. In addition, the CV9035 Mk.IIIC is equipped with two missiles Rbs 58, a modified version of the anti-tank complex Akeron MP, which improves the ability of BMP to hit enemy armored vehicles, including tanks. When designing the CV9035 Mk.IIIC, BAE Systems gunsmiths focused on improved protection of the armored vehicle. It weighs approximately 35 tons, such a solid weight is explained precisely by the additional reservation. The BMP is equipped with sensors and countermeasures designed to detect and respond to threats such as anti-tank missiles, including a system that can launch a defensive projectile to intercept an enemy missile. The armored car also has rubber tracks to replace the steel tracks of older models, and a rear ramp instead of the traditional hatch. BMP retains the capacity of 6-7 military personnel in the landing cabin. Added a 360-degree video camera system to improve crew situational awareness. The version shown in Sweden matches the model the Netherlands is buying, but the Swedish version will have additional armor in the final configuration. Although the exact number of vehicles and the value of the contract have not been disclosed, experts estimate that about 50 units of the new BMPs, potentially valued at $360 million, have been ordered. Armament deliveries are expected between 2025 and 2027. The CV90 BMP family, which has been in service since the 1990s, includes a wide range of variants adapted to different operational needs. These vehicles were purchased in large numbers, more than 1,700 units, performing various functions such as air defense, reconnaissance and armor recovery. The CV90 platform continues to be operated by several countries, including Norway, Finland, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Slovakia, which have adopted it for their respective defense forces. As Sweden continues to plan to modernize its fleet of infantry fighting vehicles, CV9035 Mk.IIICs are expected to play a key role in meeting the country's military needs in the coming years. New BMP CV9035 will replenish the fleet of armored vehicles of the Swedish army.

Cheap and angry - the enemy concentrated a large number of towed guns in the Pokrovsky direction	About this on the ArmyTV stream a soldier of the 14th regiment of the Forces of Unmanned Systems of the Armed Forces with the call sign -Aladdin- told about it. -We see a lot of trailed guns. There used to be fewer of them, but now there are very, very many. We can find 7-8 of them in one flight. We also see many trucks delivering BC. It's hard to tell which howitzers are because they're usually camouflaged,- Aladdin said. According to him, the enemy uses tactics of small groups on the front line. -We see a lot of motorcycles, we see buggies, they are different, the Russians put something on them and it is difficult to recognize them, we see a lot of -loaves- and we see enemy infantry. It is not always possible to work on them all day, because we have not very good weather in this direction,- Aladdin complained. As reported by ArmyInform, the 14th regiment of unmanned aviation complexes of the Forces of Unmanned Systems of the Armed Forces caused fire damage to the Buk-M2 air defense system.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/03/deshevo-i-serdyto-vorog-zoseredyv-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-velyku-kilkist-prychipnyh-garmat/	2024-12-03T12:02:27-08:00

Rustem Umyerov: The Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Health are launching a digital reform of...	This reported Defense Minister Rustem Umyerov. You no longer need to contact the TCC — you can have a medical examination in a convenient place. The reform envisages that the medical examination will be carried out by civilian doctors, who will enter conclusions directly into the Electronic Health Care System (ECHS). Information from the ESOZ will automatically be sent to the electronic system of the Ministry of Defense in a matter of minutes. At the same time, military medical commissions will receive only medical data without personal identification. This ensures objectivity and impartiality when making fitness for duty decisions. Each stage of the process will have a digital footprint - the conclusions of doctors and VLK will be recorded with the help of electronic signatures and stored in the -Oberig- register. This approach will make it possible to quickly check the work of medical institutions in case of doubts about the results of medical examinations. -We are working to ensure that public services for conscripts and our defenders are convenient, transparent and free of unnecessary bureaucracy. The reform of the VLK is another important step on this path,- Rustem Umyerov emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine together with the Ministry of Health presented the reform project of military medical commissions (MMCs), designed to significantly change the outdated system. The reform will make it possible to divide the decisions of the military medical commission into two separate sets of data — medical and administrative. Some specialists will conduct a medical examination for VLC, and others will analyze the anonymized results of these medical examinations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/03/rustem-umyerov-minoborony-ta-moz-zapuskayut-czyfrovu-reformu-vlk/	2024-12-03T09:31:01-08:00

Ukrainian soldiers also destroyed 8 tanks, 22 armored combat vehicles, 23 artillery systems, 31 operational-tactical UAVs, 3 cruise missiles, 60 vehicles and 8 units of special equipment of the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/03/zsu-strymaly-ponad-200-shturmiv-protyvnyka-rosiyany-posyleno-jdut-v-nastup-na-dvoh-napryamkah/	2024-12-02T22:28:44-08:00
40 thousand mobilized Russians, the 125th caliber and the Kursk bridgehead: an expert on the unprece...	Why is this happening now? But will the Russians increase the mobilization norms in the near future? Military expert Petro Chernyk answered these questions: -Recently, there have been huge losses of Russians at the front: more than 1,700 people per day. And this indicator is not decreasing. A logical question arises: why are the Russians so reluctant to count on losses right now? And they really do not count with them. And the month of November is an indicator that the losses are truly incredible. An absolute record was set - more than 45,000 people were confirmed killed and wounded. These are unprecedented losses since World War II. Not only the Russian Federation as such, but in general in the universal sense of the word. Why so? It all boils down to big geopolitics. On January 20, President Trump takes office. And very, very much will depend on his position: what will be our battle. And by this time, Putin has two tasks, as he understands them: to knock us out of the Kursk region. This is moment one. And the second point is to end the full-fledged occupation of Donetsk region. Will they be able to make it happen? In my opinion, they will not be able to. In order for them to realize this task, it is necessary to increase the monthly mobilization rates to 50 thousand people. So far, there is no reliable information that they worked that way. According to my own calculations, they mobilize 40-42 thousand per month. We have the so-called anticipatory extermination, when the enemy's losses are greater than he recruits. In a general sense, do the Russians have mobilization potential? Yes, there is. Unfortunately, it is quite large. They have 2 to 3 million trained men who know how to use a Kalashnikov assault rifle. And if we also take into account the unprepared component, then this number can be safely multiplied by two. In their opinion, learning how to use a Kalashnikov assault rifle takes about five to six days. And for the Russians, the MPL-50, what we call a minesweeper, is also a weapon. There is no mention of the equipment with which they could provide their personnel. The maximum they can do is 25 T-90 tanks per month. So far, there are between 3,000 and 6,000 different armored vehicles in warehouses, along with PT-76. What is PT-76? This is such a small irony: this is the predecessor of the BMP-1. If necessary, they will reach them. And there is an already confirmed, personally verified option, when, say, in the same Kurshchyna, tanks go into battle with almost no ammunition, they are used as a kind of armored vehicle that drops personnel. So, even with a 125 mm shell, they already had a problem. But in no way should the opponent be underestimated. They will also now count all their losses for the month of November. And my personal version is that closer to the New Year, considering that they have a holiday mentality, as they say, Putin may dare to raise the mobilization rates. Our task is to hold both the Kursk bridgehead and Donetsk region before the cycle of dry weather.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/03/40-tysyach-mobilizovanyh-rosiyan-125-j-kalibr-ta-kurskyj-placzdarm-ekspert-pro-bezpreczedentni-vtraty-rf-u-lystopadi/	2024-12-02T22:26:06-08:00

Why the Russians are afraid of our drones: a DSH combatant told where the enemy assault groups disap...	But with the beginning of the invasion chose the way of the paratrooper. Now the lieutenant colonel is the commander of one of the battalions of the 46th separate air mobile brigade. His combat career in the role of a combatant began in the Zaporizhzhia region. It was near Robotyny and Verbovoy. All forest strips located between these settlements were liberated by the 46th brigade. Serhiy recalls that at that time the latest developments were actively used in the battles, and this gave results: -It was then, during the battles in the Zaporizhzhia region, that we actively began to develop UAVs. FPV drones and -drops- were used. At that time, the enemy had not yet caught up with us. The guys were all prepared, intelligent. There were moments when we carried out assault actions without a single loss. No casualties or injuries.- After the battles in Zaporozhye region, the paratroopers were transferred to Donetsk region. The unit got to the outskirts of Maryanka. At that time, the settlement was almost entirely occupied. Only scraps of Ukrainian land remained, where the paratroopers were forced to hold the ruins. And they suffered losses there. -It was decided to prepare a defense line. Everyone who could was sent to equip the fortifications. This is a technical support platoon, a material support platoon, even signalmen were equipping positions at that time. They worked by hand - with shovels, peels. Logs and other materials that were needed were transported at a risk. The task was completed. They built a line, which was then held for more than six months. But, despite their heroism and all their skills, the situation on the front line was such that they were forced to retreat to a certain distance and occupy a more advantageous line,- says the serviceman. Before that, paratroopers did not take part in defensive operations. So I had to study. And learn fast. -We understood how to work in defense, what to do. Fortifications were constantly being built to move personnel to preserve life. Dugouts were dug at a certain distance so that a serviceman could move from shelter to shelter when artillery fire was being fired at him,- recalls Serhiy. In the unit, the UAV group was constantly developing. Both FPVers and Mavic pilots with resets. -There were times when we heard from interceptions that the enemy complained about them very much. And the prisoners also complained: -your drones with skids stole us.- That is, the Russians are very afraid of our drones. But, as they say, enemies do not sleep either. They also began to actively use FPV drones, drops from Mavics, and now with the enemy, you can say, we are on the same level.- However, the enemy has an advantage in the number of personnel. And they do not protect their soldiers, constantly throwing them into crazy assaults. -When we took prisoners, they often complained that their assault groups, which left on armored vehicles, simply disappeared. They reached a certain area and disappeared. Well, they didn't know the truth that we simply destroyed them after they landed,- says Serhiy. Sometimes the paratroopers had to secretly take out the prisoners so that they would not be destroyed by their comrades. In particular, after artillery and drones destroyed the main mass of enemy attack aircraft, paratroopers went out in small groups to clear the area and, if possible, take prisoners. -But the enemy does not spare his own. Even when ours were already leading prisoners, and the Russians saw it, they themselves destroyed these people so that we could not interrogate them. So, people are indifferent to Russians. Therefore, during the assaults carried out by the paratroopers, the prisoners were already taken out secretly, trying to save their lives,- recalls Serhiy. To the question of what he is proud of in his battalion, Serhiy answered without hesitation: -The DSHV is the highlight of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. But I will say that in our country each battalion works in its own way. I am proud of the fact that we still have many of those servicemen who arrived on February 24, 2022. We are all mobilized, few are full-time. We became friends, became one. Basically, we are one fighting family. We have many experienced soldiers, sergeants. If we saw that a sergeant was being followed by soldiers, we suggested that he become an officer. After all, servicemen always follow those officers who were soldiers yesterday.- And we have many such officers now.

Black hornets will come in handy: the US military will be armed with new personal nanodrones	How reported the official portal of this firm, in addition to the supply of the miniature drones themselves, the deal, which is valued in $91 million, provision is made for the transfer of relevant controllers, spare parts and training with personnel to the army, ArmiyaInform reports. These advanced nano-unmanned aerial systems (UAS) will be acquired as part of the second phase of the US Army's Soldier Borne Sensor (SBS), Individual Airborne Reconnaissance System program. According to the company, the US military is currently using previous versions of the Black Hornet system (-Чорный шерный- in Ukrainian), which have been supplied to the US Army since 2018. And the total amount of investment in the SBS project by 2030 is expected to exceed $250 million. By the way, it is worth reminding that miniature drones from Teledyne FLIR are well known in the Defense Forces of Ukraine. As our agency reported with reference to -_blank- rel=-nofollow- href=-https://www-regjeringen-no.translate.goog/en/aktuelt/droner/id2924942/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=uk&amp;_x_tr_hl=uk&amp;_x_tr_pto=op-> statement Ministry of Defense The Kingdom of Norway, in August 2022, Norway and Great Britain decided to purchase a batch of Black Hornet microdrones for the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the amount of more than $9 million. Today's latest variant of this nanodrone builds on the previous version and retains the concept of -infantry tool for reconnaissance and surveillance beyond direct line of sight-, but at the same time has received a better payload compared to the Black Hornet 3, tell the authors of the EDR Magazine site. The drone received an updated 12-megapixel camera with day, night and thermal video and photo channels. With a weight of only 70 grams, the Black Hornet 4 can stay in the air for more than 30 minutes, and the range of the UAV is more than 2 kilometers. The Nanodrone can fly confidently in winds up to 25 knots. Flight performance has been improved with new obstacle avoidance capabilities and an improved battery. Compared to small quadcopters, the single-rotor Black Hornet 4 has extremely low visual and acoustic visibility, allowing it to detect threats day and night without being detected. According to information of the experts of the IKK Defense Express portal, in order to implement the idea of ​​improving the capabilities of the drone into a concept, the developers had to slightly increase its dimensions. Yes, the weight has almost doubled, from 33 grams to about 70 grams. Rotor diameter - from 123 mm to 190 mm, length - from 168 mm to 255 mm. That is, the drone still remains quite small, and the entire unmanned aircraft complex, which weighs 1.3 kg, can still be carried in a bag on a body armor. The drone is able to launch in less than 20 seconds, well suited for missions in the absence of GPS. The Black Hornet 4 can be used to rapidly detect targets outside of line of sight and assess fire damage results in real time. -Black Hornet 4 takes the features and capabilities that made the Black Hornet 3 world-renowned to the next level,- said Jifen Lei, executive vice president and general manager of Teledyne FLIR Defense. In total, FLIR Defense delivered more than 20,000 various modifications of Black Hornet PRS to military and security services in more than 40 countries of the world. The Black Hornet 4 is designed and manufactured by Teledyne FLIR Defense in Norway. -We have worked closely with customers and end users to make this system even more valuable to reservists who need situational awareness or are involved in covert operations where accurate and operational information is critical. Black Hornet 4 is a promising nano-drone technology,- Lei added. It is also emphasized that the basis for artificial intelligence systems has been laid in the drone - thanks to this, the drone can be improved so that it is even easier for the military to operate it on the battlefield.

-5 FPVs fell, none hit the -beha--. How does the EW-laboratory of the DSHV work near the front line	Actually, this industry is developing very quickly, and the 77th separate airmobile Naddnipryan brigade even managed to create its own EW laboratory near the front - in order to quickly produce and repair equipment for its fighters on the front line. Correspondent ArmyInform visited such a secret laboratory and asked paratroopers about what electronic devices can be made in such difficult conditions, where to get spare parts and how to keep up with know-how on the battlefield. Roman, a soldier of the 77th OAeMBr, conducts a tour of the laboratory. He emphasizes that almost all tools here are made from scratch, cases and other things are printed, and elements and spare parts are ordered from online stores. - We even bend the antennas ourselves. Here we manufacture cases on which modules and power supplies are mounted. We develop 3D models ourselves. That is, the module from scratch to the finished product is ours, he says in the room with 3D printers. Next, we get to the room where the guys solder everything. Here they mainly work with antennas. The next room is where the resource gathering takes place. This laboratory collects and repairs EW from drops and FPVs, as well as trench EW. 3D printers work 24 hours a day, says a fighter with the nickname -Fitter-. His task, in addition to bending and soldering antennas, is to monitor printing. Every day at two o'clock in the morning, he must come and replace the consumables, check whether the temperature regime in the printing house is maintained. A fighter with the call sign -Zirka- says that in the laboratory the guys not only manufacture, but also test the means: - We then carry them to the position on our shoulders. There we already receive a command when to turn on and in which direction. Sometimes you have to watch, let your drone pass. Military serviceman Serhii, who was an electrician in civilian life, adds that this laboratory has established feedback with his colleagues in the brigade - they praise the tools for their efficiency. — There was feedback, the guys called the commander, they said that the REB was awesome - there were five FPVs, they fell, all from the side, none of them hit the -beha- - that's good feedback, - recalls Roman. One of the most interesting developments of 77 OAeMBr are backpacks for assault groups. Backpacks and containers are selected by the guys themselves, spare parts are printed and ordered online. There are also anti-drop and anti-FPV backpacks. With a battery, it can weigh somewhere between 5-6 kg. - He is taken with them to the position. It has a control panel, there you can see the battery charge. There is also a seven-meter-long cable inside - that is, you can pull out, install and remotely control the backpack device, Roman explains. Serhiy talks in more detail about the technical side of the developments. He says that a year ago it was possible to close questions on one range, and now it is necessary to do four, or even five. It can be seen from the equipment that drives here near the front line, there are no longer two, but three or four -checkers- on the roof, he adds, emphasizing that before a combat mission, all equipment is tested together with pilots at different frequencies. Serhii says that the proximity to the front is connected with the need to promptly respond to the requests of fellow soldiers: - It happens that the guys at the front have a broken electronic device. Accordingly, it is delivered to us promptly, and we repair it in a day. And if it was a private manufacturer, which usually has production somewhere in the rear, then one can only guess how long it would take to repair or service the equipment. The financial aspect is also important, Serhii explains, because in the laboratory the guys can make a tool for 100 thousand hryvnias, the analogue of which on the market will cost 350-400 thousand. The fighter notes that both we and the enemy are very dependent on details from China. Although there are rumors that all these spare parts can be made here, but it will be many times more expensive. Now the guys use only Ukrainian aluminum radiators and plastic for 3D printing. The boys say that they have been fighting here for the second year. We immediately ask how to get to them. Serhii says that almost everyone here expressed their desire to serve. And everyone has the basic skills to work with EW. — In civilian life, I had an education in the field of radio engineering. They looked at the military ID and sent it here. People who understand what radio engineering is, know how to solder at least, - he explains. Serhiy also recommends going to the REB to those who know physics; understands what waves are, what they are. Motivation and a willingness to constantly learn are also important, because the approaches that were relevant a year ago may no longer work today. The -Zirka- fighter says that in civilian life he worked as a machinist at the Southern Mining and Processing Plant in Kryvyi Rih. At first I had protection against mobilization, but when it ended, I went to the TCC without hesitation. We talked about the fact that, in the eyes of civilian DSHVs, these are primarily assault units, and here we see a laboratory where the guys only do soldering, assembly and repair. First, you need to understand that different specialties are needed in the army. And secondly, the guys from the laboratory have either returned from combat missions after being wounded, or are carrying EW on their own. -Zirka- remembers how he received the task to go to the positions and help his comrades with the REB. But after he and his group went there, the Russians went on the offensive, and mines and drones began to fly at the boys. — There were four of us, we had machine guns, grenades and -flies- with us. there were five Russians, one was with the -baker-. They entered the landing stage, there was contact, we shot one of them three times, - says the fighter. Then the DSHV mortar connected, then the Russians were chased away. But towards the end, they sent a drone with a drop that landed right next to the boys' dugout. Then -Zirka- suffered a concussion. It took two days to leave, and the boys left another day later. - This is to understand that the REB platoon are the same fighters as all other paratroopers, and you should always be ready to take on a fight. Everyone who was injured there has already been treated, with the boys in contact, he adds. In parting, the 34-year-old soldier adds that his values ​​in life have changed significantly during his service: he began to appreciate the time he spends with his family, especially with his son, much more. — I appreciate every phone conversation, message. Even between the lines you can read how they care about me, are proud. They also have their own problems, so I call, reassure and say that everything is fine, everything will be fine, this is life. And no matter what, it continues. Under any circumstances, he summarizes.

-When buying one shoe, a 50% discount-: the enemy invented a fake about veterans of the war in Ukrai...	This is supposedly a promotional offer in one of the Ukrainian clothing stores. The first thing that comes to mind is that it was necessary to come up with such a thing! In the head of a healthy person, such a cynical and mocking idea - to offer a person who has lost a limb, a discount on one shoe - simply cannot be born. Only the -Russian measure- is capable of so deforming the consciousness of homo sapiens to produce such content. The primary source of the spread of this fake is the video of the Russian propagandist Armen Gasparian. The ad itself is a screenshot from it. The video shows that information about the promotion is posted in the fitting room. However, neither the sign nor the frame shows the name of this store, despite the fact that the name of the store is usually duplicated on the promotion announcement. In addition, fakers used the word -disabled- in the ad, although the correct word would be -person with disabilities.- This is a traditional problem with education and tolerance for them. Most likely, the Russians themselves printed such an ad in order to shoot this video and pass it off as a real promotion in a supposedly Ukrainian store. The purpose of this fake is to sow discord in Ukrainian society by openly mocking veterans. In fact, the level of respect for the military and war veterans on the part of society is extremely high. That is why such fakes cause hatred only for Russians.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/03/pry-kupivli-odnogo-cherevyka-znyzhka-50-vorog-vygadav-fejk-pro-veteraniv-vijny-v-ukrayini/	2024-12-02T20:12:19-08:00

Soft diplomacy: the National Presidential Orchestra presented the project -Symphony Rock Resonance-	—⁠The National Presidential Orchestra is a world-renowned professional ensemble that is loved and respected in the music community. How are you greeted abroad today, during the great war? — Our creative, professional activity consists in the preservation and development of national cultural traditions, the promotion of the heritage of world musical culture, and the disclosure of Ukraine's cultural identity on the international arena. We are an integral part of the presentation, image, cultural and diplomatic symbols of the state and the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Therefore, during performances both in Ukraine and abroad, we are, first of all, carriers of our cultural and intellectual identity, we are cultural ambassadors who speak in the language of art. Any audience can sense sincerity very well, and when you are sincere in your work, you will receive a warm welcome. And we are sincere in our creativity. —In response to Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine, in 2022 your team initiated the -Fight for Ukraine- art project, which had great success and a powerful symbolic meaning. How is the repertoire selected today? - We have an unlimited genre and stylistic spectrum of different music. We have the potential to perform diametrically opposed concert programs. So, performing academic music today, tomorrow, or even in parallel and at the same time, we are preparing for the performance of modern popular compositions with a different composition. Of course, this is a great physical and psychological burden on orchestra artists, but our team can handle it. Selection of the repertoire is a complex, intellectual, creative process. It is difficult for people who are not immersed in our artistic world to understand all the complexity of creating a concert program, all that is connected with the performance, combination, dramatic arrangement of this or that piece of music in a concert. It's funny when some people think that we just take some music, put a sequence number next to each piece - and that's it! But in fact it is psychology, history, and emotion. Sometimes, while performing music, we only hint, without speaking directly, and the listener already discovers the path for himself, and sometimes we take the listener by the hand and lead him along the path of music, showing this path. That's why we always analyze what we've done, where and for which audience. And it's actually always very responsible, a kind of daily test, because music is the universe, it's a powerful tool that has an incredible ability to revive, heal, and sometimes vice versa. The war brought suffering and grief to our country and to every family. Does it affect the repertoire? Undeniably. But what is more important is not whether the war affected the repertoire itself, it is important how we all perceive, rethink, reevaluate, relive the sound of certain musical works. —​​Military servicemen who attended -Symphony Rock Resonance- were sincerely delighted with what they saw and heard. How do you help the Armed Forces of Ukraine? - The National Presidential Orchestra functions within the structure of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. So, in the very essence, our activity takes place in the interests of the IOU and the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces. And, as is well known, in any field, and in the field of intellectual work and leisure, the balance between the direct and indirect form of beneficial effect of certain activities and the achievement of results is critically important. It's like an asterisk challenge&#8230; Our creativity is soft diplomacy, effectively used by our partners. It is taking into account modern trends and the experience of foreign partners that we build our philosophy of activity. In fact, I see so many people everywhere who loudly and loudly measure who helps the Armed Forces, and who is more, and who is better&#8230; We are working. The best help is to join the Defense Forces of Ukraine, and everything else is work, tacit homework, which everyone should do as professionally, qualitatively and efficiently as possible, well, and without too much PR.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/02/dyplomatiya-m%ca%bcyakoyi-diyi-naczionalnyj-prezydentskyj-orkestr-prezentuvav-proyekt-symphony-rock-resonance/	2024-12-02T01:35:45-08:00

The leaders of structural divisions of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, commanders of types and branches of troops (forces), commanders of separate combat military units, heads of training centers and VVNIs were involved in the meeting. At the meeting, they discussed the preliminary results of the implementation from November 1 of the current year in all educational centers of the new BZVP Program with a training period of 1.5 months. For the objectivity of the evaluation of the innovations, interviews were held with cadets and instructors, who noted only positive aspects in the increase in training terms and changes in the basic military training program. -Defined tasks for further monitoring of the effectiveness of implemented changes. Already in December, the first graduates of the one-and-a-half-month training period will go to combat military units. Therefore, we are waiting for feedback about the graduates from unit commanders and proposals for the further increase of basic combined military training,- said the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Oleksandr Syrskyi added that the training of officers of the tactical unit, the content of which currently needs improvement, including an increase in the training period, was not overlooked. Such proposals were expressed by the heads of higher military educational institutions. Commanders of combat brigades also emphasized the need to improve officer training. The participants of the meeting proposed the deployment of advanced training courses for the training of staff officers in separate areas of activity. -Each commander must be responsible for the quality of the training of the staff, therefore, during their training, the principle -the commander trains with his subordinates- must be used,- said the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Training is the basis of the activities of troops (forces) both in peacetime and in wartime, the activities of all commanders should be aimed at constantly improving the knowledge, skills and abilities of servicemen, their stability during combat missions. -Combat results directly depend on the quality of training of soldiers. I am grateful to the commanders of all levels, who take maximum responsibility for the training of personnel. In particular, the best practices used for training at the level of combat brigades should be extended to all Defense Forces of Ukraine,- concluded Oleksandr Syrskyi.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/02/pokrashhennya-yakosti-bzvp-i-zbilshennya-terminiv-navchannya-oficzeriv-golovnokomanduvach-zsu-proviv-naradu/	2024-12-02T00:02:30-08:00
Inflated prices and fraudulent schemes: what the enemy invents to demotivate the Ukrainian military	However, Russian propaganda would like everything to be exactly the opposite. That is why in the pro-Russian segment of the networks from time to time they spread information about inflated prices for the military, or about additional taxes, or generally about fraudulent schemes. Yes, the other day, enemy scoundrels spread information that one of the Ukrainian cafes allegedly has a menu with different prices for civilians and military. These menus are allegedly labeled -standard- and -military- respectively, with similar dishes and inflated prices for the latter category. Propagandists add a corresponding photo as -proof- of this. Usually, similar cases of discrimination by the Ukrainian military gain publicity in the media and social networks. However, no Ukrainian publications reported on this incident, the -news- is spread only by Russian propaganda resources. Neither the name of the establishment, which allegedly has a similar menu, nor its address is also known. Most likely, this is just an edited photo or a production. Previously, Russian propagandists distributed a fake photo - an announcement that a 20% tax for TCC employees was in effect in one of the Ukrainian grocery stores. And they also tried to cheat the military for money, offering them an alleged 30% discount for a driver's license without passing exams. With such fakes, Russian propagandists are trying to demotivate the Ukrainian military, disrupt mobilization in Ukraine and sow discord in Ukrainian society.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/02/zavyshheni-cziny-ta-shahrajski-shemy-shho-vygaduye-vorog-aby-demotyvuvaty-ukrayinskyh-vijskovyh/	2024-12-01T23:57:58-08:00

As reported by ArmyInform, in Kurshchyna the enemy throws into battle a large number of light transport to bring his stormtroopers closer to our positions.

There will be no total immersion in darkness: an expert on mass air strikes of the Russian Federatio...	Military expert Petro Chernyk told why there have been more mass attacks and what to expect in our country in winter: -Such a number of Shaheds: is it a lot or a little (November 28 of this year - ed.)? In fact, it is very, very much. That is, the Russians managed to raise the level of their composition. But not production. The only thing they produce is the body itself. Two-stroke petrol engine is either Iranian or Chinese. Microelectronics - from other countries. But there is a nuance. Despite the fact that these are really very high figures (the number of launched enemy UAVs - ed.), the rate of shooting down or location deviation is in the range of 90 to 98%, and sometimes 100%. This is a very serious indicator of the performance of our air defenses. Regarding indicators of locational deviation. This means that we already have such a level of radio-electronic warfare that allows -shaheda- not just to plant, but even to deploy back to Russia and Belarus. Will the Russians continue this work? One hundred percent, will not stop. But there is also an important point here: because there are again huge fears that, say, 200 Kh-101 missiles Russia has made. And it is supposedly something incredibly huge. Let me remind you that the largest volley they launched in August was 127 rockets simultaneously. And they still haven't repeated it. And they produce no more than 150-170 rockets per month. Do they have the task of destroying our energy infrastructure? THERE ARE. But again, we are a big country in terms of electricity generation, specifically in the nuclear aspect. And our network has been closed to the European network for at least two years. Despite the fact that there will be difficulties with turning off the light, I am 100% sure that there will be no total immersion in darkness. And our air defense forces will continue to demonstrate such high performance.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/02/absolyutnogo-zanurennya-u-pitmu-ne-bude-ekspert-pro-masovani-povitryani-udary-rf/	2024-12-01T21:04:48-08:00

There were no significant changes in the situation in other directions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/02/syly-oborony-vidbyly-15-atak-na-kurshhyni-vorog-aktyvizuvavsya-na-vremivskomu-napryamku/	2024-12-01T20:58:04-08:00
A new batch of aerial scouts for the Armed Forces: Germany included UAVs, which Luke Skywalker raise...	As the official portal of the German government informs, these UAVs were included in the November tranche of military support of our country, reported ArmyInform. It should be noted that the RQ-35 Heidrun aerial reconnaissance aircraft have been well known in the Defense Forces of Ukraine for many years. In particular, as told ArmyInform, back in December 2022, the legendary American actor, known for the role of the Jedi Luke Skywalker from the epic film -Star Wars- and United24 ambassador Mark Hamill, was going to donate exactly 10 powerful RQ-35 Heidrun reconnaissance drones for the Armed Forces. Manufactured by the Danish company Sky-Watch, these UAVs offer advanced capabilities for reconnaissance, surveillance and reconnaissance ( ISR). In addition, Sky-Watch engineers subsequently incorporated technical improvements into the UAV based on operational experience in Ukraine, increasing their resistance to radio-electronic warfare and the ability to navigate in airspace where there is no GNSS. The RQ-35 Heidrun is a fixed-wing mini-unmanned aerial system (UAS) designed primarily for video surveillance and low-altitude reconnaissance. The drone is equipped with a three-lens camera system, including visible and thermal imaging capabilities. Heidrun can transmit real-time video over 30km away, providing live situational awareness. This allows intelligence to be obtained without endangering the operator. This UAV has a flight time of up to 100 minutes, maximum wind resistance of 12 meters per second, and a maximum altitude of 5,200 meters above sea level. The camera payload platform features stabilized gimbals that offer 20x to 40x optical zoom and additional digital zoom options. In addition, radio frequency transmission operating in the 2.2 to 2.5 GHz range ensures secure data transmission. The fixed-wing RQ-35 Heidrun is hand-launched and rapidly collects data on enemy positions. This is extremely important when operating a UAV in the field. The compact ground station has an IP68 enclosure rating and universal mounting for a short- or long-range antenna. The short-range patch antenna allows you to communicate with the UAV at a distance of up to 25 km. For communication at a distance of more than 30 km (beyond direct line of sight), a long-range patch antenna is used, which constantly tracks the UAV. The RQ-35 Heidrun UAV platform has a multi-purpose design that allows for different payload options. RQ-35 Heidrun is supplied by the manufacturer in a set with a tablet for manual control and special software. Sky Watch claims that it is able to function properly in conditions of suppression of satellite navigation with the help of EW tools. This unmanned system was also delivered to Poland. In the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, this drone was designed to fill the gap between small (micro) quadcopters and conventional fixed-wing mini-class UAVs. Specifications: Heidrun Drones.

How the F-16 -learned- to shoot down the Shaheds: the cost of the question and what remains the most...	ArmiyaInform tells about the limitations and difficulties that the military managed to overcome and has to overcome, as well as about one of the test episodes, during which the task of the F-16 was to destroy a UAV imitating a cruise missile. F-16C fighter launches an APKWS missile at a small maneuverable air target flying at low altitude (December 19, 2019) / source: U.S. The Air Force's cruise missiles have been in service since the 1970s, but for a long time the only country that used them on the battlefield was the United States of America. This created a false impression of the absolute dominance of the US and other NATO countries in this area of ​​armaments. The situation changed in 2017, when the Russian Federation launched cruise missile strikes on targets in Syria. Soon, in 2019, Iran struck Saudi Arabia with kamikaze drones and cruise missiles. This made the military countries of NATO to worry about the possibility of using such weapons also against Western countries and to be more actively engaged in the development and testing of air defense equipment capable of countering enemy cruise missiles and UAVs. Among other things, attention was also paid to the possibility of shooting down small air targets with the help of fighters, including the F-16 Fighting Falcon. An important advantage of using aircraft as air defense means is high mobility, so they were considered as an important addition to other means of air defense. The obvious solution to the task is the use of air-to-air guided missiles by fighters. However, the expected problem was the ratio of the cost of the missile used to shoot down the enemy's ammunition with the price of the cruise missile itself or the enemy's unmanned aerial vehicle. For example, the AIM-120 AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) all-weather guided missile of the air-to-air class costs more than one million dollars. On the other hand, a kamikaze drone to shoot down can cost only a few tens of thousands of dollars. In view of this, one of the main problems that gunsmiths had to deal with was the creation of an effective and at the same time cheap means of defeat. It was possible to solve it thanks to the use against air targets of the modernized Hydra-70 missile - a 70-mm unguided air missile adopted for armament in the distant 1948. At the beginning of 2010, BAE Systems created the APKWS (Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System) guided missile based on the unguided Hydra, a high-precision air munition with a laser targeting system. The modernization was carried out by installing between the warhead and the rocket engine the WGU-59/B module with laser sensors and rotary vanes, which allow precise guidance on the target. The creation of a high-precision APKWS missile based on the Hydra-70 allowed the US Army to close the need for an inexpensive compact munition that would occupy an intermediate position between unguided aircraft missiles and high-precision missiles of a larger caliber, which would be irrational to use against small, cheap targets. The US Marine Corps is modernizing the Hydra-70, creating APKWS II based on it, and installing missiles on the launcher of the Bell AH-1Z Viper attack helicopter In 2012, APKWS was adopted by the US Navy, upgrading the existing Hydra missiles -70. Since 2014, serial production of the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System has begun and they have reached other structures of the armed forces of the United States of America. First of all, APKWS entered the armament of the MH-60R Seahawk and MH-60S Knighthawk helicopters. Later, they were also installed on the AV-8B Harrier II vertical takeoff and landing attack aircraft of the US Air Force. In 2016, the U.S. Air Force purchased APKWS missiles for use in ongoing operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, where they were used in combat operations from A-10 Thunderbolt II and F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft. This was the first example of the use of APKWS in combat operations from fixed-wing aerial platforms, as previously they had been used exclusively from Apache attack helicopters. Opponents of the US army in Iraq and Afghanistan did not have combat manned aircraft, unmanned aerial systems and cruise missiles. So, dominating the air space, the US Air Force used APKWS missiles exclusively to strike ground targets. The use of cruise missiles and kamikaze drones by Russia and Iran has prompted the US military to consider using APKWS to also shoot down these small, maneuverable low-altitude air targets. There are several arguments in favor of such a solution - APKWS are not only effective, but also cheap, compact, versatile and easy to use. They do not need to capture the target before launch - the ammunition is guided by a laser guidance system that is activated during launch. Thanks to the new contactless detonator, a direct hit on the target was unnecessary - it was destroyed by an explosive wave and fragments. The cost of one missile is about 25 thousand dollars, which is not only significantly cheaper than the cost of a cruise missile, but also quite commensurate with the cost of most long-range UAVs. For example, it is about half the price of Iran's Shahed kamikaze drone. The versatility of the APKWS lies in its ability to be used as an air-to-surface, air-to-air, surface-to-air and even surface-to-surface missile thanks to the installation of launchers on various types of air, ground and surface platforms. The Hydra-70 missile launcher for air platforms contains 19 munitions and weighs 225 kg. In view of this, most helicopters and airplanes can carry 2-4 such launchers. Specifically, the F-16 can simultaneously carry 4 LAU-61/LAU-68 missile pods, each containing 19 Hydra missiles or 7 APKWS missiles, respectively. Ground platforms like a missile system VAMPIRE by L3Harris in general practically not limited to the number of missiles, as it depends only on the size of the body of the vehicle where they will be loaded. The only limitation is the availability of roads, the ability to move freely along them, and the maximum possible speed of the car in real conditions. Overcoming these land transport limitations allows the installation of APKWS missile launchers on high-speed air platforms such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon multirole fighters. About the successful shooting down of a small-sized aircraft at low altitude by an APKWS missile launched from the F-16 during tests on December 19, 2019 reports Air &amp; Space Forces Magazine. Then, a test pilot of the 85th Flight Test Squadron of the US Air Force, Major Jeffrey Entine, shot down a small drone that imitated a cruise missile over the Gulf of Mexico during a training exercise at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. APKWS was guided to the target by the aircraft's on-board targeting platform. The exercises proved that the F-16 can relatively easily shoot down small air targets, such as enemy UAVs or cruise missiles flying at low altitudes, with low-cost weapons — APKWS guided air missiles based on upgraded Hydra-70 unguided air missiles. As the US Air Force reported at the time, the use of APKWS to protect against cruise missiles and UAVs is a promising step, as the cheap high-precision munition allows to achieve the same successful result as the much more expensive AIM-120 AMRAAM missile. However, there is also a difficult part of the task - it consists in detecting an enemy small-sized air target flying along a complex trajectory. It is possible to cope with it thanks to the complex cooperation of all forces and means of air defense.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/02/yak-f-16-navchyvsya-zbyvaty-shahedy-czina-pytannya-ta-shho-lyshayetsya-najskladnishym/	2024-12-01T20:34:07-08:00
Harry Potter and the -Rabbit's Ear-: How to Spot Landmines and Avoid Moles at Interflex UK	The correspondent of ArmiyaInform tells about how the Ukrainian military is trained to detect mines and other explosive objects during the BZVP within the borders of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. We practice the disposal of explosive objects dozens of times. The first and most important thing to learn is to detect mines of different purpose, method of activation, detonation mechanism and type of damage, as well as improvised explosive devices, stretchers using grenades and unexploded ammunition. The lion's share of classes are devoted to the detection of explosive objects and their subsequent actions. We are infantry, so demining or demining by detonation in place is not our first priority - that should be done by specially trained detonators. The algorithm of our actions is reduced to a few simple steps that can be reliably remembered by the rule of five -Ps-: Marking a mine and informing about its presence can be done in different ways at the same time or in different sequences depending on specific circumstances. However, both actions must be performed in one way or another, because this is the only way to protect those who can potentially activate an explosive object to action or find themselves in the affected area. The most difficult, of course, is the first point - to detect a mine that is specially made, installed and camouflaged in such a way that it is as difficult as possible to notice. Therefore, this is what we work on the most, for the longest time, under different conditions and in different ways. We need to be able to detect mines under any conditions - in the twilight or even complete darkness, in the rain and in the fog, in the forest thicket, among the grass and leaves, or in the dirt and among the debris of construction debris on a city street or in a building. This can be learned through knowledge of a number of basic principles and long-term practice, which trains the eye to notice the slightest signs of the presence of an explosive object. So it is not surprising that this is what we have been doing for the longest time and in different ways. Physically, the most difficult thing is to detect underground and well-disguised mines with the help of a minesweeper kit. This should be done crawling in full protective gear, with legs crossed and constantly feeling the ground in front of you. It is necessary to wield a sapper's probe like a conductor's wand of a wizard from the Harry Potter books - strongly and confidently, but at the same time gently and gracefully, holding the probe with a bunch of fingers and pressing only with the wrist. It is extremely difficult to cover even a small distance in this way, some 3‒4 meters on grass completely wet from several days of rain. Already after the first few dozen dives, the probe starts to hurt my wrist mercilessly, the helmet becomes heavy as a bell, and the bulletproof vest sticks into the Georgian soil. The only thing in my head is the Avada Kedavra spell. It is directed not so much against the mine, which the instructors disguised under the turf, as against numerous fragments of flint. There are a lot of these stones here, so every 3-4 dives the probe gets stuck in them, confusing and giving false hope that it is a mine. It is possible to detect a mine as far as the beginning of the third meter of the site. From under the probe, instead of the usual ticking or a light grinding against the flint, a dull blow to the hollow plastic can be heard. -Mina, finally definitely Mina!-, I think and crawl back. Now it should be marked and reported to the instructor about the completion of the task. Before doing this, I cheat a little and rest for a few minutes, kneading my wrists. Only then do I raise my voice and raise my hand. After listening to the comments, I move to one of the neighboring areas - and so three times in a row during one class. However, the result seems good to me only until I find out that during the time I detected three mines, some managed to detect 5-6. -I need to work faster,- I think, and I remember the spell from Harry Potter again. -And instead of -Avada Kedavra- you should use -Accio- - I know that I'm looking for a mine.- Such jokes with yourself allow you to relax a little and rest before the next class. Fortunately, it is much less physically demanding and requires observation rather than action and effort. We examine a large square, 20 by 20 meters, in order to detect at a great distance a place where a careless enemy may have planted a mine. Traces of human movement and presence are immediately visible. It is produced by crumpled grass and broken plants, shifted soil, abandoned garbage, elements transferred from another area, symmetries that do not belong to the natural area, changes in color, and many other things. There was definitely a person here relatively recently, which means there may be a dangerous surprise. Then we practice these same skills many times in pairs, moving along forest routes, on each of which the instructors have set several mines. However, in the forest, we are quite often misled by moles who managed to work in the middle of the trails after the instructors. Freshly excavated earth is not a sign of a recently laid mine, but traces of the life of forest animals. -Look for a combination of at least two signs of a possible mine, because one is not enough,- the instructors explain. And in most cases, we all complete the task successfully. The most difficult thing is to detect stretch marks - a barely noticeable fishing line crosses the path at different heights, and we can't always notice it in time. Often, of course, the play of light and water droplets helps, and sometimes a light web, which the spider has already managed to attach to the stretch, but it is not always so lucky. In the end, at one of the classes, the instructors reveal to us another interesting way to detect a stretched fishing line - with the help of a -rabbit ear-. This is a simple tool that can be made from things at hand, such as wire and light cloth. To do this, an oblong wire similar in shape to a real rabbit's ear or a similar base should be wrapped with white fabric, film or tape. The technology of using this product is as simple as the product itself. Having put the -rabbit ear- in front of you, it should be slowly raised from the ground level to the highest point above your head, describing a semicircle in the air. On its white background, it will be easy to see the thinnest stretch line. The main thing is not to rush, not to miss any section, not to step forward and to raise the tool from the lowest level above the ground as high as possible, because the fishing line can be pulled at any height.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/02/garri-potter-ta-krolyache-vuho-yak-vyyavyty-miny-j-unyknuty-krotiv-na-interflex-u-brytaniyi/	2024-12-01T20:23:42-08:00

It can be armored: APC, BRDM plus a tank for cover. But they also use a lot of light vehicles such as ATVs and motorcycles to quickly reach our positions and land infantry. They can go further, or they can simply leave the equipment, they don't count on it,- said Solomon. According to him, our marines are trying to respond to the attack aircraft as soon as possible. -When we spot this column, our artillery and FPV drones start working on it. When they approach, then the Maviks with resets are turned on, which fly no more than 4 kilometers. We work, then conduct preliminary reconnaissance and strike the survivors, if there are any,- said Solomon. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the soldiers of the 36th Marine Brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinsky, together with the soldiers of the 73rd Battalion of the Territorial Defense Forces repelled the assault of superior numbers Russian elite units in the Kursk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/ne-berezhut-ani-lyudej-ani-tehniku-na-kurshhyni-rosiyan-ne-zupynyayut-zhodni-vtraty/	2024-12-01T10:57:51-08:00

Operational information as of 16.00 on December 1 was published by the General Staff of the Armed Forces . The border regions of Chernihiv and Sumy regions continue to suffer from Russian artillery shelling. Today, a number of settlements were affected, including Novovasylivka, Bleshnya, Gremyachka, Bachivsk, Leonivka, and Karpovychi. In the Kharkiv direction, the Defense Forces repelled six assaults by enemy troops near Staritsa, Tykhi, and Vovchansk, one battle is ongoing. In the Kupyansk direction, the enemy tried to advance to our positions six times during the day in the areas of Lozova, Kruglyakivka, and Zeleny Gayu. Two skirmishes continue. The aggressor also increased the number of attacks to six in the Lyman direction. Attacked in the vicinity of Druzhelyubivka, Grekivka, Hryhorivka, Terni and Torskyi. Two skirmishes are currently ongoing. In the Kramatorsk direction, our defenders repelled one attack by the occupiers in the area of ​​Chasovoy Yar. In the direction of Toretsk, the enemy tried to advance five times in the area of ​​Toretsk and in the direction of Shcherbinivka. The battle is currently underway. Enemy activity continues in the Pokrovsky direction. Clashes of varying intensity have started here 22 times today. Enemy attacks were repulsed in Myrolyubivka, Promenya, Lysivka, Dachenskyi, Zhovtoi and Chumatskyi districts. Five clashes are still ongoing. Fierce fighting continues in the Kurakhiv direction. In the vicinity of Berestki, Sontsivka, Zori, Novodmytrivka, Kurakhovo, Dalnyi, Elizavetivka and Hannivka, 33 combat clashes took place during the day, 14 attacks by the occupiers are ongoing. In the Vremivsk direction, the aggressor attacked the positions of our defenders 19 times in the area of ​​Kostiantynopolskyi, Trudovoy, Velika Novosilka, Novosilka, Novy Komar and Novodarivka, nine clashes are ongoing. In Kurshchyna, Ukrainian defenders repulsed six attacks by the invaders, a total of 12 skirmishes took place in the direction today. There were no significant changes in the situation in the rest of the directions. Ukrainian troops are exhausting the enemy along the entire line of battle and in the rear. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Kurakhiv and Pokrovsky directions of the Defense Forces repelled more than a hundred Russian assaults.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/genshtab-zsu-nazvav-napryamky-na-yakyh-vorog-zoseredzhuye-zusyllya/	2024-12-01T07:39:32-08:00
The number of enemy drones on optical fiber has increased in Kurshchyna	About this on the Army TV stream the chief sergeant of the platoon of the 36th marine brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinsky with the call sign Solomon . -Often, they send a drone along the route to be on duty, and if they don't find our target, they direct the drone straight towards our positions. The Russians don't count on losses at all,- Solomon noted. According to him, although fiber-optic drones have a shorter range than conventional drones, they are insensitive to the effects of ERB, and therefore can operate where conventional drones lose contact with the operator. Solomon also talked about what drones are used for different tasks. -In my opinion, FPV drones are more useful for destroying equipment, as well as manpower, -maviks- are used for more static purposes, because it is not easy to hit infantry with a grenade. Accordingly, equipment can also be hit by drops, there is cumulative ammunition, but it should be more static equipment: damaged, abandoned,- said Solomon. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the soldiers of the 36th Marine Brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinsky, together with the soldiers of the 73rd Battalion of the Territorial Defense Forces repelled the assault of superior numbers Russian elite units in the Kursk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/na-kurshhyni-zbilshylasya-kilkist-vorozhyh-droniv-na-optovolokni/	2024-12-01T07:32:38-08:00
Oh, whose tank is on fire - the marine drones burned the Russian armor	The video of the burning was published on December 1 on the brigade's channel. Marine aerial scouts spotted a Russian tank. As it turned out, his crew ran away and also hospitably forgot to close the hatches. The marines could not pass by such a gift and sent an FPV drone to the place. Because enemy equipment has chambers. Our kamikaze drone hit the hatch directly, a few seconds delay - and thick smoke fell from the tank. The marines did not stop there and made a -control- drop from the bomber. -In the end, minus an enemy tank that will no longer shoot at our soldiers,- the brigade commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, the fighters of the 35th brigade of marines named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Ostrogradsky was first wounded, and then took it away T-72 tank of the Russian occupation forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/oj-chyj-to-tank-goryt-dronari-morpihy-spalyly-rosijsku-bronyu/	2024-12-01T07:10:13-08:00

Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesman for the volunteer Ukrainian army -South-, said this on the ArmyTV stream. -Velika Novosilka, although a settlement of the Donetsk region, is located on the border of the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhia regions, and there is a lot of information support from our enemy here. The enemy is spreading the idea that the offensive on Velika Novosilka is not about Kurakhov and Donetsk region in general, but about the Dnipropetrovsk region. Even more about the city of Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia. The information efforts made by the enemy are very powerful,- said Serhii Bratchuk. According to him, the situation in the area of ​​Velika Novosilka has worsened, our command is taking certain measures in order to stabilize the situation as much as possible, because the enemy has tactical advances. -We understand that Velika Novosilka is a continuation of the events taking place in the Kurakhivsko-Pokrov region. This is a logistics hub that also helps our Kurakhiv garrison,- Serhiy Bratchuk explained. He assured that the Russians currently do not have the strength for a large-scale offensive on the Dnipro and Zaporozhye, no matter what the enemy propagandists say. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Defense Forces of Ukraine commented on rumors that the enemy is probably preparing a large-scale massive offensive on the city of Zaporizhzhia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/vorog-maye-taktychni-prosuvannya-bilya-velykoyi-novosilky-j-lyakaye-velykym-nastupom-na-dnipro-ta-zaporizhzhya/	2024-12-01T06:48:27-08:00
Mines, skids, FPV — footage of the exemplary destruction of the assault column of the Russians appea...	The video was released on December 1 on the -Khartiia- channel. Our aerial reconnaissance spotted a convoy of 3 enemy BMPs, which, together with the landing party, went to our positions. But mines were laid on the path of the assault column, so all 3 BMPs, one by one, were immobilized. Bombers and FPV drones immediately flew to them, finishing off the equipment so that it caught fire brightly. Then the training for the landing party, which hid in the forest strip, began. They have been working on them for a long time. When the Russians lost their nerve and tried to escape, our FPV drones finished them off in an open area. According to -Charter- data, the loss of the enemy amounted to 45 fighters (of which 29 were killed) and 3 BMP. As reported by ArmyInform, the -Charter- brigade said that in the north of Kharkiv Oblast, most of the airspace controlled by Ukrainian drone operators that destroy the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/miny-skydy-fpv-zyavylysya-kadry-zrazkovogo-znyshhennya-shturmovoyi-kolony-rosiyan/	2024-12-01T06:31:08-08:00

Bohdan Petrenko, the head of the communications department of the 48th separate artillery brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told about this on the air of the telethon on December 1. -This is happening, in particular, by surrounding Novosilka. The enemy is also using artillery, aviation, unmanned systems,- said Bohdan Petrenko. According to OSINT maps, the enemy is trying to attack from the east from Rozdilny and from the south, from Staromayorsky. The presenter asked on which of these vectors the enemy pressure is stronger. -What is happening from the east, the advance is greater and the enemy there is making much more effort today. The enemy is trying to develop an offensive in the direction. Now both the artillerymen of the brigade and the adjacent units are working to stop the enemy and prevent his further advance. What you see now on the battle maps, what is in the open maps, what is marked in red, is in fact the Russians advancing on their blood. Because in fact there is a battle for every landing, for every street, and in fact in every battle the enemy loses his strength,- Bohdan Petrenko explained. As ArmyInform wrote, in zone of responsibility 5 of a separate assault brigade in the area of ​​combat missions the enemy arranges frequent assaults , but taking into account the time of day. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/okupanty-namagayutsya-otochyty-velyku-novosilku-v-zsu-rozpovily-pro-diyi-voroga/	2024-12-01T06:06:58-08:00
An ideal meeting - enemy attack aircraft gathered for an attack, and here came the -Vampire-	The video of the defeat was published on December 1 on the brigade's channel. Aerial reconnaissance recorded the movement and accumulation of small enemy assault groups in the dugout, after which it transmitted information about it. The crew of -Baba Yaga-, as the enemy UAVs are called, flew to the spot and threw a gift to the Russians right in the -apple-. -We were so impressed that fiery cheers flew out of all their molehills.- To survive after such a bach is almost unreal. We destroy the invaders every day and night. they will not feel safe anywhere on our land!-, the mouth assured.

The Defense Forces explained how the intensity of enemy assaults depends on the weather	Such observations were shared on the telethon on December 1 by the commander of the fire support company of the 5th separate assault brigade, Mykola Zinko. -We have frequent assaults, as well as along the entire contact line, the enemy is probing our defenses, trying to find a weak point to then storm with greater forces. Mostly, it is a light time of day, or morning or evening grayness, when visibility is weaker, fog. Then small infantry groups try to find a gap in our defense somewhere. Much depends on the weather and visibility, and the enemy takes advantage of this. Well, we also enjoy such advantages,- Mykola Zinko told about the intensity of hostilities. When asked by the presenter whether we have parity in artillery, the military man answered in the affirmative. -There is a certain parity, the enemy has a little more artillery, but I can say that our artillery works better. On the other hand, in aviation, the enemy has an advantage and gives us a little trouble, in particular, with KABs, which they have enough of.- - summed up the interlocutor. As ArmiyaInform wrote, in the Pokrovsky direction the enemy continues to press in the area of ​​Zhovte and Lysivka settlements. The enemy grabs some linear object (a building in a settlement or a railroad) and tries to advance along it.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/u-sylah-oborony-poyasnyly-yak-intensyvnist-vorozhyh-shturmiv-zalezhyt-vid-pogody/	2024-12-01T05:28:42-08:00

Graceful red foxes, timid pheasants and powerful wild boars got into the lens - the real masters of the forest. -Despite the natural beauty, encounters with some animals can be a serious test for a person. Aggressive behavior of wild boars or the risk of contracting dangerous diseases from foxes are not the only threats. In view of this, we urge you to avoid walking in the border areas to reduce the risk of dangerous encounters with wild animals,- the DPSU urged. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or not to risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/tvaryny-zamist-tvaryuk-na-kordoni-u-videopastky-dlya-uhylyantiv-potrapyly-predstavnyky-pryrody/	2024-12-01T05:13:03-08:00
Ministry of Defense: in November, the Russian army suffered the largest losses since the beginning o...	About this notified the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. This number of casualties corresponds to the number of conditionally more than three motorized rifle divisions of the ground troops of the Russian Army. According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in November, during one day, our soldiers -two hundred- and -three hundred- killed 2,030 enemy soldiers. This is also the highest daily enemy loss rate since February 24, 2022. Also, during November, our soldiers hit 307 enemy tanks. This is the highest figure this fall (291 enemy tanks were destroyed or knocked out in September, 279 in October). There are 31 vehicles in the tank battalion of the Russian Federation, so in the last month of autumn 2024, the Kremlin army lost almost 10 tank battalions destroyed and knocked out. The estimated cost of this amount of equipment is equivalent to 450 million US dollars. As a result of the active combat work of the soldiers of the Defense Forces in November 2024, 899 enemy armored combat vehicles were damaged. Conventionally, this is the number of BBMs of almost four motorized rifle divisions. Such a number of armored combat vehicles cost the budget of the aggressor country approximately at least half a billion US dollars. Last month, Ukrainian soldiers also hit 884 units of enemy artillery. One artillery division of the occupying army has 18 self-propelled artillery installations. In this way, our soldiers deprived 49 artillery divisions of the opportunity to conduct combat operations the previous month. The cost of such a number of artillery installations is about 700 million dollars. If we talk about the total losses of the enemy in weapons and equipment in November 2024, then their estimated cost reaches more than 3 billion US dollars. In September and October, this number was lower. Therefore, the Kremlin continues to spend wildly on the continuation of the war.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/minoborony-u-lystopadi-rosijska-armiya-zaznala-najbilshyh-vtrat-vid-pochatku-shyrokomasshtabnogo-vtorgnennya/	2024-12-01T04:52:08-08:00
Assaults only under EW — in Kurshchyna, the enemy is making life difficult for our drones	About on the ArmyTV stream platoon sergeant of the 36th marine brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinsky with the call sign -Solomon-. -The adversary uses powerful EW means where hostilities are taking place. Unfortunately, they are head and shoulders above us in this regard. Assaults include these devices that suppress the frequencies of both FPV drones and Mavics. That's why it's very hard to work, you have to invent your own know-how in order to bypass the REB,- said Solomon. According to him, to avoid REB, you can use optics, which, unfortunately, are not yet represented in the Armed Forces. -Or install two antennas on Maviks, work from different points to bypass the suppression zone and conduct reconnaissance and impression of the enemy,- Solomon noted. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the soldiers of the 36th Marine Brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinsky, together with the soldiers of the 73rd Battalion of the Territorial Defense Forces repelled the assault of superior numbers Russian elite units in the Kursk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/shturmy-lyshe-pid-rebom-na-kurshhyni-vorog-uskladnyuye-zhyttya-nashym-dronaryam/	2024-12-01T04:42:11-08:00

According to her, among the personnel of the enemy there are also mobilized and recruited under a contract, but all are destroyed. An important role in this is played by drones from the battalion of unmanned attack aircraft systems, which find and destroy groups of Russian attack aircraft with drops. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 38th Marine Brigade recorded the strange behavior of a Russian who froze in the middle of the field like a scarecrow, or only to deceive our aerial scouts.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-odna-nasha-brygada-mozhe-protystoyaty-odrazu-chotyrom-rosijskym/	2024-12-01T03:59:18-08:00
The Defense Forces spoke about the difference between Russian marines and paratroopers in Kurshchyna	About this on the air of the telethon on December 1 told marines We can say that they live richly. They quite a lot use meat assaults, columns of armored vehicles, now the 155th has pulled back, is resting, then we are working with the Russian Airborne Forces. These guys are 100% poorer, because the assaults began on &#8220;rivers,&#8221;, ATVs, and motorcycles. Is this a tactic? It's hard for me to say. It seems more that this is the poverty and weakness of these units,- said -Enei-. When asked by the presenter about the level of training of the Russian marines, the soldier replied: -Standard. I will not say that these are elite troops. For the fact that they fire at our brothers, the enemy will be punished: both by God and by the sword of the Ukrainian marines.- href=-https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/29/vse-chudovo-myasni-shturmy-i-kolony-tehniky-nas-vlashtovuyut-na-kurshhyni-morpihy-peremololy-ochyen-gniluyu-brygadu /->commented that the basis of the tactics of the occupiers in Kurshchyna remains unchanged — attacks from with a large amount of equipment, tanks, BRDM and BMP.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-pro-riznyczyu-mizh-rosijskymy-morpihamy-ta-desantnykamy-na-kurshhyni/	2024-12-01T03:12:07-08:00

The story about the fighter was published on December 1 on the battalion channel. -It was difficult to sit at home and do nothing - I went to the military commissariat,- recalls Marik, who was engaged in repairing telephones in 2023, and before that he was a turner. He worked in the infantry for half a year, and when the FPV unit was created in the company, he transferred there. But not in vain: on Marik's account there are 20 units of damaged enemy equipment worth more than 10 million dollars and more than a hundred occupants.

But then they were also destroyed,- Vitaly Lytvyn said. According to him, sometimes the Russians use small tactical groups, and sometimes assaults take place with the participation of, for example, 30 Russian soldiers. -And we are not counting the equipment, artillery and aviation - and they use them all the time. That is, aviation in this direction strikes not only on the front edge, but also drops guided aerial bombs on logistical routes, on the Pokrovske settlement itself, using anti-aircraft missiles... Defense is very difficult,- the serviceman emphasized. He also emphasized that the difficult weather conditions also do not contribute to the conduct of defensive operations by our Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine, in particular, to the work of aerial reconnaissance. -Cloud cover is often low, making the use of UAVs difficult.- As ArmyInform wrote, the occupying Russian army increases the number of assaults by small groups near Toretsk on Daughters	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/znyshhyly-20-rosiyan-za-piv-godyny-pryjshla-nova-grupa-okupantiv-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-vorog-atakuye-bez-upynu/	2024-12-01T01:58:38-08:00

The Ministry of Defense presented the concept of reform of military medical commissions	This was reported in MoU. The presentation took place during the thematic meeting of the Council of Donors of Institutional Reforms of the MoU, which was attended by Deputy Minister of Defense Brigadier General of Justice Serhiy Melnyk, Deputy Minister of Defense Kateryna Chernogorenko and Deputy Minister of Health Edem Adamanov. -The principles of the VLK have not changed for decades. The system that exists now is a vestige of the old administrative approach. It is full of shortcomings, unnecessary bureaucratic complications, and corruption risks. We must significantly reduce these risks. Therefore, I am grateful for the support of the reform to all partners and public organizations that were involved in the launch of this project,- emphasized Serhii Melnyk. The participants of the meeting noted that the modern system of military medical commissions has two-sided shortcomings. On the one hand, it allows individuals to avoid military service without legal grounds, and on the other hand, it does not prevent people with serious illnesses from entering the service, which creates additional difficulties for the Armed Forces. The reform will make it possible to divide the decision of the military medical commission into two separate sets of data — medical and administrative. Some specialists will conduct a medical examination for VLC, and others will analyze the anonymized results of these medical examinations. To pass the military medical commission, it will no longer be necessary to go to the TCC. Conscripts will be able to independently choose the hospital where they will undergo a medical examination. Data from there will enter the Electronic Health Care System (ECHS). Over time, data from the ESOZ will enter the medical information system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which will be modernized under this reform: in particular, the technical possibility to receive data from the ESOZ and the electronic office of the VLK will be created. The military medical commission will receive data about the person, get acquainted with them, and make its administrative decision. Anonymized data will be sent to a random commission whose members will not know whose documents they are reviewing. This will prevent manipulation and abuse. -As of today, in the context of the VLK, we have old bureaucratic norms that work slowly and do not inspire confidence among citizens. This reform is needed so that conscripts can trust the system. To undergo a medical examination in civilian institutions. To feel that their rights are protected and that after a medical examination they are not immediately declared fit if they actually have some diseases. Our proposal is to create a transparent and clear path that will create the basis for trusting relations and ensure that fair conclusions are drawn,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko. After each decision, a digital trail will be visible - electronic signatures of both the doctor and the VLK employee. The conclusions of the commissions will be kept. All this will simplify the verification and monitoring of the activities of the VLK by law enforcement agencies. The reform will be implemented in three stages and should be completed in November 2025. The Council of Institutional Reform Donors of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is a platform for coordination and communication between the Ministry of Defense and donors regarding the development and implementation of defense sector reforms. Thematic meetings of the Council of Donors of the Ministry of Education and Culture are held with the aim of attracting donors to the implementation of projects in the directions of the strategic priorities of the Ministry of Education and Culture. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/minoborony-prezentuvalo-konczepcziyu-reformy-vijskovo-likarskyh-komisij/	2024-11-30T22:41:51-08:00

Blood from the ears after shelling, a broken mortar and trophies of the Kharkiv operation. -Why here...	How a knee-deep trench can save lives and why 2-3 minutes at the front sometimes make a big difference? Vladislav told our correspondents about this: -On February 26, 2022, I came to Obukhiv TCC. He told his wife that I was called, but in fact, of course, he rushed there himself. Eventually got to the 30th separate mechanized brigade. I was immediately appointed mortar commander. There were 10 days of training. There is nothing super complicated like that. The 82-millimeter mortar was fully mastered. By the way, it so coincided that in the calculation, everyone, like me, was born in 1975. The only thing is that I had ATO experience - I served in the -Donbas- battalion, and the boys did not. And then they went to Donetsk to perform combat missions. Our position was called -Depot-, it was immediately behind Toretsk. We were there for more than 4 months. They usually worked as a counter-battery. It's funny, of course, but everything fell on our 82nd mortar: the enemy was working on us with both 120- and 152-caliber mortars. But, I remember, we once hit the enemy's 120th mortar quite well. We detected it and worked on it: we damaged the mortar itself, and the BC warehouse that was near it was also blown up. And, of course, they always worked on the infantry, they didn't let it take hold. Then they left again for recovery. And then there was Kharkiv Region, where we were standing near Izyum. Then their 20th army started towards us. Their paratroopers were attacking us. Well, they were loaded&#8230; Also, the Russians were working there even then with T-90 tanks, and they are really strong - they could withstand even 7 hits from RPG, LNG&#8230; Yes, he had a turret wedged after that, but at least he could move away. By the way, there our colleagues on the 120th T-90 mortar hit and knocked down his goose. It was like this. But on August 14, the Russians already stepped on us in a serious way. Everything flew at us: both -tornadoes- and -hail-. In the morning, the command -To the battle- arrived, because the enemy had gone to break through. We then covered one of our mouths. And at one point&#8230; The exits of enemy artillery can be heard, and when the cassette is opened, there is such a click. I just managed to shout -Lie down- to the boys! We had a small trench even then, knee-deep: this is what saved us. In general, everything went well, but contusions were received, of course. My ears were bleeding, but I didn't pay attention to it at the time. Not before that. We were lucky that then two tanks of our reserves had time to remove from the echelon. And they gave the enemy T-90 a serious fight&#8230; We had one tank driver there, call sign -Kipish-. So he burned the T-90 on his T-64, which started working for us. And when an enemy tank is working on you, you just lie in the trench and read the Our Father. The -Kipisha- tank never hit the enemy, although it spent a lot of shells on him. -Kipish- is a young man. Pity him, he died later near Soledar&#8230; By the way, it is true that the Russians left a lot of equipment in Kharkiv region. It got to the point that our brigades there even started sorting through the trophies: -I don't want the 72, phew, I only want the T-80.- First, the brand new ones that still smelled of paint won trophies. Then it was restored again and we already had the Bakhmut direction: Klishchiivka, Andriivka, Kurdyumivka, Zaliznyanske. I remember how we left Zaliznyanskyi&#8230; One of our drivers arrives and says: -Run, we're leaving here quickly-! And we were no longer even on the road, but on the field from there. And you look back, at the place where we stood, and everything that is begins to fly there. Literally about 2-3 minutes everything was solved then&#8230; Eventually, injuries and other ailments left me with limited fitness. Now I work in the TCC. Yes, it happens that civilians make some kind of claims: why are you here and not there. But, honestly, there is no desire to explain to people what I went through and what I experienced at the front. Why do I have to prove anything to anyone? I also have a wife, children. But the guys who are still at the front should be replaced. They are really exhausted.

Will burn a tank with a meter of armor: the Brazilian defense company is developing an anti-tank mis...	Authors of the online military publication Army Recognition inform that as this platform develops, it will change the perception of anti-tank and high-precision strike capabilities of the Brazilian ground forces, becoming the most important element of the future combat operations of the Brazilian army, ArmyInform notes. In addition to the development of the latest MSS (Míssil Superficie-Superfície) anti-tank missile complex (ATGM), the Sistemas Integrados de Alto Teor Tecnológico (SIATT) company is also working on a new anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) with the -shoot-forget- technology. Such technology allows operators to immediately change position after launching a missile, which drastically minimizes damage to the military by enemy counterfire. The new complex is expected to penetrate more than 1000 mm of rolled homogeneous armor (RHA ). At the same time, effectively neutralizing a wide range of modern main battle tanks (MBTs) and armored vehicles, including those with dynamic protection. Thanks to this level of armor penetration, the MSS ATGM is in the same class as some of the most powerful anti-tank missile systems in the world. In addition to high penetration capacity, the future MSS ATGM model will have a range of more than four kilometers. This is very important for fighting in open or rugged terrain, where the ability to engage in long-range combat is essential for tactical advantage. The portable version of the product consists of a launcher with a tripod and sights weighing about 30 kg, a container with ammunition weighing less than 25 kg. The missile design includes a laser guidance system. In addition to the development of a new ATGM, the company is working on the creation of an anti-tank missile with laser guidance and an increased range. This variant of the ATGM is designed to increase the accuracy and range of the Brazilian army's anti-tank weapons, providing effective combat against targets at significant distances. The laser guidance system allows the missile to be precisely aimed at both static and moving targets, giving operators more control over the missile's flight path and reducing the chance that it will deviate from the target or be intercepted. -The MSS anti-tank missile complex platform marks an important milestone in Brazil's efforts to develop its own highly effective defense solutions, reducing dependence on foreign technologies,- the Army Recognition publication emphasized. In addition, the MSS complex is being developed in such a way that it can be used as an individual means of defeating armored vehicles, and can be installed on various platforms and vehicles. The MSS system is also planned to include a firing simulator with a very accurate representation of the real environment, so it will be possible to train anti-tank troops without the need to use real missiles, as well as test equipment to measure and align the direction of fire. -These capabilities increase the export potential of the system, as countries seeking to strengthen their anti-tank defense are likely to pay attention to the improved characteristics of the MSS anti-tank missile complex and its flexibility in integration with various platforms,- ​​the authors of the publication note.

Mirroring the facts in action: the Russian Federation accuses Ukraine of its own war crimes	Specialists of the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security emphasize that, in fact, Ukraine strictly adheres to International Humanitarian Law, while Russia systematically attacks civilian infrastructure. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, Russia has destroyed 227 medical facilities and damaged 1,714. Also, 3,798 educational facilities have been seriously damaged, of which 365 have been completely destroyed. Particularly egregious examples are the airstrike on the maternity hospital and children's hospital in Mariupol on March 9, 2022, the rocket attack on the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024, when 627 children were in the hospital. Russia uses attacks on civilian infrastructure as a tool to intimidate the population, which is a violation of the laws of war. Russia is trying to create the impression that its actions in Ukraine are -defense- or -response- to Ukraine's actions, despite real evidence to the contrary. Statements about attacks on civilian objects are designed to show Ukraine as a violator of international law in order to undermine its support from the world community. Disinformation is used to bolster domestic propaganda, motivate Russian citizens, and justify the continuation of the war. The distortion of facts is aimed at causing doubts among Ukraine's allies about the provision of further military and humanitarian aid.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/viddzerkalennya-faktiv-u-diyi-rf-zvynuvachuye-ukrayinu-u-vlasnyh-voyennyh-zlochynah/	2024-11-30T20:08:39-08:00

Four people were killed by a Russian attack on Dnipro Oblast — the President	The appeal was published in the evening of November 30. -There is now a rescue operation in Dnipro Oblast after a missile strike. Ordinary civilian buildings were damaged: a residential building, a shop in the village of Tsarichanka. At this time, it is known that four people were killed by this Russian strike. My condolences,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He reminded that today the Russians once again continued the extremely vile terror against the people of Kherson, when they dropped a drone on a bus, as a result of which 4 people were injured. -And so almost every day. Ukraine defends itself against this absolutely inhumane pressure. I am grateful to everyone who helps us go through all this, protect ourselves from terror and save people's lives,- the President said.

Also the Netherlands - thank you very much for the launchers for the Patriot. The United States is preparing an important strong military package of $725 million. This is something that will significantly support our boys at the front,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. According to his information, there is also a readiness of the Scandinavians and the Baltic states to increase investments in our defense industry, in particular in the production of our domestic drones. The President reminded that Norway has decided on financial support for Ukraine for the next year of more than three billion. There is also Luxembourg's decision on funds for the purchase of weapons for our Defense Forces of Ukraine. -We also appreciate Britain's decision regarding sanctions against the Russian shadow tanker fleet. It is what keeps the whole world on course for justice. For Russia to feel its responsibility for this war, for its consequences, and for Russia to be forced into peace. The world is capable of ensuring this,- the President said. He also said that he listened to the report of the Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, on the situation at the front and in the areas of the Kursk operation. -I want to thank our brigades that defend the positions that destroy the occupier. And today I want to especially recognize the 38th Marine Corps Brigade, the 68th Hunting Brigade and the 14th National Guard Operational Task Force brigade for this week's battles. Thank you, warriors! Thank you for your bravery in the Pokrovsky direction,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. He informed that the team is preparing for quite active work in December: work with partners: negotiations, meetings. -There are solutions that can be implemented precisely in these weeks and months for the sake of our common security — for the sake of Ukraine and everyone who really wants this war to end as soon as possible and, very importantly, justly,- the President noted.

Without NATO, Ukraine will not have real independence - the President	President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi told about this in an interview with Skynews. According to him, for this Ukraine needs to join NATO. In particular, first of all, the part of the territory controlled by Ukraine should be covered with the NATO umbrella as soon as possible. And then deal with the return of the occupied territories by diplomatic means. Without NATO, Ukraine will face serious dangers. -Putin does not want peace. For him, our independence is equal to losing this war. Without NATO, there will be no real independence in Ukraine. He will be back. In the next 10 years,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi believes. The President also added that Ukraine should receive an invitation to NATO within internationally recognized borders. After all, the acceptance of only part of the territory will indicate the recognition of the occupied territories as Russian. Ukraine cannot do this. Volodymyr Zelensky also does not see an alternative to joining NATO. -We don't have nuclear weapons. We gave it to the fact that the most influential leaders of the countries guaranteed the security of Ukraine. But it didn't work and we lost a lot. Maybe there is some alternative besides NATO. But I can't see her. I've heard about security guarantees. And I talked about it with many leaders of countries. Such agreements should include humanitarian, economic aid, weapons, etc. But this is not NATO. And that doesn't equate to security guarantees. We had the Budapest Memorandum. But this did not stop Putin,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. The President also calls the principle that no decision should be made without Ukraine as an important point in any agreements. As reported by ArmyInform, the Presidents of Ukraine and France discussed acceleration of Mirage aircraft transfer process.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/bez-nato-v-ukrayiny-ne-bude-realnoyi-nezalezhnosti-prezydent/	2024-11-30T04:47:28-08:00

November's top targets: Defense forces named their -fattest- targets for the month	About this reported on November 30 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. So, at the beginning of the month, Ukrainian drone operators hit the launcher of the Buk-M2 air defense system on a tracked chassis. During combat operation, this air defense system can hit targets both as part of an anti-aircraft missile system when aiming from a command post, and autonomously, in a predetermined sector. A little later, on November 16, 19 and 29, our soldiers hit three more Russian Buk air defense systems of various modifications. The Ukrainian defenders also hunted down the Tor -. It is a land-based -twin- of the Russian sea-based -Kinzhal- air defense system. It is designed to solve the tasks of anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense at the level of a divisional link. In November, one of our ground units added to the list of hit enemy targets at once with two heavy flame-throwing systems of TOS salvo fire -1A -Sunflower-. Also last month, our soldiers struck Russian electronic warfare complex -Borisoglebsk-2-. The main task of the complex is to detect and suppress various communication channels and other systems that use radio signals. First of all, these are tactical link communication and control systems, in particular satellite. The last decade of November was particularly productive in terms of destroying enemy weapons and equipment. In particular, during the repulse of an enemy assault in the Donetsk direction, units of the Defense Forces hit 7 Russian BMD-4s with a crew and a landing party within one day. BMD-4 is the latest version of the Russian Army's amphibious assault vehicles. Units of the Armed Forces also launched a missile attack on the deployment site of the expensive Russian S-400 -Triumph- anti-aircraft missile system. As a result, the radar station was damaged. Let us emphasize that the functionality of the radar station depends on the combat work of other components of the air defense system. At the end of November, in the temporarily occupied Crimea, our scouts destroyed two (!) Russian radar Podlyot complexes. This is a mobile radar, which is used by the enemy to detect air targets at low and extremely low altitudes in a complex obstacle environment. In particular, this radar is involved in the targeting system for S-300 and S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems. in November there is a Russian radar -Zoopark- - a mobile means of counter-battery combat. The main purpose of the complex is the reconnaissance of the enemy's firepower and the adjustment of fire. And another expensive target of our soldiers was the Russian mobile low-altitude radar station -Kasta 2E2-. Its purpose is airspace control, determination of coordinates and recognition of air targets, including at extremely low altitudes. It transmits coordinates and movement parameters of air targets to air defense systems. However, it can also be used as an air traffic control radar. As reported by ArmyInform, on November 28, as a result of a successful operation of the GUR of the MoU in the territory of temporarily occupied Crimea Russian radar complex -podlyot- destroyed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/top-czili-lystopada-syly-oborony-nazvaly-svoyi-najzhyrnishi-urazhennya-za-misyacz/	2024-11-30T03:51:47-08:00
Panic in the jungle -lnr-: inflation, repression against business and -meat assaults- mobilized	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. According to him, more than a year ago, the invaders forced the business to reduce the prices of food and goods, limiting the markup to 5%. This was explained by the holding of the so-called -first elections- and preparations for the re-election of Putin. Now the situation has worsened: due to the rise in prices, entrepreneurs have been accused of cartel conspiracy and issued warnings. The pressure on businesses continues, creating additional challenges for local residents. In addition, the invaders treat the forcibly mobilized residents of Luhansk region with disdain. Those mobilized are often the first to be sent on dangerous -meat assaults-. In the 13th tank regiment of the Russian army, the command forced soldiers from the -LNR- to give 50% of their pay. Those who refused were punished by being sent to the basement in Zaytsevo, known for its brutal conditions of detention. These facts testify to the deterioration of the situation in the occupied territory, both for the local population and for those who were mobilized to the ranks of the Russian army. As reported by ArmyInform, at the TOT of Luhansk Oblast, the occupiers are terrorizing the population: even a Russian passport does not help.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/panika-v-dzhunglyah-lnr-inflyacziya-represiyi-proty-biznesu-ta-myasni-shturmy-mobilizovanyh/	2024-11-30T03:28:26-08:00

One of the capital's military institutes has become a leader in the study of foreign languages ​​amo...	About it in interview with ArmyInform was told by the head of the educational and scientific center of foreign languages ​​of the National Defense University of Ukraine, candidate of philological sciences, colonel Nataliya Vasyukova. -We will not talk about statistics. However, a large-scale invasion became an obvious challenge, because we had to train soldiers who spoke English because of the importance of working with partners, learning western technology, etc. With the beginning of a large-scale invasion, language training was somewhat suspended, as it was necessary to figure out how to deal with the current situation, where to go next. But studies at the NUOU were not stopped: the educational process continued, graduations took place, and, of course, the emphasis was placed on disciplines that involved the direct repulsion of aggression. But in the same year, two foreign language courses were held. One was completed at the beginning of February 2022, the second started in October 2022,- Nataliya Vasyukova said. She emphasized that it is not just about NUOU, as foreign language courses are available in all higher military educational institutions and military educational units of higher education institutions. -And this shows that since the beginning of large-scale aggression, these processes have not just stopped, they have even become more emphasized, thus emphasizing the importance of learning foreign languages. The only question was which institution, depending on the number of scientific and pedagogical workers and teachers, could afford a certain number of groups. Let's add that NUOU is the leader in terms of the number of students,- the interlocutor emphasizes. If we compare the year 2024 with 2022 in the context of learning foreign languages, Nataliya Vasyukova draws attention to not just listener interest, but -motivated interest.- -Because people, in accordance with their positions, which require knowledge of the language or in accordance with the range of tasks performed, understand the complete dependence in certain official situations on the level of English proficiency. And there is also the realization that taking the next step in one's professional development and career growth without knowing the language will be difficult, and sometimes completely impossible,- Nataliya Vasyukova summed up. As ArmyInform wrote, from 2024 in military universities three new specialization. Previously ArmyInform informed that at military universities this year the most popular specialties among women were and specializations that train commanders of mechanized units, units of Airborne Assault Forces and Special Operations Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/odyn-zi-stolychnyh-vijskovyh-instytutiv-stav-liderom-z-vyvchennya-inozemnyh-mov-sered-zahysnykiv/	2024-11-29T21:33:44-08:00
The General Staff of the Armed Forces named three areas where the enemy concentrated its main effort...	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In addition, the occupiers are actively attacking in the Lyman and Kupyan directions. The terrorist state launched a missile strike with one missile, 31 airstrikes, dropping 53 anti-aircraft missiles. In addition, the invaders used 581 kamikaze drones for strikes and fired more than 3,000 shots at the positions of our troops and populated areas. On the Kharkiv direction, Russian terrorists stormed the positions of our units five times in the Kudiivka, Vovchansk, and Tikhoi districts. Two skirmishes are ongoing. Seven times the enemy attacked our positions in the Kupyan direction. In the vicinity of Kolisnikivka, Lozova, Pershotravnevoy and Zeleny Gayu, units of the Defense Forces repelled all enemy attacks. In the Lyman direction, Russian troops attacked Ukrainian defenders 20 times in the districts of Grekivka, Novoyehorivka, Terniv, Yampolivka, Dibrova, Torsky, Zarichny, Hryhorivka and in the Serebryansky forest. Our soldiers repelled 18 enemy attacks, two battles are ongoing. In the Kramatorsk direction Ukrainian soldiers repelled three attempts by the invaders to capture our positions in the area of ​​Chasovoy Yar and in the direction of Bila Hora. In the Toretsk direction, the occupiers twice tried to advance in the Druzhba and Toretsk districts, but were repulsed. In the Pokrovsky direction, the aggressor attacked our positions 34 times in the areas of Myrolyubivka, Promin, Lysivka, Dachenske, Chumatske, Novy Trud and Zhovte settlements. Ten clashes are still going on. In the Kurakhiv direction, the invaders made 43 attempts to advance. 11 attacks continue. The main battles are taking place near Sontsivka, Berestki, Novodmytrivka, Zori, Kurakhovo, Dachny, Dalny, Elizavetivka, Hannivka, and Uspenivka. In the Vremivsk direction the aggressor stormed the front edge of our defense 24 times in the area of ​​Vesely Gay, Kostyantynopolskyi, Suhy Yali, Rozdolnyi and Novodarivka, currently three skirmishes are ongoing. In the Dnieper direction, the enemy made three unsuccessful attempts to storm the positions of Ukrainian units. The Defense Forces of Ukraine continue the operation in the Kursk direction. Ukrainian soldiers repelled 22 attacks of the invading army in this direction. Soldiers of the 68th Separate Hunter Brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush, the 92nd Separate Assault Brigade named after Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirk, and the 71st Separate Hunter Brigade of the DSHV were awarded for their effective combat work. As reported by ArmyInform, on the Kramatorsk direction, the enemy will continue to concentrate its main efforts around the town of Chasiv Yar, but the Defense Forces are holding their positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/u-genshtabi-zsu-nazvaly-try-napryamky-de-vorog-zoseredyv-osnovni-zusyllya/	2024-11-29T21:18:22-08:00
Army English: about motivated new -blood-, conversation clubs with an attache... and not only	About all this and not only the correspondent of ArmiyaInform asked in an interview the head of the educational and scientific center of foreign languages ​​of the National Defense University of Ukraine (hereinafter - NUOU), candidate of philological sciences, Colonel Nataliya Vasyukova. —How many military personnel did the specialists of your university manage to train since the beginning of the large-scale invasion? And during 2024? - We will not talk about statistics. However, a large-scale invasion became an obvious challenge, because we had to train soldiers who spoke English because of the importance of working with partners, learning western technology, etc. With the beginning of a large-scale invasion, language training was somewhat suspended, as it was necessary to figure out how to deal with the current situation, where to go next. But studies at the NUOU were not stopped: the educational process continued, graduations took place, and, of course, the emphasis was placed on disciplines that involved the direct repulsion of aggression. But in the same year, two foreign language courses were held. One was completed in early February 2022, the second started in October 2022. But it is not only about NUOU, because foreign language courses are available in all higher military educational institutions and military educational units of higher education institutions. And this testifies to the fact that since the beginning of large-scale aggression, these processes have not simply stopped, they have even become more emphasized, thus emphasizing the importance of learning foreign languages. The only question was which institution, depending on the number of scientific and pedagogical workers and teachers, could afford a certain number of groups. Let's add that NUOU is the leader in terms of the number of students. If we compare the year 2024 with 2022, it is worth paying attention to not just the interest of listeners, but motivated interest, because people, in accordance with their positions, which require knowledge of the language or in accordance with the range of tasks performed, understand complete dependence in certain official situations from the level of English proficiency. There is also the realization that taking the next step in your professional development and career growth without knowing the language will be difficult, and sometimes impossible. - Is the training of the military to learn a foreign language now about quantity or quality? - This is a provocative question, because the process of studying, mastering, gaining a new level in a certain direction, including a foreign language, is always a transition to a qualitatively new level. Therefore, it cannot be said that it is only about quantity. Let's talk about quality quantity in this context(smiles - ed.). - How do partners get involved in this training? - We knock on everyone. I can comment on the period of my two years in office. The initiative should always come from the interested party. And in this context, it is about creating a partnership network, first of all, within the Defense Forces. Yes, we try to communicate with all departments involved in foreign language education. We exchange materials, share experience, look for ways to improve educational and methodological support, etc. That is, it is an internal affiliate network. But we also knock on all the doors of our partners. In particular, within the framework of the strategy of internationalization in military educational institutions, the idea of ​​creating a patronage system is laid: when a certain educational institution of partner countries or NATO members takes a kind of patronage over a certain military educational institution. The implementation of this would help to create a partnership network between various educational institutions, which would work not only in the direction of studying general English (General English), but also - what is extremely important today - specialized narrow-profile terminology (English for Specific Purposes). In addition, last year we started the practice of conversation clubs for students of foreign language courses with the participation of defense attachés of the Kyiv Association of Military Attachés. Classes were held 2-3 times a month in the form of interviews, discussions with students according to their level of training. The goal was to consolidate the learned vocabulary and grammatical constructions in speech practice, as well as simply the opportunity to practice speaking, practicing typical communicative situations as close as possible to real ones with the participation of a native speaker (even if it is not his native language). During such classes, students learn to overcome the psychological barrier to start speaking a foreign language, because just as it is sometimes difficult to dare to take the first step, it is also difficult to say the first word, the first phrase in English (-will they understand me-, -will I not errors-). This year, this practice of conversation clubs has spread to other higher military educational institutions that conduct foreign language courses. - Are some subjects taught in a foreign language at the NUOU? - In the center of foreign languages, we definitely teach only in English. In addition, there is also English in research for future Ph.D. But both at the university and at other higher military educational institutions, in accordance with the governing documents and today's conditions, there is a requirement to teach 20% of subjects in a foreign language. Therefore, it is necessary to improve foreign language knowledge not only of listeners, but also of scientific and pedagogical staff. To do this, we cooperate both within the internal network and with foreign partners to create a course in the direction of English as a medium for teaching other disciplines (English-Medium Instruction or English as a Medium for Instruction). In this way, we maintain, acquire or expand the capacity to study and teach in English within the university. —What do you think is the current -room average temperature- for foreign language proficiency among the Armed Forces servicemen? —Thanks to the language testing sessions, I can see the statistics and can make a cut: in fact, so far the overall temperature is— disappointing, as it is cool outside the window now. But this new -blood- that appeared in the army with the beginning of the Russian Federation's large-scale aggression against Ukraine indicates a certain tendency to increase the temperature, I will use the same metaphor - as if the heating was turned on and it's getting warmer. Those who understood that it is very difficult to achieve anything in civilian life without a foreign language, it is difficult to find a well-paid job, it is more difficult to develop professionally - they made their choice in the civilian dimension. And now they are -inspiring- their fellow soldiers with their experience. Well, it is worth emphasizing that there are many servicemen who do not wait for an order or command to learn a language, do not look for people to blame for their ignorance, but look for opportunities and time, take the initiative and start learning on their own, strive to develop, listen to recommendations - because it is the main driving force and key to success in mastering languages ​​are internal motivations and desires. I can say with great pleasure that there are more and more of them. - Do you have enough time to learn foreign languages ​​in the third year of a large-scale war? - No! Unfortunately, we confirm the effectiveness of the proverb -until the thunder strikes...-. Yes, we have started to -baptize-, but the result will take time. If you try to meet all the current needs, I jokingly say that both I and my colleagues need to be cloned! (laughs - ed.) Language is not something you can do in one or two evenings, gain some understanding and more or less master it. Language is something that is trained over time: you train your brain, you train yourself, and it is through self-discipline that you learn. But it takes time. According to our guidelines, there are 500 hours of teacher-led study from level zero to level one, which is pretty intense, and that's the pace at which four-month foreign language courses are taught. And no less important in language learning is the fact that after reaching a certain level, it is necessary to constantly maintain it, so as not to lose it, to keep what has been acquired. After all, if you do not do this, the skills will disappear, not immediately and not completely, but will become passive. Currently, there are many ways to maintain language skills - smartphone apps, news adapted to language levels, even short 15-minute lessons - but systematic - would be very appropriate. For example, we recommend Elena Chekryzhova's -Army English- project to everyone, and we broadcast her lessons to the public on the territory of our center: even passing by, you can hear something new, learn a new term. - Do you cooperate with public organizations, non-governmental institutions to improve and deepen the study of foreign languages ​​by military personnel? - Yes, and the contribution of NGOs and volunteers should not be underestimated, because the civil sector is those who, on a voluntary basis, realizing the need for the military to be included in these processes; provide translation support where necessary; continue to work and help us both abroad and in Ukraine. From November 2024, on the basis of the Memorandum of Cooperation between the Mariupol State University and the National Defense University of Ukraine, permanent and temporary staff of the university will be granted free access to educational courses on the study of the English language on the English4Ukraine electronic platform. This is another example of effective civil-military interaction. - What are your plans for improving the English course(s) for 2025? - When I am asked about the state of affairs, I usually answer -at least not worse- (smiles - ed.). As for plans, it is even more difficult, but you can use the same phrase: indeed, in 2025, we do not want to reduce our current indicators, but to increase them, of course, only under the conditions of an increase in interrelated human capital (research and teaching staff, educational facilities), so that a year later during the interview, without taking your eyes off, talk about quality quantity. We want to open more opportunities for people who want to learn a foreign language. — What interesting, funny, curious incident can you remember related to the stay of our military in an English-speaking environment? During studies abroad, during communication with partners, etc. - All these curious cases are almost always related to not quite perfect command of the language. I don't want to call these cases funny, because it demotivates those who study, strengthens the psychological barrier to language use that I mentioned earlier. And I always insisted: speak, don't be shy. After all, the foreigner with whom you speak English speaks Ukrainian worse than you speak English. One should be demanding of oneself, but the level of self-criticism should not hinder practice. And don't be afraid to laugh, and maybe laugh at yourself sometimes. Sometimes the lack of vocabulary is compensated by the ability to draw well what you cannot say, or curious cases arise not only due to imperfect knowledge of a foreign language, but also due to ignorance of cultural features, so it is always worth conducting small linguistic and cultural reviews of the countries whose language is studied. From the latest that I remember: guys are calling me and telling me: -I tell her: ``Give me keys'' - English). I meant -keys-. And the foreign interlocutor did not hear -keys- but -give me kiss- (English). Then everyone laughed&#8230; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/armijska-anglijska-pro-motyvovanu-novu-krov-rozmovni-kluby-z-atashe-i-ne-lyshe/	2024-11-29T21:03:30-08:00
-Scorpion- is ready to attack again: Turkish defenders are bringing a new version of the armored rec...	In the official release of the manufacturing company emphasized that this versatile vehicle is distinguished by advanced weapons systems and extreme mobility, which makes it necessary for a variety of military missions, ArmiyaInform reports. The new version of BBM Akrep (-Scorpion- in Ukrainian) has added to the line of armored vehicles of Otokar Otomotiv ve Savunma Sanayi A.Ş., a subsidiary of the Turkish financial and industrial group Koç Holding, which specializes in the production of buses and military equipment and whose defense vehicles ArmiyaInform repeatedlyrelate Akrep II to the BBM of the universal segment. The armored two-axle vehicle stands out for its advanced weapons systems and extreme mobility, making it useful for a variety of military missions. Unrivaled maneuverability is achieved thanks to the all-wheel drive system and the additional rear steered axle. These capabilities allow the vehicle to effortlessly navigate difficult terrains, including deep mud, snowpack or water obstacles, as well as successfully overcome natural barriers in combat conditions. If necessary, the driver of the armored car can activate the crab mode, which provides the ability to move in a diagonal direction. In this mode, the rear wheels (see video below) turn in the same direction as the front wheels. If you turn the front and rear wheels in opposite directions, the turning radius is almost halved: the rear wheels steer the car in one direction, while the front wheels steer in the other. The ability to adapt to difficult circumstances makes the Akrep II an excellent option for armies that need a reconnaissance vehicle capable of operating in extreme conditions. The John Cockerilla tower has already received high praise and is recognized as a formidable combat platform. It is designed to integrate a variety of weapon systems, including a medium-caliber automatic gun up to 90 mm. This gun has high firepower and accuracy. The turret stabilization system proved to be an effective ally for conducting accurate fire. It provides the ability to perform aimed shots even while moving, and also allows you to hit targets in different directions at short and long distances. The Cockerill LCTS 90MP turret is distinguished by its high stability and safety due to minimal recoil, which makes it the optimal choice for light shooting systems. This gun works with high-explosive shells and has effective anti-armor capabilities, which allows it to successfully perform a variety of combat missions, including reconnaissance operations. The turret system has become widespread in different countries, in particular, there are more than 300 units in the arsenal. Akrep II is designed to operate with three crew members (driver, commander and gunner) and has a total mass of 15,500 kg. With a length of 5.9m, a width of 2.5m and a body height of 1.97m, as well as a ground clearance of 400mm, this car has a compact profile that contributes to its excellent performance on the ground. The Akrep II 4X4 light armored vehicle is offered in a variety of powertrain options, including diesel, hybrid and electric. These configurations are designed to meet specific operational requirements by reducing thermal and acoustic emissions, which are particularly important for operations requiring cloaking and reconnaissance. The diesel version of the car is equipped with a 360-horsepower engine and a 6-speed automatic transmission, which guarantees reliable operation even in the most difficult conditions. Regardless of configuration, this vehicle offers a number of standard features, including central tire inflation, radial tires with Run-Flat, anti-lock braking system (ABS), as well as air conditioning systems and heating. In addition, it is equipped with five-point seat belts and an advanced driver's vision system. Additional features include Drive-by-Wire technology, a filtering system NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical), a self-extracting winch and a 360° situational awareness system that provides full visibility on the battlefield.

The Army that reads: about the project -Book on the front-, US experience and modern innovations -Cu...	The project leader, Sergeant of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Andriy Ovcharuk, told ArmiyaInform about the significance of the book at the front, the connection with the experience of Great Britain and the USA during the First and Second World Wars, and modern Ukrainian innovations. - When did the -Book on the Front- project start and what prompted its appearance? - The -Book on the Front- project started in April 2023, and I joined it from March 2024. Since in civilian life I was the head of the Kyiv office of -Stary Lev Publishing House- - opened bookstores, was a bookseller and sold books myself, I readily agreed when I was offered to lead this project and develop it. I think this idea floated in the air, because such things have already happened before. During World War I, the British and Americans gave books to their troops. Then, during the Second World War, a huge campaign was organized in the USA, during which almost 123 million copies of the books were given to the servicemen of the US Armed Forces. These books simply went to all fronts, 155 thousand boxes were sent every month, each of which contained 40 different books. In total, they had a very large list of over 1,300 items. These included classics, contemporary American literature, entertaining books - westerns, detective stories, and more. — That is, there was a significant demand for books then. Is it the same now? — When many people who were civilians yesterday and are now mobilized join the army, they bring their everyday habits and needs to the army. Our Defense Forces now number hundreds of thousands, more than a million people, a significant number of whom have read in civilian life. Getting into the conditions of war, into the conditions of military service, they retain this need to read. There are also those who are trained as readers already in the army. Military personnel or those who have interacted with military personnel know very well that in the military there are quite often situations where you have to wait a long time. For example, sitting on your belongings until the transport arrives, or being on the guard of some objects, waiting for some task or resting after its completion. Typical are situations where a significant number of people have some free time that they have nothing to do. For many, the main entertainment is the phone, but we want to offer an alternative. The phone isn't always safe, it's not always smart, it's too easy a dopamine hit. In most cases, the phone is not useful, people lose concentration, and things like attention, imagination and concentration are very important in war. - Does the book help to preserve and develop them? - Yes, the book helps to concentrate and think, especially in conditions of uncertainty. When you don't know what to do, the book can help you find a non-standard solution to the situation. Therefore, we want the military to read books and do everything possible for this. -Cultural Landing- is a big project in which musicians, singers, poets, writers, puppeteers take part. People of many creative professions who worked in the field of culture in civilian life. Currently, groups of -Cultural Airborne- travel around military units in the combat zone, visit hospitals and rehabilitation centers, where they perform in front of the military. These can be different events: poet Artem Polezhaka reads poems, puppeteer Valery Dzhek performs plays, Myroslav Jonovich Kuvaldin from the band -The VYO- plays the guitar, Vitaly Kyrychenko sings songs, the most famous of which is -Good Morning, Ukraine-. And when our -Cultural Landing- groups come to the military, they take books with them. After the performance, after communicating with the fighters, they open a box of books and offer to choose something to read. Accordingly, the military choose something to their taste that they like. —Where does the Book to the Front project get the books it distributes to the military?—In the United States, since World War II, the program to supply books to the military has been supported at the state level. The government decided that this was important for the military, who had no other entertainment than reading - when boxes of books arrived, they would instantly take them apart, read them, and exchange them among themselves. It got to the point that after frequent reading, the books simply fell apart. This, by the way, caused a real book boom after the end of the war, because after returning to civilian life, former soldiers continued to read. Book publishing, the book industry experienced a boom - the book market doubled in the first half of the year, and then doubled again in the following year. In the end, it had a tremendous impact on the development of the entire country. For us, this is now happening on a voluntary basis, so the scale is disproportionate. If in the USA during the Second World War there were tens of millions of books, then we are talking about tens of thousands. We offer ordinary civilians, visitors to bookstores, book festivals to buy a book and donate it to the -Book on the Front- project. On this book, you can write a wish, leave a note for the military who will read the book. Having collected books in the rear cities of Ukraine, we hand them over to the -Cultural Landing- groups who go to the front, to educational centers, to military units, to hospitals, rehabilitation centers - wherever there are military personnel. - A paper book has a certain weight, takes up a certain volume - it is not always convenient for a soldier to take it with him. Instead, almost everyone has a smartphone in their pocket. Does the Book to the Front project practice e-book distribution? - Yes, there are several other initiatives within which the military can access e-books. There is an initiative from online bookstore Yakaboo called The Library for Heroes. We are also engaged in the dissemination of this initiative. The reading application has a separate library that contains more than 700 e-books, several dozen audiobooks. According to the promotional code, which can be obtained from us on the -Book on the Front- project, the soldier will have access to this library and can choose anything there. You really won't carry a lot of paper books with you. For example, after reading one book that was obtained during a meeting with the Cultural Landing, I realized that I wanted to read more. So here's your promo code, pick whatever you want, there's a lot to choose from. But paper books are also important, because it is not always possible to charge a phone - electricity is needed. And many people find it more convenient to read a regular paper book - you get used to it, it's nice to flip through the pages, feel them to the touch. - What is read most often, which genres of books are most often chosen and ordered? - Most often, military personnel read fiction books. They provide an opportunity to distract yourself from the military routine, from anxiety, worries about your life. They allow you to immerse yourself in another world, experience vivid emotions. How do imagination and emotions work? They help to relax, rest, switch off from complex thoughts a little. The book helps a lot in this. Of course, there are also people who like to read non-fiction - something serious, non-fiction, self-improvement books. Many people are interested in the experience of previous wars - historical books on military topics are also quite in demand and popular. It doesn't have to be books about our war—it could be books about the Vietnam War, World War II. It happens that comics are ordered, especially in hospitals and rehabilitation centers there was a request for comics. There was even a request from the military from the combat unit to give them the manga. - And poetry, collections of poems - are they ordered, read? - Of course, poetry is very attractive, because it is a short emotional text that helps you get to your own emotions very quickly. Reading an emotional poem, you yourself begin to feel everything more deeply. You can cry, you can laugh, you can experience many different emotions when you read poetry. Many of those who order books ask for poetry. Some resort to the spoken word in training centers, reading poems to motivate fighters during training. Now there are many bright, talented poets in the army. Artur Trony, for example, writes very strong poems. Unfortunately, a very strong poet Maksym Kryvtsov died, his poems became very famous. I have already mentioned Artem Polezhaku - this list can be continued for a very long time. Military service, reliving the personal experience of war prompts both to write and to read poetry. Therefore, poetry collections are chosen for reading quite often. I had an order from one hospital specifically for poetry, I organized the collection and transfer of more than fifty collections of poetry to them. - Where can a soldier put a book after reading it? - These books are gifts, they do not need to be returned. If it is a school, hospital or rehabilitation center, the book can stay in a local, often informal, library where it can be borrowed and read by others. Most often, books are given to siblings by exchanging books. You can also mail someone, family or friends, to read this book too. This allows you to share your emotions, find a common topic for conversation. Books allow military personnel to think more deeply about and relive their own experiences, and become an additional means of communication both among themselves and with those who remained in the rear. After all, a book is an extension of life. We don't know when the war will end, but life still goes on. And books help us to continue living even in the midst of the horrors of the present war.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/armiya-shho-chytaye-pro-proyekt-knyga-na-front-dosvid-ssha-ta-suchasni-novacziyi-kulturnogo-desantu/	2024-11-29T20:28:59-08:00
Breaking the truth: the Russians are circulating fakes about drugs in the army	By keyword search experts from -Vox Ukraine- found the original source of the photo that was distributed by propagandists. The original photo appeared on the Facebook page of the patrol police of the Dnipropetrovsk region. Law enforcement officers seized drugs from a woman in the Samara district of Dnipro. However, there is no information in the police report that the detainee was a soldier. The propagandists cropped the original photo and passed it off as a package with drugs, which are allegedly distributed among the fighters of the 95th ODSHBr. The topic of drugs is extremely popular among Russian propagandists. Propagandists have repeatedly stated that drugs are used by Ukrainian military personnel, and that the narcotic substances themselves are grown in Ukraine by Americans in biolaboratories. In particular, we can recall fakes, as if the Armed Forces of Ukraine are creating a -universal soldier- with the help of drugs, and the Third OSH Brigade is forcing recruits to use narcotic substances. All these and similar -throwbacks- by the Russians are lies.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/lomka-za-pravdoyu-rosiyany-tyrazhuyut-fejky-pro-narkotyky-u-vijsku/	2024-11-29T20:10:10-08:00

According to him, the enemy is trying to complicate its offensive actions, and for this purpose it bypasses Chasiv Yar from different sides. He added that in the areas on our side of the canal, the enemy has not established a foothold, but is trying to penetrate in small groups. -Our boys identify them very quickly and work on them. The enemy is trying to accumulate forces in this way, but because of our drones, they are unable to do so,- Andriy Polukhin said.

Why MRAP armored vehicles are the safest against mines	Armored vehicles MRAP (from the English MRAP, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected - protection against mines and ambushes) - a class of military vehicles specially designed to protect the crew from undermining on min . The first armored vehicles under the MRAP system were produced back in the mid-70s. For the production of such cars, a special design and technological features were invented, which allow to protect the crew when hitting a mine. These machines have reduced the number of losses many times over. Due to the wedge-shaped bottom, the kinetic energy from the mine explosion is directed to the outside of the armored capsule. When making a V-bottom, it is important to maintain a certain angle. The sharper it is, the more energy is directed outwards and the better the crew is protected. At the same time, the sharp angle of the bottom increases the center of gravity and the height of the car, which reduces the car's rollover resistance and increases the height, vulnerability to anti-tank grenade launchers. When making an obtuse angle, the situation is reversed. The more obtuse the angle of the bottom, the worse the protection against a mine explosion, but the lower the center of gravity and the overall height of the armored car, which increases the protection against grenade launchers and other means of destruction. MRAP armored vehicles are designed according to the modular principle - a monolithic protected armored capsule and remote poorly protected external units: wheels, chassis elements, engine. The latter have an inertial fastening principle, that is, they absorb all the kinetic energy of the explosion. This design allows you to withstand detonation of powerful mines with minimal impact on the crew module. By the way, Formula 1 cars are designed according to a similar principle. Amortization seats and units. The design of landing seats in MRAP armored vehicles absorbs the kinetic energy of the explosion, saving the life of a serviceman. The seats are installed in the places of the least impact of the blast wave. During the explosion, the armor module moves, and the chair remains in place. According to a similar damping principle, other components are installed on armored vehicles so that during an explosion they do not harm personnel. For example, fragments of affected units fly out. Special design wheels. MRAP armored vehicles use wide, low-pressure tires with a high profile. Such tires create low pressure on the surface, so they do not activate the effect of anti-tank mines. The high profile of the tire serves as an additional explosion-absorbing factor. Strengthened ballistic protection. The armored capsule of MRAP vehicles is made taking into account the impact not only of small arms, but also of fragments from explosive devices of various strengths. An example of the application of safe technological solutions is the MRAP Buffalo. At the beginning of 2007, the US Army had 90 such vehicles in its arsenal. During the hostilities, they suffered more than 800 mine explosions without a single loss of crew. This fact provoked the Pentagon to start a program of complex procurement of such machines. The most popular foreign-made MRAP armored vehicles are Maxxpro, Casspir, Oshkosh, Mastiff, Bushmaster, Kirpi, etc. Ukrainian enterprises produce MRAP technology, in particular, armored vehicles of the Kozak, Varta, Novator, etc. families. And what about the MRAP technology in the Rosarmy? Objectively, the Russians also worked on this project. In the context of the large-scale rearmament and reform of the Rosarmy, which actively began after the Russian-Georgian war in 2008, and revived after the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine in 2014, this technology was implemented. For example, we will give the most famous examples of armored cars that were developed by the Russians: It is worth noting one interesting detail. In the West and in Ukraine, armored vehicles, in particular with MRAP technology, are a class of armored vehicles for widespread use in the military. The Russians follow the policy of the Soviet empire: the best weapons and equipment are for the security forces, which are designed to protect the regime, and special forces. For ordinary infantry, a -three-line- is enough. Analyzing open data on orders in the Russian Federation for armored vehicles, in particular MRAPs, their main operators within the country are units of the Russian Guard, force units of the police (riot, sobr), FSB, etc. Paratroopers, scouts and sappers received BBM in the Rosarmy. But for the rest of the ground forces, the command of the occupying army is in no hurry to implement new technological and engineering security solutions, because the life and health of personnel is not a priority for them.

This is the second enemy air target he has eliminated as part of a mobile fire group in the past two weeks. The previous shooting was on November 17. Then the soldier also destroyed a Russian cruise missile. -I am an anti-aircraft gunner from the first day of service in the army, so I know my job well,- says the soldier. — Got into the Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigade back in 2016, when he was serving his military service. I liked it, signed a contract, and I am fighting in this unit to this day,- said Taras. The man was born and grew up in the south of Ukraine. Here he got married and became a father. Therefore, he does not know from words what the Russian occupying forces are doing in Ukraine, and how to protect his native home and family. -We must defeat the enemy, protect every family, every child, parents, every piece of native Ukrainian land and sky. For this, we need to strengthen the army,- he emphasized. Taras urged everyone to join the fight against the aggressor, to join their Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigade. -Our team is excellent. Together we can hasten the Victory. In the meantime, let's continue to destroy the enemy!- - he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, on the night of November 28, 2024, as a result of an anti-aircraft battle -ta-naslidky-vorozhoyi-ataky/->almost 90 percent of the winged Kalibr and Kh-101 missiles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/29/voyin-taras-zbyv-krylatu-raketu-pid-chas-odnogo-z-najbilshyh-rosijskyh-kombinovanyh-raketno-dronovyh-udariv/	2024-11-29T08:52:40-08:00
The hero of Ukraine Oleg Apostol told how his 95 beat the enemy: interview	The Hero of Ukraine Oleg Apostol was the commander of the 95th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Polish Army until today. In the spring, the correspondent of ArmiyaInform recorded a long interview with him, we suggest that he be recalled on the occasion of his new appointment. The great war that Russia started against Ukraine 10 years ago, during this period many young but extremely experienced military personnel grew up. who have already entered the history of modern Ukraine as talented military leaders. One of these is the commander of the 95th Separate Polish Airborne Assault Brigade, Hero of Ukraine, Knight of the Cross of Combat Merit, Full Knight of the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, Colonel Oleg Apostol. During the ten-year war, the paratrooper fought for Slovyansk and Luhansk airport, liberated the Mykolaiv thermal power station in Donetsk region, and from the beginning of the large-scale invasion, also populated areas in Mykolaiv region. With the appointment to the post of commander of the 95th brigade of the Russian Armed Forces, Colonel Apostol led the battles in the Serebrian and Kupyan forests, and now continues to organize defensive and offensive actions in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Exclusively for ArmiyaInform, Hero of Ukraine Oleg Apostol talked about his combat journey from platoon commander to brigade commander. — What are the most significant combat episodes of the paratroopers since 2014, in your opinion, will go down in the history of Ukraine? — Undoubtedly, the well-known raid (the raid of the Ukrainian paratroopers, which began in July 2014 during the anti-terrorist operation - ed.), defense of Luhansk and Donetsk airports, battles for Debaltseve. During the breakthrough to Luhansk airport, I led a combat reconnaissance platoon, then I was in the position of deputy battalion commander. The occupiers then tried twice to set up ambushes on the advance route. Having calculated the dangerous areas in time, they decided to play it safe. Ordered two tanks and an armored personnel carrier to occupy the designated line. It saved us and prevented us from being destroyed. Everyone knows that 80-90% of ambushes do not survive&#8230; But the commander should always be able to calculate everything in advance, because then it saves many lives and enables the completion of the task. — Tell us about your first battle with the enemy. — June 2, 2014, when everyone went to storm Sloviansk and Lyman. I was tasked with bringing three artillery batteries into a designated area to support operations. Two batteries were equipped with 122 mm howitzers, and one with 152 mm. I was driving behind the 79th DSHV brigade, and then they were ambushed on the climb to Sloviansk. At that moment, I stopped the convoy, because I realized that the 79th was operating with one of the Jaguar special units. All of them are charged, and I have three armored personnel carriers, one -zushka- and three batteries that are covered with tents and not ready for combat. Then the 79th broke through and went forward to Liman, we stood in a column, and the enemy was on our right and left. I understood that the enemy might start to outflank us, so I gave the command to turn off the headlights, turn right and left, and we took up a circular defense. 15 minutes have passed I got on the armored personnel carrier and decided to move forward. I thought then that if I leave and nothing happens, then we will jump by 2-3 cars. When we realized that the enemy had withdrawn, we first thought how lucky we were, because if the enemy had not made such a mistake, it is difficult to imagine what could have happened if three batteries, each with 6 howitzers and ammunition, had been ambushed. ; This is actually the first moment of the battle, but then there was the first contact battle, when I liberated the Mykolaiv TPP. The first time we went there, it was difficult to detect the enemy, and we conducted reconnaissance by combat. The second time, we already knew where all their firing points were, and we simply stopped them with direct fire from tanks. In fact, after we regularly held them at gunpoint, they began to run away. For the third time, we broke through, unblocked Mykolaiv TPP, occupied the commanding heights - and after that Slovyansk was liberated. - What are the most memorable combat episodes since you became the commander of the 95th brigade? - The first is the assault in the direction of the settlement of Kreminna. We had great success there, but the only thing we lacked was effort. Of the four battalions, only two advanced, because the other two were in other directions. We broke ahead, we literally lacked two kilometers. After that, the enemy brought in significant reserve forces, we switched to defense with the task of defending the Kreminny direction. Secondly, this is the defense of the Kupyan forest, at times it seemed that everything was about to fall, but the enemy could not withstand the dynamics of the fighting. This was clearly visible from their assaults. At first, they attacked 15-20 people several times a day. Then 6–8 Russian soldiers, then two people, and then once a day, a couple tried to go on an assault. As soon as such a turning point comes, we immediately tried to regain the lost positions, which we did. - What units of the Russian army did you have to fight against? - We were in the Flint Forest opposite the 76th Airborne Assault Division, which included the 104th Guards Airborne Assault Regiment, the 234th infantry regiment and the 237th Guards parachute regiment On the eastern side, they concentrated the 228th motorized rifle regiment, the 80th tank regiment, and the 4th separate motorized rifle brigade. I am sure that this enemy remembered us well, because we crushed them so much that some units went out to recover. In the Kupyansky Forest, -Sturm Z- and -Sturm V- stood against us, and when the -Zeks- were finished, the personnel left - the 25th Separate Motorized Rifle Guards Brigade, the 138th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade - this was real -meat -. Analyzing the actions of the enemy, you ask yourself the question, how can you just send people to slaughter like this? But I cannot understand this, because my commanders did not act like this with their personnel. And he himself would never do that to his people. At Terny, units of the 20th Guards Combined Arms Army and some assault units of the Tank Army tried to storm us. They have the same tactics here as in the Kupyan forest. They also go in packs, they just put people down. By the way, they call themselves -Kyiv Russia-, but in fact they are simply distorting our history. The most stupid thing is that their people are led by such narratives and believe that it is normal to send people to their death. All this is welcomed by the people, because then they can buy a car. Of course, it is worth noting that the -stacking- tactics of the occupiers is paying off. We have seen this in Bahmut, Soledar and other destinations, but our advantage lies in pure intelligence and technological development. — Your brigade took many prisoners. Will they admit their guilt for all the evil they have committed on our land? - When the occupiers are captured, they immediately become different people. It is clear that at first the characteristic phrases are heard: -We have been abandoned, we are offended by everything and everyone, barefoot, poor, unhappy and hungry.- They behave as prisoners should, they don't show their character, they give us information about where their command posts are, what paths they took, who is senior. If compared with the captives who were at the beginning of the large-scale invasion and now, then I call this -party- mercenaries, because they stupidly go to kill for money. No one catches them and forces them to go fight against Ukraine and kill our civilians and military. This is a purely conscious choice of each of them. When I talk to them before handing them over to replenish the exchange fund, they all say that they were aware of the possibility of their death, but they came to make money. But we understand that they have come to destroy our people. And there is nothing sacred about them. - Which settlements did your brigade liberate? - Our brigade de-occupied Dovgenka, Krasnopill, Makarivka, Pasika, Dolyna, Kamianka, Sukha Kamianka, Studenok, Koroviya Yar, Yatskivka, Krymka, Synycheno. Then they moved to the settlements of Krymka, Shandrigolovo, Zelena Dolyna, Kolodyazi and reached Ploschanka. The Kharkiv operation was well planned by the senior commander, it was correctly selected units, the direction of our shock fist, support and a clear assessment of the enemy. The enemy really relaxed then, they were confident - and that also worked against them. While still a member of the 80th DSHV brigade, he met the war in the position of battalion commander. Such a first moment, which will be remembered forever and will go down in history, is the defense of the settlement of Voznesensk. After successfully repelling the enemy's offensive, we moved to offensive actions. And then they liberated the following settlements in the Mykolaiv region: Arkhargelske, Katerynivka, Kashpero-Mykolaivka, Novopetrivske, Novofontanka, Dobrokamyanka, Ingulets, Vynogradivka, and in this way we reached Yavkina, and already near Snigurivka we supported the enemy. The outlying villages that we held there were: Shiroke, Chervona Dolyna and Kobzartsi. Oh, and we won trophies then! - Which trophies were the -fattest-? - Well, the most I can point out is REB -Resident-. In addition to it, there were gas tankers, water tankers, bathhouses, armored personnel carriers, tanks of various models of the T-72BZ type and modifications, D-30 howitzers, engineering vehicles, MT-LB, pickup trucks, many shells and even to the Grad anti-aircraft missile system. In general, we received such a normal lend-lease from the Rashists, it was -gifted- to us by the 126th separate brigade of the coast guard and the command post of the army. - How has the training of Ukrainian paratroopers changed over these 10 years? - Definitely for the better. Everything we invest in the training of young recruits is invaluable experience forged in battles on our own experience. We in the brigade have developed our own material base and assembled a group of experienced instructors who skillfully manage personnel for each type of combat and explain all the nuances. For me personally, the combat training of personnel is extremely important. — A few months ago, I saw with my own eyes how you set an example and taught the paratroopers of your brigade. To be honest, I was impressed not only by your professional approach, but also by how much your actions motivate the personnel. — Yes, then I gathered my instructors and another certain category of officers and showed all those points that need to be improved in preparation for further training of soldiers on the battlefield. Of course, these are not all dogmas and things are different in battle, but absolutely all situations are analyzed from real battles. We constantly monitor the enemy's channels, watch how our defenders act, analyze where there was success and what caused it, and where we could have done differently. That is, constant analysis of oneself and the enemy gives an understanding of how to plan the course of hostilities. If a person is trained and clearly knows what he should do, then this is already a great destiny of success, because it is the soldiers who forge our Victory in the trenches. And then an extremely important point is the moral and psychological state of my paratroopers. All of us are waiting for our relatives at home. A person should always understand what he is fighting for and what will happen if we do not fight, if we do not overcome this evil now, then Russia will not let us go so easily and will destroy us. — At the beginning of the large-scale invasion, many Ukrainian media underestimated our enemy and dispelled myths that the occupiers were weak and weak. What can you say about this and how often the enemy changes? - If they were weak and weak, we would have knocked them out long ago to the borders of 1991. You can never underestimate your opponent. Russia is a really big machine with a huge human resource, which they do not spare. They are abandoning their people by the thousands and will continue to do so, because history repeats itself. In addition, the occupiers learn quite quickly. Many examples can be given. Russia learns a lot from us and uses it against us in the future. - Did you dream of becoming a paratrooper as a child? - Definitely yes. I never considered infantry or other types of troops. When I was little, in the 7th grade, I had about 300 toy soldiers, up to 100 pieces of equipment, aviation, special forces. All the money that I saved and that my relatives gave me, I spent on my plastic army. I put them against each other according to the scenario, simulated the landing of the landing force and developed various battle sequences. It happened that I was so engrossed in the placement of soldiers that I did not come to the actual battle. After all, I was a child, and I switched to another game, for example, I went to play football, because the placement itself took more than an hour. I have also loved historical films and the history of Ukraine since childhood, constantly read memoirs and historical novels. It was then that my desire to become a soldier was born, I could not see any other way for myself. - What personally gives you strength and how do you motivate your personnel? - Gives strength when the day or battle has passed without loss. War dictates its terms, so you can never get too lazy. I understand that it can be difficult for me mentally at times, because you are constantly worrying about your people, that they are all alive and well, but we understand that it is the hardest for the soldier there. Yes, we plan everything with the brigade leadership, combatants, conduct reconnaissance, provide artillery support, but nothing will happen without soldiers. Therefore, I sincerely want all people to respect our real heroes, because many of them have already given the most valuable thing - their lives. Russia is an enemy and an evil that we must stop. I have lived in this world for a reason, at least we have already avenged both the Cossacks and the Kruts. Now our job is to reclaim the rest of ours. Here you are either the hunter or the prey. — What do you wish for the youth who dream of joining your ranks? What traits do they need to nurture? — DSHV is an elite. I even tell my boys, when they're a little off balance, to remember that they're paratroopers! It will always be difficult, because war is merciless and unfair. We all realize what a tremendous amount of work has been done here to earn the proud title of paratrooper. I wish the youth to cultivate courage, to be physically hardy, to study the entire history of Ukraine, because this is not the first time we are fighting this enemy. Putin's appetite is growing, and it will not stop. He is becoming, and may have already become a copy of Hitler himself, without realizing it. Everyone will have to fight, it is necessary to accept it as it is and with a cold mind. The main thing is to remember and honor all our fallen Heroes!

One of such attacks was shelling from Grady, when the positions of the border guards were literally destroyed. There were defenders in the dugouts, and in the forest - the border guard Vadim with the call sign -Obolon- and the position commander.

We quickly gave him first aid and evacuated him. Fortunately, he is now recovering and will hopefully return to us soon,- says Obolon, who temporarily took command of the position. The border guards rebuilt the fortification from scratch, putting all their strength into it. -We do this for ourselves, because it is our security, and for our commander - so that he is satisfied with our work,- Obolon adds.

The results of the Security Cooperation Forum: who ignored the hysteria of the Russian Federation	The FBS is the OSCE's main platform for arms control, as well as disarmament, confidence-building and security measures, on the basis of which it cooperates for stability in the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian regions. Russia tried to disrupt this meeting even before it began. In particular, during the adoption of the agenda, the Russian delegation stated that there was no consensus regarding the proposed project. In their statement, the Russians demanded from Denmark: The Russian delegation also demanded to immediately start consultations between the Russian Federation and Denmark with the involvement of -third parties-, in particular Malta and the OSCE Secretariat. In response to Russia's actions, the presiding country resolutely confirmed its position on the impossibility of blocking the agenda, which contains only minimal items (-General statements- and -Other-). The Danish side also rejected accusations of abuse of power. Only Belarus supported the Russian demands, and the delegations of the EU, Ireland, Sweden, the USA, Switzerland, Romania, Croatia, Ukraine, Poland, Latvia, France, Great Britain and Georgia expressed their full support for the Danish approach and called for the continuation of the meeting. All this theater was organized to disrupt the performance of Ukraine at the FBS. But our delegation, headed by T.V.O. the permanent representative of Ukraine to international organizations in Vienna, Victoria Kuvshinnikova, who initiated consideration of the issue of the ongoing Russian aggressive war against Ukraine, nevertheless gave her speech on this occasion. -Ukraine, Europe and the whole world need a comprehensive, just and durable peace. Ukraine, as the main victim of Russian aggression, wants an end to this war more than any other country. But this must be real peace, not appeasement of the aggressor. Ukraine is open to diplomacy, but from an honest, strong position. That is why we have the Peace Formula - it is a guarantee of negotiations without forcing Ukraine to commit injustice. Ukrainians deserve a just peace and we must do everything to end the war next year. Unfortunately, the Russian Federation continues to reject all peace initiatives aimed at restoring justice in accordance with the norms and principles of international law. The criminal regime in the Kremlin still believes that it can achieve victory and change the international order according to its own vision. However, despite repeated claims that Russia has one of the most powerful armies in the world, it is still far from military success even after 1,000 days of intense fighting against a country 28 times smaller in size and almost four times smaller in population.- — said the representative of Ukraine. She also emphasized that the successes of the Russian army are based only on a complete disregard for the rules of warfare and a huge amount of -cannon fodder-. Therefore, the Russian army can be defeated, and the international order can be restored. This goal can be achieved only under the condition that all peace-loving states join forces to force the Russian Federation to end the war and recognize its responsibility for the crimes committed. Statements were also made by Great Britain and the EU, and statements by the United States and Canada were distributed in writing. Thus, for the second time, the Danish chairmanship of the FBS decided to ignore Russia's demands and limited the Russian delegation's ability to speak at the Forum. Such a position, in the opinion of the Embassy of Ukraine, corresponds to the interests of our state, since the actions of the chairmanship emphasize Russia's isolation and the weakness of the aggressor's position in the OSCE arena. In addition, the Danish reaction to Russia's actions caused significant damage to the image of the Russian Federation, emphasizing the destructive nature of its actions and the illegality of its demands.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/29/pidsumky-forumu-bezpekovogo-spivrobitnycztva-hto-proignoruvav-isteryku-rf/	2024-11-29T06:04:40-08:00

When there are many of them and they are together, it is a little easier to deal with them. The 155th brigade stood against us, but now it was a little -tired- and Russian airborne troops entered. Their tactics -on ATVs and motorcycles- are even more cool than armored vehicles,- said the spokesman of the 36th separate marine infantry brigade.

There is no translation for the -Cossack- family: how to improve the armored car -Cossack-	Andriy Kharuk, a well-known researcher of military equipment and armaments, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petr Sagaidachny, told the ArmiyaInform correspondent about the history of the creation of this vehicle. Today is the continuation of the conversation, and the first part of the interview can be read at link. — Andriy Ivanovych, at the beginning of our conversation, you mentioned that the premiere sample of this armored car has already attracted the interest of potential foreign buyers. As far as I know, the manufacturer of this type of special equipment had further plans to enter the international market. What did they consist of? — In addition to the basic version, the Praktika company created a modification of the Kozak-2M2, which was offered for export. In particular, with the optional replacement of the Iveco engine with Deutz or Caterpillar, as well as the manual gearbox with an automatic one. This variant could be equipped with a three-door or five-door body. It was planned to establish the licensed production of Kozak-2M2 in Indonesia. In December 2021, the first Indonesian prototype was demonstrated, but there is currently no information on the further development of this project. —And then the third and subsequent generations of -Cossacks- appeared. What can you tell us about them? — BBM -Kozak-3- is a Land Rover Defender all-terrain vehicle booked by -Practice-. The work was carried out on the order of the State Border Service of Ukraine, and the batch of manufactured machines probably does not exceed several dozen copies. Very little is known about the Kozak-4 - it is described as a 15-passenger transport vehicle that was tested in the National Guard. An alternative to Iveco units was the use of the chassis of the American Ford F-550 car. The Kozak-5 prototype, built on this basis, was presented at the -Weapons and Security-2016- exhibition. Unlike Kozak-2, this car was positioned not as an army armored vehicle, but as a police vehicle, including for special-purpose units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. The chassis of the Ford F-550 specially modified for the construction of an armored car by the company - an official converter (reinforced front axle, brakes and suspension elements replaced with stronger ones, installed large 335/80 R20 wheels, replaced gear pairs in the bridges - ed.). The eight-cylinder Power Stroke turbodiesel with a working volume of 6.7 liters develops a power of 390 hp. The transmission is a Ford TorqShift six-speed automatic. -Kozak-5- is lighter than -Kozak-2- - it weighs 10 tons. In the basic version, the armored car accommodates eight people. The design of the body is generally similar to -Kosaku-2-, but in the rear wall, instead of double-leaf doors, single-leaf doors are installed. — But the -fifth- -Cossack-, figuratively speaking, somehow did not go well with the service in the Armed Forces. What, in your opinion, is the reason? — The basic version of the Kozak-5 does not have weapons, but it can be equipped with a machine gun on a turret. And in October 2017, at another -Weapons and Security- exhibition, a variant with a BPU-1 tower from BRDM-2 was demonstrated, in which KPVT (caliber 14.5 mm) and PKT (7.62 mm) machine guns were installed. Unlike Kozak-2 and Kozak-2M armored vehicles, Kozak-5 did not arouse much interest in the Ukrainian military. Only one vehicle is believed to have been transferred to the National Guard in the spring of 2017. She was received by the special forces unit -Vega-. The Armed Forces of Ukraine did not purchase a single armored vehicle of this type before the beginning of the Russian large-scale invasion. Instead, Praktika managed to get an order from Saudi Arabia for 60 armored vehicles. The first batch was ready to be shipped to the customer in April 2021. However, apparently not all Kozak-5 armored vehicles were delivered to Saudi Arabia by February 2022 - photos of such vehicles at the front appeared in the spring and summer. They differ from the armored car given to the National Guard in some details, in particular, the design of the headlights. — However, one of the variants of the Kozak-5 BBM turned out to be a valuable acquisition for Ukrainian sappers, for whom, unfortunately, jobs are constantly being added&#8230; — A special variant of the Kozak-5MPL is intended for demining groups State service for emergency situations. It serves to transport unexploded mines and improvised explosive devices. The difference is a longer wheelbase and a special body design designed to detonate mines/improvised explosive devices that are transported. In addition, the car is equipped with a compartment for a special tool of the pyrotechnic team. In June 2018, the State Emergency Service received eight Kozak-5MPL armored vehicles. — There was an attempt by the manufacturer to create a Kozak-6 special vehicle — In the summer of 2021, the Kozak-6 was produced and tested, a car with a four-door body without a roof. She was appointed to participate in military parades and even took part in the rehearsal of solemn events in August 2021. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine planned to purchase three -armored convertibles-, but this idea was quickly abandoned, so the Kozak-6 prototype was returned to the manufacturer. — However, the -Cossack- manufacturers did not abandon the idea of ​​providing the Ukrainian army with their armored vehicles. What did the -seventh- Kozak turn out to be? — Yes, the last representative of the BBM data line is the Kozak-7 armored car. Unlike the -policeman- -Cossack-5-, it is positioned as a purely military vehicle. The base chassis of the Ford F-550 has been significantly strengthened - wheel hubs from the US Army JLTV vehicle, reinforced axles and new springs have been installed. The body became three-door. The mass increased to almost 12 tons. Compared to Kozak-2M1, the armored car has better ergonomics, improved dynamic characteristics, as well as lower cost and simpler production technology. On the other hand, it has a frame structure, which was considered the main drawback of the Kozak-2 and became the reason for the appearance of the Kozak-2M1 machine with a supporting body. - This model of armored car has its own -export- history of creation. - Kozak-7 armored car was created for an unnamed foreign customer according to an individual technical task. On January 25, 2022, this machine was demonstrated to the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Under the conditions of a large-scale Russian invasion, exports were out of the question. However, a certain number of Kozak-7 armored cars were still produced. Since January 2023, their appearance at the front has been recorded, and in May 2023, information appeared about the use of such armored vehicles by the Airborne Assault Troops. Taking into account all of the above, it can be concluded that the Praktika company has created a fairly extensive line of armored vehicles with a 4×4 wheel formula, which are based on the use of imported civilian units. These machines, primarily Kozak-2 and Kozak-2M1, are widely used by the Defense Forces of Ukraine to ensure the mobility of light infantry units (primarily Airborne Assault Forces, Marines and National Guard - ed.), as well as to support the actions of Special Operations Forces . —Mr. Professor, with this conclusion you have effectively summed up the creation and development of the -Cossack- line of BBM in the period before the large-scale invasion of the aggressors. But the manufacturers of Kozak machines continued their improvement after the start of the great war. — In August 2023, a video appeared of the Kozak-2M1 with a new weapon option — a remote-controlled module with a 14.5-mm KPVT machine gun. In June, this module was already spotted on another carrier - MT-LBu, converted into an ersatz BMP (the designation BMP-1LB is found - ed.). The origin of the remote-controlled installation is unknown, but some conclusions can be drawn from its image. Several lenses of the optical station suggest the presence of a night channel (infrared or thermal imaging - ed.). The module is also equipped with a protective shield in the front projection, which hints at the lack of adequate bulletproofing of the installation itself. The gunner controls the module using a joystick. The level of execution of the combat module suggests that it was produced in Ukraine by one of the defense enterprises already during the large-scale invasion. Its weapons are powerful enough to destroy light armored vehicles - Soviet BMP models or armored personnel carriers. However, in my opinion, it would be desirable to supplement the KPVT with a 7.62 mm machine gun for effective damage to manpower. At this time, it is not clear to me personally whether this armored car is a new production, or perhaps repaired after damage. However, the improvements were not limited to a new weapons module - the car also received a digital TV camera for the driver. The production of -Cossacks- continues. Yes, at the end of April with the participation of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov the transfer of 40 vehicles of this type to the 225th separate assault battalion took place at once (15 Kozak-2M1 and 25 Kozak-5). In my opinion, this is a very revealing event against the background of the failure of the German company to supply 400 ordered armored vehicles of the same class. Ukrainian manufacturers manage to increase production even under the conditions of war. This fact cannot help but infuriate our enemies, because photos from this event have already been posted on anti-Russian websites. - Over the years of service, -Cossacks- have become in demand in various units of the Defense Forces. - Indeed, the family of -Cossacks- continues to grow. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine in July notified about the codification of the medical evacuation armored car -Kozak-5MED-. Like the standard Kozak-5, it has a frame construction and uses the chassis of the Ford F550 pickup truck. The car is equipped with a 330 hp diesel engine. and automatic transmission. -Kozak-5MED- accommodates four wounded on stretchers, or six seated, as well as the driver and the personnel of the medical evacuation group. —The category of these machines for direct combat use continues to develop. What innovations are you aware of in this direction? — I would like to note that the Ukrainian Kozak-5 armored vehicles received a combat module from the company Escribano Mechanical &amp; Engineering for a 12.7-mm machine gun. The module has day and infrared cameras with autofocus, as well as a laser rangefinder. The combat module can automatically follow the target taking into account corrections and fire in several modes. — Protecting armored vehicles from combat drones today poses relevant challenges to the manufacturers and operators of BBM. What has been done to protect the crews of the armored vehicles we are discussing? - Recently, a message was published on the page of one of the domestic manufacturers about a new development - a set of protective anti-drone screens for the Kozak armored vehicles. As you can see from the photo, the design of the screens is well thought out and protects the car from all angles. It is reported that different versions of the kit developed are adapted to specific modifications of the Cossacks. The first 18 kits will be transferred to the 46th Separate Assault Brigade.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/29/kozaczkomu-rodu-nema-perevodu-yak-vdoskonalyuyut-bronovyk-kozak/	2024-11-28T21:04:35-08:00
50 thousand -British-, -The Sun- and death for Ukraine: what Valery Zaluzhnyi actually said at Inter...	The British government made this firm and factual statement on the occasion of the 1,000th day of the Russian Federation's large-scale attack on Ukraine. She quite worried the Russian propaganda, which tried to interrupt the information agenda. ArmiyaInform tells about how Russian propagandists tried to use the authority of the -Iron General- and now the Ambassador of Ukraine to Great Britain Valery Zaluzhny and the Western media with the aim of spreading anti-Ukrainian narratives. More than 50,000 Ukrainian military personnel have been trained within the framework of Operation Interflex, a training program for recruits with no or little military experience according to NATO standards on the territory of Great Britain. About reported in the Ministry of Defense of the United Kingdom. -The UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with our Ukrainian allies since day one of Putin's illegal full-scale invasion - providing international support, training 50,000 new recruits and supplying weapons, drones and other critical military equipment,- UK Defense Secretary John Gealey said. The press release of the Ministry of Defense of Great Britain was published on the occasion of 1000 days of large-scale war. It contains an assurance of the United Kingdom's unwavering support for Ukraine and a firm promise to help the Ukrainian people in their just struggle as much and as long as it is necessary. On the same day, British Deputy Defense Minister Luke Pollard together with Ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Valery Zaluzhny met with the Ukrainian military who are training on the territory of STANTA - Stanford Training Area in the county of Norfolk in the north east of england -The training of over 50,000 Ukrainian recruits on UK soil since the start of Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 is an achievement that cannot be overstated,- said Luke Pollard. During the meeting, Valery Zaluzhnyi addressed the Ukrainian military personnel undergoing training with a short motivational speech. He emphasized the importance of the training mission in Great Britain for the high-quality training of the Ukrainian military and urged them to learn the main things every soldier needs here. Valery Zaluzhny's speech was generally correctly reported by the well-known British media -The Sun-, although the publication about the address to the Ukrainian military came out with a somewhat provocative headline characteristic of a tabloid: -KILL OR BE KILLED. Watch how Ukrainian troops training in Great Britain are told to -kill without hesitation- in a moving speech by the former -Iron General-. Recruits of the heroic army of Ukraine must learn to kill Russians -without hesitation-, The Sun clarified the words of the former Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The publication cited a direct quote from Valery Zaluzhny's speech: -When you see the enemy, kill him before he tries to kill you or your comrade.- The Sun also published video report about the visit of high-ranking officials to the training base on the territory of STANTA. It also contains a video recording of Valery Zaluzhny's speech to Ukrainian soldiers, which allows you to hear exactly what he said in his address to the Ukrainian military. The -Iron General- began his speech by stating that modern warfare is becoming more brutal every day and leaves very little chance of survival on the battlefield. Valery Zaluzhny emphasized that fighters should learn not to be afraid of death and bravely look the enemy in the eye. It was these words that Russian propaganda tried to falsely present as a statement that Ukrainian fighters on the battlefield seem to face only inevitable death and the only thing they should learn is the absence of fear of imminent death. This is how the Russians tried to devalue Great Britain's undeniable colossal contribution to Ukraine's support, including the training and full equipping of more than 50,000 soldiers. To promote a false thesis, the Russians traditionally resorted to the usual propaganda techniques - pulling out of context, focusing on a part of the information and silencing everything else, manipulative statements and appeals to the authority of the Western media - this time they massively referred to -The Sun-. Instead, by looking at the video recording and the full text of Valery Zaluzhny's speech, it is not difficult to make sure that he was talking about completely different things that are completely unfavorable to Russian propaganda. He called the main tasks during training in Great Britain the need to learn how to survive on the battlefield, to take care of one's own safety and to save one's comrades, and to carry out a combat mission by killing the enemy without any extra thought. The -Iron General- urged not to die, but to kill for Ukraine and to survive himself and to help a comrade in arms survive. After all, to be ready to die for the Ukrainian people does not at all mean to be doomed to death, and death should be accepted first of all by the Russian occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/29/50-tysyach-brytancziv-the-sun-i-smert-za-ukrayinu-pro-shho-naspravdi-skazav-valerij-zaluzhnyj-na-interflex/	2024-11-28T20:37:40-08:00
The Ministry of Defense reported what new specializations appeared in military universities	The Department of Military Education and Science of the Ministry of Defense informed ArmiyaInform about this. -According to the decisions of the leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and on the basis of detailed applications for the training of military specialists with higher education, sent by customers for the training of military specialists, new specializations have been introduced since 2024: -International cooperation in the field of defense and the military sphere-, -Management of the actions of units marine unmanned systems (complexes)-, -Operation and repair of marine unmanned systems (complexes),- the agency said.

the Russians mirror their crimes: they invented a fake about looting in Kurshchyna	Yes, now they are reproducing a photo of a box with allegedly Russian products that fighters in the Kharkiv region received. Such a gift was apparently given to them by the military 154 OMBr from the Kursk region. However, this is not true. Ukrainian names of products are visible in the photo, they are not sold in the Kursk region. These photos were probably taken by Ukrainian volunteers to report on the aid given to the Defense Forces. Such fakes are aimed both at the domestic Russian consumer, to whom they are trying to prove that it is the norm for any military to rob stores, that it is not only the soldiers of Putin's army who do it, and at the Ukrainian, to whom the enemy is trying to show that the Armed Forces have problems with provision	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/29/rosiyany-viddzerkalyuyut-svoyi-zlochyny-vygadaly-fejk-pro-maroderstvo-na-kurshhyni/	2024-11-28T20:07:32-08:00

Volodymyr Zelenskyi: Putin is brandishing his -oreshnik- to frustrate Donald Trump's efforts	President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi said this in his evening address. -He can wave his -nutcracker- now only in order to frustrate President Trump's efforts, which will definitely take place after the inauguration. Putin wants to escalate the situation now so that President Trump will not be able to end the war,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. The president added that today in Kazakhstan, Putin again advertised his missiles — his readiness to kill and destroy. -Putin obviously wants to add thousands more to the thousands of missiles that have already hit Ukraine. He does not need the end of this war. Moreover, Putin wants to prevent others from ending this war,- the head of state said. He emphasized that Putin is the only culprit of this war and the only one who believes in the war. And that is why Putin's escalation now is a pressure to later force the US president to agree to Russia's terms. As ArmiyaInform reported, on November 21, the Russians hit the Dnipro with a new medium-range ballistic missile based on the older Rubezh ICBM, which is a potential carrier of a nuclear warhead. GUR IOU reported that Russia struck by using a ballistic missile, probably from the -Kedr- missile complex. The flight time of this Russian missile from the moment of launch in the Astrakhan region to the impact in the city of Dnipro was 15 minutes. Six combat units were installed on the rocket: each one was equipped with six sub-munitions. The speed on the final part of the trajectory is more than Mach 11. As of October of this year, Russia was supposed to produce two experimental rocket samples from the -Kedr- missile complex. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/28/volodymyr-zelenskyj-putin-rozmahuye-svoyim-oryeshnikom-shhob-zirvaty-zusyllya-donalda-trampa/	2024-11-28T09:50:19-08:00

Fighter -Luna- took part in contact battles in Maryinka and met with 9 enemy FPV drones	An interview with himappearedon the unit page. -After training in training centers, our recruits undergo additional training already in the combat zone. Combat training, says the sergeant, is constant and systematic work on oneself. And it is impossible to achieve perfection in it. Because war changes every day. That's why training never stops,- the paratroopers said. How to act in the most difficult situations and under fire, how to move during the operation of enemy attack and reconnaissance drones - all this -Luna- knows not from books, but from its own, real, experience. And shares it with those who go into battle. -When we entered Maryinka, it was already difficult there. The hardest thing was not to hold the position, but to get in and out of it. Everyone mostly moved along the roads. Wherever possible, they went around houses and foundations, but mostly it was roads, and they were shot at, birds are constantly flying, constant resets,- said -Luna-. He remembered how once he and the boys left the position with two three hundredths, and the Russians, who were 154 meters away, opened fire on them. -We helped ours, ours helped ours, and it turned out as it should. Sitting with three hundred all day is not an option. And they started running. So they ran from funnel to funnel, to the first foundation, to the first building. It's hard,- he shared his memories. The paratrooper also described his first encounter with enemy FPV drones. -9 FPVs flew to us in 15 minutes. There was a structure, and a hole was punched at the bottom and, as in a dugout, a descent into the basement. And we started jumping in there, miraculously without loss. This was my first experience with these FPVs. We were used to resets then, and here half the house is gone. -Mainly the loss is due to the fact that people are not trained,- he emphasized. According to him, in order to save life, one must constantly learn. -Luna- works every day with those who join the ranks of the Tavrian paratroopers. Earlier, ArmiyaInform told about the story of a fighter with the call sign -Prytsyl-. He fights in the drone battalion air complexes of the Perun Group of the 79th Tavrian Assault Brigade.

The President signed a draft law on the permission to return to military service for those who first...	The relevant information is indicated in the bill card on the site of the Verkhovna Rada . The document stipulates that during the period of martial law, military service and the validity of the contract will continue for military servicemen who voluntarily left military units or places of service for the first time or deserted and voluntarily arrived at the place of service and expressed their willingness to continue military service.

Combined strike of the Russian Federation: the Air Force of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of ...	This was reported by the Air Force of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. -The enemy attacked critical infrastructure — electrical substations in various regions of Ukraine. Unfortunately, there is a hit,- the message reads. In addition to cruise missiles three guided air missiles and 35 enemy UAVs were shot down, more than 60 were lost in location. A total of 12 hits were recorded, mainly at the facilities of the fuel and energy sector. The PS of the Armed Forces reported that recently, during air attacks, the enemy has been using a large number of missiles and drones. Their massive use in certain directions often exceeds the number of means of cover. In addition, the enemy uses modern means of air attack, constantly improving them. It is about the firing of thermal and radar traps, and also uses EW means of personal protection installed directly on the missiles. -All this significantly complicates the operation of Soviet-made anti-aircraft missile systems that are in service with the Air Force. Western systems work much more effectively in such conditions, which in Ukraine are not sufficient to reliably cover hundreds of critical infrastructure facilities. That is why, during massive enemy attacks, maximum forces and means are used, including aviation, electronic warfare, anti-aircraft defense and mobile fire groups,- the Air Force said. It is also noted that on the eve of attacks, the enemy takes into account meteorological conditions, which significantly affect the work of mobile fire groups and fighter aircraft. Dense fog and cloud cover, which were observed in many regions at the time of the attack, did not allow the pilots and calculations of the MVG to effectively perform their tasks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/28/kombinovanyj-udar-rf-povitryani-syly-zsu-rozpovily-detali-ta-naslidky-vorozhoyi-ataky/	2024-11-28T04:14:00-08:00

500 rubles for the Internet: privileges for selected people in the forgotten cities of the occupied ...	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. The local population lives without electricity, water supply and heating. The promises of the occupiers to restore public services, which were last made in the fall of 2023, were never fulfilled. There is practically no transport connection with Lysychansk, which makes the life of local residents even more difficult. The Internet in these cities is available only to the chosen ones: representatives of the occupation authorities and the military of the Russian Federation. In Rubizhny, for 500 rubles per hour, you can connect to the WI-FI network only in a special facility available to Russian military personnel.

Voyyskovyi also explained the significance of Liptsi for the defense of Kharkiv. — As for Liptsi, their geographical position is a very strategic settlement, on its outskirts there are operational heights that, if God forbid, will be lost, then this will give a direct view of the city of Kharkiv itself and the approaches to it. This will make our logistics very difficult. If the enemy starts to use direct strikes with artillery systems, it will be very difficult for us to move, to store our ammunition, - explained the fighter with the call sign -Cat-. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast the enemy is -covered- by fog, but artificial intelligence helps to detect it, the -Charter- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine carried out a successful offensive and is entrenched in new positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/28/pidnimayetsya-voda-v-unikalnij-misczevosti-na-pivnochi-harkivshhyny-zahysnyky-protystoyat-okupantam-i-pryrodi/	2024-11-27T23:37:46-08:00

Trump, Putin and more than 220 clashes per day: an expert explains why the front is getting even hot...	Why the number of enemy assaults has increased so significantly, military expert Petro Chernyk explained to ArmiyaInform. -This is connected with major geopolitics. Putin set two clear and understandable tasks. The first task: before Trump's inauguration, seize Donetsk region at any cost, and similarly, before Trump's inauguration, knock us out of Kursk region at any cost. Does the enemy have the human potential for this? Unfortunately, there is. The total mobilization resource is within 3 million people. This is very, very much. The average figures of their conscription are somewhere in the range of up to 40,000 personnel per month. And I think that in this proportion they will continue to train themselves. Do they still have a certain margin of strength, say, in terms of armored vehicles? Let's look at the example of tanks. At the beginning of the large-scale invasion, they had 3,400 full-time vehicles, but there were still up to 10,000 in warehouses at that time, which is quite a lot. And part of the equipment we destroyed, the enemy managed to restore. Approximately the same applies to artillery. We have already destroyed more than 20,000 units. But they may still have 3,000-5,000 barrels of all calibers. However, we must understand that they cannot and will not be able to build a full-fledged artillery. The comprehensive margin of strength, which is currently calculated for the Russian Federation, is somewhere within the limits until the summer of next year. And then the real problems of both military and economic nature will begin. That is why the Russians set themselves the goal of seizing as much of our territory as possible and knocking them out of Kurshchyna. This is all we need to understand why the number of armed clashes has increased. It is extremely important for us to stay in the Kursk region until the summer, until the next cycle of dry weather. And it is extremely important that we retain Donetsk region also for the summer of next year. Then our positions in a potential conversation through intermediaries will be much stronger.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/28/tramp-putin-ta-ponad-220-boyezitknen-za-dobu-ekspert-poyasnyuye-chomu-na-fronti-staye-shhe-garyachishe/	2024-11-27T21:07:46-08:00
Soldier Mykhailiuk destroyed an enemy tank from an almost unreal distance. The history of the defend...	In civilian life, he was a builder, a loader, in the position of foreman. Currently, he is performing combat tasks as part of the calculation of anti-tank missile systems. His comrades say that he quickly navigates in extreme situations and has already destroyed more than 10 units of enemy military equipment and weapons. ArmyImform succinctly asked soldier Mykhailiuk about his path to the Defense Forces, his participation in the war, and, therefore, the approaching victory over the enemy. — I ended up in the army at a time when the long queues at the TCC stopped, and you could come calmly to the reception. On April 18, he arrived at the TCC, passed the medical examination, and already on the 19th, he left for Desna, the soldier recalls. Next is basic military training. — I already served in the army in 2008-2009 as a conscript. Therefore, I remembered, so to speak, what was once. Passed everything I knew. Nothing new. But they taught about radio communication, special devices. Everything happened in an abbreviated form. It was not difficult for me. All in all, there was plenty. The most vivid memory during the BZVP is scary, but interesting, says the soldier. — There was rocket fire, evacuation of a military unit. I was the driver - I was there -to and from- our outermost soldier from our battery. We assumed that there could be another shelling of the military unit, but, despite all the threats, we got fuel, made several walkers, took out all the people and all the things. The military destroyed more than 10 units of enemy equipment and weapons. We ask the soldier to recall the most vivid case when he managed to work on enemy equipment. Each destroyed enemy vehicle, the military officer states, is both -greasy- and -delicious.- But in October 2023, it was -as fat and tasty as possible.- — Then it was both dangerous and most interesting to beat them. Because there were so many of them, and because of that it was easy to beat them. But we had a connection, although the Russians thought that they had jammed it for us. We were completely controlled by the company. The commander was in constant contact with us. We knew how many enemy vehicles were coming. Yes, they already came in 3 pairs of deuces, 2 pairs of deuces&#8230; And we could already work for them, since we had the calculation of -Stugna- and their trophy -Cornet-, then we had a chance to do everything right. Therefore, their -Cornet- repulsed the attack. So we knew how to destroy them more easily and quickly, and that we would not get anything for it. There was excitement, it made sense to choose (enemy equipment.— Ed.). For example, 2 tanks, 2 BMPs and a trawl drove in. We immediately had the urge to destroy the trawl so that it did not pave the way for our infantry. We didn't let them get up,'' the army man recalls. But after that, he says, the enemy launched a powerful shelling with artillery and aviation: - There was a fire, it was burning, everything was in smoke, we had to change positions. But they failed to destroy us. Each combat exit and each launch is the brightest that can be, the soldier does not hide his emotions: - Nice exit, nice hit. The most interesting thing was when we destroyed their observation post. Then we had to go through a forest strip in the Swativ district, about 5 kilometers. It was approximately three kilometers through the gray zone and 2 kilometers through the red zone. They approached them, 2 km from the enemy observation post, and destroyed it. Later, he says, there was training on enemy tanks: - They came from closed positions and constantly gave nightmares to the infantry at different times. We found an enemy tank, but we couldn't get to it, it wasn't coming any closer. So we came as close as we could to get it anyway. It was a distance of 5200 - almost unreal. He was standing far from the line of scrimmage. And we destroyed him with a javelin. It was a good shot, and the detonated tank burned to the ground. Only the sides remain, and I think it is still there. We ask whether a soldier is afraid during such combat sorties, and if so, how does he cope with this fear: - Fear is in every person. But we have harmony, the commander constantly helps us. We know where we are going, what we are doing, what awaits us. That is, there is no fear as such. But when you perform a combat mission, fear disappears altogether. Yes, when they give you a short briefing and show you what you have to do, yes, there can be some fear. And when you already get into that zone, have already entered, there is no such fear at all. The mood is always fighting - in all boys, not only in me. And what would an army officer advise civilians who, for various reasons, have not yet joined the ranks of the Defense Forces? — There is nothing to be afraid of the army: there are shelling all over the country. And the sooner recruits join the army, the better it will be for our country, and the sooner we will defeat the onslaught of the horde, says Oleksandr. The military dreams of the borders of 1991: — But initially victory is when we stop the Russians and the shelling of our cities stops. And in the future, I am sure that we will reach our borders in 1991.

Blasters are already on the agenda: in the Republic of Korea, they are thinking about arming the tro...	How informs the Army Recognition portal, during the work of the international defense exhibition KADEX 2024, which took place in the Republic of Korea and united the leading players of the global arms and security industry, the development of the local firm LIG Nex1, the newest laser rifle, attracted the attention of visitors, ArmyInform reports. The manufacturing company is positioning its latest creation, which has not yet been named, as a rifle designed specifically for modern combat conditions. This compact and lightweight weapon, equipped with advanced technology, offers not only high power but also stealth, making it ideal for military operations where efficiency and stealth are important. -The rifle produces an extremely low noise level, which allows soldiers to remain invisible during operations. In addition, the low-noise cooling system maintains the optimal temperature of the weapon, preventing overheating during prolonged use,- Army Recognition experts said. Designed for easy operation by individual soldiers, the LIG Nex1 laser rifle features advanced technologies such as non-line-of-sight (NLOS) laser generation. This ability allows the fighter armed with it to hit targets that are not directly visible on the battlefield, providing a tactical advantage in the confrontation with the enemy, especially in difficult conditions where visibility is limited. Featuring high-power laser technology (one kilowatt level), this rifle combines lightness and power, offering soldiers increased efficiency without sacrificing maneuverability. Its discretion and effectiveness make this weapon an essential tool for operations that require precision and stealth. At the same time, official data on the capabilities of the laser rifle are not disclosed. The product at the exhibition was equipped with an adjustable stock, bipods and an optical sight. Shin Ik Hyun, CEO of LIG Nex1, expressed optimism about the impact of KADEX 2024 solutions. -We hope that the solutions presented at this exhibition will not only strengthen the military potential of the Republic of Korea, but also contribute to the expansion of the global presence of K-defense (South Korean arms industry),- said the Korean businessman. Founded in 1976, LIG ​​Nex1 is a South Korean company specializing in the development and production of advanced weapons systems. It offers a wide range of defense products, from precision munitions to electronic warfare systems, drones and tactical communications systems. LIG Nex1, based in Yeonin, Republic of Korea, is a major supplier to the South Korean military and also exports its technology around the world.

The Kremlin spreads the thesis that Ukraine has already lost the war: for what purpose	This was noted by the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security. His specialists found out that The National Interest is owned by Dmitry Simes, who actively supports Russian propaganda. After 2022, he is in the Russian Federation and is accused by the US Department of Justice of violating sanctions, which carries a sentence of up to 60 years in prison. The publication has long been associated with pro-Russian views, and Symes himself moderated events organized by the Kremlin and received funding from Russian state structures. This message aims to undermine faith in the Victory of Ukraine and encourages citizens to doubt their country's ability to continue the struggle. Such rhetoric also helps to create the illusion that aid to Ukraine is futile in order to discourage Western powers from providing arms and financial support. In this way, Symes justifies further crimes by the Russians, while at the same time creating the appearance of strength and invincibility of the Russian regime for a domestic audience.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/28/kreml-poshyryuye-tezu-shho-ukrayina-vzhe-prograla-vijnu-z-yakoyu-metoyu/	2024-11-27T20:03:57-08:00

The largest center for wounded soldiers of the RECOVERY national network has opened in Chernivtsi	Today, the center is the largest in the RECOVERY network, which Viktor and Olena Pinchuka founded to help the Security and Defense Forces. The RECOVERY project is an example of a successful partnership between the private sector and the state, when philanthropists create innovative rehabilitation centers on the basis of public medical institutions. The new center is designed for 61 beds, which makes it the largest in the RECOVERY national network today. The state-of-the-art center is built on three floors of one of the key medical facilities in Bukovyna. During a meeting with the military at the newly opened center, the founder of the RECOVERY project, Viktor Pinchuk, remarked: — Do you know what I felt at this, the 15th, RECOVERY center? How much it is necessary to do everything now so that our defenders realize: the state, society and the private sector value them, now they are literally our VIPs, because the most important for the state are those who are just now at the front, and those who goes to the front - and also added: - We do everything according to the highest global standards, and there is hope that we set them for everyone: the state, other philanthropists, foreign partners. That is, the standard will be all over the country. The center was equipped according to world standards of inclusivity and technology, providing the highest level of rehabilitation for our soldiers. The complex of simulators and devices covers the entire range of possible functional disorders, in particular injuries resulting from mine and explosive injuries. Physical rehabilitation rooms are equipped with virtual reality (VR) equipment that provides feedback to the patient. Such equipment contributes to the gamification of rehabilitation processes, which, in turn, increases the intensity of training and accelerates the recovery of patients. Task-oriented exercises add motivation, and built-in analysis programs allow you to effectively monitor the patient's condition and evaluate the results of rehabilitation. In addition to VR technologies, the list of equipment equipped with the center includes bobat and massage systems, rehabilitation complexes for limbs, simulators for balance correction, joint mobilization and sling therapy. Like other centers of the chain, RECOVERY in Chernivtsi is equipped with the requirements of inclusivity of premises: wide doorways, no thresholds, medical anti-slip flooring, handrails in the corridors, sanitary rooms for people in wheelchairs and showers with seats and handrails. On the first floor of the rehabilitation center there are rooms for physical rehabilitation (large and small), an occupational therapy room, as well as rooms for physiotherapy, laser therapy, assistive technologies, psychotherapy (group and individual) and a speech therapist. In addition, there are two massage rooms, staff rooms, inventory and pharmacy rooms. The second and third floors are reserved for 22 rooms: 4 single rooms, 6 double rooms, 3 three-room rooms and 9 four-room rooms. Each ward is equipped with functional beds, inclusive bathrooms and comfortable furniture. In addition, the floors are equipped with medical stations, dining rooms and treatment rooms, which ensure comfort and quality medical care for patients. Chernivtsi OVA also joined the creation of the center in Chernivtsi, allocating funds from the regional budget, as well as territorial communities of the region. This made it possible to arrange the roof, the entrance group according to accessibility norms and to insulate the premises. — Thanks to the work of a powerful multidisciplinary team and modern equipment, we expect not only a doubling of the possibilities of providing rehabilitation assistance, but also a high level of its provision. Today, it is extremely important that the military personnel who defend our country receive timely rehabilitation assistance, - noted Vitaliy Polataychuk, head of the medical institution on the basis of which the RECOVERY center operates in Chernivtsi. RECOVERY's multidisciplinary teams consist of physical rehabilitation medicine specialists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, massage therapists, assistants, speech and language therapists, and psychologists. An individual rehabilitation plan is developed here for each injured person, and thanks to innovative equipment, patients receive high-quality and evidence-based rehabilitation care at the highest level. RECOVERY is a national network of rehabilitation centers for wounded soldiers. Today, in addition to Chernivtsi, RECOVERY rehabilitation centers provide free services in Kyiv (two facilities), Lviv, Chernivtsi, Rivne, Lutsk, Vinnytsia, Cherkassy, ​​Poltava, Khmelnytskyi, Odesa (two facilities) and in the Dnipro region (three facilities).

Medical collapse and cold batteries: the realities of Luhansk region after the occupation	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. According to him, residents of the region, from Kreminnaya to Sorokino, are forced to turn to medical facilities in Luhansk. The situation is complicated by the lack of doctors, especially narrow-profile specialists, which leads to the formation of long queues. In Seversko-Donetsk, problems with centralized heat supply continue. The occupation administration promises to provide heating only in the houses located near the STKE boiler house, but even in these areas, not all apartments have heat. Due to the mass absence of residents in many houses, technical difficulties arise with the supply of heat, which confirms the absence of the promised return of people to the city. As of the end of November, most of the high-rise buildings in Seversko-Donetsk remain without heating. As reported by ArmyInform, opening of a -patriotic education center- in occupied Siverskodonetsk , which the Russian occupiers planned for September 1, is postponed again. The reason for this was the delay in repair work due to the embezzlement of funds.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/medychnyj-kolaps-i-holodni-batareyi-realiyi-luganshhyny-pislya-okupacziyi/	2024-11-27T05:31:44-08:00

The enemy attack aircraft successfully survived being hit by our drone because it hid behind a tree. It was behind him that the Russian hid further, all the time looking at the sky to see if a new drone was flying. The invader was so engrossed in the air defense game that he forgot about our infantry. That is why he received a bullet in the head, which spared him the painful wait for a meeting with our aerial scouts.

Oleksandr, the spokesman of the Third Assault Brigade, told about this on the -Suspilne Novosti- broadcast. Borodin According to Oleksandr Borodin, mass armored assaults from the Russians are not being observed. All because the fighters of the Third Assault Brigade learned quite well how to destroy the mechanized formations of the enemy even on the approaches. The enemy usually does not take risks with technology. -I think that it is one thing to restore even infantry regiments, and another thing to restore 3-4 T-90 tanks. Because they abandon the infantry, as usual, and try to save the equipment,- Oleksandr Borodin said. As reported ArmyInform, in the north of the Kharkiv region, in the Liptsi district, Ukrainian troops are entrenched in new, won positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/legshe-vidnovyty-polk-pihoty-nizh-kilka-tankiv-t-90-na-harkivshhyni-vpered-kydayut-zasudzhenyh-i-novomobilizovanyh/	2024-11-27T05:03:50-08:00

And still he hit, although, probably, not with the consequences he was counting on. Then began the hunt for enemy vehicles that exploded and burned. -The Kursk benefit: the occupiers feel like the stars of a blockbuster - they are blown up day and night.

AviaHerostrat — in Kirovohrad Oblast, a Russian agent wanted to leave a military airfield without el...	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on November 27. The detainee turned out to be a 21-year-old local resident who was remotely recruited by the FSB in August 2024. The young man came to the attention of the occupiers because of his pro-Kremlin comments in the Telegram channels of the aggressor country. To perform -verification- tasks, the agent collected information about the technical condition of power plants, as well as monitored the locations of military hospitals and TCC buildings. The traitor transmitted the received information to his Russian curator via messenger in the form of text messages and marking objects on Google maps. Later, the agent received a new task: to penetrate the territory of the key power station of the region and set it on fire with a flammable mixture, and then extinguish the fire. In the event of the destruction of the power facility, the occupiers promised their henchmen a monetary reward of 200 thousand. Russian rubles. SBU employees exposed the traitor in time, documented his crimes and arrested him -red-handed- when he was conducting reconnaissance near the target. At the same time, comprehensive measures were taken to secure the locations of the Defense Forces in the areas of the agent's intelligence activity. At the place of detention, a mobile phone with an anonymous chat in the messenger, which he used to communicate with the FSB, was seized from him. Investigators of the Security Service informed the defendant of the suspicion under part. 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law).

Capture or suicide: the ZSU described a portrait of a typical Russian with a white flag	Lt. Col. Nazar Voloshyn, spokesman for the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, said this in a comment to ArmyInform. According to him, most of the Russian prisoners are newly mobilized. Many of them have recently undergone training on training grounds, and some are involved in assault operations and conducting reconnaissance of Ukrainian positions. Previously, a significant part of the prisoners were former prisoners who, in exchange for amnesty, joined the ranks of the Russian army, but now their number has decreased - many of them will no longer be able to return to the battlefield. In some cases, there are special forces soldiers among the prisoners. However, in general, the Russian army compensates for losses by recruiting people with financial difficulties - many new recruits and mobilized are motivated by promises of money to pay off debts or mortgages. In the Kupyan direction, as Lt. Col. Nazar Voloshyn noted, Russian units are replenished mainly with prisoners and mobilized. At the same time, cases of suicide among the occupiers due to fear of being captured were recorded. This is the result of Russian propaganda, which spreads lies about brutal torture by Ukrainians. Despite this, the zone of responsibility of the -Khortytsia- OSU is marked by numerous cases of surrender. One of the latest is the story of a Russian soldier who surrendered, saying that -it is better to live in captivity than to die at the hands of his commanders.- He reported that the Russian command threatened him with reprisals for refusing to follow orders. According to Nazar Voloshin, such cases demonstrate the demoralization of the Russian military and the complexity of the situation in their ranks. As reported by ArmyInform, -occupiers turned Bakhmut to a logistics hub-: warehouses and hospitals were placed in the city.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/polon-chy-samogubstvo-u-zsu-opysaly-portret-typovogo-rosiyanyna-z-bilym-praporom/	2024-11-27T03:15:37-08:00

This is the point of temporary deployment of the 98th Airborne Division and the 3rd Army Corps. -The city with its mines became a kind of logistics hub for the occupiers. Due to the fact that there are mines and fortifications there, the enemy has placed ammunition, equipment, as well as warehouses with fuel and lubricants there. There is also information that the occupiers have deployed field hospitals in the mines,- said Nazar Voloshyn.

Attack -Kedrom-: the expert explained why Putin hit the Dnipro	Oleksandr Musienko, manager, told about this on the broadcast of the -Edyny Novyny- marathon. of the Center for Military Legal Studies. According to Oleksandr Musienko, the Russian dictator's threats are truly unprecedented - this type of weaponry was not used even during the Cold War. However, the Russian dictator still fears a conflict with NATO. -The strike was on the city of Dnipro, that is, away from the borders directly with the North Atlantic Alliance. He did not hit the west of our country, and the missile did not fly there. That is, he was still wary and afraid of provoking a certain reaction from the West,- Oleksandr Musienko is confident. This proves that the launch of a new ballistic missile, states Musienko, is nothing but another element of the Russian dictator's nuclear blackmail. Earlier ArmyInform told that as of October of this year, Russia was supposed to produce two experimental rocket samples from the Kedr missile complex.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/ataka-kyedrom-ekspert-poyasnyv-chomu-putin-udaryv-same-po-dnipru/	2024-11-27T01:17:34-08:00

Propagandists launched an anti-Ukrainian article in the media: why are they in Greece?	On November 26, the site -Banking news- with a reach of 6.5 million users in Greece published article with just a wild set of Russian narratives. It is dedicated to the so-called -Ukrainian nationalist battalions -Azov-, -Aidar-, -Kraken- and others-, the destruction of which, in the opinion of Greek propagandists this time, is -one of the main goals of the Russian invasion of Ukraine-. In the material, the Greek pseudo-journalists quote the sanctioned ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Spyridon Kilinkarov, Russian military analysts Oleksandr Sharkovsky and Oleksandr Perendzhiev. They accuse units of the Armed Forces of various war crimes typical of daily Russian propaganda. The material was obviously made at the behest of Russia and is spreading through the Greek-speaking segment of the Internet with the clear aim of discrediting Ukraine, the Defense Forces of our country and specific units. Such publications are made to undermine the confidence of foreigners in Ukraine and to reduce their support. In October, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, and the Prime Minister of Greece, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, signed the Security Cooperation Agreement in Brussels, which confirms Greece's readiness to continue providing the most urgent defense needs of Ukraine.

Will South Korea enter the war on the side of Ukraine: expert's opinion	-At the beginning of November, everyone admitted that the North Korean military was on the territory of the Russian Federation and may even have taken part in hostilities. We had first very cautious assessments, then we had positive assessments. Now we will receive them in doses, because this information still has a great political and diplomatic weight. Therefore, it will not appear quickly. Some will try to hide it, but we will try to get it as soon as possible, use it as soon as possible. The question now will be whether international institutions are ready to do something about it. As we can see from the latest reaction of most international organizations, unfortunately, they are not ready to act according to even their own statutes. That is, how they should react to Russian aggression, how they should react to Iran's actions, how they should react to North Korea's actions, no one is reacting. Therefore, now the North Korea factor, most likely, will be the catalyst that the world order that exists, those interstate organizations that exist, will be forced to change their approaches to events and to their activities. As for the reaction of other countries, in particular, South Korea, here it is necessary to know their military doctrine, how it should react to North Korea's indirect aggression against another state. But we are already seeing the -first swallows- appearing in the international space. We know that North Korea will also demand the participation of a Russian contingent in a possible war against South Korea. I don't think South Korea is very excited about that prospect. After all, the Russian army is absolutely different. There are units that we despise, but there are also units that give us a huge amount of trouble. And South Korea, the United States of America, and NATO also understand this very well. So the activity of other countries will depend on how well their doctrinal documents correspond to the existing situation, on the one hand, and on the other hand, how ready the military-political leadership of other countries is to react to the situation that is emerging.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/chy-vstupyt-pivdenna-koreya-u-vijnu-na-boczi-ukrayiny-dumka-eksperta/	2024-11-26T21:07:20-08:00
More than 150 shots per day: CAESAR crushes Russians in Donetsk region. Reportage	We arrive at the specified point, where the gunners are already waiting for us. Just like us, in body armor and helmets. Because it can already fly here. - Follow us. We pull into the position, unload, our car drives away. Then you stop by. Here the safety rules are written in blood, so it is better not to break them. Let's go. We will drive past the mines. Some were destroyed by the arrivals, others continue to work, despite the approach of the front. From time to time, towering tericonas are visible from the road. Fields between them. The harvest from them has been collected, but the winter crops have not been planted. Apparently, local farmers are waiting for what will be here in the spring. The road is getting worse, there are more and more potholes, as well as tracks of heavy equipment. We turn around at one of the landings, drive through the field. The front car stops, passengers get out of it, the car starts. Next, we will land. We enter the landing, among the trees we see the CAESAR self-propelled gun, hidden under a canopy made of a metal mesh, on which a camouflage net is draped. We are met by the gun crew. Her commander, sergeant Andrii, is of medium height and wiry. He has a phone and a tablet, necessary for combat work, sticking out behind the automatic stores on his body armor. We welcome you. Andrei says that he is waiting for the goal. If we're lucky and the target is there, we'll go to the fireground and see CAESAR in action. Meanwhile, Andriy talks about his gun. — Before that, I fought on the Soviets: -Hyacinti-B-, D-20, -Vsti-B- and I can say that CAESAR, if compared with them, is like -Mercedes- and -Zhiguli-. - What is its greatest advantage? - It is maneuverable. On CAESAR, you arrive at the firing line, lay down in a minute, quickly work and drive away, and you don’t wait to see if it will fly in response or not, as is the case with trailed guns. And it's coming fast now. Both -Lancets- and FPV drones began to fly far, and enemy artillery, and now also KABs were added. So speed becomes an important advantage. - And what, do you actually have time to spread out in a minute? - You will see for yourself if there is a goal. In this regard, CAESAR works clearly. We arrived at the place, the gunner entered the coordinates, so we are ready to shoot. - And what was the highest rate of fire you had in practice? - The same as in TTX, 6 shots per minute. You can't do it faster than the manufacturer's set, because there are a lot of sensors that you can't fool. But there is no need, because here everything is done for the safety of shooting. And conveniences. The same automatic loader helps a lot, because you don't need to stuff the shells with your hands, and they weigh a lot. Once our CAESAR was under repair and we were working on a domestic gun. I manually loaded 18 rounds and tore a muscle in my stomach. So, if offered, would never change CAESAR to anything else. CAESAR has a crew of four. According to French standards, there should be 5 of them, but then it is too cramped in the cabin, which for the crew is their native home, especially now that it has become cold. They joke that they take off their shoes when they enter the cabin. — When I worked at the towed artillery, we had to constantly dig dugouts nearby so that there was a place to live and hide during shelling. CAESAR with its armored cabin is much more comfortable in this sense. - Have there been such approaches when the armor protected? Ironically, it is at this very moment that a rather loud -babah- is heard. Whether it's a departure or an arrival, I involuntarily bend over, the gunners just look around. — Once a -Lancet- flew at us, hit the roller. We had minor injuries, one of the hoses broke, but the car was not damaged, the damage was quickly repaired and we continued to work. Andriy and his crew work on the older version of CAESAR (produced in 2007), they say that they would not like to switch to the new one. — Because the new one is much larger: there are four axles instead of three, it is longer and higher, it is difficult to hide it in the landing, you have to dig a much larger caponir, and it is not so maneuverable. And there are much more electronics there, which increases the probability of some kind of breakdown. Of course, something can break in us too, because we work actively, and this is iron, it is not eternal. But we repair something on the spot, our repairmen trained in France work with something, and the enterprise that provides maintenance is already engaged in serious repairs. - There is a stereotype that Western equipment is too poor for the conditions of our war. - It all depends on service. If it's serviced well, it works well. CAESAR is a gentle machine. But if you take care of it correctly, follow all the rules for maintenance, then it works well. Andriy finally gets the coordinates of the target. — Two shells, we are working to ban actions. This is when enemy activity is detected, fire is placed on that area to force them to abandon their plans. — We are leaving for the firing position! The crew gets into the cockpit, the CAESAR quickly moves out of hiding and heads to the pre-equipped firing position. There are several such positions, they are constantly changed to confuse the enemy and prevent him from hitting. According to Andrii, his CAESAR often takes part in counter-battery combat, that is, strikes at enemy artillery. — We work on absolutely everything: from jet artillery to barrel artillery. We worked against both -Hyacinta- and -Msty-, we reach everything. We also hit mortars, anti-aircraft guns, even anti-aircraft systems. In the Vugledara area, they once worked on the Strela air defense system. It is clear that we are hitting and being hit, so we need to act quickly. CAESAR unexpectedly pulls into a forest strip. At first it seems that it is going straight to the trees, but then you notice a carefully cut gap in the wall of the trunks. CAESAR fits perfectly into it and falls under the arch of trees that cover from above. The crew leaves the cabin. The gunner turns on the computer and lowers the hydraulic plate, which provides a stop during firing. The driver prepares the gunpowder needed to hit the targets, and the loader programs the detonators, which are wound onto the projectile. The gun commander dictates the coordinates of the target, the gunner enters them into the computer. The barrel of the gun is raised and aimed. The branches in front of him are cut so as not to interfere with the projectile. CAESAR is ready to fire in exactly one minute. Second to second. - Fire! — Shot! If it wasn't for the headphones, it would have been very loud. The next projectile is already on the loading machine, which delivers it into the barrel of the gun. Followed by gunpowder, shutter closes. - Fire! — Shot! Another -babah-. Already dry leaves begin to fall picturesquely from the trees. However, the crew is not into romance. The plate rises, the barrel lowers, the computer near the gun turns off. And now CAESAR is rapidly leaving the firing position. The enemy has almost no chance to hit him in response. They just don't have time. —Mr. Andriy, what is the record for shots per day? — The maximum shot per day was 153 shots. But it is very difficult. Health minus 1. Now we are steadily firing 60 shells a day, sometimes up to 90. — But CAESAR ammunition is only 18 shells. — Yes. So we shot them, drove off and reloaded, we continue to work. — But 153 shells, that’s 9 rounds per day! — I mean, it’s difficult. — And how often do you have to change the barrel with such intensity of shooting? — It all depends on its condition. This barrel has already fired 4,000 rounds. But its condition is normal, we just take into account the correction for wear. We have such barrels that fired 6,000 shells each. Our specialists will check for wear, if it is significant, then the barrel is replaced with a new one provided by the French manufacturer. - This is the first barrel on your car? - What about you, the barrels of all the guns have already been changed three or even four times. Because we work every day, without days off. - And what is the maximum firing range? - We had 41 kilometers, it is an active-reactive projectile. Usually, we work on targets at a distance of 14 to 36 kilometers. - Have you been working with cluster ammunition for a long time? - Yes, a few days ago. We shoot them regularly. - What about the famous American -Excaliburs-? - Many used to work. And worked very well. In 2023, when the enemy was advancing on Vugledar in the winter, we fired 52 Excaliburs in one day. This is a very good projectile. Because if you work with ordinary projectiles, you need 2-3 shots for close range. And -excalibur- shot one - and it hit the target exactly. CAESAR returns to its hideout in the landing area, where it will await new targets. During the day, the guys can rest a bit, because most of their shooting is at night. I ask for permission to hold the projectile in my hands. It weighs over 40 kilograms. I take it in my hands and understand that, even with the presence of a charging mechanism, the work of the charger is not easy. We photograph the crew against the background of his car: Andriy is the commander, Yevgeny is the gunner, Kyrylo is the driver, Bohdan is the loader. For those who don't know, CAESAR is an acronym for the French CAmion Equipé d'un Système d'ARtillerie, meaning -truck equipped with an artillery system.- This truck causes a lot of trouble for the enemy and helps our infantry a lot. We wish the boys success and good luck in their difficult but necessary combat work. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/ponad-150-postriliv-za-dobu-caesar-troshhyt-rosiyan-na-donechchyni-reportazh/	2024-11-26T20:57:56-08:00
Autocivilka for UBD: what will change in 2025	According to article 13 of the Law, participants in hostilities, persons with disabilities as a result of the war, who personally drive their own vehicles, are exempted from mandatory civil liability insurance on the territory of Ukraine. That is, it is not necessary to issue anything. There must be documents for a car and a UBD certificate or a person with a disability due to war. But already from January 1, 2025, you will have to issue a driver's license. Article 13 of the Law suffered certain changes. And now there are no categories of citizens who are exempt from compulsory insurance. In return, combatants will receive a discount. In particular, for them, -the amount of the insurance premium under the domestic insurance contract is reduced by 50 percent.- But there are also certain nuances. The discount is provided for a vehicle that has an engine displacement of up to 2500 cubic centimeters or an electric motor power of up to and including 100 kilowatts and is owned by a combatant /strong>, provided that such vehicle is driven exclusively by the insured or by a person who also owns to preferential categories, and using a vehicle without the purpose of providing paid services for the transportation of passengers and/or cargo. Another important point is that the amendments to the Law indicate that the reduction of the insurance premium can be applied at the same time only regarding one vehicle of the insured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/avtoczyvilka-dlya-ubd-shho-zminytsya-u-2025-roczi/	2024-11-26T20:46:59-08:00
Seven years to the goal: in Turkey, the development of a mortar system with the possibility of 360° ...	As indicates the official portal of the manufacturer, this advanced system combines high accuracy, mobility and versatility, which makes it an effective weapon for various types of combat missions, ArmiyaInform reports. The SM-81 Keskin mortar is equipped with an 81 mm barrel with a length of 1.453 meters and a manual vertical slide. The system provides full circular horizontal firing (360 degrees) and an elevation range of −5 to +82 degrees, which is manually controlled by pointers. A hydropneumatic recoil system is installed above the barrel to soften recoil. Depending on the type of ammunition, the firing range is from 100 to 6,000 meters. Shots are fired through the trigger mechanism, which allows precise control of fire. The SM-81 Keskin mortar supports both direct and indirect guidance. For direct fire, the system is equipped with a six-fold day sight, a thermal imaging camera and a laser rangefinder, which ensures accuracy of aiming at distances up to 6 thousand. meters Experts of the defense portal Army Recognition note that when firing with an indirect with guidance, the system is loaded from the muzzle and supports two options for firing: the normal mode, when the projectile falls on the fixed trigger pin, and the trigger fire, in which the striker is activated by the trigger. If the angle of the barrel is less than 30 degrees when firing with a direct aim, the system allows loading from the breech, which expands its tactical capabilities. The SM-81 Keskin is compatible with various types of standard 81mm ammunition, including high-explosive, smoke, and illumination rounds. To improve shooting accuracy and simplify control, the system has a 10.1-inch screen that displays a digital map and ballistic calculations for elevation correction and horizontal guidance. In addition, GPS/INS technologies are implemented in the system, which ensure more accurate hitting of targets even in difficult conditions. The total weight of the mortar system is 450 kg, which allows it to be installed on light trucks for high mobility on the battlefield. The diameter of the system's pedestal is 770 mm, and its height varies from 1005 mm to 1980 mm depending on the position of the barrel. In addition to being mounted on vehicles, the SM-81 Keskin mortar can be used for stationary defense of bases or other key facilities. One of the main advantages of the SM-81 Keskin is the ability to fire 360 ​​degrees without reorientation between shots. This significantly reduces the time to prepare for firing and reduces vulnerability to counter-battery fire. The system is optimized for mobile deployment and high rate of fire, making it an essential element for modern warfare that requires flexibility and precision. Specialists of the iNEWS portal underline the fact that at the level of SM-81 localization Keskin is a cost-effective solution. More than 90% of the parts and components of the mortar system were designed and manufactured by Turkish contractors. The SM-81 Keskin system is an important addition to the arsenal of today's armed forces, providing high firepower, flexibility and reliability. Its mobility, accuracy and ability to be used in various scenarios make it an effective tool for both defensive and offensive operations. SM-81 Keskin 81mm Mortar System.

The Defense Forces spoke about the enemy's preparations for assaults in the South	The spokesperson of the Defense Forces of Southern Ukraine told about this on Army TV Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn. -For about 10-15 days, our situation is approximately the same. The enemy is continuing assaults in the Vremivsk direction and is preparing to conduct assaults in the Gulyaipil and Orihiv directions,- said Vladyslav Voloshyn. In addition, according to him, the enemy is conducting reconnaissance and search operations, small assaults in the Dnieper direction, on the Dnieper islands near Kherson. -There is constant counter-battery fighting, the enemy is constantly launching missile and air strikes, as well as shelling with MLRS,- the spokesman added. He noted that the weather sometimes affects the enemy's use of drones, but the number of shelling and assaults does not decrease, remains constant. -Mostly, assaults take place in small infantry groups, from 5 to 10 people.

The Ukraine-NATO Council discussed the Russian strike on the Dnieper with a new ballistic missile	This was reported by the press service of the Alliance. The meeting was held at the level of ambassadors. Senior Ukrainian military officials held a video briefing for the members of the Council. -During the meeting, the Alliance members confirmed their support for Ukraine. The attack, which was directed at the Dnipro, is seen as another attempt by Russia to terrorize the civilian population in Ukraine and intimidate those who support Ukraine, which is defending itself from Russia's illegal and unprovoked aggression,- the message reads. As NATO spokeswoman Fara Dahlalla previously noted, -the deployment of this potential will not change the course of the conflict and will not distract NATO allies from supporting Ukraine.- The Ukraine-NATO Council is a platform for consultations between Alliance members and Ukraine on security issues of mutual interest, including Russia's aggressive war. The meeting was chaired by Acting Deputy Secretary General of NATO Boris Ruge. The next meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council should take place during the meeting of foreign ministers of the Alliance member countries, which will be held on December 3-4. As ArmiyaInform reported, on November 21, the Russians hit the Dnipro with a new medium-range ballistic missile based on the older Rubezh ICBM, which is a potential carrier of a nuclear warhead. GUR IOU reported that Russia struck by using a ballistic missile, probably from the -Kedr- missile complex. The flight time of this Russian missile from the moment of launch in the Astrakhan region to the impact in the city of Dnipro was 15 minutes. Six combat units were installed on the rocket: each one was equipped with six sub-munitions. The speed on the final part of the trajectory is more than Mach 11.

MARCH is on the march: the cadets underwent an intensive 16-hour training in takmed	All conditions are created here for high-quality and fast training of combat medics, paramedics and soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -The cadets take the basic ASM (All service members) course with us, which is coordinated with the current Ukrainian standard of providing first aid. Here, they have the opportunity to hone their knowledge and skills directly during simulations of injuries and combat injuries, taking into account all the stress factors that accompany them,- says Diana, head of the tactical medicine center. Training takes place in full compliance with the MARCH first aid protocol (Massive bleeding, Airway Management, Respiration, Circulation, Head injury / Hypothermia / Hypovolemia) in all possible phases: -red-, -shelter-, -evacuation-. The training itself lasts 16 hours over two days. Each cadet practices this protocol independently. For this, models are used, or another cadet plays the role of the wounded. Certain marks simulate wounds (injuries) of varying complexity, according to the nature of which certain methods and means of assistance are used. Simulation of combat conditions helps cadets feel real responsibility and practice the skills of using various auxiliary medical devices (tourniquets, decompression needles, occlusive stickers, hemostatic bandages, etc.). It is also extremely important to take coordinated actions in the shortest possible time during the organization and evacuation of the wounded. In general, during the training, future officers must master the CLS (Combat Life Savior) level, which corresponds to the functionality of a medical marksman. Training takes place under the supervision of experienced combat medics. The principle -train as you will fight- applies - it educates the cadets' endurance and prepares them for actions in extreme combat situations, where the ability to save one's life and the life of a comrade is one of the most important tasks. -We work according to the MARCH protocol. First, we examine for the presence of massive bleeding, then we work with consciousness and breathing problems, tamponate, glue and carry out evacuation,- says cadet Mykola about the basic course of tactical medicine. Testing and awarding of certificates are ahead. And one more step towards receiving the rank of -lieutenant- will be taken.

Ministry of Defense: An interdepartmental commission is investigating the causes of the abnormal act...	About this Ministry of Defense reported November 26. -The absence of comments in the public space does not mean that the Ministry of Defense is inactive or does not respond to information that comes from the military or appears, in particular, in the mass media.

What are the advantages of the corps-brigade system: an expert on the new concept of reorganization ...	This may also mean how much the military management system will improve, said military expert Petro Chernyk: -We have a major combat unit, a brigade. However, we understand that the brigade does not fight by itself, considering the fact that we have a huge section of the front with a total length of about a thousand kilometers. Some number of brigades are fighting. The next control body that appears is the so-called tactical group, which can include 7-8 combat brigades. This is where the first problem appears. The command of the tactical group is a collective mess. This is not a permanent unit, it is temporary. There is a constant rotation of officers, which can actually reduce the quality of combat management of such large units. Therefore, we came to the conclusion that a full-time corps should be organized.- A corps can be anywhere from 4 to 7 brigades with the entire command network deployed. Why did they bypass the division link? A divisional unit is 3-4 brigades and is a duplicating body. There, again, a bunch of commanders, a bunch of operatives are needed there, they will be engaged in nothing but dubbing of the corps link. Could it have gone the divisional route? No. In my opinion, this is counterproductive. The conditional corps is 6-7 brigades. These are two divisions. So, instead of one corps level, there would be two divisional levels, which in the end creates a shortage of officers for such a large number of troops. What is the world practice? And so and so. Let's say the United States has the 101st Scalloping Eagles. But it is more of a historical character, because the divisional system justified itself well in the Second World War. But there are nuances. Both the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, and the Allies had such a gigantic number of troops, so they could afford it. We cannot afford it. Plus, we understand that this is also funding for a potential division link.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/26/u-chomu-plyusy-systemy-korpus-brygada-ekspert-pro-novu-konczepcziyu-reorganizacziyi-zbrojnyh-syl-ukrayiny/	2024-11-25T21:03:16-08:00
From the police to the Armed Forces: the instructor - Oak - told why every policeman should pass the...	ArmyInform, a military officer spoke about the choice of each police officer, the danger of a logical trap due to euphoria or despair when consuming information about the war from the media, as well as why every adult citizen of Ukraine is obliged to pass the BZVP. Dub met the large-scale invasion in the ranks of the National Police. Took part in military operations on the territory of Zhytomyr and Kyiv regions. After the enemy was pushed beyond the borders of Zhytomyr and Kyiv regions, he resigned from the National Police and joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Subsequently, -Dub- took part in military operations in the Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Donetsk regions. In particular, he fought in the Bakhmut direction in the areas of Avdiivka, Klishchiivka, and Kurdyumivka. — I was injured there, after which I learned to walk again. And after rehabilitation, I was offered a position at a training center so that I could share my practical experience and teach as many new recruits as possible to perform their duties well, says the instructor. He adds that at that time he was not sure that he would be able to perform combat tasks due to his health, so he decided to transfer. Now, after recovery, he again submitted a report for transfer to a combat unit. — Some of my former police colleagues also joined the ranks of the Armed Forces, others continue to serve in the National Police. This is a worthy choice, because if all police officers resign and go to the Armed Forces, then there will be chaos in the rear. -Policemen in the rear are necessary,- says the soldier, answering a question about whether all police officers should go to war. He adds that training as a police officer is not enough to immediately become a soldier. -Oak- points out that the specifics of the work of the National Police in the rear, and even of the special police officers, are the detention of small groups of criminals armed with small arms and the release of hostages, and not at all combat operations inherent in modern warfare. — The level of training of National Police employees is not comparable to the level required in the Armed Forces. The skills and abilities of a police officer are not enough to participate in combat operations using FPV drones, artillery, tanks and other numerous means of fire damage that they want to kill you with, the military emphasizes. He is convinced that police officers need just as much intensive training during BZVP as anyone else. After all, modern war requires fundamentally different knowledge, abilities and skills than even special police officers from specialized units have. So police officers have to retrain and relearn a lot. — Being -at zero-, I would not want to worry that something bad might happen to my family. Therefore, I rely on my police colleagues who continue to serve in the rear. Their work and labor is also needed, -Dub- emphasizes. However, at the same time, he notes that rear-line policemen must be trained for combat operations even if they continue to serve in the rear. — In my personal opinion, it may well happen when they will also have to become servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, will have to take up weapons, not just automatic weapons. Therefore, all Ukrainians should receive at least minimal military training, the instructor is convinced. Similarly, he believes, basic general military training of all civilians should be provided. This does not mean that everyone who has it will go to the front or even serve in the Armed Forces. However, everyone should have a minimum set of knowledge and skills in order to be able to defend Ukraine in case of need. -Oak- explains its position with personal experience. He is convinced that the availability of basic knowledge helped him a lot in the first months of the great war, becoming the basis for the further acquisition and improvement of the abilities and skills of a serviceman. — I expected that I would have to defend Ukraine with weapons in my hands, and I was preparing for it, because I understood that a big war would definitely happen. He tried to learn, learn information about weapons, about the tactics of action in small groups, studied topography, orientation on the terrain. He prepared little by little, he says. That is why everyone should be at least minimally prepared for hostilities, because with such a neighbor as the Russian Federation, there will always be a danger of new aggression and renewed hostilities. - Now our population has relaxed, started to lose the sense of danger that was in the first months of the large-scale invasion. It seems to many that the war is somewhere far away, and therefore will not affect them personally. It is very dangerous to think like that, - the former policeman is convinced, because the war is actually very close, and has already affected, and continues to determine the life of every Ukrainian. -Dub- puts a significant share of responsibility for this attitude of Ukrainians towards the war on the media and the state information policy aimed at reassuring people and the promise of a quick end to the war and easy victories. — -Two or three weeks, two or three months - and we will win. We have liberated Kherson and will soon enter the Crimea!-. After hearing this, people began to believe that they are no longer needed in the army, because what is the point of changing your life, joining the army, if victory will soon come without you? he asks rhetorically. Due to excessive optimism in the presentation of information about the war, Ukrainians began to distance themselves from the topic of the war and stopped following what was happening at the front. Because they believed that the Armed Forces of Ukraine would handle everything perfectly without their personal involvement. And then there was a -distortion- in the opposite direction - they began to tell that everything was bad and that Russia was still winning. Therefore, people began to get the impression that their participation would not change anything. In fact, the military man is convinced, only the joint efforts of the entire society, the entire country — all Ukrainians and women need to make efforts to win. - Many people are afraid to join the army because they believe that they will be thrown into the trenches, and they will, let's say, always sit in the trenches - in the mud, in the mud, in the cold. It's not like the army is functioning at all, a lot of specialists are needed, including logistics, clerks, cooks, drivers, and repairmen, the instructor explains. Therefore, in the Armed Forces there will be a place for everyone within the limits of his specialty and abilities. The decision to join the army, he believes, does not mean the end of life, but rather becomes a new stage in it. The extent to which a recruit will be able to realize himself in the Armed Forces will depend on him. - This is what I tell the servicemen who come to our unit for training - that they need to learn, to be able to do everything. But I draw their attention to the fact that not all of them will necessarily become stormtroopers or fight on the front lines, the instructor explains. At the same time, everyone who joins the army must pass the BZVP, because there can always be an urgent need to join the battle for everyone - as it was in February 2022, when everyone stood in lines for weapons, regardless of civilian profession and having military experience. - In 2022, no one paid attention to the civilian profession - it was necessary to take up arms and defend one's land. Because of this, basic general military training is now conducted to ensure that everyone has general combat skills. Then the fighters are sent to professional training depending on where they will be assigned, -Dub- explains. He emphasizes that, already during the BZVP at the training center, the instructors find out what education, skills and skills the recruits have from their previous civilian experience. This allows them to be recommended for exactly those positions where they can be most effective in the ranks of the Armed Forces, and therefore useful for the defense of Ukraine. — We can make recommendations to which position to assign a particular serviceman in order to make the most effective use of their skills that they have acquired throughout their lives working in civilian professions, so that they can be as effective as possible in the ranks of the Armed Forces, the instructor says. — We communicate directly with the brigades of the airborne assault troops that are on the front line, we exchange training recommendations. They make certain corrections, recommendations on training, on the necessary practical or theoretical knowledge that is actually needed on the front line, - says -Dub-. Thanks to this, the training is structured in such a way as to give the maximum necessary knowledge and not to overload the cadet with secondary information, not to take his time and energy for unnecessary things that will not be needed during the service. - From the statutes, we study only the most necessary, and we almost completely reject military training, since there is no practical need for it. We have instructors and officers with combat experience, they understand very well what is needed, what knowledge needs to be invested, - explains the instructor. He notes that the BZVP is the foundation on which each soldier will then be able to build his knowledge depending on the needs of his future position in the ranks of the Armed Forces. - My conscience does not allow me to teach them badly, because their lives depend on how I teach them. If one of them gets injured or dies in the future, I take it on my own account in the sense that I did not teach them well, that I did not give them a certain amount of information, a certain amount of theoretical or practical skills, did not motivate, did not brought something necessary, - says -Oak-. Currently, the soldier is already completing rehabilitation and has submitted a report for transfer to a combat position, because he believes that soon he will be able to be more effective on the front line. — My rehabilitation is already coming to an end, I understand for myself that I am ready to perform combat tasks, that I can lead people with me. Therefore, I am preparing to be transferred or seconded to a combat brigade in the near future, and there to perform my duties directly on the battlefield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/26/z-policziyi-do-zsu-instruktor-dub-rozpoviv-chomu-kozhen-policziyant-maye-projty-bzvp/	2024-11-25T20:50:12-08:00
All-weather beam-protector: a high-energy laser weapon system was presented to the US Army	As stated in the annotation to this project, the text of which posted on the official portal of the developer firm, FIREFLY is designed to combat the growing asymmetric threats associated with with unmanned systems, and is a significant technological breakthrough in the field of air defense, ArmyInform reports. The system has a mobile and pallet (for stationary deployment) design with a modular architecture and scalable power (from 5 kW to 40 kW), specially designed to protect forward positions and critical infrastructure. The FIREFLY combat mechanism (-Svitlyak-, -Svitlyachok- in Ukrainian) is designed on the basis of a universal open architecture, optimized to balance performance, reliability, serviceability and portability. Thanks to modular replaceable units (LRUs), the system adapts to a wide range of operational applications and provides the flexibility to configure, customize and upgrade its capabilities as needs arise. This design allows FIREFLY to interact with C3S computer systems, such as FAAD (Forward Area Air Defense, -Forward Area Air Defense- - Ukrainian) and MEDUSA (Advanced Technology System for Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and other autonomous detection systems (such as radars and optical sensors). The modular structure also facilitates maintenance at the intermediate and field levels, reducing operating costs by using low-cost, commercially available components. To provide target tracking, FIREFLY is equipped with an ISR (surveillance systems) payload, which includes independent visible and infrared surveillance systems, as well as advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities for remote threat detection and classification. One of the key advantages of this system, according to the experts of the Army Recognition defense portal, is its ability to work continuously for a long time. This allows the FIREFLY to neutralize multiple targets without the need for frequent reloads or reloads. Such indicators are critical when fending off massive attacks from multiple drones or other similar aerial threats. FIREFLY's functionality has undergone 34 months of rigorous testing, demonstrating its adaptability in challenging environments, including testing in temperatures from −15°C to 35°C, as well as challenging weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, and sandstorms. The weapon was deployed on both fixed and unprepared sites, which confirmed its adaptability and ease of transport and deployment. This high-energy laser system is designed to be cost-effective with minimal logistical support thanks to simplified maintenance processes. KORD specialists focused on reducing production costs and delivery times by using commercially available components, ensuring increased reliability and rapid availability of fully ready-to-deploy units. FIREFLY is offered on competitive commercial terms, making it the perfect solution for armed forces that require modern, ready-to-deploy defense technology. The increasing use of drones in modern warfare is radically changing the battlefield, creating new threats that require innovative countermeasures. These include directed energy (DE) weapons, particularly lasers, which stand out for their accuracy and effectiveness. These technologies are becoming important tools to counter unmanned aerial systems (UAS), which play an increasingly important role in today's conflicts. UAVs pose a significant threat to military personnel and equipment. Their low production cost, ability to transport various payloads, and reduced risk of injury to operators make them particularly attractive to both state and non-state actors. Recent conflicts, such as those in Ukraine, Yemen and Gaza, have highlighted the growing importance of drones in military operations. In response to this growing threat, the military is investing heavily in counter-UAS systems (CUAS), where laser technologies, with their rapid target neutralization capabilities and long-term cost-effectiveness, will play a central role in defense strategies.

The fifth wave — higher than two meters: - Book flood - will sweep through Ukraine and distribute mo...	This is the fifth wave of the initiative launched in 2015, shortly after the beginning of the open armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. As before, it is aimed at popularizing reading and supporting libraries from different regions of Ukraine - both front-line and those that sheltered many forced migrants. This time, as part of the -Book Rush-, more than 31,000 books will be transferred to Ukrainian libraries, including books for children and teenagers, Ukrainian classics and modern literature of various genres, translations of foreign authors, popular science literature and books about the war experience, works of veterans and volunteers. The co-organizers of the -Book Rush- told the correspondent of ArmiyaInform about the action. — The National Military Historical Museum of Ukraine is a museum of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine system, a military museum. When we learned that the fifth wave of the -Book Rush- action would take place, we offered to join it, says Yuriy Bilous, deputy director of the National Military Historical Museum of Ukraine. In particular, a small exhibition was placed at the entrance to the museum, which presents all the books that will be transferred to libraries within the initiative. - This is necessary so that anyone can see the total volume of collected books. After all, there will be 300 sets of 100 books each, which will be distributed to the libraries of Kharkiv, Sumy, Poltava, Mykolaiv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Volyn regions, he explains. It is important for people to see this volume visually, because the information about 100 books that will be transferred to each library is a certain abstraction. When you collect the books together on one shelf or put them in a stack, it is already a small library of modern Ukrainian literature. - One hundred books is a lot. If it is conventionally assumed that each book is at least two centimeters thick, then the height of a column of stacked books will be more than two meters, says the deputy director of the National Military Historical Museum. Several books from the collected list relate in one way or another to military topics, talk about the modern Russian-Ukrainian war - an aggressive war on the part of the Russian Federation and a just defensive war on the part of Ukraine. - Since we are a military museum, together with the organizers of -Book Rush- we paid special attention to this, - explains Yuriy Bilous. However, since the selection is intended primarily for the average mass Ukrainian reader, the share of books on military topics is not decisive in it. In view of this, in addition to the basic standard set of books for libraries, the organizers plan to create a special selection of books specifically for the military. — There are many children's books, books for teenagers, which are less needed by the military. Therefore, there will be a separate list specifically for adults, for the military, he says. The museum owner invites everyone to visit the National Military History Museum of Ukraine, because in it you can not only see with your own eyes books from the fifth wave of the -Book Flood-, but also get acquainted with unique exhibits from the history of the Ukrainian military. — This is the fifth wave of the -Book Rush- launched by the -Information Resistance- group. The first took place back in 2015. Then, in addition to our usual activities - monitoring the situation, identifying and investigating security risks, countering aggression against Ukraine in the information sphere, we also decided to pay more attention to communication with people -on the ground-, - says the coordinator of the -Information Resistance- group. historian and museum expert Oleksiy Kopytko. One of the effective options was cooperation with libraries and the dissemination of modern Ukrainian literature, organization of scientific and educational events. — At first, emphasis was placed on literature of a historical profile. Our first waves of actions were connected with books about the Holodomor, with the distribution of the ten-volume popular science book -History without censorship- from the public educational project to popularize the history of Ukraine -likbez. Historical front-. Instead, we have now put together a universal kit aimed at popularizing Ukrainian books and reading in general, he explains. The demand from libraries for new literature, which is catastrophically lacking, is very high. Books are needed by all readers of all ages, so in the fifth wave of the -Book Rush- they tried to please every taste and preference. - This is children's literature, which includes both new classics and works on the school curriculum. It is also scientific popular literature, including several encyclopedias of a natural nature. This is literature for teenagers, this is what is called -non-fiction- - modern and classic Ukrainian and translated literature, says Oleksiy Kopytko. — A separate block consists of books related to understanding the experience of modern war. This is an experience of different regions - there are books about Okhtyrka, several books about Kharkiv, about Kherson. We want to collect such a palette of books that make up a certain -military- kit for any reader, - explains the coordinator of -Information Resistance-. Having received such a universal set, the library will be able to offer different groups of readers the latest Ukrainian publications that will be of interest to them. — Since the resources are quite limited and, so to speak, not comparable to the need, we decided to focus primarily on several regions from the East and South of Ukraine. First of all, these are Kharkiv, Sumy, Poltava and Mykolaiv regions. We also included two regions of Western Ukraine — Volynsk and Ivano-Frankivsk, because many people moved from the East and found shelter that way, as well as in the central regions, he says. Also, the -Information Resistance- group establishes contacts with the training centers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. There you need literature for conducting classes - about weapons, about battle tactics, publication of motivational and psychological content, etc. — We are now preparing to form a certain set of books that will go to educational centers with an orientation primarily to instructors. We started a certain dialogue in order to understand what they specifically need and what is needed as a priority, because the needs are huge and it is necessary to understand the best way to ensure them, Oleksiy Kopytko said. public libraries, is already rolling across Ukraine. Organizers have completed accepting and selecting applications and are starting to ship books to selected libraries. The libraries of the Sumy region will be the first. — We had the following approach: formally, there are more than 10,000 public libraries in Ukraine. Unfortunately, some of them are, to put it mildly, -inanimate-. We wanted to find those libraries of various levels that are important to their communities. They can be small, but if there is life in the village around the library, some events are taking place, children come or people of all ages come - then we wanted to strengthen such libraries within the boundaries of -Book Crowd-, - explains Oleksiy Kopytko. For this review, the organizers, in addition to reviewing applications, also looked at library websites, pages and groups in social networks, which show how active and important the library is to the local community. So far, the -Information Resistance- group has collected more than 31,000 books from 26 publishing houses, more than 40 books from the set were published in the book capital of Ukraine — near the frontline, Kharkiv. Three sets of 101 books each have already gone to the first three libraries.

In the swamps, counterfeiters attack computer games: why is this the enemy	Plots from video games see them everywhere. For example, propagandists are spreading information on social networks that the German TV channel allegedly used footage from the American video game -Call of Duty- in the video of the assault on Russian positions by soldiers of the Azov brigade in the Pokrovsky direction. But in fact, this is not Pokrovsky direction, but Serebryansk forestry in Luhansk region. The video was shot in first person and is divided into three sections: advancing through positions, mopping up, and securing after the assault. There are no computer graphics on it. Apparently, the Russians still cannot believe that the Ukrainians are capable of defending their native land so selflessly. For them, the heroism of the military is beyond reality, so they believe in the fictions of their fakers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/26/na-bolotah-fejkoroby-atakuyut-kompyuterni-igry-navishho-cze-vorogu/	2024-11-25T20:06:10-08:00

A video of the combat operation appearedon the unit's page on November 25. -Thanks to the coordinated work of our units, we stopped the enemy, inflicting significant losses on him. Footage from drones, on which every moment of the battle is recorded, resembles scenes from Hollywood action movies. But this is not a movie. This is the harsh reality of today's war in Ukraine,- the fighters commented. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 60th mechanized Ingulets brigade showed destruction of Russians who decided to attack on -Niva- passenger cars, protected only by camouflage and electronic radar.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/kadry-z-droniv-nagaduyut-sczeny-z-gollivudskyh-bojovykiv-bijczi-pro-vidbyttya-drugoyi-hvyli-rosijskogo-shturmu/	2024-11-25T12:01:05-08:00

Pavlo -Beton- is the commander of the mortar unit of the 60th separate mechanized Ingulets brigade. He repels enemy assaults almost every day, covering his comrades. Pavlo strikes at enemy concentrations and equipment, despite continuous fire from enemy artillery and tanks. -During one of the battles, -Beton- deliberately destroyed a stationary BMP of the enemy, under which enemy infantry was hiding. Two 120-mm mines were enough for this - the technicians tore off the tower, and the infantrymen were burned,- said the Ground Forces. Pavel admits that he wants even more such results. His main motivation is to protect his fellow vanguards. For his courage and skill, Pavlo was awarded the Golden Cross. -Beton- was born in the city of Kryvyi Rih. Before the full-scale invasion, he worked as a locksmith. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 60th mechanized Ingulets brigade showed destruction of the Russians who decided to attack in Niva cars protected only by camouflage and REB.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/znyshhyly-rosijsku-bmp-i-pihotu-dvoma-minamy-istoriya-kolyshnogo-slyusarya-betona/	2024-11-25T11:58:24-08:00

Rustem Umyerov: We expect that partners will take the initiative in equipping our brigades	This is stated in the minister's message on the Facebook page. -Allies' support will become faster and more effective. The defenders of Ukraine must be provided with everything necessary to put an end to Russian aggression,- said Rustem Umyerov. The ministers discussed the urgent needs of the Defense Forces, as well as the priority areas of assistance to Ukraine. -We count on the fact that partners will take the initiative in equipping our brigades and battalions. We have a successful experience of cooperation with France, which provided training for one of the Ukrainian brigades and also provided it with armored vehicles,- said Rustem Umyerov. Another area of ​​support is strengthening our anti-aircraft defenses ahead of winter. The enemy does not stop trying to destroy our critical infrastructure, so we need more air defense systems and ammunition for them. The next important issue is artillery ammunition. Rustem Umyerov thanked our European partners for providing Ukraine with 1 million artillery shells, but noted that Ukraine needs more to achieve parity with the enemy. -Together with its allies, Ukraine is already building the potential of the domestic defense industry. We invite the countries of the free world to transfer technology to us and start strategic partnerships with our industry,- he said. The minister informed the partners about the areas in which we see significant opportunities for cooperation: At the same time, it is planned to conduct an audit with the allied states of the aid provided during 2022, 2023 and 2024 in order to determine which models of support to Ukraine worked best and scale them up. Ukraine is also open to new initiatives that will help quickly meet the needs of our soldiers in 2025. -We must act boldly and coherently. Only in this way will we be able to achieve a just and lasting peace in Europe,- Rustem Umyerov stressed. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukraine reached specific agreements with Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Lithuania on investing directly in Ukrainian production.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/rustem-umyerov-rozrahovuyemo-shho-partnery-vizmut-na-sebe-inicziatyvu-v-osnashhenni-nashyh-brygad/	2024-11-25T11:09:24-08:00

The spokesman explained that the actions of the DRG in border areas are a common practice. - Subversive intelligence groups are a common Russian practice. They try to enter in small groups in order to find out where there is some opening for them - an opportunity to enter, start a fight or advance somewhere. But these efforts always end in the same way - with the corpses of Russians, - assured Yevhenii Romanov. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Defense Forces stopped the breakthrough of Russian saboteurs in Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/vorozhu-drg-zupynyly-na-pivnochi-harkivshhyny-chastynu-rosijskyh-dyversantiv-likvidovano/	2024-11-25T10:57:16-08:00

Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . The depressed mood among Russian soldiers is due to the extremely high level of casualties and the lack of success in the Siversk region. -Already now we can say about unsuccessful operations, unsuccessful assaults in the previous period of time - for about a month they tried to storm with equipment using a large amount of equipment that was completely broken and destroyed,- the spokeswoman said. In an attempt to rectify the situation, the Russians replaced the command staff here, and deployed military police on the ranks. — As a result of this, there were big changes in the enemy group standing in the Seversky direction: the brigade commander was changed, the combatants were changed. The military police came, as far as we know, in order to -motivate- the personnel to go into battle, the officer said. However, even this does not give the desired result to the Russian invaders - the soldiers of the Russian army refuse to perform combat tasks. ArmyInform previously reported that propagandystiv/->in OTU -Luhansk- denied the statements of Russian propagandists about the advance of the occupiers to the northern part Toretska.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/u-bij-na-zabij-chy-pid-trybunal-na-siverskomu-napryamku-rosiyan-motyvuye-vijskova-policziya/	2024-11-25T10:21:55-08:00
The escape attempt ended with a call to the rescuers: three men barely survived in Tisza	About this notifies November 25 State Border Service of Ukraine. -The men used the services of traders who promised to help them cross the border by land, but after paying for the -service- they were told that they would still have to go into the water,- the report said. It is noted that the shippers, traditionally disregarding the lives of their customers, directed them to the Tisza after dark, lying that the water there was knee-deep, the river itself was not wide, and therefore they would cross it with ease and would not even have time to freeze. No flotation devices or life jackets were offered to the men. -Taking off their shoes and slightly rolling up their pants, the divers went into an unknown body of water,- said the DPSU. In just a few minutes, all three were washed away by a powerful current and carried away in an unknown direction. According to the border guards, the only thing that saved the men was the fact that there was a washed-up tree in the water, which they were able to grab onto and get to the shallows in the middle of the river. Then they called the rescuers and reported that they needed help. Military personnel of the -Vylok- and -Dyakovo- border service departments of the Mukachevo border detachment were involved in the search for offenders. As a result of using a drone, the -islanders- were discovered. All three were taken to a border unit, where servicemen gave them hot tea and allowed them to warm up and dry their clothes and shoes. For an attempt to violate the state border, administrative offenses were filed against the men. -The water level in the Tisza River, which runs along the border with Hungary and Romania, has risen significantly at the moment. The water temperature is very low, which causes muscle cramps in those who try to dive into the river. Under such conditions, the human body becomes uncontrollable, which can lead to death,- the DPSU emphasized. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/sproba-vtechi-zavershylas-dzvinkom-do-ryatuvalnykiv-troye-cholovikiv-ledve-vyzhyly-u-tysi/	2024-11-25T10:08:16-08:00

Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — In the Toretsk direction, the number of assaults did not decrease, accordingly, the losses of Russians in manpower in this direction did not decrease either. They remain consistently high, she said. The spokeswoman did not confirm the information of Russian propagandists about the advance of Russians in the northern part of the city. — In the northern part of the city, they have not yet appeared. Although I must also repeat that urban battles are one of the most difficult battles in military practice, military science. They are characterized by dynamism and require constant attention from servicemen and constant tension, she said. At the same time, the military woman noted that during battles in the city it is difficult to talk about the details of the situation, because the enemy may unexpectedly appear on a neighboring street for a while and will be forced to leave it or be destroyed just as suddenly. — It is difficult to say what the situation is in the city itself, specifically on this or that street. The enemy may run into the neighboring street, but this does not mean that he is entrenched there. They immediately destroy him, immediately make it impossible for him to move or take him prisoner, - explained Anastasia Bobovnikova. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Toretsk, the enemy loses 100 soldiers per day.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/u-pivnichnij-chastyni-toreczka-okupantiv-nemaye-v-otu-lugansk-sprostuvaly-zayavy-rosijskyh-propagandystiv/	2024-11-25T09:39:11-08:00

There should not be even a hint of normalization of Russian terror — of getting used to it,- the President said. The head of state noted the new decision of Britain regarding sanctions against the shadow tanker fleet of the Russian Federation, according to which 30 tankers came under restrictions. -This is an important step. And it would be right for European partners — at the level of the entire EU — as well as other partners to support such sanctions. The less Russian excess profits from oil, the less Russia will be able to wage war. This is an obvious connection. A relationship that must work for real peace,- he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also announced that today at the meeting Bets were relevant reports and analysis of experience in repelling Russian strikes on energy. -The best results of specific units should be spread to all objects, to everyone who carries out protective work,- he emphasized. The production and supply of drones, missiles, and other weapons were also discussed. -All weapons tasks for this year will definitely be completed. Also for the next one.

Britain introduced large-scale sanctions against the shadow fleet of the Russian Federation	This is stated in the message at sites of the British government. -With half of the vessels sanctioned today carrying more than $4.3 billion worth of oil and petroleum products such as gasoline in the last year alone, this is the UK's largest sanctions package of its kind,- the statement said. It said the move would further limit the Kremlin's ability to finance its illegal war in Ukraine and its malicious activities around the world, and would also bring the total number of oil tankers under UK sanctions to 73, more than any other another country 46 countries and the EU signed the call to action against the shadow fleet, announced by the Prime Minister of Great Britain at the summit of the European Political Community in July. Revenues from oil sales are a key source of funding for the Kremlin's illegal war in Ukraine. The -shadow fleet- also poses significant risks to global trade. Many of these vessels use deceptive transportation methods and pose an environmental hazard—many tankers blatantly ignore basic safety standards, increasing the likelihood of catastrophic oil spills.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/brytaniya-zaprovadyla-masshtabni-sankcziyi-shhodo-tinovogo-flotu-rf/	2024-11-25T05:57:46-08:00
RAROG breathes fire: how to get to the 24th OMBr named after King Danylo	The windows of high-rise buildings are sometimes covered with fiberboard boards, film or other material, reminding that some people left their native homes and were forced to become internally displaced persons or refugees in other countries. Evacuation offers from the Donetsk regional military administration constantly come to the phone of everyone who enters the territory of the region. A typical picture of a front-line city. It is young, energetic, focused on results. This result is the destruction of the occupiers, day and night, under all circumstances and weather conditions. The fact that unmanned systems are becoming the main means of fire damage to the enemy significantly increases the role of such units in combat military units. Everyone flies: reconnaissance units, artillery fire adjusters, UAV units of mechanized and rifle battalions, and even EW units and RKBZ. But the main striking force of the brigade in the conditions of the enemy's superiority in ammunition over artillery is the battalions of unmanned systems created in the brigades. Why -RAROG- in particular? The mythical falcon of the ancient Slavs, which flies out of a fiery whirlwind and spews fire, a whirlwind, a storm on its own - isn't this a literal description of a deadly attack on the enemy from an unmanned aerial vehicle? 24th -royal- separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, since the beginning of the war in 2014, has already entered into its history the glorious pages of the battles for Liman, Popasna, Lysychansk, the liberation of the right bank of southern Ukraine. Today, it holds the defense of Chasovoy Yar. The brigade's arm badge depicts a Galician lion with the motto -milites regum- — royal infantry. The eidetics of the new Ukrainian army organically connects the generations of our ancestors with modern heroes who defend their country from the next invaders. -Rarog- is also from those times. Only a person rooted in the history of his kind, who is aware of his responsibility both to the past and to the future, is able to consciously and effectively destroy the enemy. - We do it effectively,- the combatant claims. Some episodes of battles are particularly ostentatious. Thus, the road Verkhne Toretske - Avdiyivka was jokingly called -RAROG road- in the brigade. The enemy tried to advance along it with combat equipment at night. The operators of the battalion carried out 12 sorties with mining of advance routes. As a result, we received 11 detonations of the enemy's equipment. -After all, this is not just mining. It's practically a piece of jewelry when a mine is dropped after detonating the previous car on the likely bypass path. Sometimes almost under the tracks of an enemy tank,- explains the combatant. Service in the battalion is no less difficult than in mechanized or rifle units. Permanent shifts of UAV operators at positions with a continuous change of drones in the air; logistics and delivery of goods for infantry in positions; repair, modernization and improvement of unmanned aerial vehicles; own logistics and production of discharges and other ammunition. After all, up to 1 thousand can be dropped on the enemy during the night. kg of -surprises-. On the Facebook page of the battalion, there are photos with the latest results of defeating the enemy. From military equipment to individual invaders who met their death on Ukrainian soil. Destroyed dugouts, bridges, shelters, firing positions. Such results are comparable to the achievements of the most successful battalions of unmanned systems: Magyar Birds (deployed to a regiment), Achilles, K-2, Wild Hornets, Magura brigade battalion and others. This is the result not only of state support for capacity building The forces of unmanned systems, but also significant volunteer funds and the battalion's own funds. In a new kind of military, real development comes ahead of changes to states, state-contracted drones and typical munitions. And the constant change of the situation and the actions of the enemy force us to be more and more resourceful in order to resist and, in the end, see Victory . Up to 10 million hryvnias are spent every month on the modernization of drones received in the battalion alone. The unit needs its own cargo transport, solutions for the rapid movement of control points, modern computer equipment and drones, drones, drones... span> Everyone can become the embodiment of the power of the fiery vortex and destroy the enemy personally. This requires: &#8211; choose a position that matches your skills and abilities; &#8211; constantly learn and grow professionally; &#8211; fight for victory with ideological and motivated comrades.

Foreign components of 2023 detected in North Korean KN-23/KN-24 missile — GUR	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on November 25. The aggressor state Russia received more than 100 such missiles from the DPRK. The enemy used this weapon for the first time in the war against Ukraine at the end of 2023. Together with the missiles, Pyongyang then sent its military specialists to Russia, who serviced the launchers and actually participated in war crimes against Ukraine. The victims of KN-23/KN-24 strikes were Ukrainian civilians both in front-line communities and in settlements far from the battle line. In particular, on January 2, 2024, four people died as a result of a North Korean missile hitting a Kyiv high-rise building. On August 11, 2024, a four-year-old boy and his father were killed by KN-23/KN-24 debris in the Kyiv region, and three more citizens were injured. The KN-23/KN-24 missile used by Russia against Ukraine contained foreign components produced by companies from five countries — China, the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. At least one of them, a voltage converter labeled -XP Power- by a British manufacturer, was made in February 2023, after the full-scale invasion had begun. In order to obtain technologies for their weapons programs, the aggressor state of Russia and its allies - the DPRK and Iran - use joint schemes to circumvent international sanctions, which requires an appropriate response, in particular - the strengthening of export control mechanisms. As reported by ArmyInform, in the GUR we talked about the tactics of using the Magura V5 attack marine drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/u-pivnichnokorejskij-raketi-kn-23-kn-24-vyyavleno-inozemni-komponenty-2023-roku-gur/	2024-11-24T22:57:52-08:00

The RBU-6000 -Smerch 2- was developed back in Soviet times and was intended to destroy enemy submarines and attacking torpedoes. Due to the fact that nothing is known about Ukrainian submarines in Donbas, it can be assumed that the use of such specific weapons is a sign of a certain arms crisis in the enemy. Also, the fighters of the 5th brigade destroyed the mortar and the enemy's shelter. As ArmyInform reported, fighters of the 5th assault Kyiv brigade repelled a foot assault of the invaders on Pokrovsky direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/morskyj-bombomet-u-stepah-ukrayiny-na-donechchyni-znyshhyly-ridkisnu-vorozhu-ustanovku-zalpovogo-vognyu/	2024-11-24T22:41:15-08:00

Enemy cesspools were dug somewhere in Odessa -Nikolai Fyodorovich-: what are you lying about	However, all his words are a standard set of Kremlin narratives and clichés used by propagandists every day. It in no way reflects the opinion of the residents of all of Odessa. After all, the only country that makes the residents of Odessa and other cities and villages of Ukraine suffer is terrorist Russia and its dictator Putin. It is the Russians who launch attack drones and missiles over Ukraine every night and every day. According to social survey of the Rozumkov Center, as of September In 2024, 94% of Ukrainian citizens have a negative attitude towards the Russian Federation. By the way, as a result of a Russian missile attack on the city on November 18, 11 people died. A total of 55 people were injured, 23 of them are still in hospitals.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/vorozhi-pomyjky-vykopaly-des-v-odesi-nikolaya-fodorovicha-pro-shho-breshe/	2024-11-24T21:10:28-08:00
Help has arrived: how recruits are being prepared for a real war in Donetsk region	We asked who and what is taught before being sent to combat positions. The training ground is somewhere in the steppes of Donetsk region. An infantry division moves between barricades made of old tires. They keep their distance, keep their weapons at the ready. — A grenade! The instructor shouts and throws a mock-up of a hand grenade to the side of the compartment. Fighters fall amicably to the ground. They are waiting — Explosion! And we're moving! Let's move! He who does not move will die! The instructor shouts, the fighters pick themselves up and advance further. In general, all recruits have undergone a month's training in training centers, but the battalion believes that it is not enough. -Military personnel come from training centers with a low level of training. They have a small shot, weak tactical skills, everything has to be learned almost from scratch. Currently, 90 percent of the recruitment is without experience of military service. Which, after all, gave at least some initial skills,- says the commander of the department with the call sign Psych, a calm man in his 50s with a beard. According to him, 12-15 bullets are given in training centers, in the best case, up to a hundred. -We give much more. Weapons are attached to military personnel so that they get used to them. This weapon is being fired. We also allow shooting with RPGs, disposable grenade launchers, and various machine guns. Here we are already undergoing disassembly and assembly. We try to prepare as much as possible,- says Psych. -Here, a fighter can shoot more in one day than in a whole month at the training center. This is a fact. We shoot from automatic weapons, from machine guns, from RPGs, throw grenades of various types,- says the senior sergeant with the call sign Romeo, black and cheerful. -There are almost no veterans among the recruits. We have succumbed to this misconception that the army must be professional. In fact, an army can only be professional if it has to fight against a bunch of savages. And against an enemy equal in strength, a common army is needed. After all, the protection of Ukraine is the constitutional duty of its citizens. And I don't have time for civilians now. They can't even line up and march in formation. That's why they have to be taught fast,- says Norman, who is tall and looks like a wrestler. He was just throwing dummy grenades at the soldiers to teach them to immediately lie down and then move quickly. The time that the unit allocates for the training of new recruits depends on the situation at the front. -There were cases when fighters arrived by bus after training, received weapons and immediately went into battle, because the enemy was attacking and it was necessary to hold the front. Now we try to cook for at least a week,- says Romeo. Next, according to the plan, the fighters will have training on conducting combat operations in urban conditions. The department enters the site of the landfill, on which there are models of urban development. Fighters learn to sweep, cover each other, act as a team. -Tactical fighting skills in urban development, which we really need now, none. We are now teaching them this, because there is no way without it. Because what is Donbas? This is an agglomeration! More than five hundred settlements! They flow into each other! In some places, the boundaries of settlements pass along the streets! It is a continuous development. And the war in solid construction has its differences. Here, the offense requires a one-to-seven power advantage, while the field requires a one-to-three power advantage. Considering that Donetsk is almost one continuous population center, it is necessary to sharpen the preparation for this. Because if we surrender Donbas, it will be trouble. Operational space begins behind Donbas, that is, space not occupied by troops and without prepared fortifications. That's it, they go to Dnipropetrovsk region and spread in any direction like a plague or a locust. That's why we need to focus on Donbas!- says Norman. Military personnel move from wall to wall, working in pairs. One takes a position and shouts, -I'm hiding!- The second shouts: -I'm coming- and runs forward, takes the position: -I'm hiding!-. Everyone else watches the pair, the instructor explains and points out mistakes. Another couple starts working. Some try harder, some less. Someone falls when necessary, and someone just kneels so as not to get dirty. -We are trying to teach them so that they don't die stupidly on the first day. The reason some people don't give their all is because people don't fully understand where they are and what they're here for. It has not yet been understood that in war any mistake, wrong step, untimely movement can cost lives,- says Romeo. -There's nothing to do in urban combat without grenades! You should carry at least a dozen with you! And when entering the premises, do not spare a grenade for each room, but rather a few! To make sure that there is no enemy waiting for you! -Raise your hands, who doesn't have combat experience?- Norman looks at the recruits. Everyone raises their hands. This is another example of the quality of training in educational centers. You will have to learn this too. When the exercise is over, the fighters are given time to rest a little. Someone smokes, someone sits down directly on the ground to rest. Everyone is breathing heavily, because the training takes place in full equipment: body armor, helmet, discharge, first-aid kit, weapons, ammunition. A total of at least 15 kilograms. Try to run with a kettlebell, fall, stand up, squat, see if you can last long. I look at the fighters. Most are somewhere around fifty and they don't look like athletes. Fall asleep after exercises. I approach a fighter who was very active in training, did not feel sorry for himself, worked out to the full, and also caught up with his brothers who were lazy. Mykola is of medium height, thin, sinewy, from the city of Gulyaipole in Zaporozhye. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, a front has been passing there nearby. Mykola knows what war is. Especially since he did not work anywhere, but in a funeral service. -I saw different things. People also had to be collected in parts. We are in a war zone, shelled every day: mortars, guns, tanks. It happened that you were digging a grave, and then the shelling began, and you jumped into the hole yourself to wait. Then you dig further. He was wounded twice. Once in the head a fragment, but only -combed-. The second time in the stomach, but saved the phone, a mortar fragment got stuck in it. That phone is still lying at home,- says Mykola. His family left for Zhytomyr, and he stayed to help the old and sick who remained in his hometown. In 2022, he was summoned three times to the TCC, but each time he was not taken to the army. Only now it was his turn. Mykola underwent basic military training in the Poltava region, but he says that here, in the battalion, the occupations were more intense. -We didn't have such movement in urban conditions with weapons there. It was mostly medicine, some more lectures. Well, maybe 5 times in a month they stormed the trenches. And then they tried to storm more. So that it was not so much, truly, as here, in the textbook. And here, of course, it is difficult, especially on the first day. But we are taught to go to the positions and not stay there on the first day,- says Mykola. Sergey stands a little aside. He is from Bohodukhov, Kharkiv region. I was driving from work, stood at a bus stop, the police drove up, and in a couple of days I already went to the educational center. -There's a lot of useful stuff here, it's hard to remember everything. But something must be done, because this is the army,- says Serhiy. Fighters rest before a new exercise. In the battalion, problems are recognized both with the age of recruitment and with its motivation. -Well, what could be the motivation if he was going to work and was taken to the TCC? Will he have motivation? But hardly. It was at the beginning of a large scale motivated guys, but they have either run out or there are few left. That's why you have to fight with the people who are there,- says Romeo. And Norman says that it's not about age, it's about your attitude. -I myself am already under sixty. You just don't need to drink and smoke, you need to do sports. And the boys, of course, complain that it is difficult for them. They often come here already with some kind of clinic,- sighs Norman. He himself was withdrawn from the combat team after a serious injury and has been the head of the battalion's combat training for a year. To his credit, he looks younger than most recruits. The battalion's aerial scouts raise two drones. The next point of training: work under enemy copters. The detachment moves through the territory in pairs, when a drone appears overhead, then the fighter drops to the ground, necessarily in a straight line, to maintain visual contact with the drone. If earlier the training program for new recruits included a run-in with a tank, now it is a drone flight. Because the recruits may not see an enemy tank, but an enemy drone - for sure. -The Kalashnikov assault rifle does not change, but the war has changed very much: both methods and tactics. At the beginning of the war, who would have thought that drones would play such a role? And now it is a technological war, a war of drones. Now they attach to them -lighters- and other ammunition. Drones perform very different tasks and you have to be prepared for them,- says Romeo. -We currently have the biggest losses from enemy drones. Moreover, they already have standard ammunition, thermobaric, cumulative, which allow them to perform any task on the battlefield. Because what is mortar or art? Shot and hit or missed. Because the flight of a mine or a projectile is affected by a large number of factors: the quality of ammunition, wear of the muzzle channel, wind, weather. And the drone is all about it, it can fly up and accurately drop its ammunition on the target. So the focus has now shifted and countering drones is now the main thing,- says Norman. He remembers the year 2022, when he fought near Lysychansk, and the main striking force was artillery. Shows photos on the phone of positions that look like a lunar landscape: dozens and hundreds of craters from artillery shells. -We did not see a live opponent, we were simply destroyed by his arta. A platoon entered the position, and only half left. Or simply ran away in a panic due to continuous fire exposure. But now everything has changed and it is the drones that are making the decisive fire impact. That's why we teach recruits to get used to the idea that they will constantly be in front of our eyes and the enemy's eyes,- says Norman. The copters dive at the fighters, and they learn to notice them in time and not to panic. Vlad is the youngest in the entire department. On September 2, he turned 25, it is from this age that mobilization now begins, and already on September 3 he had a summons. Vlad himself is from Cherkasy, says that since 2022 he has received summons several times, but he was not taken because of his age. -I was told that you are still young, go for a walk for now. I updated my details and waited. September 3 came, I was sent to the VLK, I passed it in two days. In two, because the tests had to be taken the next day. In the TCC, I met with a representative of the battalion, and he offered me to serve in it. I agreed, got the attitude and went to the training center, after which I got into the battalion, everything was as it should be. Is it difficult? It is difficult, but useful. I listen a lot, I try to remember everything,- says Vlad. According to Oleg, deputy chief of staff of the battalion for mobilization work, Vlad's case is not an isolated one. -Our vacancies are on many sites. Now they have also appeared on Army+. If a person is interested in them, write to us. I contact her, ask questions, send a questionnaire. A person is filling it out, and at this time I am checking it on the website of court decisions to weed out people who want to hide in the army from some administrative or criminal cases. If the person is suitable for us, then we will provide them with a letter of recommendation. This is an official document with a registration number and seal. With it, a person goes to the TCC. If he is going to sign a contract, then he will 100% come to us. As for mobilization, there are options, because the General Staff can decide that some brigade needs more replenishment. That's why I always recommend a contract. For the most part, the positions of clerks, UAV operators, and drivers are filled with us through recruiting. There are less snipers or shooters,- said Oleg. Training on the range ends with firing from a Browning machine gun. The guys come two by two, squat down, the instructors show how to prepare the machine gun for battle, how to aim and how to fire. Short bursts fly towards the targets. Some of the cartridges are tracers to make it easier to adjust the fire. -Browning- shoots loudly, out of habit it can cover your ears a little. But the work of the machine gun, it is far from the loudest thing that can happen in the positions. Recruits are animated, they are interested in shooting with a machine gun. Someone sits on a box, someone kneels, short queues, shell casings fly. Fighters listen to the advice of instructors, adjust their fire. Today they still have grenade throwing here at the training ground. And in the evening, classes on tactical medicine. The battalion tries to give its soldiers maximum skills that will help them in battle. And in just a week or two, the boys will be in combat positions. Hold the front and do not let the enemy into the operational space.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/pidmoga-pryjshla-yak-na-donechchyni-gotuyut-novobrancziv-do-realnoyi-vijny/	2024-11-24T20:55:44-08:00
Getting Closer to the Assault Rifle: Introducing the US Army's Newest 30mm Grenade Launcher	As said in a release posted on the Barrett portal, the new Squad Support Rifle System (SSRS) is designed to revolutionize the battlefield with its advanced capabilities and innovative design. This marks a significant step forward in the evolution of soldier protection systems, ArmyInform reports. Manufacturers classify the weapon as a -support rifle-, which is designed to fire both at enemy infantry and vehicles, as well as at drones. -We are pleased to partner with Barrett, the world's leading manufacturer of military weapons, to further advance our 30mm support rifle for the US Army's PGS program,- said Michael Merino, president of MARS Inc. Merino added that the companies are developing a solution that will significantly improve a soldier's ability to counter a wide range of threats on the battlefield. The PGS is a magazine-fed semi-automatic weapon that provides soldiers with greater accuracy and firepower. The grenade launcher is designed to engage targets at a distance of 35 meters to over half a kilometer, including enemy manpower hiding behind shelters. The PGS aims to offer a flat firing trajectory for faster and more accurate target engagement, reducing flight time for long-range shots. In addition, the PGS will include a sophisticated fire control system capable of programming shots and ammunition families for different tactical situations. The arsenal can include rounds for counter-defilade, close combat, and even armor-piercing charges or anti-drone (Counter-UAS) munitions. As inform the authors of the defense portal Army Recognition, the program reached its final stage when several companies such as FN America and Plumb Precision Products, submitted their own projects for evaluation by military experts. The new weapon is designed to participate in the PGS (Precision Grenadier System) tender, which is expected in fiscal year 2026, when the US Army will select the final candidate after a successful technology demonstration. The key to the design of the Barrett SSRS is its comfortable assault rifle-based design. The weapon has a stock in the rear, a magazine with five cartridges in the center and a barrel length of 305 mm. The grenade launcher is compact and versatile with a total length of 861 mm and a weight of only 6.3 kg. It can fire a variety of ammunition, including anti-aircraft shells, giving soldiers a decisive advantage on the battlefield. The weapon is also equipped with a Vortex Optics XM-157 scope, similar to the sight installed on the 6.8 mm machine gun XM7 army USA. This sight is used in the marksmanship developed under the Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) program. This optical enhancement further strengthens SSRS's ability to deliver precision in combat, aligning with the US Army's modernization goals. With Barrett leading a team of industry-leading partners, this next-generation grenade launcher will be a key component of future lethality systems in the U.S. Army soldier's arsenal, combining firepower, accuracy and safety on the modern battlefield. The US Army announced the launch of the PGS program in August 2024. It is worth reminding, as reported ArmyInform , the products of the arms company Barrett Firearms are on the list of about 20 samples of sniper and anti-materiel rifles, which from the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine were codified and accepted for use in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Should we give up propaganda: a military historian on the world experience of working with human con...	-We do not like to mention either the Soviet experience or the experience of other totalitarian states. But in reality, propaganda always works the same way. She worked in the same way in Ancient Rome, in European states, when the Crusades were being prepared. It worked like this in Europe during the 30 Years War. She worked like this during the First and Second World Wars. At the moment, certain democratic circles believe that the use of propaganda is unacceptable, although we see that no country in the world shies away from using propaganda. The only difference is that now the word -propaganda- has been replaced by the construct -strategic communications-. But the essence and methods have not changed from this. We can call them whatever we want, but these principles are absolutely constant, they have always worked the same way. And I don't think that Ukraine should give up on this, it's just that in the end we have to get used to the fact that evil should be called evil, and not the phrase -not everything is so clear-cut.- Good should be called good, struggle should be called struggle, one should go precisely to Victory. And then propaganda turns into just a tool. She is neither good nor bad. It is simply a tool for working with human consciousness. Likewise, someone may not like a scalpel. But the scalpel during surgery cannot be replaced by anything else. In the same way, nothing else can replace propaganda in working with consciousness.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/chy-varto-vidmovytys-vid-propagandy-militarnyj-istoryk-pro-svitovyj-dosvid-roboty-z-lyudskoyu-svidomistyu/	2024-11-24T20:29:15-08:00

Serhii, the spokesman of the volunteer Ukrainian army -South- told about this in ArmiyaTV stream Bratchuk -The week is passing... under the sign of a certain hysteria in the media that the enemy is preparing a large-scale massive offensive on the regional center of Zaporizhzhia.

The number of Russian shelling of Sloviansk increased this week — MBA	The head of the city's military administration, Vadym Lyakh, said this on -Society. Studio-. -As a rule, it is not one bomb, several of them arrive at a time.

How is preparation for takmed: a master class from instructors -Kabana- and-Puma-	Such training of fighters already after arriving from the training center to the battalion is a mandatory element of continued training. No soldier will go on combat missions until he has received additional training, including tactical medicine. The instructors told the correspondents of ArmiyaInform how the training in the technical field takes place and why it is necessary for every fighter newly arrived in the battalion. During training, those who have well mastered the basics of tactical medicine during BZVP have the opportunity and will be able to refresh and consolidate their knowledge. Those who were less attentive and diligent must make up for lost time. — Such training takes place with all newcomers. We work in small groups - from 4‒6 to a maximum of 10 fighters in order to be able to pay attention to everyone, says Vladyslava. Medics must firmly make sure that newly arrived fighters at a sufficient level have mastered the necessary set of knowledge, abilities and skills in order to be able to provide first aid to themselves or a brother in case of injury. To do this, with each successive group of replenishment, they go through the same set of classes, exercises and training again and again. After all, as the Ukrainian proverb says: -Until you try, you won't know how.- — With beginners, we always go through the MARCH algorithm and consolidate knowledge and practice skills in practice. This is necessary so that they do not get lost in the position and during combat, so that everything is done as correctly as possible, she says. — When newcomers come, we treat them as if they know absolutely nothing. We understand that they have already received training at the BZVP, but we need to make sure of the level of their knowledge acquisition, - explains the head of the medical center, Senior Lieutenant Yuriy Faustus. This is why medics work in small groups, which, moreover, can be divided into pairs in such a way that the fighters train on each other and check each other. — Today they listen with interest, work responsibly. Therefore, it was easy to train them - they helped each other, applied tourniquets, made bandages. They themselves checked whether the tourniquet was put on properly, -Puma- says with satisfaction. New arrivals are different, doctors explain. It is easier for someone to explain everything and to teach what is necessary, but for someone it is necessary to force. It's not so bad when a person can't do something, they note - it's much worse if he doesn't want to learn. Not everyone immediately understands where they got to, that they are really at war. Therefore, sometimes it is necessary to force. It is very bad when a person himself does not realize how terrible the consequences of his negligence can be, doctors are convinced. — We must teach all those who come to us so that they do not get lost in combat conditions. Of course, they are not seeing these tourniquets and bandages for the first time, but we understand very well that time and opportunities to bring knowledge and skills to a perfect level are not always enough, - explains Vladyslava. She does not hide that not only the attitude of the fighters, but also the level of their training after passing the BZVP can be different. There are those who after the training center really have a sufficient level of knowledge and skills, but there are also those who wasted their time and did not learn even the most necessary minimum at a sufficient level. — There are cases when they think that they only have to learn how to shoot from an automatic machine, and they don't really need everything else. I encountered this quite often. Because of this, we make sure to train all new arrivals and then try to repeat them every time the opportunity arises, says Yuriy. Because of this attitude, some have to be forced to learn through disciplinary measures. Instead, it's always nice to have one or two motivated fighters in a training group who set the tone and become an example for others to follow. — What is important for us is what we have taught them now, what we have taught them right here. Because we understand that from now on the responsibility for their training lies with us, emphasizes Puma. The truth of these words is confirmed by intensive training, during which Yuriy and Vladislava give 100%, either working with the whole group of fighters at the same time, or by dividing them into pairs or singling out someone alone. It is noticeable that doctors treat their mission extremely responsibly and diligently.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/24/yak-vidbuvayetsya-pidgotovka-z-takmedu-majsterklas-vid-instruktoriv-kabana-tapumy/	2024-11-23T21:02:26-08:00
Barrage -Jackal-: a new high-precision missile with a turbojet engine was presented in the USA	As stated in the abstract of this project on the official portal of this corporation with headquarters in Virginia, the Jackal multi-purpose missile (-Шакал- in Ukrainian) can use both lethal and non-lethal payloads for a range of functions such as electronic warfare and reconnaissance, surveillance and intelligence (ISR), ArmyInform reported. Developed in cooperation with AeroVironment, this rocket uses the technological developments of the Switchblade series, a family of ammunition that has already proven itself well in practical applications. It should be noted that the Switchblade barrage drones (-Ejection Knife- in Ukrainian) have repeatedly dopomogy-na-13-mlrd/->included in the packages of weapons that were transferred to the Defense Forces as part of the foreign partnerships and about which our editors in detail she told in her publications. The Jackal missile features a modular configuration that allows integration of lethal and non-lethal payloads suitable for complex military operations. Thanks to its turbojet engine running on JP-10 fuel, the Jackal missile can reach a speed of more than 644 km/h, has a flight range of 100 kilometers and can stay in the air for about 15 minutes. Its useful load capacity is 4.5 kilograms. The open architecture of the Jackal missile allows for flexible integration of various payloads, including electronic warfare (EW) systems, reconnaissance, surveillance and intelligence (ISR) equipment. This missile can be deployed on air, land and sea platforms. The Jackal missile was first presented at the Special Operations Forces Industry Conference (SOFIC) in Tampa, Florida. in May 2022. As the manufacturer explains, the purpose of the Jackal missile was to fill the gap between existing ammunition, such as the Switchblade 300 and Switchblade 600, thanks to increased range, speed and versatility. While the Switchblade 300 is ideal for precision strikes at short ranges and is adept at dealing with armor, the Jackal strikes a balance between speed and payload as it can carry heavy warheads and other essential equipment over long distances while maintaining the flexibility needed to dynamic combat conditions. Moreover, as Northrop Grumman points out, the Jackal missile is an excellent choice for counter-terrorism missions, allowing it to gather valuable information in difficult environments for a long time before striking. As emphasize defense market researchers from the profile portal Army Recognition, this high-precision strike missile combines advanced avionics and flight control systems, designed for navigation in conditions where GPS is unavailable, ensuring operational reliability even when conventional navigation systems fail. The Jackal missile's next-generation flight control system offers advanced capabilities such as GPS-disabled navigation and an automatic targeting mechanism that is fine-tuned for target recognition, detection and enhanced situational awareness. Thanks to its high-speed turbojet engine, the Jackal missile quickly reaches targets, providing the necessary response to emerging threats, which is an important feature for maintaining tactical superiority in changing combat scenarios. Due to its modular design, the Jackal missile provides a variety of effects, both lethal and non-lethal. It autonomously follows set waypoints and can be reconfigured in flight depending on tactical tasks. Once a target is detected, the warhead reactively accelerates to intercept the target, setting new standards for tactical superiority in range, accuracy and speed. -Today's rapidly changing landscape requires multi-domain solutions that are flexible, resilient, and able to respond quickly to tactical demands to meet these demands. The Jackal missile is a next-generation high-precision strike missile that provides critical countermeasures in high-stress conditions when launched from air, land and sea platforms at a range of more than 100 km,- says a new video about this munition posted by Northrop Grumman on YouTube . According to Northrop Grumman, the Jackal missile has attracted a lot of military interest since its initial presentation. In November 2022, the system completed a series of successful test flights, and additional demonstrations are planned for 2024 to further improve its capabilities and bring it into line with potential US military missions. In the ever-changing conditions of warfare, the Jackal missile offers a cost-effective and versatile solution for modern armed forces, capable of delivering high-precision strikes and strategic surveillance at the same time, emphasizes Northrop Grumman.

How to become a reckless UAV pilot: tips from an instructor	- What qualities should a UAV operator have? - Let's start with the fact that UAVs are different. The main division is copters and -wings-. And, for example, the skills and mental toughness of FPV strike drone pilots and wing operators are exactly the opposite. Because, relatively speaking, if a person is determined to shoot videos for TikTok, scouting is not an option for him, because there will never be any interesting stories. To shoot such videos, you need to be either an FPV shooter or a fixer. And these are different professions. A scout actually needs a certain amount of boredom and a normal education. That is, if a person does not understand how radio waves work, he will not be able to fly an airplane. It is also necessary to understand that he will not have any spectacular heroism, but will stupidly and methodically perform the same work every day. And not everyone can stand it. I know that people have tried to switch from scouting boards to strike boards or tried to be transferred to artillery by adjusters. This also has to be done by someone, and if the person's character is more suited to it, this is the right decision. - What qualities do an FPV drone operator need? - FPV drone operator is probably one of the most difficult professions in terms of training. A pilot needs a certain recklessness. They are closer than anyone to the front line. It is necessary to dig a lot, to be able to quickly collect and assemble your household, to haul it, because it is a question of their survival, and you need to calmly treat the spectacle of human bodies torn to pieces. In fact, they are probably the last fighters in modern warfare who look the enemy in the eye before he dies. And I know that many people dream about it at night. - What should a person who wants to become a reconnaissance drone operator know? - The cadet should know that he will receive, as a rule, the task of scouting a specific area. That is, either to walk along such and such landings, or to explore such and such a settlement, or simply to conduct preliminary reconnaissance. Here, for example, we know that something was or can be at such and such coordinates. You fly everything again and find out - it's still there, or it's gone, or in that place where it was empty, something has appeared, or confirm the target has been hit. That is, we know that the REB was there, and you take off and find out why it turned off - or it died, or it left, or it is just silent. For his part, the -wings- operator must know the entire terrain of his unit in depth, in fact, reconnaissance, and another 20-30 percent, must clearly know the map in order to anchor at any moment and understand where he is. Simply because the Western fantasy that we will go to war for GPS has little to do with reality. You need to understand where you place your point so that, firstly, you are found as the latest, and secondly, so that you have time to leave this point in time. In other words, the scout does not sit in one place, unlike the adjuster. The task of a scout is to arrive, set up, and it is good if there is a shelter nearby, if there is not and there is no way to prepare it in advance, which, unfortunately, happens often, then he started from the ground, worked, quickly gathered and changed the location. It is advisable to make the second departure in a day from another place. - So that's all you teach your cadets? - Yes, that's exactly it. Here, for example, is the question of how to choose a position for an airplane. It should have many factors, in contrast to vertical take-off boards, such as -quadricopters-. You are tied not only to how to place the antennae, not only to how to place yourself so that you don't get killed. You are still tied to how you will raise and lower your plane based on today's wind. The position may be perfect for everyone, but you either can't raise the plane or you can't lower it. — What other qualities do cadets need? — Let me remind you that -wing- scouts need perseverance and attention, and FPV-schneiders need recklessness. These are incompatible qualities, so we divide the cadets immediately. Well, you need the ability to turn nuts, solder circuits, glue, etc. That is why people of working specialties who can fix something, if necessary, show themselves best in training. If a person still has some imagination to come up with a field upgrade on the plane, this is also a plus, because the shortcomings of the boards are compensated solely by the skills of the crew. — What percentage of cadets drop out during training? — There is a general rule: the cheaper and simpler the plane, the more difficult it is to learn to fly. The number of people who could not finish the course is quite large among the same FPV pilots, there are very difficult piloting skills. That is, what in more expensive boards is partly taken over by automation, you do everything yourself. The control complexity is about the same as that of World War II fighter jets. But overall, not very much. - What are the age restrictions for cadets? - I will say yes. For -wings-, age is not a critical factor. For FPV, this is actually more critical because, once again, there is no automation, and the speed of reaction is very important. That's why people often don't pull because of their age, people with concussions don't pull, people with a bad vestibular apparatus don't pull. Simply because, when you look at this screen, where everything swings around you at full height, it can really make you feel sick and sick. - How long does the training take? - Currently one and a half months. It is possible to train a person from zero to a pilot who will perform the task in that time, and it is almost always successful.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/24/yak-staty-bezshabashnym-pilotom-bpla-porady-instruktora/	2024-11-23T20:33:19-08:00
The Ministry of Defense named the most popular combat specialties for which women entered in 2024	The Department of Military Education and Science of the Ministry of Defense informed ArmiyaInform about this. -The most popular among women were the majors and specializations that prepare commanders of mechanized units, units of Airborne Assault Forces and Special Operations Forces,- the department noted. In 2024, the number of women enrolled in higher military educational institutions, military educational units of higher education institutions, and professional advanced military education institutions of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine system was 31.5%, which is 3.2% more than last year. Earlier ArmyInform reported that at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petr Sahaidachny, many women study such combat specializations, as -Complexes, devices and devices of artillery reconnaissance-, -Management of the actions of artillery units- and -Management of the actions of mechanized troops units-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/24/u-minoborony-nazvaly-najpopulyarnishi-bojovi-speczialnosti-na-yaki-vstupaly-zhinky-u-2024-roczi/	2024-11-23T20:21:40-08:00
The enemy spreads lies about -provocations- in the capital	The training of all structures, forces and departments, which are working out measures to counter provocations that Putin's fakers are constantly seeing, has really begun in Kyiv. As noted the head of KMVA Serhii Popko, these trainings are conducted with the aim of increasing the level of skills, interaction and combat capabilities of all structures that ensure the defense of the capital. Such trainings will continue to be held systematically in Kyiv. They are needed to better prepare for the important task of protecting Kyiv and its residents from potential threats. Therefore, for everyone who works for the enemy in Kyiv, they definitely pose a danger. After all, sooner or later all separatists and collaborators will be discovered and severely punished. But the purpose of the lies spread by faikomets is to sow distrust of the population in the authorities and the Defense Forces. Such -throwbacks- are a typical reaction of the enemy to the strengthening of Ukraine's defense capabilities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/24/vorog-poshyryuye-brehnyu-shhodo-provokaczij-u-stolyczi/	2024-11-23T20:05:23-08:00
Falling drones due to the work of friendly EW: how to solve the problem	He told this in an interview with Grunt media. -We all understand very well that our EW, at a short distance to the battle line, is fighting enemy UAVs, anti-aircraft missiles, other types of enemy missiles and vehicles. Therefore, in order to work, we always have to personally establish interaction with such units on horizontal lines,- he noted. According to him, it sometimes happens that their groups directly in the execution area come into contact with each neighboring unit, and only then use their means. As reported by ArmyInform, Charlie previously told that over the past year and a half, Russian invaders have learned to quickly adapt and modernize drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/__trashed-3/	2024-11-23T11:27:05-08:00
Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the G20 summit because of weak support for Ukraine	He said about this while communicating with journalists within the framework of the Third Grain from Ukraine International Conference. The head of state noted that the majority of the Brazilian people support Ukraine, and thanked him for that. At the same time, in his opinion, President Lula da Silva of Brazil, the country that currently chairs the G20 and hosted the summit, has shown a weak stance on the war. -If we want good, normal relations between our nations, between our peoples, then we should probably support people first of all, and not aggressors, leaders of aggression in the world, such as Putin, such as today's, modern Russia,- explained the President of Ukraine . According to him, the weakness shown during the G20 summit gave the Russian dictator the opportunity to hit Ukraine with new missiles during the meeting of the G20 leaders. -I don't think that populism can stop Putin. I don't think cheap energy is going to protect your freedom in the long run. I believe that this is a wrong move,- the head of state noted. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also emphasized: when there will be strong statements, calls and steps, the Russian dictator will not be able to behave as he is doing now. In addition, the President noted that Ukraine raised the issue of reforming the UN Security Council due to its ineffectiveness. -Everyone is talking about this, but the reform of the UN Security Council is not taking place. There are players who do not want any reforms, because otherwise their influence will be less,- said the head of state. The President of Ukraine added that every two or three months, Putin escalates on the front in order to raise the stakes and not sit down at the negotiating table. Without a clear position of the major countries - the United States, Brazil, Asian and African countries - the agreement with Putin will be a delay and a continuation of Russian intimidation. At the same time, all steps proposed by Ukraine to end the war are based on the UN Charter. Our country hopes that its partners will support them. As reported by ArmyInform, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky supports the transition to the corps control system in the ZSU, if it reduces bureaucracy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/volodymyr-zelenskyj-rozkrytykuvav-samit-g20-cherez-slabku-pidtrymku-ukrayiny/	2024-11-23T11:17:17-08:00

We try to move away from the specialization of the military for which we produce awards. We also introduce our Ukrainian traditions to encourage soldiers to study history,- he said. According to Maxim Kayol, their task is to make such an award so that the serviceman, when receiving it, feels that the state appreciated what he did. -It's a war right now, so it's very important. And all of this also happens immediately upon contact with the relevant type of troops. They look, we definitely agree with them. If they don't like something, we do it so that everyone is satisfied, there are standards, and our Ukrainian symbols are deployed in the Armed Forces of Ukraine,- he summarized.

-Generals should be in the trenches-: Volodymyr Zelenskyy supports the transition to a corps managem...	About this head of state said during a meeting with media representatives within the framework of the Third International Conference on Food Security Grain from Ukraine. -This is for the military to decide. If the corps system they are proposing today will reduce the distance between the general and the soldier, if this bureaucracy will be reduced, let them do so to reduce it,- the head of state noted. The president emphasized that the task now is to reduce bureaucracy in the army. In particular, this should be taken care of by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrskyi. -An officer must see a soldier. A general who has not been in the trenches is not a general for me personally. Despite the experience. With all due respect. Today, the most difficult situation is on the front line, in the trenches,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi noted. According to the President, it is necessary not only to talk about problematic issues at Stavka or in the command headquarters, but also to communicate directly with the soldiers. -That's why Syrsky is always at the front, always traveling. We communicate with him every day, twice a day. He has a morning and evening report. But still this is not enough. The generals must be in the trenches. This is the war. The morale of the military is the most important,- the President emphasized. He also emphasized that Putin's main task now is to oust the Ukrainian military from the Kursk region, and by January 20. -It is very important for him to demonstrate that he is in control of the situation. He is not in control of the situation. The Kursk operation is not a toy. We have shown that Putin is unable to fully defend his state. He threw everything at the occupation and destruction of Ukraine,- the head of state said. In addition, as the President of Ukraine noted, the Russian dictator wants to show that he will allegedly achieve the stated goal of occupying the entire Donbas. -From this and our respective results. Difficulties in the East, yes. Not enough armed forces there, yes. Understaffing exists for a variety of reasons. Specifically, delayed delivery, yes. But nevertheless we are there. We are defending our homeland. And under Putin, there have never been such losses as today in the Kursk direction,- the President summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the Third International Summit on Food Security Grain from Ukraine metwith the minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic Jan Lipavsky and discussed cooperation between Ukraine and the Czech Republic.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/generaly-mayut-buty-v-okopah-volodymyr-zelenskyj-pidtrymuye-perehid-na-korpusnu-systemu-upravlinnya-v-zsu/	2024-11-23T10:25:41-08:00
Dodgers in rubber flip-flops were looking for safe shallow water on the Tisza in the snow	About this informs the State Border Service of Ukraine. According to law enforcement officials, the organizers of the illegal crossing offered a rubber boat and instructions on -safe shallow water- for 10,000 US dollars each. The total amount that the violators paid amounted to more than 400 thousand hryvnias. Four men, three from Donetsk region and one from Ivano-Frankivsk region, agreed to these risky conditions. Their plans were destroyed by the border guards who spotted the trespassers. After several warning shots were fired, the offenders left the boat and tried to escape, but were apprehended. The detainees were taken to the border unit, where administrative protocols were drawn up on them under Art. 204-1 of the Criminal Procedure Code (-Illegal crossing or attempted illegal crossing of the state border of Ukraine-) and Art. 185-10 of the Criminal Procedure Code (-Malicious disobedience to a lawful order or demand of a military serviceman or an employee of the State Border Service-). The court will soon evaluate the actions of the detainees. In the meantime, operatives continue their investigation to identify the individuals involved in the organization of this illegal border crossing attempt.

We have established requirements for their reliability. They were being tested. We have a desire to contribute to our Victory,- he said. The Ministry of Defense also created the Internet platform -Partner MOU-. -Through this platform we work. All requests, all submissions of documents for acts, for military experimental tests must be made through the -MoU Partner-. Why? Because this program is tracked, no applications, no documents will be lost,- he explained. In addition, a technical committee consisting of 11 specialists was established in the MOU for each sector. -They investigate each issue, then meet and make a decision as to compliance or non-compliance. Does this product go to military trials or not; or maybe it needs to be refined. That is, we have created a system that is as transparent as possible, we involve the maximum number of people,- he noted. According to him, in order to prevent corruption, they also involve the Command of the Logistics Forces, the Central Office of Quality Control, the State Rear Operator, so that everyone is in the process and understands what is happening in the MOU.

About this told the head of the Central Directorate for the Development of Material Support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant Colonel Maksym Caiola during SMALL TALK. According to him, there will be very big changes in material support, the wishes of the fighters -from the fields- were taken into account. -They have requests to make normal pants with built-in knee pads. The combat shirt will be made of -Coolmax- fabric for moisture removal. Now we are fruitfully working on means of personal protection, such as bulletproof vests and helmets. We have already developed and implemented 8 samples of bulletproof vests and 8 samples of helmets,- said Maxim Kayola. He also reported that a -special ballistic suit- with better protection against shrapnel is currently under development, as shrapnel damage is the predominant one. In addition, a -universal awning- and a -special suit to provide protection against thermal imaging systems- are under development. According to him, this is what our army needs very much. And the task of the management of the development of material support to implement this by the end of the year will be fulfilled. -Also, we are currently developing a women's bulletproof vest. This is very important, because the anthropometric data of women must be taken into account. This is necessary so that it is a little lighter, fits well. So that a woman can perform her tasks like a military serviceman,- emphasized Maxim Kayola. Currently, a -summer special suit- has been developed for women with requirements for their figure. This suit has already been purchased, it is in stock, it is already issued. Management is currently working on underwear for cool and cold winter, winter jacket and pants. -We have anticipated everything our servicewomen want. We will now conduct military experiments, both in the war zone and in the rear areas. After all, before developing something, we always communicate with people from different families, types of troops, to understand what they need, what they want. And they should make what they will use, not what they receive and put somewhere in the closet,- explained Maxim Kayola. As reported by ArmiyaInform, previously the head of the Central Department for the Development of Material Support of the IOM told about the food standards in the army and the developments that are currently being introduced to them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/kostyumy-iz-zahystom-vid-oskolkiv-ta-teplovizijnyh-system-zhinochyj-bronezhylet-novi-rozrobky-minoborony/	2024-11-23T09:02:54-08:00

Decoy drones, repeaters, new enemy tactics: how the occupiers are modernizing UAVs	the commander of the 14th separate regiment of unmanned aviation complexes of the SBS of the Armed Forces of Ukraine told about it under the pseudonym -Charlie- in an interview with -Grunt- media. -For example, a year ago they used exclusively their -geranium-shaheds-, and now they have changed their tactics a little: they put various types of equipment on their shaheds, put video communication channels that help them detect various moments on our territory,- he noted . According to him, the first few drones are -going for detection-, other drones are already directed directly to the target. -They use baits, this was not the case before. That is, decoy drones are launched in front of the Shaheds, which discharge our air defense system,- explained Charlie. As he noted, if we talk about Russian intelligence tools, they are modernizing visual surveillance systems that allow them to work in different weather conditions, time of day and observe at a greater distance. They also use different types of repeaters that allow them to fly over long distances. -Today, we see that their reconnaissance drones directly fly to such cities as Dnipro, Poltava. Therefore, unfortunately, they are not in place,- Charlie emphasized. However, according to him, thanks to caring people and organizations that help the Defense Forces, an effective system for countering the enemy's reconnaissance UAVs is currently set up. In addition, the commander of the 14th separate regiment of the BpAK spoke about providing his unit with -wings-. -50 percent is provided by measures from the side of partners, if we are talking specifically about intelligence wings. 50% are partners, 30% are the state and 20% are volunteers,- he said. We will remind, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have started work first training school for operators of unmanned ground robotic complexes (BpNK). As reported by ArmyInform, in the Forces of unmanned systems name the specialists who are in the greatest need: drivers of various categories, clerks, repairmen of various electrical appliances.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/drony-prymanky-retranslyatory-nova-taktyka-voroga-yak-okupanty-modernizuyut-bpla/	2024-11-23T08:08:17-08:00
Torture, abuse and training -specialists-: the GUR spoke about the torture system of the Russian Fed...	told this during a speech at the forum -Genocidal practices of the Russian Federation in Ukraine: from the Holodomor to Russian-Ukrainian War- representative of the State Department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Andriy Yusov. He cited the facts about the system of violating the rights of prisoners built in the Russian Federation. -In most cases, it was not about the use of force to obtain information. These are intentional tortures to break a person's resistance, break their personality, degrade their dignity and force them to give up everything that is valuable to that person. Or to break someone who is close to him,- said Andriy Yusov. According to him, a whole system of torture operates in the aggressor country. -Individuals are responsible for this. This is how individual -specialists- are trained - the types of torture are described, and they learn from them. This is something that cannot be imagined by any representative of a Western civilized country,- he noted. Andriy Yusov also noted that the structures responsible for monitoring the observance and protection of the Geneva Conventions and humanitarian law do not actually work. -Yes, we are talking about the International Committee of the Red Cross, which Russia, on the one hand, is effectively depriving it of the opportunity to work: it does not allow access to places of detention, does not involve it in training and exchanges. At the same time, the position of the ICRC, frankly speaking, in many cases should be much more proactive,- stressed Andriy Yusov. He emphasized that it is not Ukraine as a victim that should talk about the recorded -absolutely flagrant- examples of violations of the Geneva Conventions on the part of the Russian Federation, but those structures that are responsible for monitoring their observance and implementation. He reminded that even in these difficult conditions, Ukraine continues to work on the return from captivity of our captured defenders and kidnapped civilians. During the full-scale invasion, 58 exchanges already took place: almost 4 thousand Ukrainians managed to return home. -Unfortunately, thousands of others are still in question. And it is necessary to fight for them: both for the military and for the civilians,- emphasized Andriy Yusov. We will remind you that in October-November of this year 13 criminal proceedings were registered /a> according to the facts of the shooting of 54 Ukrainian prisoners of war. This is a third of all proceedings initiated in 2024 on such facts. As reported by ArmyInform, the Prosecutor General's Office reported on the initiated investigation into the fact shooting by Russian servicemen of five captured soldiers of the Armed Forces near Vugledar.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/tortury-znushhannya-i-pidgotovka-speczialistiv-u-gur-rozpovily-pro-systemu-katuvan-rf/	2024-11-23T07:54:50-08:00

This is due to the fact that there are new challenges in the troops, new tasks, new strategy, new tactics. -Basically, our task is to make the use of food supply effective and appropriate, so that the fighters are well provided with caloric, quality and diverse food products,- Maksym Kayola noted. He said that dry food kits, so-called -sukhpai- - halal and kosher - are now being introduced for people with special religious beliefs. Such attention of the military leadership to their needs significantly increases morale. -This was implemented at the behest of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, because he wants to provide for all families, types of troops, servicemen of all religious beliefs. We are also currently working on introducing a vegan menu for people who do not use products of animal origin according to their beliefs. But for this we need to change the -normatives-, we are working on this,- added the head of the Central Department for the Development of Material Support of the Ministry of Education and Culture.

As a result, it is being destroyed, the military said. The drone commander reported what percentage of Russian equipment is destroyed on the battlefield. -Statistics say that 90-95% of lightly armored and armored vehicles that end up in the affected area burn up on the battlefield or are seriously damaged,- he said.

Shooting lists and mobile crematoria: Russia planned the genocide of Ukrainians long before the inva...	This was announced the head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov, during the forum -Genocidal Practices Russian Federation in Ukraine: from the Holodomor to the Russian-Ukrainian War-, which took place on November 22, 2024. According to Kirill Budanov, the preparation included the creation of firing lists, the deployment of mobile mobile crematoria and the organization of mass burials. Russian propaganda and the state machine called for the destruction of Ukrainians, based on theses voiced in Putin's article published in July 2021. In this article, the Russian dictator denied the right of Ukrainians to exist, which became the ideological basis of future crimes. Kyrylo Budanov noted that total Ukrainophobia has become not only the policy of the Russian authorities, but also a mandatory public conviction. Before the start of the invasion, the occupiers were briefed on the location of mass graves and the compilation of firing lists. They planned to include Ukrainian language and literature teachers, ATO veterans, journalists, priests, public figures and others who supported Ukrainian statehood. The head of the GUR MOU emphasized that the mass crimes of the Russian military in Buch, Borodyanka, Gostomel, Izyum, Mariupol and other cities were not chaotic, but planned and synchronous. These actions were based on the doctrinal provisions of the Russian genocidal policy. The forum, in addition to military experts, was attended by Holodomor researchers, historians, public representatives and foreign guests, who discussed the crimes of the Russian government against the Ukrainian people, which have continued since the Holodomor until today. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov addressed Ukrainians on the Holodomor Memorial Day, emphasizing the importance of preserving historical memory and countering Russian aggression.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/rozstrilni-spysky-ta-mobilni-krematoriyi-rosiya-planuvala-genoczyd-ukrayincziv-zadovgo-do-vijny/	2024-11-23T01:33:07-08:00
An ambulance that will not come: Russia has brought a decline in the medicine of the occupied Luhans...	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. In many cities, even before, only one ambulance crew was on duty per shift, as a result of which calls often went unanswered, and patients waited for hours. Tragic cases when people did not wait for a doctor have repeatedly become a reason for criticism. Although the number of special vehicles allegedly increased on paper, the real ambulances provided by Russia disappeared without a trace. Instead, doctors, paramedics and drivers are now being cut. In Starobilsk, air alerts are regularly announced, even when there is no threat in the neighboring areas or in the entire -rear- part of the -LNR-. During such events, propaganda meetings are held in schools, during which children are moved to damp, unfurnished basements, where anti-Ukrainian lectures are organized. In addition, the occupation administration regularly organizes meetings of children with the Russian military, using them to plant propaganda. These actions of the occupiers cause increasing indignation among the population, which is faced with the decline of the medical field and aggressive propaganda in educational institutions. As reported by ArmyInform, in Alchevsk, as well as in other settlements of the temporarily occupied Luhansk region, the situation with the removal of garbage has remained critical for more than ten years. Spontaneous landfills continue to grow, and instead of solving the problem the occupation administration chose the path of repression, installing more than 100 video surveillance cameras to fine citizens for littering.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/shvydka-shho-ne-pryyide-rosiya-prynesla-zanepad-u-medyczyni-okupovanoyi-luganshhyny/	2024-11-23T01:11:12-08:00

The officer explained the purpose of the Russian invaders. - They are there in a certain waiting mode, while the strike group is assembled, which begins active operations from the front. And that's when they step up to destabilize the situation, damage our reserves, mortars and other firepower, the military said. However, the Defense Forces are well aware of this insidious enemy tactic and effectively counter it. — Since we are talking about this with you, the Defense Forces are very well aware of such tactics of the enemy, since he has been using them since the beginning of an essentially full-scale war. Only now it is gaining a larger volume, said the commander of the Ukrainian drones. Ukrainian defenders timely detect the occupiers hidden in the pixel and eliminate them or capture them. - The vast majority of these groups are detected by the Defense Forces, eliminated and captured when the opportunity arises. But not all of them surrender, so they are mostly liquidated, said Yuriy Fedorenko. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that occupiers dressed in Ukrainian uniforms are effectively detected on the field battle.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/aktyvizuyutsya-shhob-destabilizuvaty-sytuacziyu-yak-diyut-perevdyagnuti-u-piksel-okupanty/	2024-11-22T23:57:11-08:00

Kupyan adventure in kamikaze mode: the Armed Forces explained how the Russians managed to jump into ...	told the commander of the battalion of strike unmanned aviation complexes of the 92nd separate brigade named after the Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirk Yuriy Fedorenko told about this. — The situation unfolded as follows: taking advantage of the unfavorable weather conditions - the fog, which was thick enough, the enemy in kamikaze mode used one unit of armored equipment, such as a tank with trawls that removes mine barriers, and two MTLB. These are combat armored vehicles for transporting, in particular, infantry units, he said. For the place of an unexpected attack, the enemy chose an area least suitable for the use of armored vehicles. -At high speed, [the Russians] jumped in at the place that is the least passable for lightly armored and armored vehicles,- explained the soldier. However, as soon as the equipment and manpower of the occupiers were discovered by the fighters of the Defense Forces, the enemy was inflicted with fire damage. The equipment was burned, and the landing party was partly destroyed, partly captured. - As soon as they crossed this line, they were detected by the Defense Forces, after which a fire was inflicted, as a result of which the tank was burned, two MTLBs were burned, and the enemy's assault infantry was eliminated, - Yuriy Fedorenko said.

Is it possible to freeze the war: the expert told when the new phase of the conflict will begin	-There will be a great truce after all. We will not miss it. Why? In order for it not to exist, the Russian Federation must lose the war. The loss in the war of the Russian Federation, if we go to the borders of 1991, is its disintegration. It is reinforced concrete. But there is no solution to its disintegration. If there is no such solution, then in some part there will be a frozen conflict - exit from the phase of hostilities. As soon as this -freeze- or suspension of hostilities takes place, both we and they will go into military capacity building. It will be so without fail. And if at this moment of the historic truce a decision is not taken on the collapse of the Russian Federation, then the next Russian-Ukrainian war is only a matter of time. It can be in half a year, it can be in a year. I am a fan of the version that is at least five years old. Because they still have to recover. At this moment, the Russian Federation has lost within 50% of its convention potential. With the exception of nuclear. It is still very powerful - the second on the planet Earth. Because this war will only end when they are defeated or get their way. That is, they will join Ukraine to Russia. But, in my opinion, this is already impossible in this historical context. For two simple reasons. First, we are supported by the entire civilized world. And primarily the Anglo-Saxons. This is very fundamental. And the second important point is that we managed to keep the capital. There is even such a historical saying: -who owns Kyiv, owns Ukraine.- They are doomed to defeat. The only question is when this defeat will come. But they cannot refuse us, because it is part of their social ideology. Lenin has a brilliant saying for this case: -losing Ukraine is the same as losing one's head.- State identity is the most powerful feature of any human community. And their state identity sprouts from the concept of our Kyivan Rus. That's how everything will be. I am sure that in the next phase of the war we will achieve a historic victory.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/chy-mozhlyva-zamorozka-vijny-ekspert-rozpoviv-koly-rozpochnetsya-nova-faza-konfliktu/	2024-11-22T21:12:50-08:00
Ready for any mission: a surveillance drone with ultra-fast transformation properties was presented ...	Presenting its aircraft, this firm, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, on the official portal said's Group 2 eVTOL autonomous drone, the P550, redefines battlefield adaptability, setting a new standard for rapid deployment in any environment, ArmyInform reports. The goal of the new P550 project was to create an unmanned aircraft with high flight and operational characteristics. Representatives of AeroVironment note that there are already UAVs on the market that are equipped with effective reconnaissance and/or weapons, as well as devices capable of flying for several hours. Within the framework of the new project, the company sought to combine all these qualities in one drone. To simplify the design process, the design of the P550 used many ideas and components from existing products. The main sources were drones well-known in the United States military Puma and Raven by AeroVironment. At the same time, it was not possible without the introduction of new solutions and components. As a result, a medium-sized UAV was created, capable of vertical takeoff and landing, as well as a horizontal flight lasting several hours. The P550 may carry reconnaissance equipment, a communications relay, light weapons, or other equipment. Currently, the new UAV is undergoing flight tests, during which it demonstrates its capabilities and confirms the correctness of the applied technical solutions. After the tests are completed, the company will be able to offer this drone to potential customers. For obvious reasons, the main commercial hopes are tied to the Pentagon. The P550 product is an unmanned aircraft with a classic aerodynamic scheme. At the same time, its design has some features due to which additional working and operational capabilities are achieved, as well as important advantages are provided. The P550 UAV has a torpedo-shaped fuselage, complemented by a thin tubular tail beam. A mid-positioned wing with a slight sweep is combined with the fuselage. Near the centerplane on the wing are two compact nacelles of marching engines. At a distance from them, longer gondolas with lifting propeller groups are placed. Tail feathers are traditional, with stabilizer and keel. For transportation, the drone is separated into several units. All of them fit into three containers that can be transported by any vehicle. Pre-launch assembly takes minutes and is done without any tools: it takes less than 10 minutes to prepare for flight after unpacking. The total length of such a drone reaches 2.7 m, the wingspan is 4.25 m. The maximum take-off weight is set at 25 kg and includes a significant payload. For example, a drone can carry up to 7 kilograms of explosives. The AeroVironment company classifies the P550 as the 2nd group of UAVs according to the Pentagon's classification. The drone has six traction electric motors with propellers. Four are placed on wing nacelles and provide vertical take-off, landing and hovering. Two more are on the wing and provide horizontal flight. Engine types and specifications are not disclosed. The flight data of the UAV is also still unknown. It was only reported that the P550 will be able to stay in the air for up to 5 hours. The communication range is 40 km, but can be increased to 60 km. In all configurations and configurations, the drone has an autopilot and a remote control system. They must interact with the operator and carry out his commands, as well as control the payload of all types in solving any assigned tasks. The control panel reportedly has software to automatically process intelligence data. A special program based on artificial intelligence should study the picture from the cameras and look for potential targets to hit on it. Such software should simplify the operator's work and increase the speed of the entire unmanned intelligence system. The issue of installing and replacing the payload is solved in a rather interesting way. A removable part of the fuselage, which includes the nose fairing and part of the bottom, is designated for the placement of various devices. The module with the necessary equipment is attached to the centerplane of the wing, and the UAV receives the necessary functions. All module variants are equipped with optical-electronic systems. -Bullets- of various types carry video cameras, thermal imagers and/or laser rangefinders. It is possible to use other equipment. So, at the AUSA 2024 exhibition, as the Shephard publication informs, showed modules with a radio signal repeater and a weapons carrier module. The combat variant of the P550 carries a swappable module with a pair of pylons on the bottom. At the exhibition UAV on them placed Shryke-type small-scale guided bombs. The principle possibility of using other ammunition is reported. AeroVironment is currently studying such possibilities and plans to expand its range of repellents. The company AeroVironment proposes to use its new P550 UAV in military units at the tactical level. With its help, the army units will be able to effectively solve several basic tasks, and it is expected that the efficiency of such processes will increase. The successful application of the new UAV should be facilitated by its high characteristics as an aerial platform. This drone is easy to operate, able to take off from small areas and stay in the air for several hours. Not all modern drones of this class can boast of such capabilities. Three variants of variable payload modules have already been created for the P550. With their help, the drone can perform various tasks: conduct reconnaissance, target guidance, relay signals or use weapons. The ability to solve various tasks with one UAV as such is a plus. In addition, they have their own capabilities and advantages of various modules, devices and weapons. The automation of intelligence processes is of great interest. It is claimed that the software of the unmanned complex is capable of analyzing images from optical-electronic systems and finding various objects. If this feature is fully implemented, the P550 will become a much more user-friendly reconnaissance tool and give it a significant advantage over the competition. However, the P550 has its drawbacks. Its main problems are common to all such UAVs. First of all, this is the dependence on radio communication and vulnerability for modern air defense. In addition, this project implements several bold ideas that may have some technical risk. Therefore, the AeroVironment company continues to develop existing UAVs and create new models based on them. During these processes, innovative solutions and technologies are developed and implemented, aimed at improving the main characteristics and expanding working capabilities. Another result of such activity was shown in October at the exhibition AUSA 2024 . Now the new UAV P550 must go through all the necessary tests and confirm the declared potential. And even after that, future customers have to decide whether they need such a smart and versatile new drone. Reconnaissance and strike unmanned aerial vehicle P550.

- Adrenaline is going through the roof. Class!-: paintball training was included in the combat train...	According to the plan of the institute's management, the training was supposed to stimulate team actions of cadets in combat groups during search and sweep in an urbanized area. Practical training is based on the scenarios of real combat experience of teachers. Reconciliation, cohesion, mutual support and mutual assistance are the main priorities in the training of future officers. -Alone in the field is not a warrior! Only the team wins. This should be the philosophy of the signalman's victory,- says the deputy head of the institute for psychological support of personnel, Colonel Oleg Petrovskyi. He is convinced that only practical work on training grounds can form a new quality of servicemen, give them the necessary skills to handle weapons in extreme combat conditions. Almost an hour of grueling confrontation between yellow and blue: conventional opponents, but with real physical and psycho-emotional stress. In addition to the tasks of destroying a hypothetical enemy, the cadets practiced the basics of first aid in the area under fire in the scope of self and mutual aid. -For the first few minutes, I couldn't calm myself down, then I was panting, I remembered what was taught at the institute during combat and psychological training, and - I rushed! - says one of the cadets. The guys willingly share their thoughts: -And even though you understand the conventionality of the fight, the adrenaline still goes through the roof. Class!- Military psychologists call this method operational stress sensitization. It is the best practical method of entering the military profession and forming combat readiness. Practicing tactical actions by cadets in the conditions of intense training combat also ensures the development of critically needed marksmanship skills. Paintball training has already been included in the combat training program of the institute and consistently arouses great interest among cadets.

Rams interfere the most in combat shootings: about the features of BZVP at Interflex in Britain	ArmyInform correspondent tells about the firing of live cartridges during the BZVP within the framework of the Interflex multinational training mission in Great Britain. Firing live rounds is the final element of the entire training course of basic general military training. By this time, the soldiers have been regularly dealing with weapons for several weeks and have fired at least 700−800, and some even 1000−1200 blank cartridges during training exercises. While we fire blanks during tactical exercises, practice changing magazines, and cleaning our assault rifles, the instructors keep a close eye on how we treat weapons and follow safety rules. Even though the grades are not reported to us, it is clear from the comments themselves that the instructors grade us quite meticulously. It is noticeable that they observe and record all our actions, discuss us among themselves and inform each other about the positive features and problematic points in the training of each cadet. So when it comes to combat shooting, no one causes I am surprised that one soldier from the platoon is not allowed to join them. Systematic indiscipline and inattention to weapons take their toll - he does not go to the range on any of the following days, during which there is intense firing with live ammunition. of us For some, they also related to the handling of weapons, but everyone tried to correct mistakes and eliminate shortcomings. It seems that he is the only one not only for the entire first platoon, but also for the entire company, because everyone else has well learned the basic rules of behavior with weapons. Some may be less skilled or accurate than others, but they certainly won't pose a danger through carelessness or sloppiness. Safety rules at British shooting ranges are quite strict and foreign instructors strictly enforce them. At the same time, the control is triple. We are watched by the British, as representatives of the host country, the instructors of the country that conduct the training, as well as the Ukrainian instructors and the platoon leader. Every time we receive a full briefing from the responsible instructor, we are in the waiting area in full protective equipment , and stores equipped with cartridges are obtained only when entering the firing line. We set up a store, load and open fire only under individual commands of instructors. Extreme responsibility and vigilance will eventually give the desired result - during the entire time of combat firing, not a single problematic, but even unfortunate incident will happen. And this is despite the fact that we shoot a lot, especially when we move from -stationary- shooting to simulated combat. During the entire time of firing live cartridges, each of us shoots at least 500−600 bullets. Those who showed increased activity easily increase this indicator to 750−800 cartridges or even double to 1000. Starting to count shots from the first day, I am already losing count on the second day. And in the last three training days, I generally shoot more than 200, 250, and 300 rounds during exercises, respectively. I will not be surprised if some of the cadets have even higher scores. — asks the instructor in the evening of the penultimate day. -Can you still shoot? Then shoot,- I answer. -Great, but this is already the last store, it has 20 cartridges,- he says and hands me the rest of today's ammunition. In 15 minutes I will regret my decision, because I will be forced to catch up with my brothers, who have already started disassembling and cleaning weapons But not now - another rehearsal of fire contact with a hypothetical enemy is ahead while patrolling the territory. Despite the fact that by the end of the evening I had already managed to get exhausted, this time everything works out as best as possible - it is difficult to do something for the tenth time and not correct the mistakes made during the first few attempts. This is one of the exercises during the execution which we shoot or the most bullets, moving between trees and changing position. More interesting and more difficult than it is only work in pairs or fours, when we alternately cover each other, firing at a hypothetical enemy at the time when the partner changes position. It is easier to practice this exercise on the training ground, however, after all, we are given the same task in the forest, where it is impossible to move in a straight line and maintain eye contact between all fighters. Forced to run between trees, we inevitably break the interval and straight line set from the beginning, and also lose sight of the other members of the group. It remains to be guided by voice commands. -Hide, hide!- — I hear from somewhere to the left. -I'm running!- - I shout back with all my might and make a dash for 20 meters forward to a rhizome that is convenient as a cover. Shots are heard on the left, but in a few seconds I, having fallen under a tree trunk, shoot and shout: -Hide, hide!- Constantly maintaining communication between fighters and duplicating commands is one of the most important requirements of instructors, and completion of training in our -small infantry groups-, we already do it without thinking. -Drone!-, -arta!-, -grenade!- - the one who first reacted to the danger shouts the loudest. Others pick up and repeat the shout, confirming that they have heard and understood the warning and passing it on. This skill will be most needed on the last day of training, when we simulate a defensive battle and must maintain contact with our nearest neighbors in the chances and between two adjacent chances. Then you have to shout very loudly, especially to the commanders of the units who have to coordinate the actions of the fighters. The simulation of mortar -arrivals-, especially when the charges explode very close, is quite convincing, and the crackle of live rounds is as loud as in real combat. It is difficult to shout over the roar of explosions and the numerous sounds of gunfire, but it is necessary , because the completion of the task and the survival of the unit depend on it. We give our all, and we do it also because we know that today is the final day of training. It was on that day that each of us managed to shoot the most rounds in one training day - sometimes by chance and along with with them, the casings lay in several layers and crunched under the berets. The number of rounds fired is the best evidence that training firings are combat rounds during BZVP at Interflex in Great Britain are extremely tense and intense. Only two circumstances can stop them. The first is a problem with one of the fighters or his weapon. Then, loudly repeated three times by the instructor or any of the participants, the command -Stop, stop, stop!- must immediately stop the shooting. This never happened during the training of our platoon. On the other hand, the second circumstance occurred several times and made us wait for several tens of minutes until the problem was solved. It concerned local residents — sheep and rams, whose herds grazed near the shooting site and occasionally wandered into the zone of possible damage. As soon as the observers noticed that the rams again approached the dangerous zone for them, the command was immediately sounded. stop shooting Soon, a specially trained dog was brought on a pickup truck, which flew out of the car window in a flash and rushed towards the violators, driving them to a safe place. From several minutes to half an hour passed, and the four-legged commander of the rams returned, jumped into the pickup truck and with the look of a winner left to return in the event of the next security breach. We, having received an unexpected break thanks to the rams, resumed shooting.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/barany-na-bojovyh-strilbah-zavazhayut-najbilshe-pro-osoblyvosti-bzvp-na-interflex-u-brytaniyi/	2024-11-22T20:31:01-08:00
Today, Ukraine commemorates the victims of the Holodomor	In 1932–1933, the communist totalitarian regime committed the crime of genocide against the Ukrainian people. Today, the Rashists, as the heirs of that regime, are once again committing crimes against humanity and genocidal acts on Ukrainian soil. This year, for the third time, we honor the victims of the communist genocide in the context of the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. The tragic events that we are going through testify that living memory is extremely important. Those who commit crimes against humanity must be condemned by the world community and the victims must be honored. Then, as now, the enemy's goal was to destroy the Ukrainian people as a national group. The communist totalitarian regime, due to the forcible withdrawal of food, the blockade of villages and entire districts, the ban on travel outside the borders of famine-stricken Ukraine, the curtailment of rural trade, and repression against dissenters created conditions for Ukrainians incompatible with life. The Holodomor became possible because, during the Liberation Struggle, Ukrainians could not withstand the large-scale invasion of Russian troops and establish the democratic Ukrainian People's Republic, proclaimed in 1917 in Kyiv. the Russian Bolsheviks seized the territory of the Ukrainian People's Republic by direct occupation and proclaimed the creation of their own quasi-state of the USSR with the center in Kharkiv. In the USSR, which included the territory of the Ukrainian state captured by the Bolsheviks, a totalitarian communist regime with a strict social hierarchy was established. Any expression of dissent was immediately brutally punished and suppressed. Because of this, almost the entire Ukrainian nation, which had a huge cultural and historical heritage, its own glorious traditions of state-building, and the experience of the national liberation struggle, immediately found itself -outlawed.- The occupation of Ukraine led to numerous crimes, mass repressions, terror, deportations. But the primary goal was the destruction of Ukrainians as a political nation that could raise the question of creating an independent state. To achieve this goal, the horrible tool chosen was starvation. The mechanism of forcible procurement of bread, which led to the Holodomor, was set in motion from Moscow. In less than a calendar year (1932–1933), millions of people died in Ukraine. Mortality exceeded the average level by 8-9 or more times, especially many children died. To this day, the terrible circumstances of the crime and the deliberate ban on keeping death statistics make it impossible to establish the exact number of dead. The Holodomor led to moral and psychological changes in the nation's consciousness. The consequence of the crime of genocide was the destruction of the traditional Ukrainian way of life. The year 1933 was a time of national catastrophe for Ukraine, the consequences of which are felt to this day. Today, the Russians are once again using genocidal methods against Ukrainians to destroy our identity, culture, and language. Therefore, the modern Russian-Ukrainian war is aimed not only at destroying the independence of the Ukrainian state, but also at destroying Ukrainians as an independent people, as a nation. Putin in the 21st century, like Stalin in the 20th, resorted to genocide because other methods of subjugating the Ukrainian people did not work. Stalin organized a total confiscation of food, a blockade, mass terror. Putin used a full-scale military invasion with atrocities, violations of international laws and customs of war. Terror, mass murders, deliberate attacks on shelters, evacuation routes and humanitarian corridors, bombing of residential areas, sexual violence, military sieges, deportations (forcible displacement of Ukrainians, in particular children) became the components of the genocidal policy of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. During the Holodomor, the leadership of the USSR deliberately disoriented the world public, made special statements about the absence of hunger in the country. The regime refused foreign aid, and the totalitarian Moscow government sold seized bread to other countries for foreign currency, which was used to purchase machine tools and other equipment for industrial enterprises. Today, the democratic world is well aware of what is happening in Ukraine and supports us. The security and defense forces of Ukraine are heroically resisting the enemy. And each of us, remembering the crimes of the Moscow totalitarian regime in the 20th century, directs all our efforts to support our defenders. In the conditions of ongoing Russian aggression, our memory of the Holodomor of 1932-1933 is a factor in the social mobilization of Ukrainians and the world community to oppose the aggressor. So let's remember in the National Minute of Silence on November 23 at 4:00 p.m. the millions of human lives that Ukraine lost due to the Holodomor and massive artificial famines organized on orders from Moscow. Let's visit the places of memory of the Holodomor victims in our locality, and with the onset of darkness, let's light candles of memory wherever we are. After all, every light is a manifestation of our sorrow, memory and faith in the future inevitable Victory over the aggressor.

Rospropaganda spreads a false video: a photo helped to expose the fake	As -evidence-, a video is shown where a woman, presenting herself as the wife of the deceased, claims that her husband is not on the lists of military personnel. For specialists StopFake was able to identify the person in the photo and find out the circumstances that contradict the information provided in the video. In the fake video, which is a hostile production, the woman says that she cannot receive the benefits promised by the state. According to her, she allegedly -called the headquarters-, where she was told that the man -is not on the lists-. At the same time, she does not mention her name, her husband's name, or the headquarters to which she addressed. The photograph that the woman in the video was holding helped to expose this fake. It depicts the defender of Azovstal Andriy Kainara, who was captured by the Russians in Mariupol. After a year and a half in captivity, Kainar was exchanged and he returned to serve in the 56th brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. On the website of the non-governmental organization Polygon 56 Berdyansk, which takes care of the families of missing prisoners and fallen soldiers, a photo of Andrii Kainara, taken on the occasion of his return from captivity, was found. On it, he is depicted with Olena Dobycha, the head of this organization. On September 18, 2024, she announced his death on her personal Facebook page. The photo featured in the fake video was published by the Ukrainian mass media in a report on the death of Andrii Kainara near Bakhmut in September 2024. StopFake contacted Olena Dobycha to view the video being circulated and to comment on the -delisting- situation. According to her, this video is an -absolute fake-, primarily because Kainara did not have a wife, but only a sister. The obvious goal of this and similar fakes is to undermine the trust of Ukrainian citizens in state institutions, in particular in the Armed Forces and authorities. Propaganda seeks to create the impression that the state allegedly does not fulfill its obligations to the families of fallen soldiers, which can sow despair and demoralization among the population.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/rospropaganda-poshyryuye-nepravdyve-video-vykryty-fejk-dopomogla-fotografiya/	2024-11-22T20:01:27-08:00

More than UAH 90 billion have already been contracted for 2024-2025: 55% — for long-range drones, 37% — for other UAVs, 6% — for EW and 2% for robotic complexes. This approach will make it possible to provide the Armed Forces with modern equipment even more effectively,- he said. Hleb Kanevskyi reported on the implementation of purchases of high-tech defense goods. -Investments of the Ministry of Defense in innovative defense solutions, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, robotic complexes and deep-strike drones, are aimed not only at strengthening defense capabilities, but also at stimulating the development of Ukrainian technological enterprises, creating new jobs and ensuring stable growth of the defense industry,- he emphasized . The TSC meeting became an important platform for the exchange of opinions on the integration of experience and the optimization of legislative mechanisms that will contribute to the development of a strategically important industry. -The Ministry of Defense expresses its gratitude for the invitation to participate in the event and confirms readiness for a constructive dialogue for the joint strengthening of Ukraine's defense potential,- the ministry said in a statement.

The Military Law and Order Service talked about three options for returning to service after the SZH	About this in an interview with ArmiyaInform, the deputy chief of the Main Department of the Military Law and Order Service, Colonel Oleksandr Grynchuk, said. The first option concerns servicemen, about whom information has already been entered in the Unified Register of Pretrial Investigations. In such a case, the serviceman can independently, at the stage of the pre-trial investigation, apply in writing to the investigator, the prosecutor, directly to the court or come to the nearest administrative body of the VSP. But there are still certain conditions. In particular, this applies to servicemen who have committed FGM for the first time. There must also be a written consent of the commander of the military unit to continue his military service. The second most common return option. It applies to servicemen who have committed a felony, the duration of which did not exceed three days. That is, before the acquisition of signs of a criminal offense. In this case, this serviceman can independently return to the military unit to continue his service. The commander has to find out the circumstances why the serviceman committed the SZH. And then disciplinary responsibility is applied to him. The third option is when a serviceman who has committed a criminal offense wants to return to service, and at the same time, the information about the offense is not entered in the EDPR. That is, 3 days have already passed, according to the disciplinary statute, the commander of the military unit has appointed an official investigation, which can last a month, but there are also different situations. If the official investigation has not been completed or the investigator has sent the materials for revision, and the information has not yet been entered into the ERDR, such a serviceman with the participation of the VSP is delivered to the reserve battalions that are part of the Armed Forces. There is an algorithm approved by the Commander-in-Chief, and in reserve battalions such a serviceman is transferred to military units and units of the Armed Forces. Depending on the situation, a decision is made to return him to service: either to the place where he served, or to another place. Read more in our material: How to return from the SZH correctly: about search, reserve battalions and transfer to another part ArmyInform reminds that you can join the army either directly at >recruiting centers, as well as use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/22/u-vijskovij-sluzhbi-pravoporyadku-rozpovily-pro-try-varianty-povernennya-na-sluzhbu-pislya-szch/	2024-11-22T01:47:07-08:00

In advanced FPV drones, our companies were second with a result of 26% of submitted proposals. Kateryna Chernogorenko emphasized that such a number of proposals from our companies proves that we are achieving the goal of scaling drone production in Ukraine. -It is already helping to create an asymmetric advantage in technology over the enemy. Especially in the context of interceptor drones, as our companies have the best expertise in the manufacture and application of such technologies. We want to push the world industry so that such drones go into mass production,- said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Digitalization. Applications for the production of advanced FPV drones ended in October. The call for proposals for the interceptor drones ended on November 11. Companies that win the tenders will receive orders for drones that will be tested and evaluated.

Notarial isolation: documents in the occupied Luhansk region became unreachable	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. In Severodonetsk, the occupation authorities limited the possibility of applying to notaries. Previously, services were provided by a notary from Lysychansk, who came once or twice a week. However, after the prohibition of the so-called -extraterritorial principle- of service, citizens from Severodonetsk are prohibited from using the services of notaries in other cities of the -LNR-. Currently, one notary has been appointed in the city, but the documents pending in other settlements have not yet been handed over. The queue for a notary is scheduled until the spring of 2025, which creates significant difficulties for the population, forcing them to wait for months. In Starobilsk there is an increase in control over the school process. Teachers, cooperating with the occupying power structures, conduct informal surveys among the parents of students, finding out their attitude to the teaching of the Ukrainian language. Despite this, the return of the Ukrainian language to the school curriculum in the occupied territories is not foreseen. Such actions are aimed at identifying residents who are -disloyal- to the Russian authorities. According to Artem Lysohor, these cases are another example of oppression of the local population in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk region. As reported by ArmyInform, to the temporarily occupied territories of the Luhansk region /->funds for the implementation of the housing restoration program have arrived.

What will be the result of lowering the age and enlisting women in the army: the historian spoke abo...	Should we be afraid of mobilization measures? What will reducing the mobilization age, conscription of women, or the introduction of other mechanisms operating in the world bring to Ukraine? A military historian, head of the Center for Military History, Vasyl Pavlov, told the ArmiyaInform correspondent about this: -If we talk about mobilization, we will not find any other recipes for effective resistance to the aggressor. The only question is that until 2014 Ukrainian society was generally in a certain -lethargic- state, no one was preparing for war. From 2014 to 2021, the Ukrainian authorities, the Ukrainian state, managed to minimize the impact of the war on society, which led to the fact that the war and its feeling ended at the administrative borders of the anti-terrorist operation or the operation of the joint forces, while the rest of the country did not feel it. And when the question of mobilization arose, it became clear that the population was absolutely not ready to participate in the war. I don't know how to rate it. Is it very bad or not. We are very fond of saying, -I was not born for war.- Indeed, no one is born for war, no one is born for murder. Most likely, people are born to realize higher, more beautiful goals. But life works out the way it does. And if we talk about mobilization, then sooner or later Ukraine will go through all the stages that states that found themselves in a state of total war went through. We are now in a state of total war, that is, it is taking place on the entire territory of our state, regardless of whether there are military actions on the ground, or rocket attacks, or daily night attacks by Shaheds, or whether there is a threat of actions by subversive and intelligence groups. That is, we now have a situation where the entire population of the state is in one way or another related to the war. But a certain part of the population does not believe that this is their war. And the reason here is that for 30 years, the youth education policy was not carried out properly, the society education policy was not carried out, the state was not preparing for war. We constantly mentioned that it would be good for Ukraine to become Israel, but in the end we became Israel. But then we have to accept all those norms that exist in Israel itself. This is a certain mobilization age, this is the mobilization of women, this is the participation of all strata and strata of the population in the war. Therefore, I hope that just as Ukrainian society has overcome many problems of its growth since 1991, we will also overcome the problem of mobilization. Sooner or later it will all be evened out, because in a state of war, and everyone should understand this, we still have a long, long time to live. And again, here the question will be that the state should take a proactive position in the matter of the formation of a mobilization resource. We very often make fun of Russians that they are trying to do something from kindergarten. But we have to understand a very simple thing: they have been preparing for war for several generations. And the Russians have been openly talking about this since 2015. That they have the mobilization resource to wage war for one to two generations, that is, for 25 to 50 years. In other words, the Russians completely deliberately moved to a war of attrition, to a long-term war. In the same way, we need to prepare for this: prepare society physically, technologically and mentally.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/22/shho-dast-zmenshennya-viku-ta-pryzov-zhinok-u-vijsko-istoryk-rozpoviv-pro-svitovyj-dosvid-mobilizacziyi/	2024-11-21T20:57:07-08:00
How to return from the SZCH correctly: about the search, reserve battalions and transfer to another ...	— Not so long ago, changes were made to the Criminal Code of Ukraine in relation to SZH. From now on, there is an opportunity for military personnel to return to service, avoiding criminal punishment. So, what is the legal way to return from the SZH now? - Currently, there are several options for returning to military service. Everything depends on the categories of servicemen. There are three in total. If we talk about changes in the Criminal Code, then this applies to military personnel, about whom information has already been entered into the Unified Register of Pretrial Investigations. In such a case, a military serviceman can independently, at the stage of the pre-trial investigation, submit a written request to the investigator, the prosecutor, directly to the court or come to the nearest administrative body of the VSP. If, at this stage, criminal proceedings are ongoing against such a serviceman and his military service is suspended, the prosecutor may submit a motion to the court to release him from criminal responsibility to continue his service. But there are still certain conditions. In particular, this applies to servicemen who have committed FGM for the first time. There must also be written consent of the commander of the military unit for his continuation of military service. Accordingly, the court may decide to close the criminal proceedings and release the serviceman from criminal liability. In this case, the serviceman is given three days to arrive at the military unit or at the place of service, and already the unit is obliged to reinstate this serviceman in the service. At the same time, it should be noted that there may be certain circumstances that will not allow a serviceman to return to the military unit where he served, for example, the commander's refusal to give consent. In this case, he can return to service in another military unit. The list of these parts is determined by the General Staff of the Armed Forces. There is a different category of servicemen, and a correspondingly different return option. It is usually the most common. Up to 45% of the cases when servicemen committed a SZH, the duration of which did not exceed three days. That is, before acquiring signs of a criminal offense. In this case, this serviceman can independently return to the military unit to continue his service. Of course, the commander has to find out the circumstances why the serviceman committed the SZH. And then disciplinary responsibility is applied to him. And there is a third category. This is when a serviceman who has committed a criminal offense wants to return to service, and at the same time, the information about the offense is not entered into the ERDR. That is, 3 days have already passed, according to the disciplinary statute, the commander of the military unit has appointed an official investigation, which can last a month, but there are also different situations. Perhaps the serviceman fell ill or was insulted by someone in the service, or there were certain family circumstances, and he was not heard and was not given leave. entered in the EDPR, such a serviceman with the participation of the VSP is delivered to the reserve battalions, which is in the Armed Forces. There is an algorithm approved by the Commander-in-Chief, and in reserve battalions such a serviceman is transferred to military units and units of the Armed Forces. Depending on the situation, a decision is made to return him to service: either to the place where he served, or to another place. For example, there are task forces, let's say -buyers-, who carry out the recruitment of military personnel. — Tell us more about these reserve battalions. What is their function? - Every operational command has reserve battalions. And now the initiative to increase the staff and the number of these battalions has started. This was done in order to go to a meeting and receive servicemen who decided to return to service. True, there are also certain nuances here. First of all, we are talking about the return to the units identified as a priority for completion. It is intended that the soldier return to the combat unit, and not just to the rear. It is important not to legalize the process of transferring servicemen through the SZH. But, of course, each case must be considered separately. If a serviceman is medically unfit to serve in combat units, then other options are considered. Someone can't be an attack fighter, but can be, for example, a UAV operator, a signalman, or an IT person. That is, efforts are focused on what is most needed now and on human capabilities. — Let's take a closer look at the issue of returning to service in another unit. And how does it work in practice? Is only the consent of the commander of the unit where the serviceman wants to serve sufficient? -According to Article 401 of the Criminal Code, the written consent of the commander of the military unit to which the serviceman wants to return to continue his service is sufficient. Today, this mechanism is implemented in reserve battalions. You can find out more about this in any department of the VSP. But this applies to those servicemen against whom criminal proceedings have been opened and there is information in the EDPR. If we consider the option when the information is not entered in the ERA, then the general norms of departmental regulatory and administrative acts of the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces of Ukraine on issues of military service, according to which the consent of the commander of the military unit where the serviceman served, and the commander of the military unit to which the serviceman is transferred. And here, as I have already said, a special action algorithm has been developed. In particular, working groups have been created in the reserve battalions to speed up decision-making. There are also medical workers, and employees of personnel agencies, and psychological support, and Law Enforcement Services. To process documents, in addition to mail, messengers are used so as not to wait for the documents to arrive. In particular, servicemen submit reports, commanders confirm their approvals. This working group then considers the expediency of moving the serviceman, and a relocation plan is developed within a day and submitted to the Commander-in-Chief for review. Transfers may be approved within the Armed Forces. In the case of a positive decision on the transfer of a serviceman, an order is issued for personnel. The personnel center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine sends an electronic notification of the adoption of a personnel decision to the unit where the serviceman is serving and to the unit where the commander agreed to the transfer. Also, within three days, the senior group informs the serviceman about the adopted or unadopted personnel decision. Decisions may not be made, for example, due to health, profession, presence or lack of certain experience. It is possible that the serviceman needs to be sent for additional training or retraining. There may be cases when it needs to be sent to the VLK. There are medical companies in the new staff of reserve battalions. Because this is not only an entry into the Armed Forces, but to some extent also an exit from them. If the serviceman needs additional examination. There are such flagrant socially unjust cases when a person has lost a limb, but for some reason is listed in the SZH. Therefore, we make an appropriate decision and report such situations to the command. —Are there any units that are interested in sending those who went to the SZH to them? Perhaps some brigades have approached you? — Many military units are interested in being equipped, in particular, at the expense of servicemen who have completed SZH and wish to return to service. Therefore, in reserve battalions, conditions have been created for the selection of such servicemen, which is carried out by representatives of military units. They come there, study personal files, documents, and in accordance with this, the units carry out selection. Someone is looking for certain specialists, for example: signalmen, REB officers, engineers, sappers or drivers, because there is a shortage of them. The interest is there, and so is the action algorithm. That is, something like recruiting is conducted. Only in this case, not the civilian population, but active servicemen. And it is even better, because the military serviceman is already trained, was in the formation, performed tasks. — Has the number of those who voluntarily return to the army increased due to the introduction of changes to the law? —The rate of servicemen who voluntarily return to military units and show willingness to serve, increased, and a positive trend is observed in the future. Other measures also contribute to this. For example, the Commander-in-Chief decided on a large-scale search. When we'll peak, I can't say. But we predict that growth will continue. Courts consider the petitions of military personnel. The return algorithm works. Working offices have been created in the battalions. In fact, we are now going down the path of selecting a category of parolees who have volunteered to serve. They made study rooms. Online court sessions were held, decisions were made, decisions were sent to the battalions. There are also additional places for working groups of pre-trial investigation bodies and procedural heads from the prosecutor's office. These meetings are scheduled daily. There was also a decision of the Supreme Court, which appointed certain judges to hear these very cases in order to speed up the processes of returning servicemen to service. Next, we will look at the dynamics. — You said a large-scale search. How is the search for those who have committed FIR or desertion generally carried out? -The search is carried out in cooperation with many authorities. We work with the SBU, the National Police, the TCC and SP, the SBU, the Border Service. The case is being investigated, and a search is being made for all possible locations or hiding places of servicemen. For example, by the place of residence of parents, family, close relatives, loved one; by the place of recruitment or work. In addition, data are transferred to general registers that are relevant to the search. Operational information exchange is carried out. Our search system is constantly being improved. An interaction manual has been developed, where the processes are defined by the direction of work. According to the result of the search, servicemen are delivered either to the reserve battalions, if the information is not entered in the EDPR, or to the nearest pre-trial investigation body. You should not think that no one is looking for anyone. There are already many examples when servicemen received real sentences. But we also understand and emphasize that there is no single main problem of the implementation of the SDF or the desertion of servicemen. Each case should be considered only individually and the circumstances of the offense should be studied. In individual cases, appoint additional investigations and inspections. In particular, regarding the activity or inaction of the officials of the management structure, which forces the serviceman to commit the specified offenses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/22/yak-povernutys-iz-szch-pravylno-pro-rozshuk-bataljony-rezervu-ta-perevedennya-v-inshu-chastynu/	2024-11-21T20:48:12-08:00
Autonomous anti-ship symbiosis: the US announced the transfer of unmanned ground vehicles to the KMP...	As stated in to the official release posted on the Oshkosh Defense portal, ROGUE-Fires (Remotely Operated Ground Unit for Expeditionary Fires fire action-) is an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) that uses the extreme off-road mobility and cargo capacity of the Oshkosh JLTV off-road vehicle, as well as advanced autonomous vehicle technologies to support ground-based anti-ship missile (GBASM) operations, ArmyInform reports. ROGUE-Fires have two modes of operation: tele-controlled and fully autonomous. This allows effective performance of combat missions in conditions of minimal operator intervention. The platform is capable of carrying a wide range of warheads, including the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), a modern missile designed to engage sea targets at a distance of up to 185 kilometers. One of the key advantages of ROGUE-Fires is the ability to conduct distributed logistics operations, which makes it not only a weapon platform, but also a versatile machine to support operations in the rear. ROGUE-Fires is also integrated into the NMESIS (Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System), which includes proven remote control technologies and the Naval Strike Missile. One of the key tactics used with NMESIS is the -scoot-and-shoot- method (quick movement after a shot), which allows you to minimize the possibility of receiving hits from the enemy in response. The NSM is a high-precision missile developed by Kongsberg Defense. Its feature is the ability to fly at low altitudes, avoiding radar detection, and hit both stationary and moving targets with maximum accuracy. To create the missile body, composite materials are used to reduce the radar signature. The NSM has a high-explosive high-explosive warhead made of a high-strength titanium alloy, filled with an insensitive explosive with a reduced probability of detonation when the missile is fired. One launcher accommodates 4 missiles, after firing, the NSM can travel a long distance over land, and then go to a target in the sea. This is followed by recognition and selection of an object for destruction, the missile hits the ship in the waterline area and uses a programmable detonator to inflict maximum damage on heavily armored targets. SUV JLTV, about which ArmyInform details told in one of her materials, was developed for the US Army and Marine Corps as a replacement for HMMWV (Hummer) military vehicles. In August 2015, the first contract for the supply of 16,901 vehicles to the armed forces was signed. JLTVs provide better protection than HMMWVs, comparable to the level of heavier and larger MRAP-type armored vehicles. The Gale Banks Engineering 866T diesel engine is capable of accelerating the armored car to a speed of 110 km/h. In total, the Pentagon plans to deploy 14 such batteries. By 2025, the Marine Corps wants to have four NMESIS batteries, which will allow it to achieve initial operational readiness. Full combat readiness is planned for 2030. The appearance of such ground-based unmanned systems as ROGUE-Fires demonstrates the rapid development of technologies of autonomous combat vehicles. This machine not only increases the flexibility and mobility of the troops, but also reduces the risks to the personnel by allowing tasks to be carried out remotely. The ability to adapt the platform for different tasks makes it valuable in the changing nature of modern warfare, where flexibility and speed of reaction play a crucial role.

Telegram channels of the Russian Federation spread a fake about the supply of dozens of mobile morgu...	The disinformation post is accompanied by a photo showing mobile containers with what appears to be the English inscription -Mobile Morgue-. As reports the Countering Disinformation Center, in fact this is another fake of Russian propaganda, and mobile containers, about in question are mobile boiler houses that the Ukrainian Red Cross, in cooperation with Coca-Cola, delivers to local communities to support the population of Ukraine. The theme of -use of crematoriums in the Armed Forces- is strongly supported throughout the full-scale invasion. For example, in September 2023, propaganda -brought- such crematoria in the amount of 200 units from Germany, and in August 2024 - from Sweden and Italy. Judging by the pace of propaganda, there will soon be no mobile crematoria left in Europe. At the same time, it is Russia that actively uses them, and there is corresponding evidence for this. Thus, as of April 2022, according to the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, 13 mobile crematoria were operating in the temporarily occupied Mariupol to clear the streets of the bodies of dead civilians. The use of such crematoria was also recorded in the territory of Chernihiv region and in the city of Novoaidar, Luhansk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/22/telegram-kanaly-rf-poshyryuyut-fejk-pro-postachannya-desyatkiv-mobilnyh-morgiv-do-sum/	2024-11-21T20:13:33-08:00

According to Volodymyr Zelenskyi, this is Russia's second step in a year to expand the scope of the war. The first was North Korea's deployment of at least 11,000 troops to support Russian aggression. -This is an obvious and serious increase in the brutality of war, as well as a cynical violation of the UN Charter. -Putin ignores calls from the whole world, including China, Brazil, the United States and European countries, to end the war,- the President emphasized. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also noted that Russia continues its attacks, despite all attempts by the international community to establish peace. He emphasized that Ukraine has a full right to self-defense in accordance with the norms of international law. -Every night our country is attacked by Iranian drones, and a contingent from North Korea is deployed on the border. -Putin not only continues the war, but also challenges all those who seek peace,- the head of state noted. The president called on the international community to respond decisively to the actions of the Kremlin. He emphasized that the lack of tough sanctions and measures only encourages Russia to new attacks. -The world must act decisively to force Russia to real peace. Otherwise, strikes, threats and destabilization from Russia will continue and affect not only Ukraine. Real peace is worth the effort, and we need to act now,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy concluded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/21/prezydent-zaklykav-svit-posylyty-sankcziyi-putin-plyuye-v-oblychchya-tym-hto-pragne-myru/	2024-11-21T12:36:29-08:00

REB mines are not afraid - -Birds of Magyar- have learned to bypass the most powerful Russian REB	The video of the combat work was published on November 21 on the battalion channel. Recently, powerful EW installations have appeared on the equipment of the occupiers, which prevent our drones from working on them. -But there is a way out: large-scale and permanent remote mining of all possible ways of movement, assaults, logistics, evacuation of the enemy. Equipment stopped by mines is then disposed of by ordinary FPV drones,- said the battalion commander, Captain Robert Brovdi. He showed how Russian equipment detonated on a remotely installed mine is then calmly carried out by drones, since the EW is not working on it. -The wormhole must be stopped systematically and in advance. Along the entire front line. Without risking the infantry, to mine non-stop with the forces of hundreds of aviation units that we have,- says Robert Brovdi. Now -Birds of Magyar- is conducting a large fundraiser for mines for drones on their channel. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 414th battalion of unmanned aviation systems -Birds Madyara- as part of the marines struck Russian attack aircraft.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/21/miny-reba-ne-boyatsya-ptahy-madyara-navchylysya-obhodyty-najpotuzhnishyj-rosijskyh-reb/	2024-11-21T11:43:09-08:00

Real war changes quickly, we must adapt education to these changes - Serhiy Melnyk	About said on November 21 Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General of Justice Serhiy Melnik. -Despite full-scale Russian aggression, we continue to improve the system of military education, in particular under the NATO DEEP program. Even in such a difficult time, we do not stop the transformation of the educational process. We should focus our efforts on improving the study of foreign languages ​​so that graduates of higher educational institutions of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine can represent our country at the international level,- Serhiy Melnyk said. For according to him, as part of the reform of the military education system, special attention is paid to the implementation of the NATO DEEP Program and the involvement of foreign partners in strengthening the language training of cadets and servicemen. In particular, preparations for the institutional audit of the military education system of Ukraine in 2025 have begun with the financial support of the Republic of Lithuania. Special emphasis will be done to intensify the teaching of foreign languages ​​for first-year students of higher military educational institutions. For this purpose, it is planned to update educational programs and form requests of higher education institutions, which can be financed by international partners. In addition, it is planned to involve instructors from combat brigades in the educational process and training of cadets. -Real war changes quickly. For example, at the beginning of 2022 we knew nothing about FPV drones, and today it is one of the key weapons. Therefore, we must quickly adapt the processes of education and training of servicemen to changes on the battlefield,- emphasized Serhiy Melnyk. As reported by ArmyInform, the number of training flights of cadet pilots will increase, the geography of flights will expand.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/21/realna-vijna-zminyuyetsya-shvydko-mayemo-adaptuvaty-osvitu-do-czyh-zmin-sergij-melnyk/	2024-11-21T10:53:19-08:00

Drone operator training: The Ministry of Defense is expanding the network of certified schools	The Ministry of defense of Ukraine. The project aims to test new approaches for increasing the training of future operators, instructors and external crew members of unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned aerial systems (UAVs/UAVs) for the Defense Forces of Ukraine. -Drones should fight, and people should control them from a safe distance. Today, driving a drone is no longer a hobby, but a requirement of the time. The number of units of unmanned systems has increased in the Armed Forces, there is a demand for such vacancies. That is why we have to increase the number of certified schools where people can receive professional training,- stressed the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General Anatoly Klochko. The process is directly handled by the Main Directorate of State Aviation of Ukraine, whose representatives have formed a certification commission. It is there that applications from organizations are considered and within five days a decision is made to issue a school certificate or to refuse it with reasons. Certified schools involve representatives of the training centers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, other components of the security and defense forces for the practical exam. Based on the results of the practical exam, school graduates are given certificates with recommendations for assigning a military accounting specialty (VOS). Graduates of schools who are not military personnel can receive VOS after acquiring the status of military personnel and passing basic military training (BZVP). Military personnel studying at certified schools can obtain a military accounting specialty based on the results of successfully passing a practical exam. It is envisaged to maintain a list of certified schools and their graduates. This will make it possible to know the potential of trained UAV operators, and the Defense Forces will be able to appoint specialists to positions related to the use of unmanned systems. As reported by ArmyInform, the OSCE held a course for Ukrainian specialists in mine countermeasures.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/21/navchannya-operatoriv-droniv-minoborony-rozshyryuye-merezhu-sertyfikovanyh-shkil/	2024-11-21T00:21:46-08:00

ATACMS, the Kursk bridgehead and the US permit: an expert on whether there will be a turning point o...	For example, the media cites the position of Polish President Andrzej Duda, who says that this could be a turning point on the front. But military expert Petro Chernyk has a different position. He explained to the correspondent of ArmiyaInform why the possible US permission for Ukraine will not be a turning point. -Permission for ATACMS strikes deep into Russian territory cannot and will not be a turning point in the war. With one single exception, if these missiles are given several thousand, and this is a fantasy. There will be no fiction,- says the military expert. And he adds that our country was given somewhere in the range of a couple of hundred of these missiles: -We used a certain amount, if they give a couple of hundred more, it will be very good. ATACMS will help to really hold the Kursk bridgehead. Because it is they who are called to destroy warehouses with ammunition, warehouses with fuel and lubricants: this is if we are talking about the cassette part. And the high-explosive part is the control points and communication nodes. Chernyk emphasizes that if everything goes like this, then everything will be complicated for the enemy in terms of knocking us out of Kurshchyna. -And this is already a big geopolitics. Our task is to hold out until next year's dry weather cycle,- the expert noted.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/21/atacms-kurskyj-placzdarm-ta-dozvil-ssha-ekspert-pro-te-chy-bude-zaraz-perelam-na-fronti/	2024-11-20T23:27:28-08:00

Crocodile tears of prisoners near Kupyansk: what the captured occupiers are crying about	About this informs State Border Service of Ukraine. One of them said that on the Russian side, mostly Zeks are fighting in this direction.

Another prisoner turned out to be a native of the Samara region. He was sent to the assault even without identification marks. -They don't give us anything, they spit on us like they threw meat, I don't even know how to shoot,- cried the Russian invader to the Ukrainian border guards. He says that he did not serve in the army, and before being sent to attack, he was not even shown how to use a machine gun. The occupier admitted that he was going to the positions under duress, because there were blocking units behind him.

Encircled battles, destruction of alligators and revenge against the marines of the 155th brigade: a...	ArmiyaInform journalists visited the 82nd Bukovinsk Airborne Assault Brigade, which broke through the Russian border and is still performing tasks on enemy territory. In more detail about the participation of paratroopers in this operation, its commander Colonel Dmytro Voloshyn said: -In my opinion, there were several key aspects. First of all, secrecy in the planning and preparation of the operation. And also the secret movement of troops. We had several interactions with the Commander-in-Chief and were instructed to move to a new area. We moved to the Sumy region in three days at night. But they did it in such a way that even some of our units, which should have known about it, did not know. I even had a conflict with the head of the VSP, who should have known that I was moving and should have provided me with an escort. And he found out when we moved, about three days after that. It is a real skill to move unnoticed by an organism like a brigade. You yourself understand that personnel, heavy equipment, and shells were being moved. Already on the territory of the Sumy region, we disguised ourselves as much as possible. There was no -shuffling-. No one knew that the 82nd Brigade had appeared there. And this continued for about a week after the operation began. For example, Russian media reported that the 22nd Mechanized Brigade broke through the front line and went deep. For understanding, the 22nd brigade was moving behind me. She was in our second echelon. The second aspect is who was bet on to carry out such an operation. And I think the airborne assault troops did it for once. The third aspect is the territory on which we fought. If you look at it, it is a rough terrain, full of difficult sections. I do not think that the enemy saw it as suitable for large-scale operations. And it is necessary to hit where it is weak, where the enemy does not expect. Yes, it was difficult. But we coped with it. Of course, another aspect of success was provisioning. Sometimes I think that if the Commander-in-Chief had raised problematic issues at some regular interaction, then I would have said that I need some kind of intergalactic blaster, I think that it would have been found for us somewhere within a week. To be honest, they gave literally everything. So that you only perform tasks properly. He attacked, destroyed the enemy, took possession of certain areas and borders. And all this, in fact, was successful. After all, the credo of the airborne assault troops is that we do not back down in the face of difficulties, we move to the end. And the main aspect why we have succeeded in all this is the belief in what we are doing. My immediate, faith of my subordinates. No one said: -we have to go to Russian territory anyway.- When the soldiers were told that they had to go and fight in enemy territory, the reaction was quite expected: -finally we will go and slander these bastards on their territory.- Why not? Our country is destroyed every day, children die. So let them also feel what war is like, but for them it is somewhere far away. The first day was probably the most difficult, you had to overcome a barrier in your head. After all, the introduction of such large-scale offensive actions is a very difficult task, taking into account the enemy's use of various means of fire damage. These are high-precision weapons, anti-aircraft missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, military aviation, FPV drones, and Lancets. Of course, it is like that everywhere now. It stands on the stream in them. So I had to overcome this barrier in my head. Somewhere he adjusted himself to some extent, somewhere he adjusted the commanders. There was anxiety, but they went to perform the task. I thought that if we break through the front edge now, then everything should go according to plan. And we broke through the front edge. It was something with something, how we crossed the border. The entire brigade passed through one passage made in the mine-explosive barriers by the 225th assault battalion assigned to me. The car is moving, and I am thinking: now it should be hit by ATGMs, or now the Lancet should fly into it. And nothing comes flying in&#8230; troops enter in huge columns. The noise was so loud that probably the whole of Sumy shuddered. I was puzzled, because there is such a sign that when everything is going according to plan, somewhere ahead, the enemy has prepared something. The Wisent barrier machine was the first to pass. It has no weapons, just an armored car with a big bucket. He crossed the border and went to the enemy stronghold. I think, well, that's all for him. And he turned around and drove back. I had even more questions than I had. But the units went further deep into the enemy's defenses. Why we managed to break through the border in such a way became clear when I was already on the territory of Russia. They did not see us, because, as they say, no one mowed the grass in front of their positions. Literally. The grass was taller than my Hummer. And they just didn't see what was happening. They heard explosions, the rumble of equipment, but did not see. So we slipped past them and did not storm those positions. It was also nonsense for them that we do not storm positions where the enemy is, but move on. I'll be honest, when the actions started, everything just went, and we completed the tasks as I set them for myself. The tasks of the first, second, third day, we still did. They occupied certain areas, surrounded the enemy. Somewhere they bypassed him. And perhaps one of the key decisions that led to rapid success was that I did not task my units to enter populated areas. Before that, I spoke with the participants of the campaigns on Russian territory - RDK, GUR. They said that when they entered populated areas and knocked out the enemy, then they were simply mixed up with aircraft and that was it. That's why it was a failure. I decided that the enemy would build defense nodes in populated areas. Therefore, we simply bypassed them, and it was already incomprehensible to the enemy. As we passed through the front end, we thought there were maybe 200 people at most. It is clear that there were pre-prepared positions, but they looked uninhabited. And then, when the enemy was in our rear, it turned out that there were much more of them. Apparently, on the seventh or eighth day, I think you heard, the SBU special unit -Alfa- took about 120 prisoners at just one stronghold. And just so you understand, there were 30 to 40, sometimes 50 enemy military personnel at each stronghold. That is, in general, there were about two thousand servicemen in our rear. Yes, there were mostly conscripts who did not cause us much harm, and they were then taken prisoner. But such a number of personnel were in our rear, and, in fact, our soldier did not pay attention to this, but moved forward and performed his task. Of course, there were also some -slips-. The 225th battalion fulfilled its task, entered and blocked a number of settlements. In particular, the route that went from Korenev to Suja. The second battalion was supposed to go at the same time with it, but it was not possible to make passages in it. There were failures of engineering equipment. So while we were redeploying this battalion to a neighboring route, I decided to immediately bring the second echelon into battle. These units overcame the combat formations of the 225th battalion and immediately went to the first line of enemy defense. The first is because, according to the operational construction, we first overcame the echelon of the state border cover. And behind it, at a depth of 10-12 km, there was already another boundary. Again there were -dragon's teeth-, again an anti-tank ditch, again mines. Two battalions slipped through and went all the way to Novoivanivka, where they pressed the enemy and prevented him from occupying strong points on this line. With this, I set myself the task of the day - to get behind these -dragon's teeth-. If we did not do this, there would be no point in moving forward. Overcoming such barriers under enemy fire&#8230; it would be Zaporizhzhia number two. But the staff did not disappoint. &nbsp; Strong resistance was put up by the enemy's army aviation. Helicopters flew over the columns at a height of 50-100 meters. They fired from cannons, anti-tank missiles, unguided missiles. We immediately deployed anti-aircraft defenses. The first Ka-52 was destroyed with Strela MANPADS. We also damaged the Mi-8 with small arms fire. He fumed. As it turned out later, he flew a little further and also fell. That is, on the first day, we destroyed two enemy rotorcraft. They didn't fly the next day. Then they started working again. On one of these days, we destroyed another Ka-52. A paratrooper hit him with a Stinger MANPADS. The entire crew was destroyed there (ArmyInform already wrote about this episode. Read more can be read here - Ed.). About two weeks after the operation began, a large number of drones appeared here. Serious units arrived with trained crews who know how to use all this. They were constantly working on technology. Here, by the way, they encountered FPV drones in the 330 MHz frequency range for the first time. And at that time we did not have EW tools against them. But we found options. Their points were detected, fire damage was inflicted, and at this time they slipped wherever they needed. There were many different solutions that we constantly combined. While we were advancing, the enemy tried to throw at least someone to stop us. In fact, they threw their units into the tiger's mouth. The -scoop- once had such a thing as marching companies. Literally, from the wheels, they threw themselves at some boundaries with only small arms. We met such companies. They smashed them to zero. First with combat vehicles. And then the soldiers went to clean up if someone continued to resist and did not want to surrender. There were moments when our advanced units went deep into the defense, and the sweep did not have time. And the units found themselves surrounded by the enemy on all sides. But we are paratroopers. We are always in the rear of the enemy - surrounded. We were preparing for this, for a circular defense. And it does not matter whether it is a department, a company or a battalion. Everyone should be able to conduct an all-round defense. Determine dangerous directions, where to place grenade launchers or anti-tank weapons, how to -close- (mining the terrain. - Ed.). We have been trying to unblock one of the units for about a month. And they kept the defense all this time. The first real resistance was offered by the 810th Marine Corps Brigade. For understanding, its composition includes 13 battalions. And these are not security battalions at all. She arrived only by arrangement. The prisoners said that it was 96% manned and 90% equipped. My third battalion captured their APC. Yes, there was still polyethylene on the seats. New car. Only from the factory. There are also paratroopers here. 83rd, 51st, 56th, 119th Parachute Regiments. 73rd Reconnaissance. This is a Vedevesh battalion. Various -Akhmatians- are also here. Well, the most finished is the 155th Marine Corps Brigade. These are the infamous freaks who cut off heads, cut off ears, knocked out teeth, and shot prisoners. The most interesting thing is that they are so boring when they are all together. And if anything, they are afraid to admit that they are from the 155th brigade. They are called anything. I understand that this is a war. But torturing and killing an unresisting opponent is low. There are certain laws and rules of war. No normal commander would set such a task. But there are no moral boundaries in this swagger. Therefore, there is no mercy for them from our paratroopers either. We are trying to destroy them. An eye for an eye, as they say. In a certain period, units were withdrawn to rest a little. But as soon as they came out, literally in a day and a half, the enemy started his offensive actions. Of course, we were quickly brought back into battle. And so we fought for another month. For example, one of the battalions defended Lyubimivka. The enemy tried to drive in with 12 vehicles. I thought that he would just drive in and sell en masse, as was the case in some other settlements. But they immediately made mine barriers, put up a -jagoza-. The enemy blew up somewhere, started to turn around somewhere and blew up again. And the paratroopers have already finished off everyone with automatic weapons. Everything, -I wish you health-, as they say. Later, we still went for a short rest, to regroup. At that time, new personnel also arrived, because, of course, there were also losses. And we were preparing for new offensive actions. The enemy began offensive actions again to dislodge the Defense Forces from Kurshchyna. And my units returned there to carry out assault operations to dislodge the enemy from those territories where he managed to wedge himself in. Of course, it doesn't happen so fast these days. The enemy has accumulated a lot. We retook three settlements. And for the fourth one, we are -getting excited- now. Half of it has been cleared, and the enemy has been trying to attack us here all day today. In the airborne assault troops, the main thing is training and motivation. Some people say that we have some special fighters. That's not true. We take these servicemen from the same training centers as the others. We just have such an ideology - we teach them not to survive, but to kill the enemy. And we will fight to the last.

How much is paid for the destruction of enemy equipment: it's all about the monetary reward	According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, our defenders destroyed almost 100,000 units of enemy equipment during almost 3 years of large-scale invasion. The purpose of the survey is to understand how this is implemented in practice and what difficulties military personnel face. ArmyInform reminds how this reward should be paid and how much can be received, for example, for a destroyed tank or a downed plane. The payment of such remuneration is regulated by a special procedure, approved order Ministry of Defense of Ukraine dated September 18, 2020 No. 340. Yes, military personnel are paid a reward in the amount from 12,180 to 243,600 hryvnias, depending on the type of equipment. The decision to recognize the equipment as destroyed or captured is made on the basis of at least three documents. Next, a conclusion is made about the destruction (capture) of enemy equipment, and it is formalized in an administrative document (order) of the head of the troop group (forces). Confirmation of the destruction (capture) of the equipment is: An increase in the reward for the destroyed (captured) equipment is distributed by the commander's decision among the servicemen who took a direct part in the destruction (capture) of the equipment, depending on their personal contribution. Remuneration is paid to military personnel from the place of service on the basis of the orders of the commanders of military administration bodies and military units. We remind you that not only a monetary reward is provided for the destruction of enemy equipment. Also, from this year, it became possible to get additional vacation days. More about this can be read here.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/21/vynagoroda-za-znyshhenu-j-poshkodzhenu-tehniku-voroga-skilky-otrymuyut-zahysnyky/	2024-11-20T21:11:31-08:00
-Malyuk- Challenger in the service of DSHV: how a British tank beats Russians on their territory	These tanks were handed over to Ukraine by Great Britain in 2023. And now they serve in the 82nd Bukovyna Assault Brigade, which operates in the Kursk direction. Tank commander Oleksandr worked as an electric and gas welder almost all his life. After BZVP, he was offered to become a tanker, and he immediately got on the Challenger II tank. That is, he did not have experience working on other machines, so it is difficult for him to compare. But he does not have such a desire: -I once sat in Abrams.- I didn't like him. It is much smaller. In my homeland, I'll be honest, I didn't even climb. I looked at the driver's seat, looked into the tower and realized that there wasn't even enough room for me,- Oleksandr says. One of the main advantages of the Challenger II tank, the commander calls its accuracy, which is achieved thanks to the 120-mm rifled gun and the fire control system, which itself, depending on the conditions, makes all the necessary corrections: -It can work at a distance of up to 10 km inclusive. But it depends on the area. He works as a sniper. For example, if you shoot at a distance of 5 kilometers from a T-shka (a series of Soviet tanks - ed.), Abrams and Challenger, then it will hit the most accurately. It has a weather sensor that transmits information about wind, humidity and other factors to the computer. And he makes these corrections himself.- In general, the on-board computer is the brain of this tank, adds Stanislav with the call sign -Patron-, who is a loader in the crew: -He programs everything himself. For example, if two tanks leave. One at 1,800 meters, the other at 2,300. The laser is aimed at both tanks and the computer remembers two targets. And when the commander decides which one to hit, the gunner can switch between targets with just one button.- The loader is the fourth crew member, which is characteristic of most Western tanks. After all, the Soviet ones have a charging machine, so there are fewer crew members there. Here, although you have to charge manually, it is not difficult. -There is nothing complicated. Yes, everything is done manually for the first shot. I lower the shutter wedge, load everything, close it and move it to the right position. And after the first shot, everything happens automatically. You just need to throw in another projectile,- Patron says. And this tank is very strong and safe for the crew, says the commander of the vehicle Oleksandr. After all, even after significant damage, it can be driven. And it already saved the boys' lives: -Somehow he withstood the impact of a cumulative projectile during missile fire by Russian helicopters. The depth of damage was 720 mm. And the boys survived. They were the ones inside. There was another commander with them at that time.- The loading -Cartridge- was just in the tank during that shelling. He remembers that it was during the approach to Kurshchyna. -As soon as we crossed the border, 2-3 helicopters were already flying over us. And we had to take a stand. They drove and shot on the go. The distance to them was about 4 km. It is quite difficult to hit a helicopter. But something had to be done,- Patron recalls. Already when the tank was in position, the first rocket arrived. -It flew into the tower. Triplexes flew at the commander and the mechanic-driver. And when they -rolled away-, they were already driving along my triplex. I told where to go. Then there were a few more hits. They knocked out 2 rinks for us, punctured a tank. We drove through it at about 30 kilometers per hour.- Despite the damage, the tank was able to drive to a safe zone. He accomplished his mission, saving the lives of the crew. And already after the repair, he returned to the line and is again destroying the enemy on his own territory. First of all, the enemy is trying to hunt for Western weapons. That's why these tanks are the No. 1 target, says driver-mechanic Maksym with the call sign -Kalyna-. -As soon as we are spotted somewhere, all the fire is directed at us. Therefore, you need to constantly maneuver. All in all, it's a very powerful machine. And her defense is cool. But there are nuances of the engine - it needs constant maintenance. If it is done on time, then everything is fine. But this is not always possible because of the intensity of the action. And it would be possible to put an even more powerful engine here. Now it has 1,200 horsepower, but it would be great if they put 1,500.- Currently, the intensity of hostilities in the direction is very high. The enemy is trying to knock our units out of Kurshchyna. Constantly deploys large amounts of vehicles and infantry to attack. This is also felt by the tankers, who almost constantly have to advance to the task - to work both on equipment and on the enemy's manpower, covering our units. -We worked on the Zaporizhzhia and Vovchansky directions before this. I can say that every time it becomes more difficult. After all, the enemy is constantly studying us, our actions. Constantly introduces something new. But thanks to the interaction between departments, we manage everything. The result is mostly positive,- says tank commander Oleksandr. He also talks about his main fear when performing tasks. -I'll be honest, it's always a little scary before leaving. And this is a normal phenomenon. Everyone has it. But when you start working, you focus on the task at hand. Adrenaline is also on the rise. And the main fear is to let the team down. Failing to do something or doing it wrong. But then, when you see the results - how many enemies we destroyed, you already feel proud. That they didn't just leave to work, but also have a result,- adds Oleksandr. The guys' motivation is simple - it's better to stop the enemy here than when he gets to your house. Because then it will be too late.

Combat duo: what is known about the new UAV that will work together with French fighters	How informs The War Zone website, this project promises to increase the effectiveness of the French Air Force by 2033, ArmyInform reports. The industrial part of the drone program will be led by Dassault Aviation, building on its previous UAV prototype nEUROn UCAV already used in trials with manned combat aircraft. The program was announced by the French Minister of the Armed Forces, Sébastien Lecornu, during a ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of the French Strategic Air Force (FAS) at the Saint-Dizier air base. The new UCAV, which is being developed by Dassault Aviation in collaboration with the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA), will have a number of unique characteristics, including stealth technologies, autonomous control with the participation of the operator (man-in-the-loop) and internal weapons loading. These features will allow the drone to adapt to a variety of threats, as well as perform complex combat missions in support of the French Aerospace Forces. The basis of the project is the development of the nEUROn program — the first prototype of an unmanned aerial vehicle with stealth functions in Europe. The program, launched in 2003 under the leadership of Dassault Aviation, brought together industrial partners from six European countries. nEUROn demonstrated key technologies such as stealth, autonomous flight and the ability to use internal weapons such as laser-guided bombs GBU-12. As note analysts of the defense portal Army Recognition, nEUROn weighing 7 tons, with a wingspan of 12.5 meters and a length of 9.2 meters powered by Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour Mk. 951, which provides a speed of up to Mach 0.8 at an altitude of 14,000. meters Since its first flight in 2012, this demonstrator has completed more than 170 test flights, which allowed to confirm its technological and financial efficiency. The experience gained within the framework of the nEUROn program will be directly used in the development of a new combat drone. For now, the drone remains nameless, but its specs are already sparking interest. It will have stealth, which will allow it to effectively perform tasks in difficult conditions. The War Zone reports that the drone will operate in tandem with a Rafale fighter jet, which will be operated by a pilot. This interaction between manned and unmanned aerial vehicles opens up new horizons for combat tactics. Dassault has already stated that the drone will be versatile and able to adapt to future threats. Experts assume that this device will be able to perform a wide range of tasks, from reconnaissance to strikes on targets. Its internal payload space also promises to be substantial, allowing for the integration of various weapon systems. As for the Rafale Standard F5, which is expected to support the new drone, the plan is to keep the multi-role combat aircraft in the forefront until 2060. Initial research for the F5 Standard began last year, and full-scale development will begin in 2026-2027. Experts of the IKK Defense Express publication reminded that the law on defense planning of France for the period from From 2024 to 2030, the upgrade of the Rafale attack aircraft to the F5 standard, which should act as a carrier of a promising cruise missile of the type ASN4G as a means of delivery nuclear weapons. The French military stipulates that the Rafale F5 must be able to overcome various prospective threats, and accordingly this aircraft must have the necessary technological options to perform its tasks. In turn, researchers from the Opex360 portal indicate that as early as 2023 the French the military has recognized one interesting point about upgrading the Rafale to the F5 standard - for this aircraft to be able to independently perform all its intended tasks, it is necessary to increase the power of the computing equipment on board, which must process -hundreds of thousands of pieces of data-. But to achieve this, it is necessary to increase the length of the cables for various types of equipment so much that they literally will not fit in the plane itself with its current geometry. It seems, according to Opex experts, that it is against this background that the French Ministry of Defense came up with the concept of -tying together- the promising Rafale F5 and guided stealth UAV. nEUROn made its first flight in 2012 and has since completed more than 170 test flights, demonstrating its ability to remain undetected by modern air defense systems. During one of the tests in 2016, the drone successfully penetrated the defenses of the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, demonstrating its unique stealth capabilities. This experience will form the basis of the development of the new UCAV, which will play a key role in future joint operations. Presentation of the combat unmanned aerial vehicle nEUROn.

How many Ukrainians are actually against territorial concessions of the Russian Federation: the enem...	According to polls, the majority of Ukrainians oppose Russia's territorial concessions. As is well known, Russian and pro-Russian sources cannot be considered a reliable source of information. However, the propagandists are trying to convince that they are citing the data of a real, and not a -bought and painted- sociological survey, despite the fact that they do not indicate any source of origin of this -insider-. At the same time, the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) has been regularly conducting surveys since May 2022 on the readiness of Ukrainians to make territorial concessions in order to achieve peace as soon as possible. According to results a poll conducted from September 20 to October 3, 2024, the majority of Ukrainians oppose Russia's territorial concessions. 58% of respondents answered that Ukraine should not give up any of its territories, even if because of this the war would last longer and there would be threats to the preservation of independence. Sociologists note that the share of the Russian Federation ready to make concessions has not changed since May of this year - it is 32%. Instead, the share of those who oppose concessions increased from 55% to 58% from May to October this year. According to another KMIS survey conducted in the same period, 63% of Ukrainians are ready to endure the war as long as necessary. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/21/skilky-naspravdi-ukrayincziv-proty-terytorialnyh-postupok-rf-vorog-statystyku-perekrutyv/	2024-11-20T20:15:07-08:00

Britain's allies have repeatedly demonstrated that they stand side by side with us in the struggle for freedom. Together with Lord Coaker, they discussed Great Britain's plans to provide aid to Ukrainian soldiers in 2025. Another important direction was the issue of synchronizing our interaction in the defense industry. I am grateful to our British partners for their comprehensive support and willingness to strengthen our cooperation. Together we are bringing victory closer!-, Rustem Umyerov assured. As reported by ArmyInform, immediately 12 countries unite to strengthen security and support Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/20/ukrayina-ta-velyka-brytaniya-obgovoryly-plany-dopomogy-ukrayinskym-voyinam-u-2025-roczi/	2024-11-20T12:07:13-08:00
-Moisey- for evaders - a man was detained in Kharkiv, who was taking him to Moldova for rough money	The Prosecutor's Office of the Kharkiv Oblast reported this on November 20. According to the investigation, a resident of Kharkiv organized the departure of men of draft age abroad through Vinnytsia. He personally conducted briefings with -clients- and reported that the amount of escape from Ukraine costs $13,400. In Vinnytsia, the men had to check into a hotel and -wait- for 1-2 days. In the future, the evaders were met by accomplices of the accused and placed in a vehicle that was already transporting them across the state border to the Republic of Moldova. On November 15, during the transfer of the agreed amount from the -client- near the store in the village of Solonytsivka, law enforcement officers detained the dealer. The court granted the prosecution's request: the suspect was remanded in custody with the right to post bail in the amount of 454.2 thousand. UAH for a period of 60 days. The investigation is ongoing. All persons involved in the commission of the specified crime are identified. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/20/mojsej-dlya-uhylyantiv-u-harkovi-zatrymaly-cholovika-yakyj-za-grubi-groshi-vyvodyv-do-moldovy/	2024-11-20T11:57:06-08:00

In Kurshchyna, the Russians shot our soldiers who were surrounded	This was announced by Dmytro Lubinets on his channel on the evening of November 20. -Another war crime! I sent letters to the UN and the ICRC regarding this crime. The international community must act immediately.

Because he's an idiot - Russian actor Volodymyr Mashkov was given 10 years and his apartment in Odes...	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on November 20. Since the perpetrator is hiding in the Russian Federation, the trial took place in a special court proceeding, in the absence of the accused.

Unified register of servicemen: the Ministry of Defense explained the advantages	This was reported by the Deputy Minister of digitization Kateryna Chernogorenko. -When the Ministry of Defense did not have a Reserve+, there was already a register of Military Conscripts. Now that the Ministry of Defense has the Army+ application, the need for a full-fledged registry for military personnel has finally arisen,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko. The Verkhovna Rada today voted on draft law No. 12066, which provides for the creation of a register. She explained that the registry will store all the necessary, but for security, limited information about the military in one place and will be able to quickly provide it on request from other state registries. Military ID will be used to exchange information within the systems of the Ministry of Defense. This is a digital number that ensures the confidentiality of the military's personal data and is already used in the Army+ application. In addition, all data collected in the registry will not contain sensitive details of your life. Only the most important minimum to allow you to quickly issue a vacation or submit a report for financial assistance. -The creation of such registers is the first and most important step in the digitalization of any sphere of life. A reliable electronic foundation must be laid in order for the military to be able to do their service, not with papers,- the Ministry of Defense explained. As reported by ArmiyaInform, last week a service was launched in the Army+ application, which makes it possible to change the place of service for soldiers in the Armed Forces. During this time, more than 1,500 relevant reports. Of these, more than 500 were fully approved.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/20/yedynyj-reyestr-vijskovosluzhbovcziv-u-minoborony-poyasnyly-perevagy/	2024-11-20T02:01:40-08:00

Transport froze, garbage does not disappear: communal collapse in -lnr-	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. According to him, the occupation authorities found a way to make a profit even from their own inaction - to fine local residents for garbage dumps that arose due to the failure of communal services. The crisis also affected transport. The buses that the Russian Federation handed over to Luhansk are parked in garages under the pretext of a lack of drivers — most of them have been forcibly mobilized. Local residents suspect that the equipment may have been partially returned to Russia, as private transporters with dilapidated vehicles that barely work have increased on the streets. The occupation administration demonstrates an inability to provide basic communal services, which only worsens the living conditions of local residents. As reported by ArmyInform, from December 1, 2024, the passports of the so-called LNR, which the Russians have been forcing residents to receive since 2014 will be invalidated.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/20/transport-zavmer-smittya-ne-znykaye-komunalnyj-kolaps-u-lnr/	2024-11-19T23:51:44-08:00

Will the armistice save Ukraine: a military historian on a 100% repeat of Russian aggression in the ...	-In this situation, only we can save us. Neither Euro-Atlantic integration nor even the return of territories will save us. We must clearly understand that as long as the Russian Federation exists, it will be an existential threat to us. And, accordingly, it will not disappear even in the event of a truce. I don't say -end of hostilities- because it's not likely to be a peace treaty, it's going to be an armistice. The truce, everyone should understand, is temporary in nature and can be broken for both objective and subjective reasons at any moment. Here it is necessary to understand and immediately prepare for how and for what we will use this truce, because we must clearly understand that any truce ends in the next war. Therefore, in this situation, the Ukrainian population, the Ukrainian political community, and the world community must understand that the time that will appear in our country after the conclusion of the armistice should be used to make the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the military-industrial complex of Ukraine even more powerful Because only this is a guarantee of avoiding possible future aggression of the Russian Federation. It must be said right away that the future aggression of the Russian Federation, or at least an attempt at aggression, is actually a 100% option. And the Russians will not hide even that. They will say that they have completed the objectives of their 1st and then they will start their 2nd. We have already seen this on the example of the anti-terrorist operation that was completed by the Minsk agreements. We know this because the Russians never keep their word and are proud of it. All diplomats in the world know about this. It is written about in all history and diplomatic textbooks, everyone studies it, but no one draws any conclusions. The Victory Plan is the requirements of the President of Ukraine, which are the requirements of the Ukrainian State and are the requirements of the Ukrainian people. There is nothing surprising in these requirements. We simply demand ours back. The question is how we will succeed, how the world community will help us in this. The Victory Plan, most likely, is not an attempt to issue an ultimatum, but actions so that the issue of Ukraine does not disappear from the agenda, so that it is constantly in the circle of interests and in the sphere of interests of the leading states of the world, so that we could continue to resist. No more and no less.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/20/chy-vryatuye-ukrayinu-peremyrya-militarnyj-istoryk-pro-stovidsotkovyj-povtor-agresiyi-rf-v-majbutnomu/	2024-11-19T22:02:07-08:00

In a flock or alone: ​​Israeli aircraft manufacturers are promoting an unmanned missile-carrying hel...	How emphasized in their statement posted on the company's official portal, representatives of the company, this project is an example of unique cooperation between Steadicopter and Rafael and provides fast, maneuverable, accurate capabilities for striking heavy targets for tactical air operations, ArmyInform reports. The Golden Eagle HS unmanned rotorcraft is armed with powerful Spike missiles, which ArmyInform reported in one of its materials, designed for precision strike missions in a variety of environments, from tactical conflict zones to border protection, regional perimeter protection, and urban operations. These capabilities allow the wielder of this weapon to dominate the battlefield, providing an advantage, particularly in difficult or overcrowded areas. Experts of the defense portal Army Recognition point to the fact that, thanks to the integration of the Spike missile, the Golden Eagle HS helicopter ensures prompt and precise strikes on particularly important targets, allowing ground forces to operate from safe positions, regardless of time of day and visibility conditions. The Golden Eagle HS armament uses high-precision Spike missiles with the possibility of using -fire and forget- tactics. Equipped with a powerful warhead, this platform combines enhanced stealth with high combat effectiveness, expanding the tactical capabilities of assault forces. With a total take-off weight of 50 kilograms, Golden Eagle HS is compatible with Spike-SR missiles with a firing range of 2.5 kilometers and Spike-LR2 with a firing range of 5.5 kilometers, providing flexible applications thanks to a data link between the missile's homing head and the operator. These missiles belong to the sixth generation, capable of self-targeting with the help of an infrared homing head. As soon as the missile reaches the target, it destroys it with a powerful anti-tank high-explosive warhead capable of penetrating up to 70 cm of rolled armor. The Golden Eagle HS unmanned aerial vehicle is equipped with an advanced suite of sensors, including a high definition EO/IR tele/thermal imaging system for day and night use with target tracking capability. Integrated with advanced SightX artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the system can seamlessly detect, track and classify targets even in adverse weather conditions or difficult terrain. This advanced method of applying AI can distinguish between different types of targets, whether people or vehicles, providing ground forces with real-time situational awareness. -The launch of Golden Eagle HS in partnership with Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd is an important milestone for Steadicopter,- said Itai Toren, CEO of Steadicopter. This unmanned aerial vehicle meets modern operational requirements, providing exceptional accuracy and the ability to launch strikes in autonomous mode. -Combining experience in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles of the helicopter type with Rafael's extensive experience provides the military with a solution that increases the effectiveness of its use on the battlefield.- In turn, a representative of the Rafael Corporation added: -Our collaboration with Steadicopter in the creation of this unmanned aerial vehicle meets the changing needs of modern warfare, where innovation and advanced capabilities are critical. This partnership will allow current and future users of Spike missiles to be more versatile and effective, potentially game-changing on the modern battlefield.- Golden Eagle HS is capable of operating both independently and as part of inconspicuous swarm groups launched from different points for combined attacks on important targets. This UAV helicopter from Stedicopter is a new step in the development of rotary unmanned systems that combine compactness, autonomy and powerful weapons. With its ability to destroy heavy equipment and provide reliable air support, this drone has every chance of becoming an indispensable tool for today's armed forces.

F-16 as an air defense tool: how effective were the Fighting Falcons during the recent shelling of U...	Is it a lot or a little within the limits of the general statistics of Russian air weapons used by the enemy and shot down by the Defense Forces of Ukraine? What enemy munitions could not be shot down by F-16 pilots? How effective are the -Battle Falcons- as a component of air defense assets? ArmyInform answers these questions based on official data of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As reported President of Ukraine, on the night of November 17, with the help of F-16s, about 10 enemy air targets were shot down, without detailing which exactly the aircraft managed to shoot down the pilots of the Ukrainian -Battle Falcons-. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also noted that, in total, during the previous week, Russia used more than 900 guided aerial bombs, more than 600 attack drones and almost 140 missiles against Ukraine. Of this number, about 120 missiles of various types, including Zircon, Iskander, and Kinjal, as well as about 90 drones, including Shahed, were used by the Russian invaders on the night of November 17. The President informed, that during a massive combined strike on November 17, Ukrainian air defense forces destroyed more than 140 enemy air targets - missiles and drones, and thanked to Ukrainian defenders, separately mentioning military aviation pilots who piloted various types of aircraft, including F -16: -We are grateful to all our air defenses, which were involved in repelling this attack: anti-aircraft missile troops, our aviation - pilots F-16, -susok- and MiGs, mobile fire groups, EW - all worked out in an organized manner. Thank you for the reliable protection!- Official statistics of the results of the combat work of the Air Defense Forces in repelling the record-breaking Russian combined air attack reported in Air The forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces - defenders of the Ukrainian sky shot down 102 missiles of various types and 42 unmanned aerial vehicles. If we take the number of aircraft shot down with the help of F-16 aircraft mentioned by the President - about 10 units - as a basis, we find out that the pilots of the Ukrainian -Fighting Falcons- shot down about 7% of all enemy air targets destroyed on November 17. Is it a lot or a little? Depends on what data we can operate on and what factors should be taken into account. Back in the summer of 2023, the then spokesman of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Yuriy Ignat noted that the F-16 as an air defense vehicle has limitations - fighter jets cannot shoot down ballistic missiles: -It can cover the sky from kamikaze drones and cruise missiles, that is, bring the percentage of shooting down closer to 100, now we have 70-80% - this is with strong Russian attacks, with the F-16 this figure can increase to the maximum Plus, it will allow us to use cheaper missiles.- In view of this, from the general list of munitions used by the enemy, those that the F-16 cannot shoot down should be excluded. These are ballistic, aeroballistic and hypersonic missiles. There are at least 10 of them: It should also be taken into account that a significant proportion of the air strikes used by the enemy on November 17 - 85 units - were Kh-101 and Kalibr cruise missiles. Kh-101 missiles can fire dipole reflectors as obstacles against radar-guided missiles. Missiles with infrared (thermal contrast) guidance on such small targets, equipped with a compact turbojet engine, work much worse than on airplanes and helicopters. One should also take into account the share of F-16 used to repel an enemy attack among other means of the Ukrainian air defense forces, which cannot be significant. In view of the above, the estimated 7% of enemy air targets shot down by F-16s during the massive combined strike of the Russians on Ukraine on November 17 is a significant indicator. It testifies to the high efficiency of the -Battle Falcons- as an air defense vehicle.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/20/f-16-yak-zasib-ppo-naskilky-efektyvnymy-buly-bojovi-sokoly-pid-chas-neshhodavnogo-obstrilu-ukrayiny/	2024-11-19T20:43:06-08:00
A gun from Afghanistan, a 30-grade gunner and dreams of victory: how the calculation of the M777 gun...	While they were waiting, a large shaggy sheepdog came out of the darkness very quietly. The dog sat silently next to us, looked up somewhere. Then he left as silently as the shadow of sadness of a small village of Donetsk region, not far from the front. Here, at night, only the constant cannonade of explosions from the front line and the sound of the engines of military vehicles can be heard. We get into a pickup truck, a car with a night vision camera drives us in the dark to the position of the artillery calculation of the 148th separate artillery brigade of the Zhytomyr Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We are met by the commander of the calculation on landing, we quickly move to the shelter, highlighting a red flashlight. A large, tidy dugout welcomes you with warmth and light. Two-story beds with dark army mattresses are lined up along one of the walls of the underground shelter. On one of the beds, everything lights up and shines, it is the equipment of a signalman - 45-year-old Taras with the call sign -Tarik-. He himself is from the Poltava region. In civilian life, he worked as a construction worker, installing gas pipelines and heating. He has been serving in the 148th brigade since April 2023. He speaks simply about his duties: there must be communication and light at the position, maintenance of equipment, batteries, generators, and transmitters. - A lot of work. Why might there be no connection? The reasons are different. Something can fly in, fragments can damage the generator, the walkie-talkie will break, the equipment sometimes fails, my job is to make sure everything works properly, - Tarik explains. He adds that civilian work is almost no different from army work. . -It's the same, only a little scarier,- says the operator with a smile. At home, Taras is waiting for his wife and two schoolboy sons. They often talk on the phone, the family supports. He recently returned from vacation, he says that everything is fine, but not enough, he would like to spend more time with his family. - The only wish is for the war to end as soon as possible and to return home. I have many dreams, but the biggest one is victory. Taras's brother approaches us and sits down next to us. He has a gray beard, a red flashlight sparkles on his head, cheerful eyes, as they say, -with beads-, he smiles and introduces himself. Anton is 44 years old, call sign -Baker-, a senior soldier, has the position of senior howitzer gunner M777A1. He has been in positions and performing combat missions for over a year. I joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in April 2023, from the city of Berdychiv. — In 2022, I was not drafted into the army, because I have four children, and in 2023, when my eldest son turned 18, according to the first the summons went to the military commissariat. I have an older son and a daughter from my first marriage and two more sons. At the time when I was drafted, my wife and I had not yet been registered, - says the artilleryman. He says that he likes to serve in the artillery. Training with work on this Pekar gun took place in Germany. — The training lasted 10 days. Why so fast? Howitzer M777A1 is easy to maintain. After completing the courses, he received a 30-grade gunner's certificate, he says jokingly. He recalls that he really liked Germany for its order and cleanliness, as well as food for the military. And they were also impressed by the roads. -The baker- was abroad for the first time. He is a bricklayer-plaster by profession, but he was a baker for many years, hence the nickname: -Peak bread, buns, cakes in Berdychiv in a restaurant-. Pekar speaks with pride about the Pekar gun, a very powerful and accurate weapon, everything depends on the gunner and the accuracy of the coordinates. — Zaporizhzhia is beautiful worked, a little less in Donetsk region. It happens differently: mostly 40-50 shots, but when it’s 10. Here you can’t guess how the enemy will attack, there’s an assault, if it’s -forbidden- so that they don’t climb, don’t forget who we are, then a few shots are enough, he explains he. It is admitted that the first time was terrible in the war. Now he already easily distinguishes where the projectile flies, how it flies and where. - At first it was scary. Now it's just flying in, it's commonplace. The hardest part of the job is carrying shells, and also moving from place to place, it's several days with almost no sleep, says the gunner. silhouettes The boys are stomping, because the morning autumn coolness gives the first breaths of the coming winter frosts. A quiet conversation, almost in a whisper, over coffee and a cigarette while waiting for the team to fight. The first, first pink, then more and more saturated yellow rays of dawn. Suddenly, the command: -To battle!- The gunners run to the gun, with coordinated movements everyone does their job: remove the masking, get the coordinates of the target, aim, load — -Shot!- , so as not to interfere with the calculation. Within a minute the gun is cloaked again, everyone goes back to the dugout to talk and finally see each other's faces and take some pictures. One of the guys looks like Jesus from the painting, the other looks like an athlete. They are smoking again, smiling, drinking coffee. 42-year-old sergeant Dmytro with the call sign -Lion- from the city of Dnipro commands the cannon. On May 19, 2022, he went to the Military Commissariat with his brother and best man, applied for the elite troops and got into the DSHV. — I thought that victory would come sooner. I had no idea what it would be like. And everything turned out as it should be, I became the gun commander. First, I got the position of a gunner after training, and then I was in the 95th artillery brigade, which was disbanded, and I was transferred to the 148th brigade. He passed sergeant courses, then training in Germany, he says. -Lev- proudly mentions that the Germans and Americans were shocked that in such a short period the Ukrainians learned everything so quickly. - We have a war, there is no time to study for half a year. We are -rexes- of the DSHV, he says. This is already the third gun of the crew. They worked on the first boy for a long time and even gave her the name -Lyalya-. - She worked like a clock mechanism. She never let me down, unfortunately, she stayed in another unit, that's how it happened. This one is a little cranky. I know that this gun fought in Afghanistan. The barrel was changed, and, consider it as new, some mechanisms were updated, then it will work as it should, says -Lev-. They have been fighting with this team for a year, they went through training in Zhytomyr Oblast. - There is also a young addition, Oleg came to us a week ago, the main thing is that he is motivated, he learned everything quickly. Currently, I can choose people for the team, only those who are needed here. Because an unmotivated person does not have time or energy to shout, argue, explain. This is a war, everyone must clearly understand why he is here, - the commander proves his position. He controls the entire process, records the coordinates, gives orders. The gunner Viktor directs the gun to the target according to the coordinates, Oleg and Andrii load the projectile, Oleksandr loads the gunpowder and brings the gun into combat order. Anton gives the gunpowder, and the commander fires. - Our calculation is one iron fist. Everyone knows what they are doing here and they have no questions about who is doing what, we are all working to win. Everyone knows their job. How do we hold on? The main thing is respect for each other. In general, we are already here as a family, - assures -Lev-. Before the large-scale invasion, Dmytro worked at a power plant. After the end of the war, he wants to return home, to civilian life, he misses his family. — What do I dream about, except victory? My wife really wants to go to Italy. They are waiting for me at home, the children go to school. We talk on the phone, via video. I take a photo of the boys in farewell, and we run to the car. We leave the position in the morning fog, -Candy- constantly beeps on the road...

Propagandists invented a fake about the surrender: what is Trump doing here	This time, they spread, with reference to the Institute, a fake about the fact that the Ukrainian military allegedly began to surrender eight times more often after the victory of Donald Trump in the elections. This -news- was also allegedly commented on by the editor-in-chief of Euronews, Klaus Strunz, who called it an -absolutely natural- development of events, saying that now -it is finally clear to everyone that Ukraine is doomed.- However, this news and everything related to it was invented by propagandists. The Institute for the Study of War did not publish such information either on its website or in social networks. There is also no reaction to this hoax in any of the reputable Western media, including Euronews - obviously because it is a poor fake. In fact, there are no independent and reliable data on how many Ukrainian soldiers surrender as prisoners, because such statistics are available only to the Russian side, and it is difficult to trust them. At the same time, the Human Rights Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, Dmytro Lubinets, said that the government is aware of more than 100 executions of Ukrainian military personnel by the Russians, who have surrendered or are being captured. There may be many more real cases, but such crimes are difficult to verify and legally record.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/20/propagandysty-vygadaly-fejk-pro-zdachu-u-polon-do-chogo-tut-tramp/	2024-11-19T20:04:19-08:00

They also carry out such defensive measures, and this says something - we call it the syndrome of the Kursk operation, he said. In the Kursk region itself, the Russian command is building up its forces and throwing its soldiers into reckless assaults with the aim of knocking out the Defense Forces of Ukraine from the territory of the Russian Federation as soon as possible. — The rest of the [Russians] forces were concentrated in the Kursk region. Here they are both in a hurry and nervous. They throw everything they can into the battle, transfer new units, new forces here to continue the onslaught, he said. The officer said that during the day, the fighters of the Defense Forces repelled more than 20 enemy assaults without losing a single controlled settlement. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that 5 drones destroyed a Russian assault group in Kurshchyna.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/syndrom-kurskoyi-operacziyi-vijska-rf-hvoriyut-kurshhynoyu-u-zsu-diagnostuvaly-symptomy/	2024-11-19T12:08:23-08:00
PereREBilo — the enemy drone could not reach our tank	Unique footage appeared on November 19 on the brigade channel. Our tank led a raid in the forest, where it destroyed enemy positions. As the tankers began to turn around, an enemy FPV drone appeared above it and attempted to dive on the tank. But due to the action of the WB, it lost controllability and exploded on the ground a few meters from the tank. -A very rare shot is a clear example of how EW works... Valuable equipment and the lives of our soldiers were saved,- the brigade commented on the video. &nbsp; As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 63rd mechanized brigade showed risky raid of his tank, which destroyed the trenches of the invaders in the forest.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/pererebylo-vorozhyj-dron-ne-zmig-doletity-do-nashogo-tanka/	2024-11-19T11:56:48-08:00

Russian stormtroopers demined the road to our positions near Kurakhovo. By myself	The video of the battle was released on November 19 on the battalion channel. A Russian armored fighting vehicle, together with the landing party, was quickly driving towards our positions. But she didn't make it, because she exploded on a mine. Smoke billowed from the car and the invaders began to climb out. They were also smoking. Some of them remained lying down, and some tried to hide in the landing. But here our bomber drones flew in and carried out a sweep with the help of drops. -Not a single racist creature from this video survived, not even the one that ran into the landing!- - assured the battalion. &nbsp; As reported by ArmiyaInform, fighters of the 214th special OPFOR battalion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine ambushed enemy armored vehicles at the landing site and -znyshhyly-na-kurahivskomu-napryamku/->started immediately to bomb. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/shturmovyky-rf-rozminuvaly-pid-kurahovo-dorogu-do-nashyh-pozyczij-soboyu/	2024-11-19T11:37:51-08:00
Mortals in Chasovoy Yar: Russians run to -meat-reconnaissance under fear of being shot	told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- a> spokeswoman of OTU -Luhansk-, Major Anastasia Bobovnikova. — On the Toretsk direction, the enemy constantly storms the city of Toretsk. In addition, battles are taking place near Nelipivka and near Toretsk is the village of Shcherbynivka. In the Kramatorsk direction in the area of ​​Chasovoy Yar, the enemy is accumulating its forces, and in the Seversky direction literally today, the enemy has already shelled 13 times with anti-aircraft guns, she said. The officer said that despite constant assaults, the occupiers are not succeeding either in Toretsk or in Chasovoy Yar. — The enemy is not advancing. We will stop all his attempts, all assaults, both in Toretsk and in Chasovoy Yar, the military woman assured. The spokeswoman denied information about the advance of the occupiers in Chasovoy Yar. — I know you probably want to ask about the alleged advancement in the Rift of Time. However, I will say that this is not an advance, but rather a situation where the enemy is running across the channel and scouting our positions, she explained. Anastasia Bobovnikova described the tactics of the enemy. — They just run forward and whoever has caught up has caught up, and whoever has not caught up has not caught up. It is more like a -meat- reconnaissance, when the units just throw and try to feel where there are weak points, where there are strong points, where the enemy cannot come, said the military woman. The spokeswoman assured that the enemy's attempts to advance are detected and stopped. — Such attempts, of course, are revealed. The enemy is destroyed, the groups are hit and the enemy does not advance, the officer said. At the same time, the morale and psychological spirit of the occupiers, according to her, is very low - they run forward due to fear of punishment - up to and including physical execution - from their command. - Their moral and psychological spirit is very low. They do not want to run into such -meat- assaults. These are rather suicide bombers who were driven to certain death under the threat of being shot. Because we recorded such statements in our intercepts, when the leaders, commanders of the enemies simply told them that if they go into battle, they will be shot,- said the spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU. Anastasia Bobovnikova said that many such cases are recorded - sometimes whole units of the Russian occupation forces refuse to obey the order. — There are many such people. There are entire units that refused to go on assaults. However, unfortunately, they are forced to do just that. Of course, they are afraid of being shot, and in this way they have a chance to run and get captured and save their lives in captivity, the military woman explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that up to a hundred occupiers are killed in Toretsk every day.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/smertnyky-u-chasovomu-yari-rosiyany-bizhat-u-myasnu-rozvidku-pid-strahom-rozstrilu/	2024-11-19T11:08:55-08:00

Denmark will provide Ukraine with 130 million euros for the development of the defense industry	About this President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky reported on November 19 based on the results of a meeting with the Prime Minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, who came to Ukraine on a visit. The head of state thanked Denmark, the entire Danish people and personally Mette Frederiksen and her team for helping Ukraine. In total, Denmark has already provided more than 20 packages of defense support, and together with Ukraine created a special model for the development of Ukrainian industry. -It makes it possible to unite other countries around investments in the production of weapons in Ukraine. These are artillery, our -Bogdans-, also missiles, long-range drones. We will continue to develop such cooperation,- said the President. One of the main topics of the negotiations is the key areas of relations: bilateral and with partners. Particular attention is paid to joint work at the level of European institutions, because in the second half of next year Denmark will preside over the EU. -Our Ukrainian policy is to be as fast as possible in integrating into Europe. And finally, we all in the Euro-Atlantic community have to admit that we have to be quick. And every day, obviously, decisions are needed for Ukraine. In the entire Alliance, there is a decision on the invitation to Ukraine. The sooner it happens, the sooner Russia will realize, come to an understanding and make a decision that the war against Ukraine does not and will not make sense for them,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Separately, the President emphasized that the world needs to put pressure on the Russian shadow tanker fleet, as well as react to the involvement of North Korean troops in Russia's war against Ukraine. Mette Frederiksen said that Ukraine should win this war, so Denmark provided and will provide assistance and support the defense industry. -We already see what your defense industry is capable of.

Having lied, the Russian propagandists buried our rocketmen, and they escaped	Footage of combat work and non-trivial rescue was made public by the State Border Service of Ukraine. A few days ago, Russian propagandists began to brag about the shots of their FPV drone of our RAK-SA-12 installation, which was installed on a Humvee armored vehicle. The invaders boasted that they destroyed not only the car, but also the entire crew. But it turned out that the Russians lied. As usual. Our rocketmen told the story of their amazing rescue, when not only they themselves survived, but also their equipment, which is very annoying to the Russians. What it's like to be in the crosshairs of a Russian FPV drone - see in the video: ArmyInform told how RSZV RAK destroys enemy infantry .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/zbrehavshy-rosijski-propagandysty-pohovaly-nashyh-raketnykiv-a-ti-vryatuvalysya/	2024-11-19T08:36:13-08:00
More than 1,500 transfer reports have already been processed — the Ministry of Defense	About this reported on November 19 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. -The number of reports shows that the military was waiting for the opportunity to change the place of service without lengthy approvals, bureaucracy and groundless refusals. Instead, the number of agreed shows that the service works effectively. Digitization continues to transform our army into the army of the future, where any service is received simply, transparently and quickly,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, deputy minister for digitalization. Changing the place of service through Army+ has a fairly simple algorithm. It is necessary to submit a report, attach to it a military card or an officer's certificate, a letter of recommendation from another unit. In some cases, a VLK opinion is required, for example, if a soldier wants to transfer from a combat unit to the rear. Then the report goes to the Personnel Center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. If there are no grounds for refusal, an order is prepared, which is subsequently signed by either the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces or the Chief of the General Staff. -Also, what makes this service unique is that the place of service can be changed without the approval of the commander. It is needed only in certain cases and it will be received by the Personnel Center of the Armed Forces, not the military. We are doing everything to free people's time for efficient service as much as possible,- added Kateryna Chernogorenko. In addition to being simple, the new algorithm for changing the place of service is also transparent. If the serviceman is refused, he will receive the reason why it happened. Currently, the most frequent reasons for refusals are as follows: — the report is submitted by military personnel who do not serve in the Armed Forces; — lack of a conclusion of the VLK for transfer to the rear from the combat unit; — copies of all pages of the military document with records of service are missing. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense in 2024 secured the supply of clothing for female defenders at 158 million hryvnias	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/opraczovano-vzhe-ponad-pivtory-tysyachi-raportiv-na-perevedennya-minoborony/	2024-11-19T08:07:48-08:00

In a few minutes, the attacking group was simply dismantled. This is what reconnaissance drones are for: they find the enemy in time, giving the opportunity to organize a precise response. It is not just a technique - it is a synergy of the human mind and technology. And thanks to such coordination, the attack was stopped at an early stage,- the battalion commented on the video. &nbsp; As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the 225th assault battalion filmed the consequences of the defeat of the armored assault group of the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/pokaraly-za-porushennya-osobystoyi-dystancziyi-5-droniv-znyshhyly-rosijsku-shturmovu-grupu-na-kurshhyni/	2024-11-19T06:57:57-08:00

What he did not count on was that even with small forces the National Guardsmen would take the fight. Trying to delay the landing of the Russian landing force as much as possible and prevent transporters with heavy equipment and main forces from landing at the airport. Armed essentially only with -needles- and small arms, the Ukrainian fighters held out for several hours, shot down several helicopters and disrupted the enemy's first plan. But the ammunition eventually ran out. I had to retreat from the airport. However, the National Guardsmen won the time during which the artillery from Bila Tserkva managed to pull up to the position. Which began to fire at the Russians, trying to disable their equipment, and most importantly, the landing strip. Or at least demonstrate that any attempt to land transporters still expected by the enemy on it will end fatally for the planes - they will come under direct fire. The Russians, who managed to report on the seizure of the airport, tried to expand the control zone, pushing the Ukrainians further, but they did not succeed. The defense forces counterattacked, and most importantly, they did not stop shelling in order to prevent the already damaged lane from being repaired. In the end, the invaders were forced to abandon the amphibious operation and wait for the arrival of their main forces by land. They captured Gostomel in a few days. However, they could not advance further. And on April 1, they left the city and the airport under threat of encirclement. Already on February 24, the Russian troops approached Kharkiv close, and on the 27th, one of their special forces groups with ten -Tigers- and several KAMAZ trucks broke into the city itself. When the breakthrough was stopped, they decided to seize the school closest to them at that moment - 134 school. But turn it into your stronghold, because it was located on higher ground. The Russians were blocked by the forces of the military, security forces and volunteers. But they did not dare to storm the building at first - in the first days, the usual experience was not enough. After some time, the invaders recovered and began to retaliate with sniper fire. It seems that reinforcements were also waiting. Wasting time was simply dangerous. So the brave men who volunteered to attack went to the school under the cover of fire from an armored personnel carrier. Later, the tank also pulled up - but it was able to fire only one shot. The melee was fierce. The Russians fought back desperately. However, the grenades they used to throw at the Ukrainian fighters soon ran out. They refused to surrender. However, in the end, two were captured. And these were the last invaders who set foot on the land of the city with weapons. The Russians were never able to break into Kharkiv again - in almost three years of war. Maybe that's why they continue to take revenge on him - destroying from a distance, Mariupol was threatened by the encirclement already a week after the full-scale invasion. The defenders turned the -Azovstal- plant into their citadel, in the bunkers of which both civilians and wounded soldiers were hiding. The sky above the city was controlled by enemy aircraft, the sea &#8211; fleet. The occupiers attacked the city with the heaviest bombs they had at hand - three-ton fabs. The Russians expected that the forces of the defenders would quickly be exhausted without support from the -big land-. But in the military intelligence of Ukraine, they decided on a desperate operation. Having information about the location of enemy units and their weapons, try to lay out a route for the helicopters. The risk was deadly - that's why only volunteer pilots were involved in the operation. Almost all weapons were removed from the sides. The cargo was more important - provisions, medicines, ammunition and means of communication for the defenders of Azovstal. They flew at maximum speed, but at a minimum height. They entered from the side of the sea, because of the smoke over the constantly shelled city, they simply could not break through. Defenders say that at first they did not even believe that it was theirs. Five minutes to unload, and how much will it cost to load the wounded. The engines were not silenced to take off at any moment. At first, the Russians did not even understand what had happened. But then the hunt for Ukrainian helicopters began. However, all 16 ships will deliver their cargo to Mariupol. Three helicopters were shot down on the way back, one was hit by a missile, but he made it with all the wounded on board. Thanks to the defenders of -Azovstal- and the helicopter crews that helped them, Ukraine won a month to equip the defense system. Mariupol shackled the enemy's forces and did not allow him to move immediately to the east - to Zaporozhye and the Dnipro. Okhtyrka is a border town. The enemy was near him already five hours after the start of the invasion. The sappers took the first blow. They had almost no anti-tank weapons, but they still organized a circular defense, set up positions on the roofs, ambushes, mine barriers&#8230; The advanced enemy group managed to break through to the city, but the Ukrainian fighters destroyed one of the tanks and a car with ammunition, which began to explode. The attackers were forced to retreat, abandoning their equipment. During this time, fighters from the Kholodny Yar brigade came to the aid of the defenders. It was they who repelled the second, tank attack. The battle lasted half a day - and the Russians withdrew again. with heavy losses. Convinced that they would not be able to take Okhtyrk from the move, the occupiers began mass bombardment of the city with -hurricanes-. The kindergarten, where civilians tried to hide, was not the first to suffer. The next day, thermobaric weapons were used for the first time. A direct hit to the location of the unit cost the Ukrainian military 70 lives. And then the systematic destruction of the city's infrastructure began. After the oil depot, they took on the CHP plant. When the -hurricanes- and rockets failed to cope with the task, bombs were dropped. 20 thousand citizens were left without heat. The next day, the water supply and sewage system were disabled. They deliberately tried to punish Okhtyr residents for their persistence - and the mayor is still confident. A doctor by profession, on the most critical days he himself performed operations - under enemy fire. The defenders, of course, answered the enemy with everything they could. The Russians soon realized that their planes could also be targeted and were already wary of bombing from low altitudes and during the day. Assault attempts did not stop. On March 16, the enemy even managed to enter the outskirts of the city, but at the cost of heavy losses. He was never able to break through the Ukrainian defense. And within a week he was forced to start withdrawing troops from Sumy Oblast. The strategic importance of the Snake Island is difficult to overestimate. The only island in the entire Black Sea at a great distance from the coast, it allows you to control the approaches to Odessa and the mouth of the Danube - and in fact all shipping between mainland Ukraine and neighboring countries - including Turkey. It is not surprising that the Russians were in a hurry to capture Zmeinyi as soon as possible. Already on the morning of February 24, 2022, it was blocked both from the sea and from the air. Communication with the border guards was lost. The enemy tried to intimidate the Ukrainian defenders, but they responded with an expression that became one of the symbols of this war. Annoyed by the response, the Russians subjected Zmiiny to a frenzied shelling, destroying all the buildings on the island. But the border guards continued to defend themselves, repelled two attacks, and only because of a lack of ammunition, the invaders managed to capture them. The defenders were freed on March 24 - during the first exchange of prisoners. The enemy tried to turn the island into his stronghold. But the Armed Forces did not allow it to be done. On April 14, two Neptune missiles hit the Moscow cruiser &#8211; the same one that was -sent- by the border guards and shelled the island. In two weeks, the Russian control post on Zmiiny itself was destroyed. Then they -thinned out- the personnel of the occupiers and sank the boats with which the enemy tried to maintain communication with the island. The tugboat carrying the TOR anti-aircraft complex also went to the bottom. The blows to the enemy became stronger and more regular. And the Russians understood that they were doomed. On June 30, they evacuated their soldiers from Zmiyny with two speedboats. And the remains of the equipment that they left on the island were destroyed by Ukrainian drones and ... Russian aircraft. On July 4, 2022, Zmiiny returned to the control of Ukraine. And the yellow-blue flag flew over him again. Before the large-scale invasion, it seemed that Bashtanka was located deep in the Ukrainian rear. And if the war comes to her, then not quickly. However, the locals did not sit idly by. Territorial defense and formation of volunteers were created. They even prepared -molotov cocktails- - it turned out that it was on time. Because already on March 1, the Russians were in nearby Yavkin. It was near him that peaceful residents came to the road. It seems that the invaders simply did not expect this. But they stopped in embarrassment. Not for long, of course. They listened to the people in silence for fifteen minutes - and after firing a machine gun over their heads, they moved on, past them. But even a short stop helped the defenders better prepare for the -meeting-. As soon as the first invaders entered the city, bottles with -cocktails- flew at them. The machines caught fire, the ammunition began to detonate almost immediately. The Russians were shocked, but continued to move. However, the deeper they broke through, the fiercer resistance they met. The forces of the defenders were not so large, but small groups were scattered throughout the city. Thus it was possible to create the appearance of a large garrison. When the Russians drove up and stopped, their column was cut up and began to be destroyed piece by piece. The end of the rout was put by a plane that appeared unexpectedly for the enemy and struck two devastating blows. The invaders finally realized that they had fallen into a trap and ran away to save their lives. Twenty-one Russians were captured. They -captured- more than four dozen units of enemy equipment, but most of it was burned during the battle. The second column of Russians was ambushed. And decided not to tempt fate and retreated. In the future, the Russians did not dare to attack Bashtanka -head on-. They dug in on distant slopes. And they tried to destroy the city with shelling. Or maybe they were just taking revenge for the defeat. Until the Ukrainian army went on the offensive and repelled the enemy as far as the Dnipro. And Bashtanka was not in the rear again. Control over the Black Sea is one of the strategic tasks of the Kremlin in this war. And at the beginning of the invasion, she was close to fulfilling this task. The initial balance of naval forces was also in favor of the Russians - the aggressor had more of them by an order of magnitude, and the quick destruction of the ships of the Ukrainian Navy. Even the disabling of the flagship of the fleet - the cruiser -Moscow- - did not seem like a critical loss. But everything changed already in the summer of 2022. It was then that Ukraine made a bet on the use of surface drones. And conducted their first tests - then it was about devices on hydrocycle platforms with high-explosive bombs. In September, they already tried to use them in a real battle. The operation failed due to communication problems. But the very fact of the attack forced the Russians to reduce the number of ships on the external raid and retreat to the port of Sevastopol. However, this was only the beginning. At the end of October, drones reached the Sevastopol Bay itself, damaging two ships and an oil filling station. The following spring, the attacks became regular, and in the summer, drones attacked the Kremlin dictator's favorite brainchild, the Kerch bridge. Within a month, Ukrainian drones caused noise on the approaches to Novorossiysk. The targets were ships capable of transporting military cargo to the occupied peninsula. In August 2023, a separate naval drone brigade was formed as part of the Ukrainian Navy - the first unit of this type in the world. A real hunt for Russian ships began - in most cases quite successful. Among the trophies were boats, and tugboats, and large landing ships. And the Russians... began to simply hide their fleet. The presence of ships in the open sea has decreased tenfold. Most of them were taken from the Crimea to the Caucasian coast. Moscow can still use its fleet to launch -calibres- over Ukraine, but the entire western part of the Black Sea is currently free. And this is a truly unique achievement – ​​no country in the world has yet managed to defeat the enemy fleet with the help of unmanned remotely controlled vessels. The Russian occupation of part of the Kharkiv region in 2022 ended with the Ukrainian offensive. The occupiers fled from the territories they occupied. One of the last they left was the city of Vovchansk, which is located very close to the Russian border. In May 2024, the enemy returned. Vovchansk again became one of the directions of his attack. The direction to Lipka became different. The calculation was obvious – while the Ukrainian defenders, dripping with blood, hold back the onslaught of the main Russian forces in Donbas, hit their flank and try to break through to Kharkiv again. Or at least get closer to the city at a distance that would allow it to be shelled at close range with artillery. The situation was really difficult. Ukrainian units were still waiting for reinforcements from the new mobilization, defensive structures in the border strip were not built. However, within a few days, having encountered resistance, the enemy's offensive stalled, and by the end of the month it was stopped. In Vovchansk, the Russians were never able to cross the Vovcha River. There was no question of an attack on Kharkiv - and the Kremlin leader even stated that this was not in the plans. However, the tactics of the Russians remained unchanged, not being able to completely capture the city, they destroyed Vovchansk with shelling. The bombing of Kharkiv also intensified. Ukraine's partners could not help but react to the aggressor's next war crimes - they lifted the restrictions on the use of their weapons against military targets in the border regions of Russia - from where, in fact, Ukrainian cities are shelled. Attempts of enemy breakthroughs in the north of Kharkiv region continue to this day. However, Ukrainian fighters managed to recapture some settlements from the invaders, and Russian soldiers blocked at the aggregate plant were eventually taken prisoner. Since the first days of the full-scale invasion, Russia has constantly bombarded Ukraine with missiles and attacked with drones - there is not a single area to which it does not -fly- from time to time. Instead, the possibilities of retaliatory strikes were limited - if only because the Defense Forces were inferior to the enemy from the beginning in terms of the number of long-range weapons and the -range-. Partners could help, but it took a long time to coordinate and deliver already agreed packages. In addition, in many cases, weapons were transferred with the condition not to strike deep into Russian territory. Without denying Ukraine's right to active defense, the allies made it clear more than once that there would be no restrictions on the use of their own, Ukrainian means of destruction, and domestic manufacturers accepted the challenge. The bet was made primarily on drones - they are cheaper, but often even more effective than missiles. The first strikes on objects deep in Russia were already carried out in 2022. The target was primarily the airfields on which the planes that launched the missiles over Ukraine were based. In the following year, the appearance of drones in one or another Russian city ceased to be perceived as a surprise or coincidence. In May, a drone exploded just above the Kremlin, causing a real commotion in the Russian capital. Since the beginning of 2024, strikes on Russian territory have become systematic. Russian oil refineries and related infrastructure were the first to feel it. Since March, they have been joined by enterprises of the Russian military industry - manufacturers of jet engines for aircraft, assemblers of drones, etc. The range of attacks also increased constantly - Ukrainian drones flew to the Volga region, the Urals and the Russian North. However, the most daring were the attacks on enemy arsenals, the loudest of which was the destruction of warehouses in Toropka, near Tver. And in the summer of 2024, for the first time, the number of Ukrainian drones launched on Russian territory exceeded the number of Russian drones that struck Ukraine. And this is certainly a success. What to be proud of. The operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region is called the most unexpected and perhaps the loudest event of the war in 2024. Until now, the defense forces conducted combat operations only on their territory. Raids on Russian territory were carried out only by fighters of foreign volunteer formations that support the struggle of Ukraine, and they usually lasted only a few days. Now the war has come to the land of the enemy for a long time. The success of the operation was ensured, in particular, by careful preparation and the fact that it was managed to be kept a secret until the last. The large-scale movement of troops was disguised as military exercises - the enemy was sure that the Armed Forces of Ukraine were preparing to repel their own offensive in Sumy Oblast. Only a narrow circle of those involved knew that it was an offensive on Russian territory: the officers were informed three days before the start of the operation, and the private soldiers - a day before the offensive. The offensive began on August 6, 2024 - and Ukrainian troops managed not only to crush the Russian forces near the border, but also to go deep into Russian territory. Initially, the enemy did not even understand what was happening, and I try to diminish the successes of the Armed Forces, even more disoriented with its soldiers. Many of which quickly realized that they had thrown and hurried to surrender. Without deciding to talk about the war in its territory, Moscow continued to pretend to be a small raid. Instead, Ukrainian fighters managed to take control of thousands of square kilometers in hostile territory in a week and to become entrenched in Sudzh and surrounding settlements. In fact, a buffer zone was created, which should not allow the enemy to fire the Ukrainian territory close. Equally important are the tasks of the operation - to cause maximum damage to the enemy, the intersection of his forces and the destruction of logistics. The transfer of hostilities to the Russian territory had a significant psychological effect. First of all, because she demonstrated the possibilities of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The partners, for whom the offensive also became unexpected, supported the right of Ukraine to active self -defense. It took the enemy to take a long time to get together with the forces, then to start attempting to counter -offensive in Kurkh. But most of these attempts were not successful. The situation on the collision line remains difficult, but the armed forces continue to fulfill their tasks.

Rustem Umyerov: The power of Ukrainian developments has already been felt by the enemy's military ai...	This stated the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov. -3,925 days of Russian aggression against Ukraine, which began with the temporary occupation of Crimea. 1000 days of full scale invasion. Our answer to the occupiers is the language of strength. It is the only language the dictator understands. And this force is, in particular, our Ukrainian long-range drones,- the minister said. He recalled that a year and a half ago, the President set the task of creating and scaling modern means of long-range destruction. -Today, the capabilities of our DeepStrike have become obvious to the whole world. The force of Ukrainian developments has already been felt by the enemy's military airfields, bases, and fuel depots hundreds and thousands of kilometers deep into Russia. We do not stop at what we have achieved,- Rustem Umyerov said. The minister took part in a meeting with manufacturers of long-range weapons. They discussed prospects, plans, conclusion of long-term contracts and approaches to strengthening the efficiency of the entire industry. -Our goal is to create means capable of hitting targets at the maximum possible distance with maximum accuracy. DeepStrike is a contribution to our victory. Thank you to everyone who works daily to strengthen the defense potential of Ukraine. We remain in touch with each manufacturer in order to promptly resolve issues and bring our victory closer together,- said Rustem Umyerov. As reported by ArmyInform, the main guarantor of Ukraine's stability should become a weapon — 30,000 long-range drones, 3,000 cruise missiles and a wave of technological innovations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/rustem-umyerov-sylu-ukrayinskyh-rozrobok-vzhe-vidchuly-na-sobi-vijskovi-aerodromy-i-bazy-voroga/	2024-11-19T04:14:13-08:00

-Neptunes-, drones and innovations - the head of state defined what guarantees the country's stabili...	This was announced by President Zelensky, who presented in the Verkhovna Rada Internal stability plan. According to President Volodymyr Zelenskyi, the country is developing military production as much as possible. So, more than 2.5 million mortar rounds and artillery shells were fired this year. The next goal is 30,000 long-range drones and 3,000 missiles. In addition, according to the President, it is necessary to be ahead of Russia in technologies. -For this reason, the format of the Technological Stavka is being implemented in Ukraine. In this format, on a regular basis, we will collect the best specialists and the most useful technological ideas. The first meeting of our Stavka will take place at the beginning of December,- said the President. According to the head of state, it is the strong defense and industrial complex of Ukraine that is able to ensure our state's independence in choosing a military strategy. Even without nuclear weapons, Ukraine can find conventional means of deterring the Russian Federation. As ArmyInform reported, Volodymyr Zelenskyi said on the need to appoint a military ombudsman.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/neptuny-drony-ta-innovacziyi-glava-derzhavy-vyznachyv-te-shho-garantuye-krayini-stijkist/	2024-11-19T03:48:13-08:00
Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated the need to appoint a military ombudsman	The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, said this while presenting the Internal Stability Plan of Ukraine in the Verkhovna Rada. -A person who will enjoy, first of all, the trust of the military and the entire society. I expect this in the near future,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He emphasized that within the Defense Forces there should be confidential opportunities for soldiers to resolve issues arising from violations of their rights. -Changing approaches to people management in the Armed Forces, in the National Guard of Ukraine, as well as spreading the best management practices in units. Each commander now answers the same question - -What is needed first of all?-. It's the personnel, it's people, the composition of teams, effective real training,- said the President. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also emphasized that it is necessary to talk about difficult things in our army, because effective solutions are possible only if there is an honest conversation about mobilization, reservation, and the system of military personnel. -Problems should be solved, not silenced. The reasons are to be found out and removed,- he said.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/volodymyr-zelenskyj-zayavyv-pro-neobhidnist-pryznachyty-vijskovogo-ombudsmena/	2024-11-19T03:26:16-08:00
They are dumping in Lviv, and they are brazen in the Kyiv region - the General Prosecutor's Office r...	This was announced on November 19 by the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine. Criminal schemes related to the illegal acquisition of disabilities allowed conscripts to avoid mobilization and illegally travel abroad. In Lviv, four doctors of one of the inter-district medical and social expert commissions were informed of the suspicion. They falsified medical documentation, on the basis of which men of military age were unjustly given disability. In this way, at least five people left the country. The cost of -services- was from $1,300. In the Kyiv region, two doctors of a district hospital were exposed, who for $12,000 offered a man to organize influence on MSEK members to obtain a disability group. The doctors started a fictitious treatment of the patient, but were exposed while receiving a part of the bribe in the amount of 3 thousand euros. A criminal group of seven people was exposed in Odesa, which included the head of the trauma department, a neuropathologist, an official of the regional center of MSEK and four civilians. Doctors produced fake medical documents that allowed them to evade military service, and an employee of MSEK ensured positive decisions of the commission. The remuneration for such -services- ranged from $4,500 to $6,000. During the searches, a significant amount of material evidence, including forged documents, accounting journals and other materials confirming illegal activity, and cash was seized from the suspects. All participants of the schemes were notified of the suspicion. Depending on the crimes committed, they are charged with abusing influence, obstructing the legal activities of the Armed Forces, assisting in the illegal transportation of persons across the border, and issuing a knowingly false official document (Article 2, Part 2, Article 369-2, Part 1, Article 114- 1, part 3 of article 332, part 1 of article 366 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). The question of choosing preventive measures for them is being resolved. Investigative actions are ongoing, the circle of involved persons is being established. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/u-lvovi-dempinguyut-a-na-kyyivshhyni-nahabniyut-u-genprokuratury-povidomyly-rozczinky-na-medychni-shemy-uhylyannya/	2024-11-19T03:19:37-08:00
-We will win, there is simply no other way out-: military journalists asked Odessans about 1000 days...	-I'm from Donetsk, so I ran here, to Odessa. Then I had to run to Romania and build a new life there, I had to move my relatives there. I have a father, he is already retired. I was in Bakhmut, during the period when it was completely bombed,- said Alina, a resident of Donetsk. Adapting to new realities was probably the most difficult, shared Alina from Odessa. It remains the most difficult even now. -Of course, I would like the situation in the country to stabilize and the war to end as soon as possible. As it was before the beginning, it was not at all full-scale, as it was before the beginning of the war in 2014,- said Alina. Meanwhile, Odessans are in pain and it is difficult. -It is very painful that they are dying, they are bombing us to this day. We very much believe that it will all stop soon,- Anastasia noted in her turn. True, not everyone is optimistic. As for the end of the war, Kateryna from Odesa says that -not surrender- would be a good option for war. -To be honest, I don't think it will be more than 5 years from now. I think it will take a lot of time,- Kateryna said. In general, the people of Odessa state, the final can only be one - we will win. One way or another. After all, there is simply no other way out. How reported ArmyInform, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy shared a video dedicated to 1000 days of heroic struggle of Ukrainians against aggression and for the freedom of his state.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/my-peremozhemo-inshogo-vyhodu-prosto-nemaye-vijskovi-zhurnalisty-zapytaly-odesytiv-pro-1000-dniv-vijny/	2024-11-19T03:06:07-08:00
The President instructed to present a new system of contracts for service in the Armed Forces	The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said this while presenting the Internal Stability Plan of Ukraine in the Verkhovna Rada. According to him, these contracts will have a tangible, very specific motivational component. -And there is no need for any speculation: our state is not preparing to lower the mobilization age. On the basis of new contractual approaches, we should gradually move to the formation of the army to a greater extent thanks to contracts, and not only mobilization,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. As reported by ArmyInform, currently 44 recruiting centers operate in the regions and 3 operating centers in the vertical of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. Tens of thousands of people have already applied to recruiting centers. The number of volunteers in the total number of those who join the army every month is 20-30 percent. The new procedure for recruiting started working on October 1 citizens of Ukraine in electronic form. According to the new rules, the military unit selected by the candidate must clarify his intentions regarding the conclusion of the contract. This happens through the use of a recruiting platform and includes an interview. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/prezydent-doruchyv-predstavyty-novu-systemu-kontraktiv-dlya-sluzhby-v-zsu/	2024-11-19T03:03:36-08:00
This man does not change for a trifle: a dealer who transported evaders in groups was detained at th...	About this informs State Border Service of Ukraine. The criminal was caught red-handed when he was transporting -evaders- in his vehicle to the border, having previously agreed with them on the details of the illegal operation. During the pre-trial investigation, it became known that the shipper is a resident of the Sarnen region. He had previously been convicted of property crimes and committed a new crime while on probation. The 21-year-old criminal was informed of the suspicion of illegal transportation of persons across the state border of Ukraine. The court chose a preventive measure in the form of detention with the possibility of bail. Law enforcement measures were carried out under the procedural guidance of the Sarnen District Prosecutor's Office, together with the National Police of the Rivne Region and the regional SBU Department.

Natural selection in the Luhansk region: only the heat-resistant will survive	the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor, told about it. At the same time, those who do not issue a Russian passport by the beginning of 2025 will be significantly limited in their access to social, medical and administrative services. This is another stage of forced passporting of the local population. The occupiers also acknowledged the disruption of the heating season in Siverskodonetsk, Lysychansk, Hirsky and Zoloty. In these cities, people remain without heat and centralized water supply. The lack of repair of damaged infrastructure systems since the time of active hostilities leads to an aggravation of the humanitarian crisis. Local residents found themselves on the edge of survival, relying only on their own strength. Broken water and heat supply systems make winter especially difficult for people. As reported by ArmyInform, occupants continue to delay capital repairs in the so-called -lnr-, leaving the local population without the necessary communal services.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/pryrodnij-vidbir-na-luganshhyni-vyzhyve-lyshe-termostijkyj/	2024-11-19T00:22:18-08:00

He invented some breakthroughs for himself: what the Russian commanders are lying about	This is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The commander of the 67th Motorized Rifle Division of the Russian Federation recently provided Major General Yusupov, the commander of the 25th Army of the Moscow Military District, with false information about the events on the battle line in the Lyman area, Donetsk region. In particular, in his report, the Russian commander announced the alleged fighting in the vicinity of Yampolivka and the breakthrough of occupiers to Torsky. However, this information is not true. Probably, in this way, the commander tried to hide significant losses from the strikes of the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine. Distorted or false reports on the state of affairs at the front are common practice at all levels of command of the Russian occupation forces. This once again emphasizes systemic incompetence and disorganization in the ranks of the Russian army.

The anti-drone regiment has arrived: how the American system neutralizes UAVs	In the official release from this manufacturing company from Virginia (USA) emphasizes that this system is the latest development, combining both kinetic and non-kinetic threat neutralization methods, providing a powerful and mobile solution for airspace protection, ArmiyaInform notes. The AirShield architecture is based on a multi-layered structure capable of operating in both stationary and mobile positions, covering all critical stages of protection: detection, tracking, classification, identification, prioritization and neutralization of threats. This complex chain of destruction allows the latest equipment to seamlessly integrate into existing air defense systems. -The threat posed by drones is rapidly evolving,- said Derrick Birdsell, AirShield Program Manager at Leidos. AirShield is designed to adapt to current systems and keep up with technological advances, allowing the addition of effectors for different types of weapons.- Once identified, the system prioritizes the threat and activates the appropriate effectors, which may include kinetic weapons such as missiles or non-kinetic effectors such as lasers or electronic jamming systems. This rapid and adaptive response not only neutralizes UAVs, but also includes cyber security strategies to counter any attempt to disrupt AirShield systems, providing comprehensive protection against emerging threats. Among the key elements of the system is the CUGAR (Co-axial Unmanned Guided Autonomous Rotorcraft) effector. This unmanned vehicle already demonstrates significant capabilities in the field of combating threats, but the company plans to expand its potential by integrating the APKWS (Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System) missile system. This will increase the accuracy and effectiveness of hitting targets. AirShield is easily compatible with a number of other technologies: high-energy lasers, turret guns, and powerful microwave systems. Such flexibility makes the system a versatile solution for combating a wide range of air threats. Leidos is actively exploring the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to further improve the AirShield system. These technologies can improve the system's ability to adapt and make independent decisions under complex combat conditions. An important aspect of AirShield's development is ensuring its resistance to cyber attacks, for which both offensive and defensive strategies are being developed. This project continues Leidos' work on C-UAS systems initiated by the US Defense Advanced Projects Agency's Mobile Force Protection (MFP) program (DARPA). After a successful demonstration, the program was transferred to the Air and Missile Development Center of the US Army Combat Capabilities Command (DEVCOM). Leidos plans to begin production of the AirShield in 2025, with initial deployment expected to the US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), which will be a significant advance for this innovative technology. As note analysts of the defense portal Army Recognition, the development of the AirShield system by Leidos is crucial due to the rapid growth of threats posed by unmanned aerial vehicles aerial systems (UAVs). As the use of drones for military operations and hostilities increases, the need for an effective and adaptive defense response becomes critical. AirShield is not only designed to protect military and civilian facilities from potential drone incursions, but also to provide an integrated solution that can adapt to new technologies and combat tactics. This positions Leidos as a leader in a growing market where air safety is a top priority. In addition, as geopolitical conflicts escalate and asymmetric threats grow, countries are looking for ways to protect their critical infrastructure and armed forces. As a versatile air defense system, AirShield offers real-time threat detection, tracking and neutralization capabilities that are vital to maintaining operational superiority. By integrating advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and various effectors, Leidos positions its system as an important response to the complex security environment, thereby helping to protect the strategic interests of its customers. At the international level, US allies that have problems with enemy UAVs, especially those participating in coalition operations, have expressed interest in acquiring such advanced C-UAS systems to strengthen their air defense capabilities. However, specific details about other foreign military forces interested in the AirShield system may not be publicly available at this time. AirShield is an advanced anti-drone system.

Winter is near. We check dugouts, prepare firewood and pet cats together with soldiers of the 44th O...	ArmyInform visited the soldiers of 44 separate mechanized brigades, who are fighting in one of the hot areas, to ask how they prepare for winter and adjust their life in conditions of constant danger of airstrikes. Do the dugouts leak, how much do mice interfere, how to wash in the field and how much firewood should be prepared for the winter - you will find out in the ArmyInform photo report below. We start our conversation in the field kitchen - this is where they gather to talk about life, to pet cats and dogs that nail themselves to positions, and to prepare food and even wash their hair. Recently, the soldiers insulated it for the winter - oilcloth around the perimeter was enough, because the -burzuyka- heats here almost 24 hours a day. There is an entrance to the dugout from the kitchen, which additionally makes it warmer and more protected. - The dugout was made by those who live here. There are five of us. Well, did Oleg -move- because he stayed in the forest alone in his dugout. He moved to live with us, the boys say. When asked if water does not flow from the kitchen down to the dugout during rains or when the snow melts, they explain that once it could collect at the entrance, but everything was still dry and warm below. At the beginning of the day, a bucket with water is left on the stove, it can stand like this all day long - so that, on occasion, someone who needs it can wash his head or take water for a trip to the bath. We go down from the kitchen to the dugout. From the conversation, it is felt that the guys made a good effort when they built their -housing-: the height here is about 2.3 meters, then there is a 50 cm -roll- and the ground. They show -heating- - the volume that can be placed under one -bunch- is enough for the winter. They say that there are stocks and they have time to chop more firewood. The immediate answer to the question of who is cutting down is everyone who lives. They do it when they are in the mood: -You know, sometimes you want to physically do something. So you take an ax and go chop wood.- They emphasize that they do not do any exceptional things about the dugout on the eve of winter, because it is already warm. Unless you often have to open the door to ventilate, but in general you can breathe normally. — The main thing is to periodically clean the pipe of the -burzuika- from soot. We clean once a week, because we smoke intensively in winter, - they explain. — We sleep in thermal baths, in the winter the -burzhujika- may take a little more firewood. But we did everything in such a way that on the eve of winter there is no need to prepare anything in particular, - says the soldier Valeriy. To avoid leaks, oilcloth is used everywhere. In general, this is a very useful thing in everyday life - it is also used to insulate the toilet and bath. All the remaining gaps are blown with mounting foam, which also helps retain heat. We ask the -Artist- about some features of everyday life that are not found in other of their peers. He immediately shows us a kitchen cabinet, which was made from a box from BC, as well as a -mashed- for potatoes with a grenade tip. Next, -Bob- picks us up - takes us outside and shows us an improvised refrigerator. At first glance, it's just a BC box stuck in the ground, but it's not. The technology, until the frosts hit, is as follows: the box is buried in the ground and the inside is decorated with a foil lining, which should keep the temperature. But in order to ensure the minimum temperature inside, bottles of frozen water are needed - the guys -order- them in advance at the store, and take them when they manage to go to the city. This is not all of the -chips- in these positions. Oleg and I leave the kitchen to see what the boys themselves say - -take a picture, because they won't believe it.- Indeed, it is hard to believe, but at the end of October, tomatoes grow here. The fighters do not know who planted them here and how, but nevertheless they tied up these tomatoes and visit from time to time to check if they have not withered. When asked whether it is realistic to harvest from this bush, he shakes his head in denial, but adds with a smile that the point is not to eat that tomato, but to take care of it as long as it is physically possible. The problem with electricity is solved by the battery, which was hidden under the -hole- in the dugout. A simple one, from a car, is enough for about a week. Guys have two of these: while one is working, the other is charging. Gadgets are -powered- by power banks. Also, the fighters emphasize that when it gets dark, they try not to use any light, they put the -airplane- mode on their phones. Starlinks are also not used, so as not to -burn- positions. At that moment, a dog runs past us, and the guys from the kitchen are yelling to keep an eye on things. Indeed, the dog wanted to chew on the pixel shoulder bag, which later would not be so easy to find in the yellow-green sheet. - They are always dragging around here - yesterday they grabbed a knife and hid it somewhere in the thicket. The other day, a stapler was taken and stolen. So why? Puppies love to cause harm, but once I hung up underwear and T-shirts, they gnawed some, and -dragged- the rest somewhere, - says Oleg. On the way to the next dugout, the fighter tells us about a woodpecker, who was not prevented by oilcloth from finding the desired log: he was so busy that he tore the -roof- at the entrance to the dugout for the boys. He also points to the forest road and says: -This is Festival Street, and over there on the side is Tykha Street.- This is how fighters jokingly call the combination between positions. The guys say that camouflage and distraction are very important in these places. By the way, the -swamp- camouflage net will soon be replaced by a -gray- one. Two brothers live in the second dugout. It is made somewhat differently: the entrance here is directly from the street, the dugout itself is three meters high, and the perimeter is covered with foil insulation. Heating is still the same -burzuyka-. There is an improvised -summer house- nearby. In this part of the forest, it replaces the field kitchen, because here people are going to make coffee, smoke and chat. It's getting dark. We have to gather, so to say goodbye to the boys, we return to the field kitchen. -The forester- says that we must see the bathhouse, which the fighters built in literally three days. - We don't have the conditions to wash properly. -They made a summer shower first, and now it's cold, then they wrapped that shower nicely with cellophane, and put a stove in the middle,- he says with delight. The soldier then explains to us the rules of use: 15 minutes before taking a shower, you must come and throw a few logs into the stove. While they are burning, you go to get water (the one that is heated in a bucket in the kitchen). — That is, the system is like this — you stand in this single bath, warm water pours from above little by little, you wash, drops of water fall from you onto a heated -bottle-, which creates the effect of a sauna in a cellophane-insulated cabin, -explains -The Forester.- -Perhaps what fairy tale will you tell as parting?- - we ask the soldiers. In response, there is a conversation about black army humor and the fact that lately the enemy is making a breakthrough on this part of the front, which is why the number of shelling has increased sharply. - Here the sky is very dangerous - everything is flying, and KABs, and -Lancets-, and artillery. It happened that for three or four days in a row, every hour, some kind of flight arrived somewhere nearby. And if it's quiet, it means that they're waiting for a -lift- and it's about to start again, says -Bob-. The boys add that there used to be a -Saharok- in the dugout, but over time it squealed more and more often. So, when enemy UAVs began to fly very often, it was simply turned off, because it interfered with sleep. They still remember a funny story in farewell. About mice. They say that there were a lot of them here in the beginning. Ants, mosquitoes, flies and ground fleas also bothered. So, over time, the local kittens began to be nailed to the positions, and, as it turned out, this was the best way to get rid of the mice. - It happened that the cat caught a mouse and brought it to bed. Like, look what I caught you, - says one of the fighters and immediately adds: - Anyway, it's better than when I was wearing a -burka-: I put my foot in, I feel something there, I look, I crushed three mice. After that, he constantly checks the shoes before putting them on. And in general, the boys say, there are many different animals here - for example, herds of wild goats run around at night. After that, we say our goodbyes and leave the position in near darkness, hoping that there will never be any more wild animals from the northeast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/zyma-blyzko-pereviryayemo-blindazhi-gotuyemo-drova-ta-gladymo-kotiv-razom-z-bijczyamy-44-ombr-fotoreportazh/	2024-11-18T21:07:24-08:00
-The highest degree of danger when I say -Svetka, pray--: the story of a professor who changed her j...	Oksana Chorna told the correspondent of ArmiyaInform about what she had to experience during these years. Oksana herself recalls these days with a smile: - I tried to return to civilian life in 2017. I was demobilized, started working at the Academy of Sciences, but I was never able to transition from military to civilian life. It is really difficult: here you save people, take out the wounded, and there is paperwork&#8230; I decided that I had to change something. Oksana started volunteering - she went to visit her boyfriends who were stationed near Volnovakha. Since she had a category C license, she drove trucks and took out the wounded. It so happened that she was invited to a university in Oman. Since the summer of 2017, she worked there as a professor of economics at the Modern College of Business and Science in Muscat. And in March 2022, she returned to Ukraine after the start of a large-scale invasion, abandoning everything. — My husband went to serve in his unit, and I am a combat medic in the 57th brigade. At that time, fighting continued near the settlements of Toshkivka, Novotoshkivka, and Lysychansk. I took out the wounded. In my opinion, these were the most terrible battles during the entire time of the large-scale invasion. Then there was the defense of Kherson, Bakhmut, and later Avdiivka. It was very difficult. There were very few of our artillery there, while everything was firing at them - tanks, -barrel-, jet systems. True, there were no KABs yet, but -nurses- (unguided air missile (NAR) - the outdated designation of air missiles as NURS from the Russian -unguided rocket-. - Author) were constantly arriving. And this thing is unpleasant: thin, long, like a needle, flies and sticks at 80 degrees. Oksana then drove a white Mercedes Sprinter. It was an ordinary -fast- brought from Poland, painted in white-red-blue color: - At first I thought of repainting, but I realized that there is no point, because everything is just scattered there. We had a corner where we parked our cars. I remember that when I served in 2014-2016, I had a nice gurney. We put the wounded on it, and everything was fine. But during the battles near Lysychansk, Oksana had to throw away that gurney, because there were always so many wounded that they were stuffed into the car. She found sofa cushions in destroyed houses, threw them in the -ambulance- so that the boys could comfortably sit and lie on them. There was no connection anywhere - only in Lysychansk hospital: Starlink was there. — I came to the hospital, handed over the wounded. They tell me: -don't come back, there is heavy shelling.- But I'm leaving. The thought flashed through my mind that the road was under fire. I hesitated for a while. She left I'm coming Terrible shelling, it is clear that everything there is exploding, burning, as usual - the Russians then threw magnesium bombs at us, which did not extinguish in any way. You can only throw them off the car if you have time, of course. You take the wounded, go back, all the couch cushions are soaked in blood. You throw it away, you take others. It's all difficult&#8230; Oksana constantly mentions the courage of our defenders. She remembered one girl the most: - We took her out with a concussion, gave her to the doctors. And in two days, when I came to pick up the wounded, I saw her again. She simply returned to her own. However, this time she was seriously wounded by shrapnel. We took her out then. I don't know what happened to her next. But I still remember her — One of our positions was shot by a Russian tank. We thought they were all dead. No one made contact from there, the position was lost. Ours retreated. However, within a day, a guy from this position came directly to our medical center from there. He was all dressed in white, so white: face, uniform. He came out with a weapon. He said that he dug himself out because it was buried. In order to survive, he drank water from the battery in the building where they were hiding. He passed without a fight to our positions, reached the first aid station. The doctor examined him, he had an injury only from chest compression. He had no serious injuries, fractures or such open wounds. He slept for two days because he was under a lot of stress. Later, he returned to his position with his boys. He didn't even want to be evacuated&#8230; Oksana also remembered abandoned pets - dogs, cats&#8230; People were moving out and simply leaving their dogs or cats behind. She recalls that there were a lot of injured animals and how doctor Svitlana tried to treat one of them. — But during the Kherson operation, in the fall of 2022, there were already FABs (high-explosive aerial bombs. — Author). They were dropped with parachutes&#8230; And when we searched the fields there and took away our dead, I flew a drone, because there were mines everywhere. So, we flew a -mavik- over the fields to look for our dead, and at first I thought that these were bodies, as white as a body in appearance, but parachutes. There, all the fields were strewn with parachutes from FABs, she recalls. Oksana talks about her trips on the front roads as if it were about ordinary work: - I remember the roads very well. And also, when I drove the -fast-, I started convoys of armored vehicles, that is, I was followed by BMP. We stayed in Avdiivka for almost a year, then I knew every path where you can drive, I knew all the detours. If there was a battle or shelling going on, or just something burning there, I always had a -plan B-. To my question, what Oksana felt during these trips, she answers frankly without hesitation: - It was very scary. The greatest fear was when you arrived at a position and the Russians were already there. We had another girl there, a doctor at the medical center, Svitlana Balenko. And she and I went to the positions in Bakhmut together. We were so scared that we held hands, I was driving, she was next to me. I tell her: -Sveta, the cap is on- - this is the first degree of fear. Then, when it has already arrived, the second stage begins - -the cap is fastened-. And then, when you drive and everything is on fire, burning, you drive there, we had the highest degree of danger when I say -Svetka, pray.- And she began to read some prayer aloud. I say: -give me another one, you've already read this one.- And she knew a lot of prayers, and judging by the fact that we are sitting and talking, it probably helped. In 2024, the situation has changed a lot. Now, taking out the wounded is a very difficult and one hundred percent man's job, because you have to pull them out, carry them to the car. And just sitting in the medical center and not making trips, in Oksana's opinion, made no sense. - I can be useful in other areas of military life. Then she moved to the position of public relations officer. I am talking about my brothers. And recently I made a calendar. The guy whose photo illustrates -January- died. His brothers still have it hanging on the wall. They don't turn it over&#8230; P.S. Currently, Lieutenant Oksana Chorna has received a new assignment in another brigade.

1000 days of the great war: about victory without illusions and despair. ArmiyaInform interview with...	And he also talked about why he chose the -Charter- brigade in particular, what the victory should be and what he plans to do the next day after it. — What is the greatest achievement of Ukraine to 1000 days of the great war? — The achievement, it seems to me, is that we hold on, that we did not give up, that we did not capitulate, despite the fact that at the beginning the balance of forces was not at all in our favor. I think this should be seen as positive. And some disadvantages - there are many of them. I think they should be talked about by specialists, experts who know more about military affairs. - And what is the biggest problem of Ukraine before 1000 days of the great war? - The problem of resources. Still, it is limited in our country. And if we talk about people who are ready to continue fighting, ready to continue to hold on and defend their country, then purely resource-wise, financially or, say, technically, or in the sense of the weapons that we have. But it seems to me that what we focus on is much more important. Do we focus on the positive without any excessive illusions, or do we still focus on the negative to the point of complete despair. — What is the most important question that Ukraine, the Ukrainian state and every citizen of Ukraine must answer now before 1000 days of a large-scale invasion? Is it the same question for all mentioned or can it be different, so, accordingly, different answers? — I think there are questions that further unite us. This is a question of what we are ready for for the sake of our country, for the sake of our future, how much we are ready to unite and what we are ready to do in this aspect. But I understand that the question is quite difficult, especially today, because now, as far as I can see, many people are emotionally tired. In addition, even the worldview is terribly misinformed, because our enemy works very skillfully and very effectively on our consciousness. — What advice would you give today to yourself 1000 days ago? Would you then and then for 1000 days do the same thing or would you do something different and different? - But in general the same. Perhaps I would advise myself to work more purposefully and in a more targeted way, after all, from then on, I should immediately set myself up for a long distance. I, like many compatriots, also experienced some emotional swings from falling into a certain euphoria when something was going well for us, to some dark days of despair. It takes a lot of effort. But hindsight is easy to be smart about. In fact, we all go through this path together, step by step. To make some mistakes, it seems to me, is natural. The main thing is to be able to draw some conclusions from them. — Since the first day of the war, since 2014, you have been volunteering, engaged in public activities. Why did you ultimately decide to join the Defense Forces as a serviceman?- I have always tried to be as efficient as possible. As long as there was an opportunity to work effectively as a volunteer - worked as a volunteer. But the law on mobilization was passed. I am a man of conscription age, a citizen of Ukraine of conscription age. As a law-abiding citizen, it was not even in my thoughts to dodge, hide or look for other options. Therefore, I immediately began to prepare for mobilization when I learned that such a law would be passed. —You have chosen the National Guard of Ukraine and the -Charter- brigade. Why NSU in particular and why -Charter- in particular? — The question of one's own effectiveness, one's own rational involvement was important to me and will remain important in the future. I know this unit, my friends and I created it, we saw how the unit was formed, how it grew, how it first turned from the DFTG into a full-fledged battalion, and then, actually, into a brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine. I know the leadership, the command of the brigade very well, I know many fighters personally. Thanks to this, I knew how I could contribute, how I could be useful, where I could be involved and where I could be effective. Therefore, for me, there was no special question regarding the -Charter-. —The experience of -Charter- is very positive, it is very media. How can this successful experience of -Charter- and other brigades be scaled to the entire Defense Forces of Ukraine? What should be done for this? - In fact, the -Charter- is not the only one. We have several divisions that perfectly understand that today both the autonomy of the division and the medialness of the division are important. And it's not about PR, it's definitely about efficiency. When you know how to build communications inside the unit and outside - both with business representatives and with representatives of the public - you have much more opportunities to provide your unit, to provide the soldiers with everything they need. It seems to me that this is definitely a positive thing, and it is probably not necessary to look for any negative here. It's important for Charter, it's a feature of Charter, and we actually try to be quite open in communication with society and to be honest. In my opinion, this creates a rather positive image of the brigade. Thanks to this, many people want to join the -Charter- today, in particular, fighters from other units are applying. I think this shows that the team is doing everything right. And how to transfer it to the experience of other divisions, is it possible to do it? I think it has to be done and, obviously, it cannot be done by the unit itself. It should still be an initiative on the part of the command, because, indeed, in many respects our Defense Forces need changes, need development, improvement. This should not be feared, it should be worked on, understanding that this is an improvement, that these changes will increase our efficiency, will make life easier for the fighter. — What should a real victory look like? What should we preserve in order to remain Ukraine? — Ukraine must preserve its statehood. Ukraine must preserve its citizens. This is the most valuable thing that can be - every human life, because every human loss, every human death is something irreversible, it is something that cannot be compensated in any way. And victory will be, it seems to me, future security, when the threat of defeat actually disappears, when the threat of human or territorial losses disappears. Therefore, I think that the issue of victory is not only purely physical, but also metaphysical. Here much will depend on what can be expected after the moment when the end of the war is announced. — Did you plan the day after the victory? What will you do after the war is over? - I have a lot of plans. In fact, I think it will somehow be further connected to the unit. -Charter- is not just a company of people who randomly got together, took up arms, and are going to disperse after the war is over. We create an environment, we create a community, a society. Regardless of whether this war ends, we will continue to have a lot of joint work, because we are united by our values, united by some common idea, common principles. Therefore, I think that I will meet this day in the company of my friends, with whom we are currently serving in the ranks of the brigade.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/1000-dniv-velykoyi-vijny-pro-peremogu-bez-ilyuzij-ta-zneviry-intervyu-armiyainform-z-sergiyem-zhadanom/	2024-11-18T20:32:00-08:00
Darknet in Russian: fakers spread lies about mercenary bodies	The Russians are also spreading information that they are allegedly selling the heart of a murdered 31-year-old German mercenary who served in the Armed Forces on the darknet. The price of such an organ is allegedly $70,000. Propagandists assure that the organ is in -good condition- and is sold exclusively to Germans. The -proof- is a screenshot of an ad from the darknet. The darknet (dark web) is a network of encrypted online content that cannot be accessed through conventional search engines. To access the darknet, users install a private browser and a virtual network that helps hide their identity and location. Because of this anonymity, this network is often used to sell drugs, share stolen data, and conduct other illegal activities. But Russian fakers faked not only the darknet announcement about the sale of the heart, but even the photo. It is not a human organ, but the powerful drug opium. -Black transplantology- is a favorite topic of Russian propagandists. They constantly lie that the military's organs are -illegally- removed in hospitals. Although in reality no such case has been recorded. In the fake about the sale of the heart, the Russians combined two narratives at once - about -black transplant specialists- and so-called mercenaries. In this way, they wanted to assert that foreign military personnel in Ukraine are treated as cannon fodder, and after that they will also -sell- them for organs. The goal is to undermine the confidence of foreigners in Ukraine and reduce their support. We emphasize once again that there are no -mercenaries- in Ukraine. Foreigners serve in the Defense Forces under a contract and have the full status of military personnel.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/darknet-po-rosijsky-fejkoroby-poshyryuyut-brehnyu-pro-organy-najmancziv/	2024-11-18T20:12:21-08:00
1000 Days of All-out War: A Timeline of Evil	1,000 days of time, during which Ukraine etched its name on the world map with blood and iron, cultivated respect and admiration for the colors of its flag, the flawless geometric forms of the national coat of arms, and the chivalry of the Warriors of Light — the Armed Forces of Ukraine throughout the globe. 1000 days that established us as a monolithic nation — ethnically, politically, spiritually. Of course, in a war that has lasted 10 years and 9 months, more than a quarter of which is already large-scale, it is somehow no longer commilfo to speak such pathetic meanings. After all, on the 1000th day, one feels general fatigue from what is happening: from the daily statistics of losses, shelling, destruction, from the enemy's advances in the populated areas of eastern Ukraine that have been wiped off the face of the earth. In addition, every day everyone has to filter out hostile IPSOs from objective news in the information space, which is imposed on those who are mostly awake due to constant -shakhed- attacks of the night&#8230; But even though there is a war, life goes on. And everyone who lives this thousandth day will certainly remember all those stages of confrontation, which cause not only sadness, but also pride, respect, inspiration for further struggle towards our inevitable Victory. Let's remember and try to systematize the periods of the Russian-Ukrainian war and we, together with the military historian, head of the NGO -Military History Center- Vasyl Pavlov. -This war is the most informational of all the wars Ukraine has waged throughout its history. In connection with this, we have a large number of materials, information, testimonies that have completely different origins. These are official documents and unofficial videos on Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, etc. These are scientific studies, journalistic studies, articles in information resources, documentaries, stories in the news. All this creates a huge array of information that really needs to be systematized,- says Vasyl Pavlov. It is very important to remember and understand how a war develops, because every war has its stages. The large-scale one was preceded by a -hybrid- phase that began with the occupation of Crimea. Then, from July 2021, there was preparation for the -great war-, which, unfortunately, was inevitable. And when on February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation carried out an open, large-scale attack on Ukraine, a new period of Russian aggression against Ukraine began, which scientists also divide into parts. In particular, specialists of the National Defense University of Ukraine single out several strategic defensive and offensive operations, and Vasyl Pavlov prefers periodization by years. -Since we are in a new information society, where events develop faster, are analyzed faster, even history is written faster, then ordinary people, and information resources, and even scientists need much faster periodization. We de facto periodize this war by years, or by campaigns: the campaign of the 22nd year, the campaign of the 23rd year, the campaign of the 24th. Yes, the 2024 campaign can be conventionally divided, as is traditionally done, into winter-spring, spring-summer, summer-autumn, and now we have already entered the autumn-winter campaign. Each of these periods has its own peculiarities and characteristic features related to the climate, the territory, and nature, but at the same time they have features related, for example, to the mobilization campaign in our country, the completion or opening of hidden mobilization in Russia. They coincide with the provision or non-provision of military-technical assistance to us. That is, there are a lot of factors that can affect one or another periodization, no matter what it is - whether it will be calendar, or event, or symbolic, that is, it will be based on some individual symbolic events, from which we will count. For example, the periodization of 2022 was significant. In fact, it was all based not so much on the calendar as on significant events that could be celebrated (the Battle for Kyiv, the escape of the occupiers from Zmiiny Island, the Kharkiv and Kherson offensive operations.— Author). But such periodization is possible only during the active phase of hostilities, when both opponents are active. At the moment, due to a number of factors, we are forced to respond to Russia's actions. If we talk about the 2024 campaign, then the question of any war arises here: how do we write its history? Do we write history through our actions or do we write history through the actions of the adversary? I want to explain this. The description of any war is that it can be done in different ways: how the enemy acted and how we countered him, or how we acted and the enemy responded to our actions. And there is a significant difference in this. It consists in who sets the initiative, who describes and how he describes. They say that history is written by the victors (and in this war, I hope, we will win), but the situation demands that the history of this war be written before its end. And we do it, but the Russians do it too,- Vasyl Pavlov explains. In particular, the destruction of the Russian A-50U long-range radar detection aircraft over the Sea of ​​Azov and the Krasnodar Territory, the signing of Security Agreements and the Global Peace Summit, battles in the north of Kharkiv region and in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation were significant for us in the current year. -The Kursk operation is really a completely new milestone, a new element. This is not the liberation of the occupied territories, but the transfer of hostilities to the official territory of the enemy, which is recognized as international borders. But, as in our case, no international organization could influence these actions. Frankly speaking, Ukraine committed an act of aggression. There is nothing wrong with that. We committed an act of aggression in response to an act of aggression. But we did do something that is very difficult to do in defensive wars — we moved the fighting into the enemy's territory. In this way, as they like to say, we turned the board upside down. That is, we changed the rules of the game, changed the approaches to them. And thus, many plans of the Russians for the summer-autumn campaign, for the second part or for the end of the summer, were fundamentally confused. After all, they were forced to respond to this, and to respond, perhaps, not so much on the front line itself, but in the information plane, for their citizens. They can advance as much as they want on the territory of Ukraine, but they still cannot get rid of the fact that Ukrainian troops are on the territory of Russia itself. This territory is quite large. And what to do with these troops, Russia has not invented at the moment,- Vasyl Pavlov notes. Historically, people remember the -last blood- - the war closest to them in time. Such was the Second World War for many of us before the events of 2014, and then in 2022. Once, when I was a schoolboy and learned that the period of German occupation of Kyiv lasted 778 days, I thought for a long time about what it was like to live in prison for so long, without rights and freedoms, under the threat of being shot at any moment. Old people in the 1990s, recalling the -last war- — the Second World War, said that any troubles can be survived if there was no war. But she is. Every day for 1000 days, the enemy has been trying to destroy us. Mariupol, for example, has been under occupation longer than during World War II. Now the collective memory of Ukrainians is building a grandiose canvas of images and symbols, events and phenomena, heroes and anti-heroes, which became decisive in the Ukrainian resistance to Russian aggression and will form the image of the -last blood-, the -last war- for future generations. Therefore, the Russian-Ukrainian war and the Victory in it will remain the core of the national memory of Ukrainians for a long time. I want them to stay like this forever.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/1000-dniv-shyrokomasshtabnoyi-vijny-hronologiya-zla/	2024-11-18T20:00:23-08:00
The navies of Ukraine and Great Britain will improve unmanned technologies	This was announced on November 18 by the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Among the main topics of the conversation are the results of the work of the Coalition on the development of maritime capabilities of Ukraine, the strengthening of the defense potential of our Navy and the development of promising directions, in particular, unmanned technologies. -Thanks to the support of Great Britain and other partners, we continue to improve our capabilities,- said Oleksiy Neizhpapa. He also informed his British colleague about the operational situation in the Black Sea, the participation of marines in combat operations on key areas of the front and the consequences of today's Russian attack on Odesa. Admiral Ben Key expressed his condolences to the victims of the Russian aggressor and assured that the partners will continue to do everything possible for Ukrainian victory. As reported by ArmyInform, the Commander of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Vice Admiral Oleksii Neizhpapa met with the commander of the Royal Danish Naval Forces Rear Admiral Henrik Rüberg.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/18/vms-ukrayiny-ta-velykoyi-brytaniyi-budut-vdoskonalyuvaty-bezpilotni-tehnologiyi/	2024-11-18T12:08:16-08:00
The Armed Forces reported the number of shells spent in 2023	About this in interv& #8217;yu RBC-Ukraine said the Deputy Commander of Missile Forces and Artillery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Serhii Musienko. He said that the Soviet caliber of 152 mm is currently being superseded. -However, first of all, there is still production of these ammunitions in the world. And there are quite modern artillery systems that are currently in use in our troops of this caliber, and they are supplied with 152 mm shots. These are Czech DANA-M2 self-propelled guns and a Soviet Msta-B howitzer, Serhii Musienko reported. In 2022, the Defense Forces used about 1.5 million artillery munitions, ranging from 120 mm mines to rockets to MLRS. Half of them are of 152 mm and 122 mm caliber. A third were 155 mm shots. According to him, at the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Russia, the Armed Forces of Ukraine used 152 mm and 122 mm guns at the front. And starting from the middle of 2022, 155 mm and 105 mm howitzers, which were transferred by partners, began to appear in the Ukrainian troops. &#8220;Already in 2023, we spent more than 3 million shells. Of these, 1.6-1.7 million were 155 mm ammunition. That is, half of the ammunition we used &#8211; it is 155 mm. By 2024, the ratio of 152 mm and 155 mm will be 1 to 10, respectively,- noted Serhii Musienko. According to him, along with the 155 mm caliber, the 105 mm caliber ammunition has proven itself well.

Doctors of last hope - a plastic surgeon and a pediatric oncologist save wounded soldiers	The video was released on November 18 on the brigade's channel. The headquarters of the brigade is a place where wounded, bleeding, shocked and contused soldiers from the front are taken after heavy battles, shelling, and explosions. If they're here, it means they've been through hell, but still have a chance at life. At the headquarters, the wounded are given medical assistance, their condition is stabilized, and then they are taken to the hospital. Currently, the medical team of the 93rd brigade employs military surgeons who have proven themselves to be among the most experienced. They know how to deal with critical bleeding, lacerations, multiple debris and military stress. But they did not always have such special skills. One of the surgeons, Oleg Kolomiets, in civilian life was a pediatric surgeon and oncologist, treating children from cancer. And Viktor Rodin was a plastic surgeon before the war: he reduced noses and bellies, rejuvenated the face, enlarged breasts and performed other operations in the field of aesthetic medicine. About how the brigade headquarters works, whether it was difficult to switch from civilian to military specialization, which periods of the war were most memorable, what keeps the mentality of medics in the army afloat, see the story of the brigade: As reported by ArmyInform, the pilot with the call sign Lyolik from the Black Raven 93 unit of the mechanized brigade -Holodny Yar- kyyevi/->won the first competition in the history of Ukraine among fpv pilots, in which 15 combat brigades and units took part.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/18/likari-ostannoyi-nadiyi-plastychnyj-hirurg-ta-dytyachyj-onkolog-ryatuyut-poranenyh-bijcziv/	2024-11-18T11:32:15-08:00

Now, even if the transfer is refused, the system is guaranteed to report the reasons for the negative response,- Kateryna Chernogorenko wrote. She named the most common reasons for translation refusals: -On the other hand, the number of approved reports shows that the service works efficiently. We are already working on making the service available to all Defense Forces. Digitization continues to transform our army into the army of the future, where any service is obtained simply, transparently and quickly. So that the military is engaged in service, not paperwork.

Rustem Umerov: Ukraine is increasing the production of missiles	This is stated in the message of the minister on the page in Facebook. The minister recalled that on April 13, 2022, the Neptune missile complex destroyed the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, the cruiser -Moskva-. It became a historic moment and demonstrated the strength of our national missile armament. -Today we are increasing the production of Ukrainian missiles. The first 100 rockets of this year have already been produced. Serial production of R-360 -Neptun- cruise missiles with improvements for hitting targets at longer distances has been successfully scaled,- said Rustem Umyerov. Also, according to him, new drone missiles are being developed, in particular -Palyanytsia-, which is an example of successful cooperation between the state and the private sector. -We work in this direction with foreign partners as well.

-Gunsmith's guide-: why private arms manufacturers need it	TSU specialists created it based on the experience of companies working in the defense-industrial complex of Ukraine. Executive Director of the Technological Forces of Ukraine, Kateryna Mikhalko, told ArmiyaInform correspondent why there was a need to publish the -Armorer's Guide-. — As an association of private manufacturers, we have seen that enterprises at different stages of development are still faced with a misunderstanding of the sequence of state procedures. Because there are a lot of them (procedures - ed.), they do not always, let's say, have an unambiguous interpretation for the industry, - the executive director notes. According to her, TSU received many requests for clarification on the mechanisms of state regulation in the arms supply processes: — And we decided to form it into a single book. Where all the regulations would be collected, their sequence was described step by step, and what the manufacturer should do at the moment when he had the idea to make a new type of weapon - until the moment of passing all the procedures of the Ministry of Defense inspections. And then, actually, about signing a state contract and supplying these weapons to the army. Kateryna Mikhalko says that the -Gunsmith's Guide- was also published so that experienced manufacturers could give this book to their team members, and to make it easier for new employees to understand the field of weapons. - Also, this book was created so that small manufacturers who are just starting their journey could take the -Gunsmith's Guide- and understand what path awaits them in interaction with the state. To our partners and manufacturers who are part of the -Technological Forces of Ukraine- association, we made it publicly available for everyone. If there is any company outside our community, they can find it online with us at sites and read. That is, this is such a gift from our manufacturers to the entire industry, - stressed the executive director of the Technological Forces of Ukraine Kateryna Mikhalko.

-Gerbery- made of plywood and foreign electronics: the GUR told about a drone that imitates -Shahedy...	This is stated in message GUR MOU. The aggressor state of Russia assembles such multi-tasking UAVs at a factory in the city of Yelabuga. -Gerbera- can carry a combat unit as a kamikaze and carry out radio-electronic reconnaissance, in particular, to detect air defense positions and record the hits of other strike drones. This UAV imitates the Shahed-136/Geran-2 and is widely used by Russia to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. Due to the use of simple materials (plywood, foam), -Gerbera- is ten times cheaper than -Shakhed-. However, the structure of this drone contains a set of components of foreign manufacturers, which is already familiar for Russian weapons. The research of the downed samples proved that the Russians are making these UAVs according to the Chinese prototype using foreign components imported from China. The developer of the UAV is the Chinese model aircraft manufacturer Skywalker Technology Co., Ltd., which also produces fuselages and organizes the delivery of kits to Russia. Delivery is carried out through third-party companies. The anti-interference antenna (CRPA) contains chips from Analog Devices and Texas Instruments (USA), NXP Semiconductors (Netherlands). The universal flight controller also includes components manufactured by Texas Instruments, Atmel (USA), STMicroelectronics, U-Blox (Switzerland), NXP Semiconductors (Netherlands), XLSEMI (China). For targeting by the pilot (according to the FPV-drone principle) of the barrage version of the UAV and conducting aerial reconnaissance, the Gerbera is equipped with a Chinese camera with a three-axis suspension Topotek KHY10S90 and a Xingkai Tech Mesh Network XK-F358 modem. The DLE60 engine is manufactured by the Chinese Mile Hao Xiang Technology Co., Ltd. In the summer of 2024, this company came under US sanctions for supplies to Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/18/gerbery-z-fanery-ta-inozemnoyi-elektroniky-u-gur-rozpovily-pro-dron-shho-imituye-shahedy/	2024-11-17T23:17:44-08:00

Junior Sergeant -Hunger-: the story of an anti-aircraft gunner from the DSHV who destroyed an enemy ...	— I'm -Hunger- because that's what the boys like, and to be honest, I'm always hungry for everything - movement and adrenaline. Well, sometimes I don't finish my meal or overeat, as happens on duty,- Ivan jokes. A paratrooper from Bila Tserkva, he has been serving in the brigade for the second year, which he calls his second family. And when he is asked what he does in the service, Ivan simply answers: -Everything — training of personnel, and inspection of property, ammunition, missiles, weapons. And, of course, I motivate the boys. Sometimes with a word, sometimes with a pronoun. The main thing is to set them up so that they don't want to die, but want to kill and come back.- One of Ivan's major achievements was the 2024 raid on Kurshchyna, during which he shot down a Russian Ka-52 Alligator. -The third day of the operation. The guys broadcast on the radio: pinwheels are flying, running for destruction. I'm in position, taking the Stinger MANPADS. The helicopter was flying straight at me. Only the power grid got in the way - I was afraid that the rocket might catch on. But everything went smoothly. A shot, and in a few seconds I hide in the landing so that the enemy does not capture the position. I hear on the radio: -Hit!- The guys are happier than I am, because I'm in shock. Then came the feeling of maximum joy and satisfaction. After that, the enemy did not fly so brazenly,- he says. -Hunger- emphasizes that the -Stinger- is a powerful tool, but not all MANPADS are so -smooth-: -I had 4 missiles for the older MANPADS that simply did not fly - old equipment. You want to cover the infantry, but you can't. Therefore, Stinger is a solution to many problems for us. Everything is simple there: the target in the crosshairs - a second and a half - a shot. There is no time to think.- Now there are slightly fewer combat missions, because the enemy has realized that it is dangerous to fly in. But, according to Ivan, they are always ready. -If it is a UAV of the Zala or SuperCam type, we are working on the situation. If it just flies by, we don't waste the resource and don't -burn- the position. If it flies specifically at us, then we shoot it down with small arms. With MANPADS, we only go for the -big fish-. When Ivan joined the service, at first he planned to join the 95th Brigade of the Military Police, because his friends served there. But he got into the 82nd and did not regret it: -When I started studying, many of my fellow students wanted to study art or be tank drivers. I thought and realized that it would be cool for me to destroy enemy aircraft as much as possible. And so it happened. I am constantly learning, improving my qualifications. I dream of becoming the chief sergeant of the platoon and not only teaching the boys, but also running with them, destroying enemy turntables.- Ivan's words resonate in hearts. He lives for Victory and does everything so that the enemy is afraid to even appear in the sky over Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/18/molodshyj-serzhant-golod-istoriya-zenitnyka-z-dshv-yakyj-znyshhyv-vorozhyj-ka-52-na-kurshhyni/	2024-11-17T21:00:05-08:00
Sergeant's Day of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: about military art, refusal of officer positions and ...	Why do sergeants sometimes have to act as officers at the front? How many sergeants have received state awards since 2014? And in general, how is the sergeant corps living in the third year of a large-scale invasion? Chief Sergeant of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksandr Kosynskyi told ArmyInform about this. — Sergeants’ tasks today essentially remained the same: preparing personnel for combat, keeping weapons in constant readiness, preparing positions, managing people during combat, their moral support, maintaining discipline, says the chief sergeant of the Armed Forces. According to him, quite often sergeants and senior officers perform the duties of officers. This is sometimes due to the absence or inability of such persons to manage the personnel, to manage the battle. After all, some of these officers were drafted into the army only because they have a higher education. — Sergeants, who perform the duties of platoon commanders, manage the unit during the battle. Some even serve as company commanders. So war is not about education, it is about ability, training and experience. Oleksandr Kosynsky claims that sergeants and senior officers are practitioners. Because they were all soldiers, they know how to work with them. Sergeants are always closer to people, and therefore they manage to adapt faster to the conditions of the constantly changing environment. — The main thing is that there should be support, interaction and freedom of action, choice of methods and ways of completing tasks. As for the challenges, one of the most critical for us sergeants is the lack of entry into the personnel units, as well as the physical and moral qualities of those who come. He explains this by the fact that during the fighting of such intensity as now, servicemen fall out of formation every day. First of all, due to injuries and contusions. Many return to duty after being wounded, but it takes time: - Even after some wounds, no matter how motivated a sergeant is, he can no longer physically perform the combat tasks he used to perform. — The sergeants in the units are also today accepting newcomers who come from the training centers. Who after BZVP, who after professional training. The sergeants carry out their additional training and adaptation, Kosynskyi says. And he adds that this training is conducted by sergeants with combat experience, specifically for the types of weapons that are in the unit. And these are not only automatic rifles and submachine guns, these are also machine guns and portable anti-tank vehicles: - Sergeants teach the art of survival on the battlefield, train for the type of combat that is relevant in this area of ​​the front. But many of those who are called -young recruits- often lack the proper physical shape, endurance, have diseases and injuries, or are morally weak, not warriors. The chief sergeant of the Armed Forces claims that during the training of recruits, both motivation and confidence increase, skills and abilities increase. But you cannot go against certain physical or psychological limitations. And to carry out a combat mission, strong and brave men are needed. — And they are a potential for filling sergeant positions. After all, sergeants also fall out of the ranks. Or they go to higher positions, after the detachment - to the positions of chief sergeants of platoons, companies, battalions. This is important so that they can apply their experience at the highest levels of military management. But sergeant positions must be constantly replenished, and there are difficulties with this. There is no soldier - there will be no sergeant, says Kosynskyi. Separately, he notes that many sergeants and foremen are appointed to officer positions: - Why do they take the best of the best. Yes, it is important to replenish officer positions as well. It is important that there are experienced, adequate military personnel. The success of the battle, the survival and health of personnel, the survivability of the unit itself, and its cohesion depend on them, on their decisions and actions. At the same time, the chief sergeant of the Armed Forces notes that it is very difficult to maintain and grow in these conditions the -bone- of professional, experienced and motivated sergeants who would form the basis of the foundations of the sergeant corps. Because no one but a sergeant will train a soldier. — We have more than 250,000 non-commissioned officer and sergeant positions, which are approximately four-fifths full. This is what I say for all types and types of troops. -Unfortunately, the worst staffing is precisely in those combat units and units that fight the enemy on the front line every day,- says Oleksandr Kosynskyi. And he clarifies that now about three quarters of sergeants are mobilized. That is, the personnel potential of professional sergeants, who have been raised since 2014, bearers of the -sergeant idea-, is decreasing: - Although I must note that a lot of mobilized servicemen are mastering the sergeant's business, taking over the foundations that were laid in the formation of the modern professional corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, reach a level no worse than that of professional sergeants. I meet a lot of such mobilized sergeants and chiefs while working in units, in areas of combat operations. I am often surprised at how quickly some of them are permeated by our sergeant's ideas, values. The master sergeant emphasizes that many of these soldiers have already completed various non-commissioned officer courses, and abroad as well. — I meet many and those who refused to move to officer positions, although they have a higher education, some even more than one. I think, I believe, I know that the future of the sergeant corps lies with such sergeants and chiefs. Because only the faithful are worthy. Our sergeants and senior officers are modern heroes, supermen, those on whose shoulders rests this thin and extremely long battle line of our nation's battle with the evil coming at us from Moscow, Kosinsky notes. Since 2014, more than 25,000 sergeants and officers have received state awards, 105 of them the title of Hero of Ukraine, unfortunately, 76 of them posthumously. — But they are our Heroes forever. Those who inspire us to continue the struggle, those who define the meaning of this struggle, our brothers in arms who are waiting for us and look at us from the sky. We have no right to betray them, must fight, must win. Sergeant Day for us, it is not just a professional holiday&#8230; rather, it is not even a holiday, especially at this time. This is a day when we can pay tribute to our fallen brothers and feel our identity and our unity in this battle.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/18/den-serzhanta-zsu-pro-vijskove-mystecztvo-vidmovu-vid-oficzerskyh-posad-ta-udostoyenyh-zvannya-geroya-ukrayiny/	2024-11-17T20:48:52-08:00
Noah's Ark for Kim: North Korea is likely to build its largest warship	Project details investigated specialists from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). As stated in the expert report, North Korea has built a new slipway 170 meters long and 30 meters wide at its shipyard in the city of Nampho. The direct construction of the facility started in May 2024. Such volumes of the construction site are a third larger than the dimensions of the recently launched Amnok and Nampo class corvettes for the DPRK military fleet, which were the largest military ships of the North Korea, built after the Najin-class frigates, delivered in the 1970s. Thanks to the appearance of such an object, the regime of -Rocketman Kim-, as the leader of the DPRK was nicknamed by the newly elected US President Donald Trump, will be able to build a particularly powerful, as according to its dimensions, a ship. However, experts do not yet have an understanding of what kind of combat vessel it might be. Available satellite images show that the North Korean regime is already building some kind of ship on this slipway. In particular, you can see something similar to sections of the hulls painted with a red oxide primer. You can also see two gantry cranes that can be used to move sections of the ship's hull along the slipway. But since the North Koreans have stretched a frame with a camouflage net over this slipway, it is impossible to see the construction of this ship in more detail on satellite images. Researchers from the IKK defense portal Defense Express (DE) singled out an interesting detail, which is that the shipyard in the North Korean city of Nampo essentially has a -dual purpose-: civilian vessels were also built there. However, it was at this shipyard that two missile corvettes under the Amnok project were also built, which are currently the most powerful warships of the DPRK Navy. that these ships have a displacement of up to 1.5 thousand tons and a hull length of 80 meters. And it is on this comparative basis that the two versions are further based on which task North Korea could build a huge, considering its scale, a slipway as long as 170 meters. The first version - the North Korean regime has the ambition to build a more powerful surface ship for its Navy, for example, a &#8220;missile frigate&#8221; class. The second version is that the DPRK wants to use this facility to build a new ballistic missile carrier submarine. On this background, ICC DE mentions the report that North Korea and Russia may work, including segment of technologies for the construction of nuclear submarines. Which, in turn, leads to the conclusion that in this story, Pyongyang's new project was not without Moscow's advice and help. While Nampo Ship yard can produce a vessel with a larger hull, which in mirrors the design of a modern warship, North Korea is unlikely to be able to single-handedly reproduce the relevant modern combat systems and capabilities. This is another proof of the presence of the -hand of Moscow-. kp/en/article/q/bb7704b49447dd80b52c60420f45e9dc.kcmsf->reported that during a September 2024 visit to a new naval base under construction, dictator Kim said , that the country's Navy -will soon receive large surface warships and submarines that cannot be anchored at existing warship mooring facilities. And the construction of a naval base for the operation of the latest large warships has become an urgent task.- One of the possible explanations for what kind of ship may be under construction is that a floating shock platform is being built with placing cruise missiles of a certain type on it. Also, in September 2023, Pyongyang test-launched long-range cruise missiles from an Amnok-class corvette. Thus, a larger platform will allow the transportation of more cruise missiles and will also potentially allow short-range ballistic missiles to be included in its arsenal. At the same time, experts note that although the North Korean fleet is formally large enough in terms of the number of vessels, it mainly consists of from small patrol and coastal ships, which have extremely limited combat capabilities. Thus, the hypothetical -frigate- (if it really is) will be a giant step forward for North Korea's military ambitions. A visual presentation of the North Korean missile project.

Human shield tactics in Kurshchyna: the enemy mirrors its own crimes	Thus, Russian and Belarusian propaganda resources coordinatedly disseminated false information, arguing that the Armed Forces in Kur Region allegedly use a live shield tactics. In fact, the tactic of a live shield is typical for the Russian army, which since 2014 has been repeatedly covered by civilians in occupied territories and prisoners of war. For example, in December 2023, the Ukrainian Prosecutor's Office opened criminal proceedings on the use of Ukrainian prisoners as a living shield in the Zaporozhye region. The Kremlin's propaganda resources are also spreading excerpts from an interview with a Ukrainian prisoner of war about the threats of -shooting in the back- that he heard from the commanders. Ukrainian prisoners are forced to fulfill the requirements of the invaders: confess to the crimes invented or committed by the Russians themselves, to speak under a record of frank lies, etc. The torture and murder of prisoners, other violations of the rules and customs of war is a common practice for Russians. Like the practice of thighs, invented by Stalin and revived in the Russian army. This function is currently performed by the Kadyrov special unit -Akhmat-. Back in March 2022, the SBU published intercepted negotiations by the Chechen language of Rosgvardia's fighter with his wife, where he confesses that his key task is to restrain the Russian military: -Our task is to drive back of those east soldiers who begin to run away from the blows of Ukrainian artillery.- Therefore, the current accusations of the Ukrainian military are another attempt by Russian propaganda to erase reality and justify their own crimes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/18/taktyka-zhyvogo-shhyta-na-kurshhyni-vorog-viddzerkalyuye-vlasni-zlochyny/	2024-11-17T20:03:48-08:00

We can see that quite young guys are really going into battle. And this youth gives them many chances to survive. Because, objectively, it is much more difficult to destroy a young enemy than to destroy some grandfather who will be half fatter and half slower,- Andrii Otchenash said. According to him, captured Russians of this age group explain that they went to fight because of money. Added to this are the consequences of propaganda, because Russians believe that they are defending their country on foreign land. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the -Svoboda- battalions of the 4th operational brigade of the National Guard -Rubizh- caused great losses to the occupiers who tried to break through our defenses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/17/plyus-minus-30-rokiv-rosiyany-kydayut-v-nastup-molodyh-bijcziv/	2024-11-17T10:57:09-08:00

The impact was so powerful that, in addition to the place of impact, it destroyed dozens of residential and commercial buildings on three nearby streets. Even in buildings several tens of meters away from the place where the ammunition was hit, the roofs were damaged and the panes in the windows were broken. The destruction of buildings near the impact site is catastrophic. In them, as well as in the house of a 90-year-old woman, not only the roofs were demolished and the windows and doors were knocked out along with the frames, but also the ceiling and walls were moved. Some of them are already unrecoverable. Despite Sunday being a day off, representatives of the Salvation Angels Charitable Foundation, which works with the support of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, arrived at the site of the explosion early in the morning. — Just as an -arrival-, we immediately arrive, help so that people can be repaired. We will find out about the need for help from the local administration, says Oleksandr, a representative of the foundation. Boards, chipboard, plastic film, construction foam, nails, screws are unloaded from the arriving trucks - everything necessary for quick installation and temporary repairs capable of protecting the buildings damaged by the explosion from the weather. Residents of destroyed houses are queuing for registration and receiving materials. Difficult days are ahead of them, because the received materials still require skilled workers - if almost anyone can cover shutters with a film, even temporary roofing requires a skilled worker. No less than the most damaged private houses, the enterprise located in the building of the former school suffered. — All 36 windows were broken, the roof was demolished, the doors in the offices were smashed. This building is over 90 years old. There used to be a stable here, after the war there was a school, says the director of the enterprise, Volodymyr. The destruction inside the building is no less than outside. Of particular concern is the equipment - will it be possible to restore it, will it work after such an impact and damage? The company's production was important for the Ukrainian energy system, which is under regular attacks from the Russian occupiers, so its shutdown would cause significant damage. The occupiers once again struck a blow at the civil infrastructure and housing development. Without any military purpose, it is purely designed to continue to terrorize the civilian population, both directly through the destruction of residential buildings and indirectly through the destruction of an enterprise that produced important products.

The church was not hit: about the Good News after the shelling of Sloviansk	Summary of the devastating consequences of the enemy strike reported by the head of the Slavyansk City Military Administration Vadim Lyakh. Chaplain Oleksandr told ArmyInform correspondents more about the destruction caused by Russian shelling. From 10 a.m. in the main hall of the -Good News- Church in Sloviansk, the service is already underway. The pastor talks about today's shelling and the Lord's will. Citing the -Epistle to the Romans- (8:28), the apostle Paul emphasizes several times that God supports those who love Him in everything, so according to His Will, -all things work together for good- for them. It is hard not to agree with this - during today's shelling, an enemy ammunition hit the road asphalt a few meters from the Church building, due to which there were no victims, wounded and injured. As a pastor at the service, Chaplain Oleksandr agrees to talk about the explosion and its consequences. — This morning, at seven o'clock in the morning, it -flew- near the road to Shevchenko. We thank God that at that time there were almost no people in the building and that the Lord saved those who were here, they were not hurt. Maybe they were scared, but everyone is alive, healthy, unharmed, he says. -Road to Shevchenko- is Mir Street, the asphalt pavement of which was hit by a Russian munition. A little further, it adjoins Taras Shevchenko Street, at the beginning of which there is a monument to the poet. The building of the -Good News- Church was less fortunate - the explosion occurred just a few meters away from it. Debris and the blast wave destroyed part of the roof and floors, broke the panes in the windows, mutilated the doors. The destruction inside the building is also significant. Oleksandr says with comfort that before the service, many believers who live nearby responded to the request to come early and clean up the debris, put things in order in front of the church and in its mutilated premises. — Many thanks to the members of the church, people who come here to praise God. We just gave a little cry that help was needed, and people came. At 7 o'clock in the morning it -flew in- - and by 9 o'clock in the morning we had already removed the garbage. We have restored order in the hall, closed some broken windows on the floors and are conducting services, he says. The chaplain says that the -Good News- Church is an important center for the local community, which helps and supports the needy and internally displaced persons during the difficult times of the war. — When there is an opportunity, we provide humanitarian aid. We are trying to somehow influence the community, to help, because times are difficult and it is necessary to stick together, help each other, says the chaplain. The Good News Church played an important role in the life of the community even before the large-scale invasion. As early as 2020, an elementary school started working in its premises, and a Sunday school operated. The main impact of the powerful blast wave after today's impact came precisely on the wing of the church building in which the children's classes are located. Alexander shows mutilated classrooms with books scattered about. — Today we have a Sunday school, we provided them with another room, but those rooms intended for children suffered the most, he says without hiding his sadness. The blackboards in the classrooms have the same inscription: -February 23. Cool job.- It has not been erased since 2022 as a reminder of when the day school was suspended until a solid peace. Since then, classes with children took place only on Sundays within the Sunday school. Now they too are under threat, because many children, frightened by the shelling, did not come today. This is how the Russian occupiers continue to destroy centers of peaceful life in Ukraine - hitting children and adults, school classrooms and the Church. However, the way the believers rallied to eliminate the consequences of the enemy shelling testifies to the strength of the Slavic community, and the expeditious filling of the hole from the explosion by local utility workers shows the responsibility and effectiveness of the local authorities. &nbsp; This is good news from Donetsk region.

Andriy Otchenash, a serviceman of the 4th operational brigade of the National Guard -Rubizh-, told about this on ArmyTV stream. According to Andrii, the fighters of his brigade repeatedly recorded cases when Russians cut their own lives short in order not to be captured. -They are horrified as much as possible, they are told that we cut off the genitals of captives, abuse them, do some absolutely terrible things in the style of terrorists. And they are so afraid of it that it is easier for them to shoot themselves or blow themselves up with a grenade. Because of this fear, the occupiers do not surrender as often as they shoot,- said Andriy Otchenash. According to him, when the Russians do get captured, they are very surprised that they are not abused, but the norms of international law are applied to them.

Huge losses of the Russians, IPSO and whether Pokrovsk will fall: an expert on possible scenarios of...	&#8220;The general characteristics of the situation at the front should be considered in the context of major geopolitics and the outcome of the presidential election in the United States. It really is. The front line of the Russian-Ukrainian war now has three large complex sections. The first is the Kurakhiv direction. Is a tactical withdrawal of the Defense Forces of Ukraine possible from there? It is possible, you should not be afraid of this, because battles can be lost, the main thing is to win the war. I really like historical parallels. Napoleon brilliantly won the Battle of Borodino, but lost the war. Ukrainians were heartbroken when our soldiers left Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, and especially Bakhmut. But the war is not lost on this. Indeed, this is a very difficult and difficult direction, but nevertheless such a scenario can be. Pokrovsk is next. There is a lot of speculation here that, they say, the city will fall, and then Donetsk will fall. This is not true. After all, Pokrovsk is a rather complex agglomeration, dense urban development and so on. Let's turn to illustrative examples. Avdiivka, in the active phase of a large-scale war, was stormed by the Rashists from October 7 last year, that is, they took it for more than six months. The enemy could not capture Bakhmut for more than 10 months. At the same time, they advanced beyond the city itself, there, the main hills, and could not. Reaching Pokrovsk does not mean taking it. The battle itself can be very long and not necessarily successful for the enemy. There will be huge enemy losses. Reconcentration of the enemy's forces and means in the Zaporozhye direction is logical. There is a very fundamental rule of war: the attacking side, if it slips at some point, must inevitably change the vector of the blow. Because if this does not happen, then a moment of balance occurs and the defending party gets a chance for counter-offensive actions. the Russians cannot allow this. According to their logic, the Zaporozhye direction is also a working one. Now speculation about the borders of Dnipropetrovsk region. It is very unfortunate that all this is happening in the information space. It is at least 30 km to the administrative borders, well, that's a lot. Indeed, according to the results of this year, the Russian Federation has the highest indicators of captured territory of Ukraine. But if these indicators are compared with the losses, then this is something incredible. According to the results of 2022, the losses of the enemy amount to 90 thousand, in 2023 more than 220 thousand, and this year I estimate them in the perspective of more than 350 thousand occupiers, because there are already 300 thousand, 21,940 people in October alone. This is simply a phenomenal figure. Therefore, it is still necessary to go 30 km to Dnipropetrovsk region. And this is a very serious distance, wet weather must also be taken into account, so you can only move on roads. The Ukrainian defenders are shelling large columns of firecrackers like nuts. The enemy from IPSO actively joined these speculations around the Dnipropetrovsk region, dispersing panic, betrayal and fakes. Why do we associate the situation on the Russian-Ukrainian war front with the victory of Donald Trump in the USA? Trump really declares a quick freezing of the conflict. But only after his inauguration on January 20 will any concrete conversation begin. A brief historical example: the Taliban and the Americans have been talking for more than a year, these are very low geopolitical stakes. And with such huge geopolitical stakes, which are now in the Russian-Ukrainian war, God forbid that in six months they would find some points of contact. Moreover, in these two months before Trump's inauguration, world geopolitics may turn around more than once. Let's not forget, Iran threatens to strike Israel already in the land part. This can really make a big difference. And if this happens conditionally, then the Russian Federation will experience a colossal reduction in the supply of explosives. The Iranians provide the Rashists with unmanned systems and ammunition. In my personal opinion, the front is moving towards a fiery equilibrium. Wet weather sets in, a cycle of rain and sleet. There will be, as in the previous two winters, endless counter-battery artillery duels. And here the Defense Forces of Ukraine are head and shoulders above the enemy. That is why he is raging now, he wants to capture as many kilometers of our land as possible.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/17/velychezni-vtraty-rosiyan-ipso-ta-chy-vpade-pokrovsk-ekspert-pro-mozhlyvi-sczenariyi-rozvytku-podij/	2024-11-16T21:04:06-08:00
Almost like SpaceX: Israel has developed a vertical takeoff barrage munition	In a brief description of the ammunition, the Israeli arms manufacturer positions ROC-X Weapon System as a hand-launched VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) electro-optical missile that provides troops with new opportunities for attack and maneuvering, ArmyInform reports. This innovative munition is designed to increase the accuracy and speed of hitting a wide range of targets, both stationary and moving, providing new opportunities for quick response on the battlefield. As indicate analysts of the defense publication Army Recognition, ROC-X stands out against the background of others of ammunition as the world's first VTOL missile that can be manually launched by a single soldier. The device is designed to solve tactical tasks, allowing the operator to independently control the flight, select targets and return it safely after completing the mission. The ROC-X design includes a one-meter-long fuselage and X-shaped wings with a span of 0.8 meters. An innovative system of engines with a channel screw without moving parts provides the product with silence, stealth and high maneuverability, which makes it practically invisible in combat conditions. Particular attention should be paid to the accuracy of the device: the probable deviation from the point of impact is only one meter, which makes the ROC-X an effective tool for destroying targets at a distance of up to 10 kilometers. Such accuracy is achieved thanks to advanced electro-optical and GPS guidance systems, which allows the operator to do without special launchers. One of the key advantages of the ROC-X is its ability for rapid manual launch, which allows it to respond instantly to changing combat conditions. This feature makes it a versatile tool for modern tactical applications where speed and flexibility play a crucial role. In combat conditions, the ROC-X demonstrates high maneuverability and rapid readiness for deployment, and also has features that reduce acoustic and thermal signatures, facilitating covert operations in enemy territory. The device weighs only 6.8 kg and is equipped with a warhead weighing 2 kg, with the possibility of using shock and non-contact detonators, which allows to effectively hit targets. ROC-X can stay in flight for up to 20 minutes, supporting both manual and automatic control modes, giving the operator the ability to adapt to changing combat conditions. Thus, this device is a versatile and highly effective tool that significantly improves the capabilities of ground troops in the conditions of modern combat conflict. The development of systems similar to the ROC-X by other defense companies is aimed at creating accurate and versatile munitions that can be controlled by individual soldiers. However, the ROC-X stands out for its true portability as it is fully manually operated, unlike other systems such as the US-based Switchblade 300 previously reported told our agency, or the Chinese CH-901, which require special launchers for use. This feature makes the ROC-X particularly suitable for dynamic environments, providing quick response and flexible operation in the field, giving soldiers greater autonomy compared to similar systems. It should be noted that in January 2023 the US Department of Defense concluded with the Israeli company Israel Aerospace Industries a contract for the development and delivery of a new portable barrage drone with electro-optical guidance. IAI, as a prime contractor, received a multimillion-dollar contract from the Office of Irregular Warfare Technical Support (IWTSD) of the US Department of Defense for the rapid development and delivery of POINT BLANK systems in the ROC-X version.

-They drove to -Otchenashi--: 2 thousand km along the front line to -Funtyk-. How the driver took th...	Artem, a senior soldier of the 21st separate special purpose battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, with the call sign -Pavlyk- at the front since March 2024. Since then, he has driven more than two thousand kilometers on the front lines in a Hummer with the call sign -Funtik- and -rolled- more than 60 thousand km in pickup trucks. And there was a rapid mission on an armored Ford and experience on a Turkish Kirpi. The driver Artyom -Pavlyk- told ArmyInform correspondents about why being a driver on the front line is important and honorable, but dangerous, how fear helps to fulfill the mission and about the heroic rescue of Ukrainian drones from a semicircle. Artem has been in the Armed Forces for over 20 months. He went to serve without hesitation as soon as the summons came. But he did not get to the front right away, at first he guarded the administration of the Pechersk District of Kyiv. However, he then transferred to a combat brigade and has been on the front line for more than half a year since then. In civilian life, -Pavlyk- worked as a tractor driver, and not so long ago he served his term as a driver. The acquired experience came in handy during the service - Artem was appointed to the position of a driver. Since then, -Pavlik- had to perform numerous logistical and rescue missions, delivering fighters and cargo for them to the front line and taking the wounded from there. - Driving in, bringing in, taking out - all this is my work, my tasks. I fly -to the point-, drop off or pick up guys, deliver them water, food, etc., he says. It was possible to drive -Pavlik- on different vehicles, but most of all - on a pickup truck and a Hummer. The pickup truck, he says, is faster and has higher cross-country ability, but it has virtually no protection. - You can drive at a speed of 100-120 kilometers per hour, even on mud, but there is no protection - except that you can install a REBchik, - says Artem. On the other hand, the Hummer is slower, its cross-country ability is worse. The driver explains that this armored personnel carrier is more suitable for the desert plains than for the Donbas mud, where the ground is viscous and sticky, like plasticine. But instead, this armor has powerful protection. — -Hummer- drives slower - 80-90 km/h, and -guzzles- a lot - 35 liters per 100 kilometers, and the passability is worse. And here the ground is like plasticine - such that the car simply floats, not on the ground, but floats on it. But -Funtyk- is strong, withstands many -arrivals-, protects against debris and even a direct hit, it has a good armored capsule, - explains Artem. — I had to relearn a little, because the car is like a car, but the dimensions are wider. And it is very heavy - five tons, says -Pavlyk- about -Funtyk-. And it also shows the padlock on the door. The Hummer does not have a standard factory lock, so it is impossible to lock it. The ignition key is also unnecessary - the car starts with half a turn of the toggle switch. -There were cases when Hammers were stolen, so we came up with a way out - to lock the door with a padlock,- explains Artem. An unusual device on the door of an American armored personnel carrier makes it look like the entrance to a basement converted into a bunker - armored doors were installed, and a lock was attached to them forgot to mount. As evidence -Pavlyk- shows the impact sites of debris from the explosions of grenades, mines and the explosive charge of the FPV drone. Deep scars in the armored doors and the body of the -Hummer- testify to the force of the explosions, and the laminated glass, apparently, withstood a direct hit from an automatic grenade launcher. — They said that -Funtyk- also traveled to Bakhmut. And the FPV shot flew behind me under the frame and exploded there. But the car survived, I hit the gas and drove away with two flat tires, Artem says. At that time, it was necessary to drive on a -docket- - pressed rubber inside the wheels, which allows you to move even after the road has -eaten- the rubber of the tires. The driver explains that under fire the main thing is not to get confused, not to reduce speed and to maneuver sharply. Then the chances that they will be able to hit the car with precision drop sharply. To do this, you need to be a true specialist in your field, a skilled driver. And yet&#8230; — Fear helps. Because when there is fear, the reaction is sharper - you understand everything faster, assess the situation, maneuver. In a calm environment, you drive relaxed. And there you go - -whoosh-whoosh-whoosh!- - run! Reaction, maneuvers, more gas - you know, you feel what you need to do, how to leave - explains the driver. You also need to be very fast and not linger anywhere, not stop longer than a couple of minutes, and even better - a few tens of seconds. That's why he always drives the guys, especially those who come out of positions, because when they load into the car for the trip, they often calm down and relax too much. — He who is not afraid will drive slowly, relaxed. And everything will catch up with him, motherfucker. Need more reaction to everything. Guys need to be coached to load and unload faster, because they lose their fear when they get out of position. And you need to be afraid until you leave, says -Pavlyk-. However, fear and adrenaline alone will not get you far - you must always carefully prepare for each mission and never violate the basic rules - drive only at night or at dusk, in no case turn on the headlights, carefully study the driving route. — I ride in a -night lamp- so as not to reveal myself. I drive very fast, at the maximum possible speed on this road. Also, before leaving, I carefully study the map in order to remember the route, I count the number of turns, says Artem. He does not have a navigator, so he carefully studies the entire route before leaving on a map, keeps it in his memory and orients himself to the local area at breakneck speed. Accidentally, due to oversight, jumping into a -turn that is not there- is deadly, because there may not be time to turn around and take the correct route. — In half an hour you have to -get stuck in.- And it is better to drive, unload and load in 20-25 minutes, and return, Artem explains. -Pavlyk- recalls that during his missions he had to take out the bodies of three dead and more than 30 wounded fighters. The mission was the most difficult, when one dead and three wounded had to be taken out at the same time, but the driver coped with it as well. — I had to drive by three -300s- and one -200- on a road where I had never driven. I looked at the map for almost two hours thinking about how to do all this, how to bypass the dangerous section. And, in the end, everything worked out - drove in, picked up, took out, - recalls the fighter. He recalls that he had to drive along a broken country road, on one of the sections of which a mortar often hit. However, in the end, skill, experience and thorough training helped accomplish the mission. Artem says that a car on the front line is the main target for all the enemy's weapons, because everyone is interested in aiming at a car. But it is not possible without it, because the infantrymen -at ground zero- are critically dependent on -last kilometer- logistics. — The car that goes! Everyone is interested in knocking her down, destroying her, because she is carrying someone or something - fighters, supplies. That is, the idea that a driver is such a safe profession in the army is false - on the -front- we are the first target, he explains. However, -Pavlyk- only partially agrees with the definition of himself as a -special purpose- driver. He emphasizes that not all of us are made for war, but someone has to do this hard work - and he does it. — It is necessary to protect, because who else will protect? And if you are smart, fast, and know how to do something, then you will simply be able to do it well, says Artem. Artem can have from one to 3-4 departures per night. Sometimes you have to wait for hours for a mission, being in full readiness to start the same second the order is received. Even after completing the mission, the driver says, he can wait for several hours until the fighters delivered by him reach their positions and report their arrival. - They can go for 3 or 4 hours - during this time I don't sleep because I'm worried about them. I understand that nothing depends on my waiting, but I'm still waiting for a message, he says. This attitude of Artyom was noticed by the fighters themselves, among whom -Pavlyk- gained extreme respect, because they know that he will never leave them to their own devices and will do everything possible to help. Artyom recalls one of his many missions, during which he had to take out drones from a semicircle in an unfamiliar car - an armored Ford. The enemy had already appeared behind their positions, so if they were not taken out before morning, they would inevitably have to engage in a direct shooting battle. The driver of the Ford then refused to go, and Pavlyk and the commander drove in an unfamiliar car, flew to the position of the drones and pulled the boys out. All this took about 40 minutes. — For forty minutes there and back, loaded in about a minute. The guys were very pleased, everyone thanked us for coming. They were already waiting for the car to arrive, they had already packed their things, and I turned around. They jumped in - and we chased them, - says Artem. Later, the drone operators told how relieved they felt not even when they broke out of the semi-encirclement, but also when they received a message that Pavlyk was coming after them: -If Pavlyk is coming after us, then we will leave!- Photo by Ruslan Tarasov	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/17/pognaly-na-otchenashi-2-tysyachi-km-po-peredovij-na-funtyku-yak-vodij-vyvozyv-dronariv-z-otochennya/	2024-11-16T20:29:14-08:00

It was the Russians who faked the video, because the Institute for the Study of War has never released such information. Such statistics were not disseminated by Ukrainian officials and the media either. Fakeness is also indicated by the fact that Russians have traditionally made a lot of grammatical mistakes. In particular, -territorial recruitment and social support centers- were translated into the video as TRSSCs. Whereas in English it is correct TCR and SS (Territorial Centers of Recruitment and Social Support). In addition, they used a fake final frame of the Institute for the Study of War. At the end of each entry, the Institute calls for a donation to their organization (-Donate today-), while the propagandists only have a list of social networks instead.

Mariupol residents, who had to leave the city due to the Russian invasion, were blamed for this. As if because of the closed apartments, it is impossible to replace the heating system. the morgue found a solution - to break the locks and declare the apartments -unoccupied-. That is, just to steal people's property. It should be noted that the occupiers are massively trying to -nationalize- housing, referring to the lack of owners. Lists of such apartments are published regularly. Within 30 days, the owners must apply to the pseudo-administration of the district and provide proof of ownership of the property.

Ministry of Defense: Every defender of Ukraine will receive improved nutrition in medical institutio...	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informs about this. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has initiated important changes in the system of providing servicemen during treatment and rehabilitation. Thanks to the Resolution adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers, the mechanism of providing improved food to servicemen in health care facilities of all forms of ownership has been improved. The resolution allows to provide our defenders with food according to the standards of military medical institutions of NATO countries even in civilian hospitals. -Every defender who risks their lives for our freedom deserves the best conditions for recovery. Not only do we provide our troops with the care they need, but we also work to ensure that each one of them feels supported and respected. This initiative is our response to their dedication and courage,- said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General Serhiy Melnyk. According to the new regulations, food in civilian hospitals for servicemen will be served according to a specially designed diet, which, in particular, determines the list of products, their quantity and weight required for one serviceman per day, taking into account the specific needs of the body during recovery. -The new standards ensure the complete nutrition needed for a quick recovery. For example, they take into account the increased need for protein, vitamins and calories needed to heal injuries or illnesses. The cost of such food is calculated on the basis of a special product catalog approved by the Ministry of Defense. This Catalog contains current prices for products, and they are taken into account when determining the cost of food for one bed-day in medical facilities,- explains Serhiy Melnyk. According to him, this ensures that each soldier will receive the proper ration for a quick recovery. The resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers also provides for a clear mechanism for compensating costs for civilian medical institutions, which will allow maintaining high standards of service. The new financing mechanism provides for the conclusion of a standard contract that will ensure transparent compensation for the costs of improved nutrition. Thus, civilian medical facilities will receive adequate funding, and military personnel will receive quality treatment and rehabilitation. We remind you that recently in the structure of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine the department for intellectual property issues was launched and the technology of detection of enemy FPV drones -Vitryak-M- was patented.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/kozhen-zahysnyk-ukrayiny-otrymaye-pokrashhene-harchuvannya-u-medzakladah-nezalezhno-vid-formy-vlasnosti/	2024-11-16T08:11:42-08:00

However, many are stopped by the price of the issue. There are enough cases when the replacement of numbers is preceded by a mandatory procedure for registration of inheritance in the event of the death of the testator.

The Ministry of Defense explained the tasks of the new intellectual property department	About this told Ilya Kostin, Head of the Intellectual Property Department of the Main Department of Military Justice of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. According to him, this is the first time that the state, represented by the Ministry of Defense, has received the rights to a technological product. -This has never been done before in the Ministry - when the manufacturer, a specialized military unit (Center for Scaling of Technological solutions) invented this product. This technological solution is of very high quality. And this was confirmed by state registration and a patent for a useful model was issued. This happened only in the MOU system. I repeat: this has never happened before. Thus, the state, represented by the MoU, has obtained the rights to this product and will now give permission to manufacturers to scale this product. But the fact that state money was invested — it remained with the state,- said Ilya Kostin. Vitryak-M is a detector that scans different ranges of FPV drones, automatically turning on EW systems. -This allows the fighter to know that there is an FPV drone nearby and to turn on the EW only when it is needed, instead of creating a dome curtain that prevents not only the enemy from working, but also us.- - explained the head of the intellectual property department.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/u-minoborony-poyasnyly-zavdannya-novogo-viddilu-z-pytan-intelektualnoyi-vlasnosti/	2024-11-16T03:52:53-08:00

For our partners, this system is a signal that Ukraine is ready for responsible cooperation. Their technologies are protected here, and the support of the defense sector gives them guarantees of development and security. An example of this approach is the patent on Vitryak-M FPV drone detector developed by our Technology Scaling Center.

However, even such a low level of requirements became an obstacle, because most Russian fighters do not have even the minimum skills for training. As a result, the Russians extended the program for three months due to the critical small number of participants. We remind you that in the temporarily occupied Mariupol records a large amount of damaged Russian military equipment that enters the territory of the Illich plant for repairs.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/okupanty-ne-zmogly-znajty-dostatnoyi-kilkosti-osvichenyh-veteraniv-aby-zapolonyty-nymy-roa/	2024-11-16T01:55:45-08:00

In occupied Mariupol, there is a lot of damaged equipment, the Russians are collecting it for repair	This was told by the adviser to the mayor of Mariupol Petro Andryushchenko in airSuspilnogo -On the territory of this combine there is one of the largest repair bases that exists in the territory of the Azov region (these are the Mariupol-Berdyan and Novoazov regions agglomerations)&#8230; Therefore, they no longer bring it (the equipment &#8211; ed.) as before to Novoazovsk or the territory of the Rostov region, but began to repair it directly on territory of Mariupol. And that's why we see what this number is: several units drop by every day. Both tracked and wheeled vehicles,- Petro Andryushchenko said. At the same time, according to him, there is no increase in the number of Russian troops in the temporarily occupied Mariupol, but on the contrary - their decrease. -The Russians currently do not have enough new contract workers to fill all camps (from Mariupol to Berdyansk) by 100%. I am referring to those camps that serve to train units that leave for replenishment, rotations, etc. Currently, these camps are filled with new contract workers by about 70%, and by 30% — those who are assigned to rotation from the front line. This is the first time, because before that the camps were filled to 100%, and those allocated for rotation were located either in the north of the Mariupol district or on the territory of the Ilyich plant. Now the trend is different, and this means that the Russians do not have time to replenish their manpower in accordance with the losses they are suffering,- Petro Andryushchenko summarized. As ArmyInform wrote, in June 2024 the first enemy tanker entered the port of Mariupol since the Russian occupation, probably to provide fuel for military equipment and equipment on the front line.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/v-okupovanomu-mariupoli-bagato-pidbytoyi-tehniky-rosiyany-styaguyut-yiyi-na-remont/	2024-11-16T00:31:15-08:00

The occupiers began to bring military equipment to the Kurakhiv direction by an unusual route	Such observations were shared by the adviser to the mayor of Mariupol Petro Andryushchenko in Efiri Public on Saturday, November 16. -We haven't seen such activity for a long time, at least a year and a half. This activity is quite unusual and sometimes looks chaotic. What is the difference from what was before? We see that all kinds of military equipment (tanks, armored personnel carriers, armored personnel carriers) are being pulled. All of them come from the direction of Berdyansk or Pologiv (from the Zaporizhzhia region). And then, through Mariupol, it moves north, towards Volnovakha,- said Petro Andryushchenko. According to him, military equipment continues to take part in the Kurakhiv offensive of the Russians, but it is unusual that it is coming from the Zaporizhzhia region. Previously, 90 percent of the equipment moved from the territory of the Russian Federation and further through either Mariupol or Granitne, but definitely not from the Zaporizhzhia direction. reinforcements where their greatest point of effort is currently,- added Petro Andryushchenko. He emphasized that a large number of trucks of all kinds, dumping of ammunition were also recorded. -And this is also unusual. Because they dismantle the operational-tactical warehouses located on the territory of the Mariupol, Berdyansky, Rozivsky districts. That is, what they did as reserves when they were preparing for the offensive in the Zaporozhye direction — all this is removed, reformatted and thrown in the direction of Volnovakha and Kurakhovo,- says the adviser to the mayor of Mariupol.

Driver drill: the GUR told how Russia solves the problem with the shortage of junior officers	This was reported to the GUR of the MOU. On the basis of civilian higher educational institutions, the aggressor state creates military training centers where basic training of platoon commanders, artillery batteries and deputy company commanders is to be conducted. A junior officer of the enemy army primarily performs the function of an infantry chaser for an assault directly on the battlefield, which explains the high level of casualties and, as a result, the acute shortage of lieutenants in Russia. The Kremlin began to establish a mechanism for training and uninterrupted supply of junior officers for the war against Ukraine in the first year of the full-scale invasion. According to the enemy's plans, by the end of 2024, 33 new military training centers were to be launched in Russia in addition to almost a hundred existing ones. Another activation of leaders in Moscow to drill even more fresh lieutenants shows that the personnel crisis of the command staff of the Russian occupation army is deepening.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/mushtra-pogonychiv-u-gur-rozpovily-yak-rosiya-vyrishuye-problemu-iz-deficzytom-molodshyh-oficzeriv/	2024-11-15T23:13:24-08:00

Transformers go into battle: the British army was offered a new version of a light protected patrol ...	How howled not without advertising bragging representatives of the manufacturing company in a release on their official portal, thanks to the modular design Foxhound is the best vehicle for light infantry and special operations forces during combat missions. The vehicle provides a high level of field-proven protection, reliability and availability, as well as the ability to adapt, ArmiyaInform reports. This project is under development. And as informed by the company General Dynamics Land Systems - Great Britain, which has been operating since 2012, its enterprises previously supplied the British Army with 400 basic Foxhound models (also known under the global brand of General Dynamics Land Systems - -Ocelot-). About these armored vehicles, reporters of our editorial office mentioned in one from defense industry reviews. The Foxhound GMRV is designed to operate in the most challenging environments, demonstrating a combination of protection, mobility and flexibility. Experts of the defense publication Army Recognition, who got acquainted with the new armored vehicle at the Defense Vehicle Dynamics (DVD) arms exhibition held in the British Millbrook in September of this year, announced that its modular design offers a significant advantage in allowing the vehicle to adapt to different mission requirements. The platform can be configured for multiple roles with the help of a newly developed mission module, which provides, according to the machine's developers, -unparalleled operational efficiency-. The GMRV variant includes a highly secure crew compartment with advanced self-defense weapons that can be controlled directly from the inside, ensuring optimal crew safety. In addition, the vehicle's design has been shaped to accommodate a NATO-standard pallet in the rear, offering endless transformative possibilities for integrating complex mission systems. They can include weapons for short-range air defense (SHORAD) and other mission-critical technologies that go beyond the traditional patrol car. By improving protection and firepower while retaining the core capabilities of the original Foxhound, the GMRV is set to be a game changer for military operations. General Dynamics UK is keen to use this new option for both the British Army and international allies, focusing on export opportunities for partners around the world. The vehicle is entirely designed, engineered and manufactured in the United Kingdom, ensuring quality control and compliance with the national defense industrial strategy. The original Foxhound LPPV has long been renowned for its protection and mobility in high-risk environments. This new variant of the GMRV carries on this legacy, but with significant improvements in operational flexibility and modular integration. The ability to seamlessly switch between roles — from patrol to air defense — without the need for a completely different vehicle underscores its value on the modern battlefield. As military forces around the world face increasingly complex operational landscapes, the Foxhound GMRV is poised to offer a solution that can evolve with these changing requirements. With design and manufacturing firmly rooted in the UK, the car is also a testament to its defense capability and commitment to innovation. A total of 52 new GMRV vehicles will be delivered to UK Army units by March 2025, according to a statement from General Dynamics Land Systems - UK.

Battles in the Kursk region: how the artillerymen of the 82nd brigade of the DSHV organized the Kurs...	A key role in the destruction of the forces and means of the Russian Federation in Kurshchyna is played by the artillery of the ZSU, which works almost 24/7. ArmyInform visited units of the 82nd separate amphibious assault Bukovynia brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which are carrying out combat missions in Kurshchyna. The commander of the artillery division, Major Ivan Bakrev, told our correspondents about the first days of the Kursk operation, how artillery calculations manage to destroy military targets of the Russian Federation, what artillery systems are used by our defenders and what is the most difficult part of the artillerymen's work: -In July, we received a combat mission from the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the shortest possible time, planning was carried out, a plan was developed. After that, it was necessary to move the artillery from the concentration area to the future area of ​​combat missions as soon as possible. Artillery was transferred covertly so that the enemy would not find out. One or two cannons at night, so that they did not notice that we were gathering forces here. Before the beginning of the Kursk offensive operation, with the help of aerial reconnaissance, we identified the front edge of the enemy, planned the objects of attack and their detailed fire damage. Everything has been thought through to the smallest detail. The sector of fire of my artillery division was determined. And as further developments showed, the enemy was not ready for this. In the first hours of the offensive of units of our brigade, the enemy was hit by fire. Moreover, it is quite effective, because the enemy retreated, at some points simply ran. Our gunners hit enemy platoon and company strongholds and even individual combat positions very quickly and accurately. The offensive developed quite dynamically. Next, they hit manpower, military equipment, and places of concentration of enemy personnel. The Russians were not given a single chance. Even later, after we started advancing in depth, the enemy did not know where we were exactly. This helped us a lot. Then the enemy began to transfer his reserves. And we, accordingly, destroyed them. They worked in convoys of motor vehicles, where they mainly transported personnel and mortar weapons, hit armored combat vehicles. Our drones very often detected the enemy's field artillery depots. the Russians just accumulated a certain number of shells, and we immediately destroyed them. On the armament of my artillery division is towed artillery. These are Soviet-style D-30 guns (caliber 122 mm) and British M119 howitzers are NATO-style 105 mm. M119 shows good combat capabilities: a very mobile gun, takes up little space, so it is convenient for camouflage and movement. Its most important feature is that it accurately hits the targets. The range of combat use on standard ammunition is 11.7 thousand. m. Also, projectiles can reach the cannon up to 20 km. But the 105-caliber ammunition itself would like better. Unfortunately, it gives few fragments and an impressive effect on the enemy. On the other hand, if working for counter-battery, rockets are a pretty good option. After all, the M119s are located at a short distance from the front edge and, accordingly, they can be used normally at a long range, in the depth of the enemy's battle formations. D-30 cannons are mainly used to destroy the enemy's manpower and firepower located in trenches, trenches, communication passages and strongholds, as well as outside shelters. We also work with them on the accumulation of enemy troops. The effective firing range of these guns is up to 15 km. Here, in Kurshchyna, in the modern conditions of the combat situation, we do not work in the classic version in the composition of platoons and batteries. A reconnaissance fire complex (RVK) is used to destroy the enemy's manpower and equipment. It consists of means of detecting the enemy (quadrocopters, Mavics, outlays, etc. - ed.), artillery means of destruction, and the third element is the management of units, which is carried out during the execution of combat missions. Ideally, this is how it works: there are calculations of UAV operators who conduct reconnaissance of enemy targets and provide through communications means of targeting for use in combat calculations of guns. A fire damage decision is made and boom, shells fly where they need to go. An interesting moment with the movement of the RVC deep into the territory of the Russian Federation. At first, the gunners worked from the border area on targets, then some RVCs remained in their places to cover the units of the airborne assault battalions, and other fire groups have already begun to move deep into the Kursk region. They quickly moved, took up firing positions, disguised themselves and inflicted fire damage. Then, in a chess order, other artillery units that were behind were gradually moved. In this way, it was possible to destroy the enemy quickly, without revealing one's location. At the beginning of the operation, the Starlink system helped us a lot in combat work. This is for general situational awareness, i.e. where the enemy is and transmitting the coordinates of targets to hit them. But Starlink no longer operated on the territory of the Russian Federation. Therefore, there were difficulties with communication, they worked at radio stations. This problem had to be solved as soon as possible. After all, the situation in Kurshchyna was developing quickly and it was necessary to establish cooperation in the battle with other units of the brigade and our neighbors. A system of military communications repeaters of domestic production was deployed. These repeaters then performed quite well in data transmission and situational awareness on the ground. Therefore, already in the process of such intensive hostilities, we solved the issue of communication. There were no problems with the supply of ammunition at all. Art shells were always delivered in plenty. The results of combat work eloquently testify to this. When the enemy performs his actions effectively, I already understand accordingly how I need to improve to reduce his effectiveness. This applies to countering FPV drones, various types of drones, counter-battery. Another important question. Use of EW means against enemy drones. Our priority targets are the enemy's reserves, air defense systems and ROPs, manpower concentrations, combat vehicles used to transport personnel and weapons to the front line. The exact number of enemy vehicles and personnel affected is difficult to determine. Fighting continues. From what is confirmed: our fire groups destroyed five artillery pieces, 4 mortars. This is within the limits of counter-battery only. In terms of manpower and armored vehicles, I can't tell you until the end, because the number of losses of the Rashits is simply huge. We try to destroy the enemy even on the approach to the front edge. We determine in what ways they throw up personnel, plan -meeting points-. The cannons are already aimed at us. If one gun does not have time to work, another joins in the work. The work is very hard, but it is worth it. The other day we discovered about seven or eight enemy armored vehicles. Some cars were driving in a chaotic manner, it was clear that they were lost, while others were moving purposefully. So, in just one day, the consumption of shells on these targets amounted to 270 shells. I think the consumption of ammunition in other artillery units was no less. They worked very powerfully, destroyed everything that moved in our direction. Before the beginning of the Kursk operation, it so happened that in my division, the full-time personnel complement was slightly more than 50%. Completed combat calculations actually from wheels. But the guys who were already here in the art division and those who came to us were very motivated, they all wanted to beat the occupiers on their territory, in a word, they were charged for success. Therefore, those who joined us quickly learned to act as part of calculations, mastered the intricacies of artillery in order to effectively strike the enemy in battle. There is no need to motivate the boys in any way, everyone is conscious and responsible, and most importantly, they are professionals. Personnel training is conducted constantly in concentration areas. If the situation permits, when one gun remains unengaged, the training is conducted by the battery sergeants-majors. We analyze the experience of combat operations, enemy tactics, analyze our shortcomings in combat work. I will give you an example. There are experienced gun commanders in the division who came from other artillery units. And they pleasantly surprised me with their work, their attitude to their duties. So, we give them targets, and they completely perform accurate calculations of data to shoot, adjust fire and, as a result, destroy the enemy and his important objects. Worked with one gun commander who had recently arrived. His guys know everything and are able to do all the necessary measures at firing positions. The main thing: they work exactly according to their goals. Where there is a responsible commander, there is discipline and efficiency. This is very gratifying. Once, enemy FPV drones wanted to hit the cannon of this commander three times. Thanks to the concerted actions of his team, the cannon was kept in operational condition and the soldiers themselves survived. The howitzer was well camouflaged. Countering enemy drones in general is key right now. Well done guys! The hardest part, unfortunately, was the loss of our personnel. The Kursk operation is very hard daily combat work. It's not easy here. At the beginning, of course, there were constant worries and sleepless nights. It was necessary to effectively establish a system of combat control and communication deployment. It was very difficult for the personnel at the firing positions in the Kursk region. There, gunners work at their maximum. Plus, the correct choice of fire positions, adjustment of moments for logistical support. There was a lot of useful information for us. Taking into account the experience of combat operations, we -entrusted- some points in preparation, in the general conduct of combat operations, as well as in the construction of battle orders: what to include in this battle order, what to add, and what, for example, we do not need and the like.

Loss of a combatant's ID card: how to restore it	ArmiyaInform tells how to restore the document. Currently, there are several options for obtaining a new ID. If we are talking about an active serviceman, then a report to the commander of the military unit is required. If you are released from military service, you should contact the TCC and SP in which you are registered. You can also contact the Ministry of Veterans, if you received the status of UBD through the interdepartmental commission created under this ministry. Certain documents must also be attached to the report or application. The type of report, as well as which documents need to be attached to it, depends on the circumstances. In such a case, the following documents should be attached to the report: This happens periodically, taking into account the realities of military life. So, if the certificate has become unusable, then the following documents are attached to the report: This also happens from time to time, because no one and nothing is safe from shelling. So, if the certificate was destroyed, first of all, an official investigation should be conducted in the area. And on its basis, recovery will be carried out. You will only need to submit two 3 x 4 cm color photo cards on matte paper. Samples of all three types of reports can be found here. Also, ArmyInform has already written about how to UBD status, at what benefits can a combatant expect and how to use these preferences.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/vtrata-posvidchennya-uchasnyka-bojovyh-dij-yak-vidnovyty/	2024-11-15T20:28:12-08:00
propaganda spreads a fake video calling for a fight against the DPRK military	This animated video is about Ukraine's victory over the Mongol-Tatars. And the emphasis is on the phrase -They were able to then! We can do it now!-. However, this is a fake, reports by Gwara Media. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine did not make any videos with appeals to fight against the North Korean military. The characters in the video are stock artwork that anyone can download to use in their animations. Moreover, such animated characters had already been used by propagandists earlier in a video that was distributed in the Russian segment of the Internet at the end of January 2024. At that time, Ukrainian farmers were offered to -send their roosters to the front- to make them combat fighters. Cartoon animation is voiced by a female voice recorded with the help of Google Translate. The fake number is also indicated by the incorrect number of the Ministry of Defense hotline. With such videos, the enemy tries to ridicule Ukrainians and discredit the Defense Forces of Ukraine. And also to sow fear about the possible participation of Korean military personnel in the war.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/rospropaganda-rozganyaye-fejkove-video-iz-zaklykamy-shhodo-borotby-z-vijskovymy-kndr/	2024-11-15T20:11:07-08:00

The Ministry of Defense explained whether a driver's license can be revoked for failure to appear on...	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. In practice, a driver's license cannot be revoked due to such non-appearance. However, the law provides for the following: Temporary restriction of the right to drive can be applied to citizens who evade military duty only by a court decision. For this: The procedure for filing a lawsuit must include a detailed description of the requirements that must be met and documentary evidence of the citizen's evasion of duties. After considering the lawsuit, the court makes a decision on the temporary restriction of the right to drive transport only on condition of confirmation of the fact of evasion and non-fulfillment of military duty by a citizen. Therefore, the decision on the temporary restriction of driver's license is made only after the case is considered in court and upon confirmation of the violation of the requirements for the performance of military duty. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/u-minoborony-poyasnyly-chy-mozhut-pozbavyty-vodijskyh-prav-za-neyavku-za-povistkoyu/	2024-11-15T05:18:44-08:00

And the armored crew cabin is additional protection for the personnel. DITA has a fairly high rate of fire — 5 rounds per minute. High cross-country ability makes it possible to quickly change position after completing a fire mission and to have maneuverability in difficult terrain conditions. Artillery units of the National Guard perform tasks on the battlefield quite effectively. The appearance of modern artillery installations such as -Bohdan- and DITA significantly increases the firepower of our forces and the effectiveness of defeating the enemy. We remind you that the Ministry of Defense has codified and put into operation in the units of the Defense Forces, the all-wheel-drive armored car with increased cross-country ability -Zubr-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/155-mm-sau-dita-posylyat-pidrozdily-syl-oborony/	2024-11-15T04:32:15-08:00

It turned out to be a canned mole: the detained commander of one of the units of the SSO	This is stated in message of the SBU. The attacker turned out to be a lieutenant colonel, commander of one of the units of the Special Operations Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who was recruited by the occupiers even before the start of a large-scale war. In the spring of 2024, it was remotely -activated- by a personnel employee of the Russian game and defined the task: to transfer the plans of combat operations of the Defense Forces behind enemy lines to the Russians. The aggressor was most interested in intelligence about sabotage and reconnaissance raids by Ukrainian special forces behind the front line in the Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Crimean directions. To carry out the enemy's task, the -mole- used his official position, thanks to which he received information about the planned routes of movement of the soldiers of the Defense Forces, their weapons and -targets-. The occupiers planned to use this information to eliminate Ukrainian special forces on the front line or outside its borders - in the temporarily captured part of the territory in the south of Ukraine. Also, the agent -leaked- data on other units of the Defense Forces to his Russian curator. As a result of the special operation, the military counter-intelligence of the SBU gradually documented the traitor's crimes and arrested him. At the same time, comprehensive measures were taken to secure the locations of the Defense Forces. According to the investigation, the person involved was recruited by the military intelligence of the Russian Federation through his acquaintances in Russia, with whom he maintained contact. During the searches, conspiratorial means of communication, computer equipment, a mobile phone and data storage devices were seized from the detainee. The investigators of the Security Service informed him of the suspicion under part 2 of Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The perpetrator is in custody. He faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/vyyavyvsya-rozkonservovanym-krotom-zatrymanyj-komandyr-odnogo-z-pidrozdiliv-sso/	2024-11-15T00:36:15-08:00

This is always difficult, but it is achieved through negotiations and tactics on the battlefield, directly taking control of this or that representative who is in the form of a -pixel- but unknown to you, he said. The military man emphasized that the insidious tactic of dressing up in the enemy's military uniform is not new for the Russian military. — This tactic for the enemy is not new. It is used by them from other wars in which the Russian Federation took part, the officer said. The commander of the drones explained the main goal of the invaders. - In the last year, we can watch quite richly when the enemy wears a -pixel- and tries to infiltrate into our rear communications in order to sow chaos in the rear and introduce the maximum imbalance as possible, - said Yuriy Fedorenko. However, occupiers who are -red- in the -pixel- are detected quite effectively. - We know the [enemy's] tactics, so such cases are becoming fewer and fewer every day. Systematic work in order to distinguish between -own and foreign- is carried out and sufficiently well implemented in the Defense Forces. It will be different in each aspect, for the sake of truth, but the vast majority of commanders clearly understand and are aware of how it should be done and how to teach the personnel to distinguish between -own and foreign-, - emphasized the commander of -Achilles-.

This was told by the commander of the Achilles unmanned aerial systems battalion on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- Captain Yury Fedorenko of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the Kosh chieftain Ivan Sirk. — The defense forces, in a united and coordinated work, manage to significantly destroy the enemy's shock-assault potential. In one of the landings, its length is up to 200 meters, 139 occupants were killed during a certain period of time, he said. The military emphasized that such losses of the occupiers are completely disproportionate to the minor tactical successes they manage to achieve. — Now the plantings are very clearly visible, because the leaves have fallen. Imagine what the enemy is suffering while trying to achieve tactical results and tactical successes on the battlefield. The losses are disproportionate to the results the enemy got, the officer emphasized. It should be noted that in the calculation carried out, it is only about the bodies of those dead enemy soldiers that the occupiers did not manage to evacuate. The number of wounded is also not taken into account. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that under the cover of thick fog, the Russians managed to penetrate to the outskirts of Kupyansk, but all armored vehicles and infantry the enemy in the city was destroyed by the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/skilky-rosiyan-gyne-v-lisoposadczi-kilkist-vorozhyh-trupiv-na-200-metriv-porahuvaly-u-sylah-oborony/	2024-11-14T23:52:49-08:00
The Navy of the Ukrainian Armed Forces told how the Russians collect resources for their defense in ...	This was told by the spokesman of the Armed Forces Navy, captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk on the air -Public Radio-. Dmytro Pletenchuk noted that in connection with this, the Russians are even diverting resources from other directions, trying to protect their strategic infrastructure in Crimea. -They constantly, especially before the period of storms, maximize all means. These are hydrotechnical structures, these are pontoons, these are various extensions. Last year, for example, 10 to 14 ships and boats were guarding the bridge at the same time. Now there are zero of them. They translate that into the aerial component,- he said. According to him, for defense against unmanned boats, the occupiers use, for example, helicopters, first of all. Because they have approximately the same speed and, accordingly, it is easier to patrol such an area on them than on an airplane. Ukrainian troops also continue to work actively to block Russian warships trying to pass through the Kerch Strait. Although Ukraine has officially closed the area to civilian shipping, Russian ports on the Sea of ​​Azov continue to operate, providing international trade. Ukraine, in turn, does not touch civilian vessels that comply with international standards. -This is also an important case, which for some reason is not often mentioned. But trading ports, for example, in the same Temryuk, in Azov, continue to work. Yes, the occupied ports of Berdyansk and Mariupol are illegal, as are the Crimean ports, of course, but those ports on Azov, which officially belong to the Russian Federation, continue international trade. And you see, we do not touch the civilian vessels that enter there. Although it is actually the Kerch Strait, it is officially closed by Ukraine, which had the right to do so,- Dmytro Pletenchuk said. As reported by ArmyInform, the ships of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation >do not enter the waters of the Black Sea due to a number of factors, the enemy uses only aviation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/u-vms-zsu-rozpovily-yak-rosiyany-styaguyut-resursy-dlya-svogo-zahystu-v-okupovanomu-krymu/	2024-11-14T23:35:04-08:00

Up to 70 magnetic -strays- per night: remote mining from a UAV is carried out by -Achilles-	About how mines with magnetic sensors work on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyvi- the commander of the unit told Captain Yury Fedorenko. — This -stray- is not new at all. It was conditionally secret for a very long time, but after certain events that took place, the enemy already understands what we apply, what we use. Therefore, we have come out of the shadows and are already collecting on it officially. It's very simple, he said. The military emphasized how important remote mining is for destroying the enemy. — The amount of equipment the opponent has &lt;&#8230;&gt; it is necessary to stop not only FPV drones, night bombers, means of fire influence - guns, anti-tank means. Mining itself plays a very significant role, the officer emphasized. The commander of the drones explained how explosive devices with magnetic sensors work. — Dangerous zones are irradiated, in particular, due to the use of unmanned systems, so as not to risk engineers, sappers, and people. For this, it is necessary to have a certain sensor, which then comes into action when a lightly armored, armored vehicle or just something made of metal passes by, he explained. Yuriy Fedorenko reported how much one sensor costs and how many mines Achilles drones can set per night. — One sensor costs 1,200 hryvnias. Sometimes we can deliver up to 70 min per night. It happens differently. You can calculate the cost yourself, but it is very effective in terms of efficiency, he said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that The defense forces reliably control tank-dangerous areas in the north of Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/do-70-magnitnyh-pryblud-za-nich-dystanczijne-minuvannya-z-bpla-zdijsnyuye-ahilles/	2024-11-14T23:19:56-08:00

Shampoo -Strength of Victory- and sweater -Last Ukrainian-: Russians talk about non-existent goods	However, this is a photo fake. Such a shampoo has never been sold in Ukraine and is not being sold. However, this does not prevent enemy couch potatoes from taking advantage of Ukrainians because of this. Presumably, the image of the shampoo was taken in a photo editor. Fakeness is indicated, in particular, by the lack of information about the manufacturer, as well as a strange description of the product. After all, it is the Russians who most often use the name of Stepan Bandera in their anti-Ukrainian propaganda. The phrase -bandera spirit- is a typical example of this. This is not the first time Russians have tried to -make fun- of allegedly Ukrainian goods that have never been in Ukraine. Yes, before the New Year holidays last year, they spread information that sweaters with the inscription -last Ukrainian- were sold in Ukraine. In fact, these photo fakes are elements to promote hostile narratives. -Power of Victory- in the form of shampoo is an attempt to mock the unity of Ukrainians and their desire to win over the aggressor. And the inscription on the sweater relays the -throwback- about the readiness of the West or Ukraine to fight -to the last Ukrainian-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/shampun-syla-peremogy-ta-svetr-ostannij-ukrayinecz-rosiyany-rozpovidayut-pro-neisnuyuchi-tovary/	2024-11-14T21:51:45-08:00

From the F-16 veto to the supply of 16 of the latest combat vehicles: Ukrainian experience is taken ...	How important it is to receive F-16 for a country from outside NATO, the example of Bulgaria allows us to understand - a country that joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization two decades ago, but still does not have F-16 fighters in service. About how Bulgaria initiated the purchase of the F-16 Fighting Falcon five years ago, and now is in a hurry to get the Fighting Falcons from Ukraine at least until the end of 2025, ArmiyaInform tells. Bulgarian F-16 Block 70 first successful test flight on October 24, 2024 (Video: Lockheed Martin) F-16 acquisition is difficult among several reasons These include obtaining appropriate approvals, the need to train pilots and support personnel, and to prepare and secure the appropriate infrastructure. It is also necessary to allocate considerable funds from the state budget for the purchase and maintenance of aircraft. It is also necessary to find on the market free F-16s of the latest modifications or combat vehicles suitable for modernization with a flight resource preserved at a level sufficient to justify modernization. The most optimal option, of course, is to purchase new fighters directly from the manufacturer, but the backlog of orders is drawn up for years, so it will not be possible to do this quickly. Moreover, during the execution of the order, circumstances may arise that will force the manufacturer to postpone the previously planned delivery time of combat aircraft by months or even years. This is exactly what happened with the first F-16 Fighting Falcon order, which Bulgaria made back in July 2019. Bulgaria then concluded an agreement to purchase eight F-16s of the latest Block 70 modification, six single-seat and two two-seat fighters. In addition, the contract provided for the purchase of regular aviation ammunition, equipment and spare parts for aircraft, as well as the training of Bulgarian pilots. The value of the 2019 F-16 purchase agreement was $1.265 billion, making it the largest military purchase in Bulgaria's history since the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact Organization. Then, in order to conclude the agreement, the members of the People's Assembly of Bulgaria, the Bulgarian parliament, had to overcome a veto from Bulgarian President Rumen Radev. He motivated his decision by the lack of public consensus on equipment, as well as the fact that the order did not provide for the receipt of a full set of regular F-16 weapons. As a former military pilot, Rumen Radev knew what he was talking about, because due to the desire to reduce the astronomical amount for the Bulgarian state budget, the initial plans had to be revised and limited to the purchase of only part of the equipment and ammunition. Then, as Andrii Haruk reports in the book -Fighting Falcon. History of the F-16-, Bulgaria was forced to abandon the purchase of guided aerial bombs in favor of conventional ones, purchase only two AN/AAQ-33 Sniper ATP sighting pods, and purchase only 12 AIM-9X and 13 AIM-12OC-7 missiles. An equally important role in determining the position of Rumen Radev was played by the pro-Russian orientation of that part of the Bulgarian political system, which tried to oppose the further integration of Bulgaria into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In any case, Bulgaria failed to receive the first F-16 fighters from the 2019 order on time - by the end of 2023. The execution of the contract was postponed until the end of 2025. Judging by everything, one of the reasons that led to the postponement of the contract, in addition to the corona crisis and the failure with the supply of components, was played by the large-scale attack of the Russian Federation on Ukraine. Already in November 2022, Bulgaria concluded a second contract, according to which it is envisaged to purchase eight additional F-16 Fighting Falcon Block 70 - this time four one- and two-seat fighters each. The delivery of aircraft under this contract will begin in 2027. The second contract is similar in amount, but its terms are somewhat more favorable for Bulgaria. Judging by everything, the Bulgarians were able to get better conditions primarily due to the postponement of the implementation of the first agreement. In particular, under the new agreement, the Bulgarians were able to acquire additional spare parts, engines, radar stations, targeting containers, as well as guided aerial bombs and an additional batch of air-to-air missiles. Russia's large-scale attack on Ukraine significantly intensified the country's activities within NATO, affected the political situation in Bulgaria and affected the position of Bulgarian politicians. September 13, 2024 President of Bulgaria Rumen Radev made a demonstration flight on the F-16 fighter. He spoke highly of the combat vehicle's flying qualities, recalled his experience as a military pilot and his first flight on the Combat Falcon in 2005 shortly after Bulgaria joined NATO. The President of Bulgaria also noted the fruitful cooperation between the Air Force of Bulgaria and the United States of America, in particular regarding the training of Bulgarian pilots to master the latest advanced tactics and methods of combat use of military aviation. Separately, Rumen Radev emphasized the importance of Bulgaria receiving F-16 Fighting Falcon Block 70 fighters, which will allow the country's Air Force to overcome the limitations of outdated Soviet equipment. On October 24, 2024, Lockheed Martin announced the successful flight of the first Bulgarian F-16 Block 70 fighter. During it, a test pilot checked the combat vehicle and certified its readiness for operation. This became a significant event for Bulgaria, witnessing the further strengthening of the country's defense ties with NATO, as well as a step that allows not only to catch up, but also in the future to try to overtake Ukraine in the acquisition of F-16 Fighting Falcon fighters. This will be possible due to the fact that Bulgaria will receive today's latest modification of the Block 70 Combat Falcons directly from the manufacturer. Ukraine will be able to maintain its primacy in the development of the F-16 only thanks to the acquired experience and the purchase of the latest combat vehicles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/vid-veto-na-f-16-do-postachannya-16-novitnih-bojovyh-mashyn-ukrayinskyj-dosvid-vrahovuyut-u-bolgariyi/	2024-11-14T21:03:41-08:00
More deadly and environmentally friendly: new shells have been prepared for Leopards and Abrams	How stated in the presentation release of this Düsseldorf-based manufacturer, the Neo cartridge is intended to counteract modern technologies of armored protection, ArmiyaInform reports. KE2020 Neo (Enhanced Kinetic Energy, eKE), defined by their manufacturer as enhanced kinetic energy (eKE) projectiles, represent the latest innovation in Rheinmetall's kinetic energy (KE) ammunition series. Utilizing decades of design experience from a well-known German manufacturer, these 120mm x 570 caliber ammunitions feature a high-strength tungsten penetrator designed to defeat the latest defense systems with increased penetration. The experts of the defense publication Army Recognition announces that Rheinmetall's KE series of projectiles has been significantly improved over the initial DM13 model. It was followed by the DM23 in the 1980s, then the DM33, and later improved versions such as the DM53 and DM63, designed to meet the needs of the upgraded Leopard 2 A6 tank. Separately, it is noted that the latest cartridge continues the evolution of a series of projectiles such as the DM63, which has been updated to meet the strict European REACh environmental regulations. These changes ensure compliance with safety standards for the environment without compromising combat effectiveness. The DM73 is currently the most advanced munition in the series, used by the Bundeswehr alongside the L55A1 high-pressure gun. The official qualification contract signed in September 2020 between the Bundeswehr Federal Office for Equipment, Information Technology and Internal Support (BAAINBw) and Rheinmetall Waffe Munition GmbH underlines Rheinmetall's leading position in smoothbore and tank weapon technology. Rheinmetall's 120 mm smoothbore technology, including the Rh120 guns and ammunition family, became the NATO standard for main battle tanks such as the Leopard 2 and M1 Abrams, and was integrated into the Challenger 3 tank, improving its combat capabilities. In addition to qualifying munitions, cooperation between Rheinmetall, Germany and Great Britain is progressing towards the modernization of tank munitions in NATO forces. This partnership, including the British Army's Challenger 3 and Germany's Leopard 2 platforms, aims to standardize ammunition types between NATO members, improving interoperability. This agreement not only strengthens Rheinmetall's position in tank weapons technology, but also opens the door to future cooperation with other NATO allies, creating important export opportunities for Rheinmetall and its partners in the UK. The new KE 2020 Neo rounds will also support the Challenger 3 upgrade programme, where a smoothbore gun will replace the Challenger 2 rifled gun. This change brings the British tank into line with standard NATO configurations, with full combat capability expected by 2030. Ammunition is planned to be prepared by that time. How ArmyInform reported, in July of this year, the German company Rheinmetall received the first order from the Ukrainian government for the construction of an ammunition production plant in Ukraine. Plans to build the plant were announced in February 2024. The order for the Rheinmetall technology group covers the complete technical equipment of the plant up to commissioning.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/bilsh-smertonosni-ta-ekologichni-dlya-leopardiv-ta-abramsiv-pidgotuvaly-novi-snaryady/	2024-11-14T20:55:55-08:00
The story of Taras, a soldier of the ZSU: in Spain, he sunk the yacht of a Russian official, now he ...	Why did he decide to sink the yacht of the head of Rosoboronexport? But is it difficult to work with the Bradley engine? He told ArmyInform about this: -At the time of the large-scale invasion, I was working in Spain as a senior mechanic on the yacht Lady Anastasia.- The salary was $250 per day. At that time, I had only one desire: to earn a good amount of money in order to secure my pension and return to Ukraine and become a grandfather here. In the first days of the invasion, I saw on video how a rocket hit a high-rise building on Lobanovskyi Street in Kyiv&#8230; Then I finally made the decision that it cannot be like this anymore and something must be done. I decided to sink the yacht I was working on. Why did I decide to sink this particular yacht? Because its owner - Oleksandr Aleksandrovich Mikheev - is the head of the Russian company Rosoboronexport. And it is precisely he who is involved in the production of missiles that fly at us. I am a senior mechanic, I have 24-hour access to the engine room. I opened the Kingston to sink the yacht. Water went into the engine room&#8230; But we still had three crew members on board the ship: our boys from Odessa. And here, as they say, -the countrymen helped-: they started to make noise that, they say, we will lose our jobs&#8230; Well, they notified the local police. The repair crew from the port brought a trailer with a huge pump, they managed to block the Kingston, which I opened. It was not possible to sink the yacht, but I did sink it well. She was then arrested and is still standing in the port of Hadrian motionless. That is, disabled. In general, this is a super yacht, 50 meters long, it has luxury cabins, salons&#8230; Of course I was arrested. Detained, or rather. They brought me to the police station, where I had to wait for the trial. But the judge made a decision: there was no damage to the Spanish side, so there is no legal reason to detain me, and I can go home. When I made this story in Spain, I said to myself: what is this job for me, if I may not have a country? Therefore, I can say to everyone: first, let's defend our country, and then we will think about our own business, about our own interests. &#8230;When I already entered Ukraine, I was accompanied by Roman Ratushny. This is our hero, he died in the 22nd year. Kyiv activist. My son's friend. My son, by the way, also serves in the Defense Forces. And on March 1, I came to the Dnipro TCC. And now I have been serving here for 2.5 years, repairing military equipment. I will be 58 soon. Now, if all the spare parts are available, on average I spend 5-6 days to issue one high-pressure fuel pump for the UTD-20 engine. Why so long? Because I do a complete overhaul, that is, I disassemble the pump to the last cog. In parallel with these tasks, I also worked on fuel pumps for the -Kamazov- engine, which is on the BTR-80. I have already repaired the Bradley: I repaired the fuel equipment. It is interesting, more complicated than the classical principle of fuel equipment. The engine in the -Bradley- is an ordinary V-shaped, eight-cylinder, four-stroke engine, like all engines, there is nothing particularly cosmic about it. The Bradley engine is comparable to the KamAZ, although the American one is a little bigger, a little more complex, and much better quality. &#8230;I will tell you this: at the age of 50 or more, you can both live and serve. And it even needs to be done, someone who has a specialty, who has a profession, can help with repairs and some other help. Guys, help our army, help our country, because don't bring it, Lord, we will lose it. Therefore, I call on everyone to defend.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/istoriya-voyina-zsu-tarasa-v-ispaniyi-prytopyv-yahtu-rosijskogo-chynovnyka-nyni-remontuye-amerykanski-bredli/	2024-11-14T20:22:57-08:00

Ammunition explosions can lead to soil contamination with toxic substances, such as heavy metals, chemical components of explosives, which limit soil fertility and endanger the lives of the population,- said Colonel Oleg Shuvarskyi. Upon completion of the courses, future specialists will be able to conduct environmental audits, draw up acts in accordance with EU legislation, and also determine the possibility of using territories free of explosives for agriculture and other sectors of the economy.

The enemy should not get there under any circumstances, the officer emphasized. Also, the Russians do not abandon their intention to capture Liptsi. — Servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other components of the Defense Forces are also defending there. This direction is reliably controlled by Ukrainian defenders, the lieutenant colonel assured. The military explained the importance of maintaining control over Liptsi. — This is the approach to Kharkiv, which gives the enemy the opportunity to deploy artillery positions and shell the city with barrel artillery. But it must be understood that the positions of the barrel artillery, which are deployed, are also vulnerable. This, of course, should not be allowed, but any artillery, as well as any other enemy forces that appear, are immediately destroyed by the fire of Ukrainian weapons, Yevgeny Romanov explained. Yesterday, after a long break, the Russians resorted to the use of armored vehicles. — The difference from previous days was that the enemy used armored vehicles, including tanks and armored vehicles. Before that, he advanced exclusively with infantry forces - small infantry groups that advanced in the dark, under the cover of rain or fog, so that they would not be noticed by Ukrainian intelligence. They could not [achieve success, so] they decided to throw armored vehicles into battle. She remained on the battlefield, the spokesman said.

Instead, the enemy is giving away satellite equipment for free within the framework of the -Russian world- project (the name of the Kremlin's Nazi ideology, which involves a belief in the uniqueness of the Russian nation and its supremacy over other peoples). That is why equipment is seized from those who refuse to take Russian equipment.

Russian airlines are in a steep rush due to the threat of bankruptcy	About this reports the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Due to restrictions on currency settlements, the Russian authorities allowed air carriers to transfer funds to special accounts in rubles, but foreign lessors do not accept such payments due to non-compliance with the terms of the contracts. As a result, the companies stopped paying debts, and the released funds were directed to support the technical suitability of the aircraft fleet, the cost of which has increased significantly due to sanctions restrictions. The government of the Russian Federation allowed to write off debts for payments in 2025, but according to current tax rules, these amounts will still be subject to a 25% income tax, which air carriers will not be able to pay. The possible bankruptcy of small and medium-sized Russian airlines will have serious consequences for the aviation industry and the Russian economy in general. It is about reducing the availability of air transportation, reducing the level of their safety, losing jobs and reducing the investment attractiveness of the industry. The increase in the tax burden in the context of the Russian government's measures to fill the budget due to the war against Ukraine is a systemic factor that is gradually destroying various sectors of the Russian economy. We remind you that the cost of loans is rapidly increasing in the Russian Federation and inflationary processes are accelerating, which is inevitable ->approaches the economic crisis in the country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/14/rosijski-aviakompaniyi-v-krutomu-pike-cherez-zagrozu-bankrutstva/	2024-11-14T10:08:26-08:00

Over the past day, no enemy assaults have been recorded, he said. Currently, there is no significant accumulation of enemy forces and assets in the section of the battle line north of Kharkiv. — We are not recording a large accumulation now, as it was a couple of weeks ago. This, first of all, is due to the deterioration of weather conditions in Kharkiv Oblast. We see that now Kharkiv Oblast is covered with snow, the officer said. Despite the fact that the Russians do not use armored vehicles in the north of the Kharkiv region, the fighters of the Defense Forces are in constant readiness to repel enemy armored assaults. - As for the use of equipment, the enemy's tactics remain unchanged for the time being: movement and actions in general by small assault groups. Armored vehicles are currently not in use and do not travel, but we see trends along the entire front line and we are constantly preparing, the military assured. Charter fighters pay special attention to identifying and destroying the enemy at the stage of accumulation and concentration, including on the territory of the Russian Federation. — We are starting to hit equipment across the border, because we see that we need to destroy those armored groups that are kept by the enemy for reserve or for assault. It is necessary to work at the stage of their concentration and accumulation. In our country, this happens mainly across the state border of Ukraine, that is, it is necessary to search, identify and destroy. We are doing this little by little so that it will be easier later, the guardsman emphasized. Thanks to coordinated combat operations, the enemy has no success in the north of Kharkiv Oblast. — The adversary does not stop trying, constantly tries to carry out some accumulations, advances in order to acquire the potential to go into offensive actions.

The occupiers recruit propagandists from among schoolchildren	This is reported by the Center of National resistance Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the Russians have killed independent journalism, and all media editorial offices have been forced to leave TOT. Instead, the occupiers began to create fake publications under the control of propagandists brought from the Russian Federation. In order to create the illusion of independence, the occupiers began to attract young people there, who sometimes, due to little life experience, go for easy money and seek fame. The deficit of propagandists in the media has not yet been overcome, and now the enemy has begun to attract high school students from captured Ukrainian schools to the editorial offices. The -Kherson news agency- (subordinate to the occupied administration) and the Kremlin's -movement of the first- deal with the recruitment of schoolchildren.

The EU plans to strengthen defense capabilities	This is reported by Service of foreign intelligence of Ukraine. The budget plan of the European Union for 2021-2027 provides 392 billion euros for -cohesion policy- initiatives. About five percent of them have been used today. According to current regulations, these funds cannot be used to purchase defense equipment or directly finance the armed forces. In order to avoid their inappropriate use, the European Commission is considering the possibility of spending money on programs for regional development, in particular, logistics infrastructure. It is about the construction and strengthening of bridges and roads for the safe passage of military equipment. In addition, legislative changes are not excluded, which will provide more flexibility to the rules of budget allocation, in particular, its use for the expansion of defense industries. Such a change in policy indicates an increased focus on defense in the next EU budget for 2028-2034, negotiations on which will begin in 2025. We would like to remind you that in the Russian Federation the cost of loans is rapidly inflationary processes are accelerating, which inevitably brings the country's economic crisis closer.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/14/yes-planuye-posylennya-oboronnyh-spromozhnostej/	2024-11-14T05:58:40-08:00

The head of the Military Conscription and Recruitment Service of the Republic of Lithuania, Arunas Balciunas, emphasized that it is important for Lithuania, which also borders Russia, to study the experience of Ukraine gained during almost a thousand days of war. -Lithuania also borders the Russian Federation, so we are interested in the experience that Ukraine received resistance for almost a thousand days. When peacetime is replaced by war events, everything changes very quickly.

The dormitory was destroyed, the classrooms were destroyed: Russian troops shelled the university in...	Correspondents of ArmiyaInform visited the scene. According to an employee of the university, she was just passing near the institution when she heard the distinctive roar of a projectile approaching, followed by three explosions. Then she saw black smoke. She was very scared, because she works as a watchman at the university, and it was a miracle that she was not on the territory of the institution. According to Stanislav Chaichenko, Vice-Rector for Scientific and Pedagogical Work of the Donbass State Pedagogical University, as a result of the Russian shelling, probably a missile, there is a hit in one of the university dormitories. In the main building of the university, windows and doors were broken, classrooms were damaged. Fortunately, during the Russian terrorist attack, there were no workers in the premises and only the premises were destroyed. — The educational process in us is carried out remotely. The university is in the stage of relocation, currently the administration works in the city of Dnipro on the basis of another educational institution, - says Stanislav Chaichenko. - Our university is a pedagogical one, the entire line from preschool education is represented: preschool, primary, secondary education in various subjects and specializations, professional education. There are also non-pedagogical specialties such as psychology, management, social work, therapy, rehabilitation and some others. The number of students currently fluctuates at different times, so somewhere on average 2.5-3 thousand students are currently studying, this is together with our separate unit, the Horliv Institute of Foreign Languages, which also moved from Bakhmut to the Dnipro for the second time and now they are next to each other, - he adds vice-rector of the university.

Prostitutes, apartments and more: what Ukrainian activists found on the hacked computer of the comma...	About this reports Center of National Resistance. At the same time, the general managed to spread a computer virus on equipment at the headquarters of the command of the Russian group in the Zaporizhzhia direction. Also, while sending Russian soldiers to their inevitable death, he sent his own son abroad with a military education. Hackers-activists -Cyber ​​Resistance- and -KibOrg- managed to download a spy virus to the personal computer of the commander of the forces of the Russian Federation in the Zaporizhia region in 2023, Colonel-General Alexander Romanchuk. He spread the malicious program on a number of devices in the main headquarters of the Russian group. The surveillance operation lasted more than a year and a half and made it possible to obtain information about the enemy's plans, the location of his forces and intelligence. Part of the obtained material was handed over to analysts of the CNS. Since the active period of the operation has ended, it became possible to familiarize with a number of its details publicly. Also, the motive for the publication was the rhetoric of Russian propaganda regarding Romanchuk. Some of its elements cause sharp fits of laughter in people who are informed from primary sources. If you compile a portrait of Romanchuk from the publications of some of the Russian -military forces- in Telegram, then a real Rimbaud with the mind of Clausewitz or Sun Tzu appears, who almost personally stopped the Ukrainian offensive in the Zaporozhye direction in 2023. Romanchuk receives the epaulettes of colonel-general from the hands of the chief of the general staff of the Soviet Union Gerasimov and in the presence of the then commander of the invasion forces of Ukraine Surovikin on the eve of being sent to the Zaporizhzhia region. February 2023. Photo from Romanchuk's personal archive, to which CNS analysts were given access. It follows from the publication of the -Rybar- channel that Romanchuk seized a tank during a business trip to Syria, -set up a carousel of fire- and -pulled 40 fighters out of the cauldron.- Another popular channel -Children of the Arbat- adds Romanchuk to the top ten most talented Russian commanders, and the -Neighbor- channel writes that Romanchuk is a key element of Russian defense in Zaporizhzhia in 2023. With such a reputation, Romanchuk received the right to open the parade until May 9, 2024 in Moscow. In fact, under the leadership of Romanchuk, the Russians traditionally bombarded the front line with cannon fodder in the Zaporozhye direction. This became clear in detail thanks to the publication of statistics by Captain Vyacheslav Dondokov from Buryatia, who then headed the tactical group of the 42nd medical battalion of the Russian Federation in the relevant area. Only one tactical medical group of the enemy (stable point) received more than 1,100 wounded for a month. According to Ukrainian intelligence, there were at least 11 such groups in the Zaporizhzhia region. This means that in 2023, Russian troops lost more than 12,000 wounded there every month. Did Romanchuk try to improve the position of the fighters and resort to non-standard steps, continuously studying the situation on the line of contact? The most impressive discovery of the CNS analysts was that the -heroic- colonel-general, while in the position of head of an entire direction, did not show any interest in the affairs at the front. There is no exaggeration here. Romanchuk literally did not deal with the matters entrusted to him. The defense forces had full access to Romanchuk's personal computer and recorded everything he did when he used the device, as well as full access to the colonel general's mail and social media accounts. Romanchuk had a very peculiar occupation during working hours. Judging by the actions on his computer, the lion's share of time was spent choosing on the sites of ads for cottages and apartments for the needs of the family. Romanchuk also engaged in the selection of girls on the dating site for personal needs.

mass bankruptcies and corporate defaults await Russia	This is reported by /a> Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The number of loans with a dynamic rate, which critically depend on the discount rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, is constantly increasing: at the end of 2023, their share was 44% of the total number of corporate loans, but by the end of 2024, it reached 53%. Economists close to the Russian government expect unsecured money issuance, explosive growth of inflation and the collapse of the ruble in the near future. The critical point of this scenario is considered to be mid-2025. In addition, the regulator's tight monetary policy creates risks of recession and transition to stagflation in the short term. The further situation may develop according to the -shock with a decline in production- scenario, which will be accompanied by mass bankruptcies and corporate defaults.

On the other hand, the appearance of civilians in the combat zone does not pose any problem for the enemy. - Our enemy is not as humane as we are. Therefore, it is not an obstacle for him, but for us it is a very big obstacle. When we see the movement of the enemy from the drone and start using means to defeat him or use artillery - and when we see from the drone that a civilian (usually elderly people) comes out on the way or near the target where the enemy is located - then, accordingly , we understand that there is no question of any fire injury. We have to wait until either the civilian disappears or the enemy moves to another place, - explained the soldier. Moreover, the Russian occupiers deliberately and specifically use civilians as human shields. - Unfortunately, the enemy also knows that we treat our civilians this way. Sometimes it happens that [the enemy] resorts to vile acts, taking cover of civilians, settling in civilian houses. They settle and do not drive civilians out of their houses, they force them to live on, but they themselves settle in basements and in this way protect themselves, because they know that at this time nothing will fly into this house, - said Anton Baev.

Repression, torture, executions, a sea of ​​blood: the historian reminds the Zhduns what to expect f...	— We have at least a dozen historical examples, so to speak, of the occupation of Kyiv either by Russians or by Soviet troops. But, unfortunately, the whole experience is exactly the same. It all boils down to the fact that after the occupation of the city, mass repressions take place, both against that part of the population that was ready to resist, and that resisted, and against that population that, in the opinion of the occupiers, was not loyal enough. Therefore, I would like to remind everyone, first of all, to address the so-called -Zhduns- so that they do not have any illusions about how the Russians will behave. They will behave the same as they behaved in 1169, 1659, 1918, 1919. We have many such examples. This will first be the absolutely deliberate destruction of people who take a pro-Ukrainian position, and then they will take care of everything else in order to simply level the landscape and change it, populating the city with its own absolutely loyal population. Therefore, no one should have the illusion that the occupation will be peaceful, that -great Russian culture- will come here, humanists in the form of Leo Tolstoy and others. No, it won't. Absolutely peaceful occupation does not exist. There will be repression, there will be torture, there will be executions, there will be a sea of ​​blood. And Kyiv has already experienced this many times. I hope this will not happen again. For this, we have the Armed Forces of Ukraine and, I hope, the consciousness of our population as a guarantee.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/14/represiyi-tortury-straty-more-krovi-istoryk-nagaduye-zhdunam-chogo-chekaty-vid-okupacziyi/	2024-11-13T20:55:49-08:00
Who can become a combat medic: the takmed instructor -Lastivka- told how much time it takes to prepa...	Lastivka told ArmiyaInform correspondent about how important quality training in tactical medicine is, who can become a combat medic and how much time it takes to train him -from scratch-, as well as when and why practice is more important than theory, and motivation determines the result. The boys gave their callsign while still in the brigade. There were many Russian-speaking boys, so they called me -Lastochka- - Ukrainian -Lastivka-. They said I looked like a swallow - small, thin, fussy, sharp and fast. I fly everywhere, I run everywhere, I try to be in time everywhere. My husband also said that I remind him of a swallow, because he once watched swallows in his childhood and saw how they protect their home, their offspring. The swallow is a small bird, and it fearlessly pounces on any threat much larger than itself. That's why he said that I look like a swallow. In the Armed Forces of Ukraine, I am from a large-scale invasion. I wanted to leave back in 2014, when the anti-terrorist operation began, but my husband did not allow me, he said that someone should stay at home with the child alone. In 2022, the child had already grown up, so it was no longer possible to keep me at home under this pretext. And the threat became much more terrible, so I could not stay at home anymore. I am a doctor by education, by 2022 I already had 21 years of medical experience. I worked in a maternity hospital, helped deliver children. And now my children have to defend their home with automatic weapons and I couldn't help them. I'm not afraid of blood, I'm not afraid of hurting people to make them better, to save them. I had to hurt even newborn babies in order to save their lives. That's why I'm not afraid to hurt an adult to make him feel better, to survive. From March 2022 to February 2024, I was in a combat brigade. At the beginning of the invasion, no one taught us what tactical medicine was, what and how we should do it - there was no time, no opportunity. Now I'm at the training center and I see how high-quality training in tactical medicine has become. Now is the time, there is an opportunity to train people to provide adequate assistance on the battlefield - this is very important. Due to this, we have much better trained combat medics who go to the brigades. There they not only provide medical care, but also train fighters. We are training combat medics - these are the people who will continue to teach the boys tactical medicine in the brigades, because, in my opinion, only the basics of the necessary training are laid down during the BZVP, and they are not enough. Any motivated thinking person can become a combat medic. Medical education would be an advantage, of course, but it is not a mandatory requirement, as we primarily train people who have never worked professionally in medicine. We explain in such a way that our students understand why exactly such actions should be taken in this or that situation. We teach them this and try not to use any complicated medical terms. We always prioritize practice, not theory. If a combat medic can work on an algorithm without thinking about it, it is much more important than when he knows how to beautifully explain what he is doing and why. Our graduates may not remember complex medical terms, but they will determine exactly what should be done and what should not be done in any case. And their hands will never forget how to properly make a bandage or apply a tourniquet. Preparation requires a high-quality material base, equipment, and consumables. We have good sponsors who help a lot with all this. There are necessary mannequins, systems, dummies, turnstiles - everything you need. Of course, it all wears out, runs out, and needs to be replaced and replenished. But in general, everything that is needed for quality education is enough. The most important resource is time. We constantly -drive- and train our students. So that they do not get confused, how and where to turn that bandage or tourniquet, so that it is done at the level of automation. Training a combat medic requires intense training and time to train muscle memory. For this, one month is definitely not enough, two is better and you can manage in general, but the best option is three months for preparation. After completing the training, the combat medic receives the corresponding VOS number with a record in the military ticket that he successfully passed the combat medic course with a positive evaluation, that is, he can assume the position of a combat medic and provide assistance on the battlefield and in shelter conditions. We also train paramedics. They are trained according to a more simplified program, but they also know and are able to do a lot to help the wounded and save his life. The most capable, responsible and motivated can later go to the courses of a senior combat medic, when the training program has already been approved. This will be the next step in professional development. A senior combat medic must know and be able to organize, set up a stabilization point - this is a higher level of knowledge and responsibility when it comes to organizing the care of many wounded in a specially equipped place. Being a combat medic is very responsible, so random people are not needed here. You cannot become a doctor by force. Unmotivated students are very difficult to teach. It's better to spend extra time on a person who really wants to learn, and I'd rather teach them, than to spend time, energy and resources on someone who needs to be forced to learn.

Military at disposal: about the grounds and amount of payments	Most often, servicemen who are on long-term treatment after an injury, or those who have been recognized as unfit or limited fit for service in such a unit, are taken into command. That is, they cannot perform the duties of their position, and at the same time they cannot resign from the Armed Forces. So they have to wait for a certain time, for example, to be released or transferred to other units. Of course, this is not a complete list of grounds for inclusion in the ordinance. For example, this is also allowed if: With in full the list of grounds can be found in the Presidential Decree -On Provisions on the Military Service of Ukrainian Citizens in the Armed Forces of Ukraine-. Servicemen on active duty should receive the following financial support: We would like to remind you that if the removal to service is related to long-term treatment after an injury, during treatment in a hospital, or during the time on leave for treatment, servicemen are paid an additional remuneration of 100,000 hryvnias. You can read more about payments for the wounded here. ♬ original audio recording - armyinform &#8211; armyinform In most cases, enlisted servicemen continue their military service. Therefore, they must perform the duties determined by the commander under whose command they fall. Exceptions are military personnel on long-term treatment, parental leave, or those on precautionary measures.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/14/vijskovyj-u-rozporyadzhenni-pro-pidstavy-ta-rozmir-vyplat/	2024-11-13T20:28:51-08:00
Cheap and can be angry: the Republic of Korea has made cardboard drones for aerial reconnaissance an...	Assaid on the official portal of the Peach development company from South Korea, this fixed-wing drone is designed to perform reconnaissance missions with minimal production and deployment costs, which makes it an attractive solution for military tasks, ArmiyaInform reports. A significant reduction in production costs is achieved due to the materials used, because they are light and cheap, and the drone itself is not large in size. Its wingspan is only 80 centimeters, and the maximum take-off weight is up to 1 kg, so the drone is record small. However, this does not affect its flight capabilities. PapyDrone-800 can be launched manually, that is, simply by the operator, whose hand acts as the -runway-. Once in flight, the drone can reach speeds of up to 100 km/h for a maximum of 20 minutes. The drone is able to provide real-time reconnaissance because it is equipped with a high-quality camera that transmits a video signal in real time and thus gives the operator direct access to information about the environment. At the same time, the control system supports not one, but up to five UAVs. The PapyDrone-800 also has an integrated avionics system that handles navigation and data processing. KCNA/P's built-in authentication module ensures the security and integrity of mission data, preventing tampering or unauthorized access. A high level of data encryption ensures that reconnaissance missions remain confidential and secure, even if the drone is intercepted or shot down. Combined with the low price and ease of production, PapyDrone-800 can be considered as a disposable UAV. It does not require ideal flight conditions and, thanks to the IPX3 standard, it can work effectively in various environments, including high humidity. While many drones used by the military have relatively expensive and labor-intensive systems to maintain, the PapyDrone-800 stands in stark contrast. As defined experts from IKK Defense Express, although the drone is positioned by its developers as a reconnaissance device, it has the description states that the internal volume of the fuselage allows carrying a warhead. -As for operational capabilities, it is declared to be used up to a wind speed of 10 m/s, which is the standard -civilian- limit. As for protection against moisture, the cardboard used has protection at the IPX3 level, and the developers showed the possibility of flying in the rain,- DE experts said. In the promo video, you can also see several details, such as the use of hot-melt glue to attach the fuselage elements, as well as the fact that some power elements of the body are still made of carbon, the equipment compartment is made of foam, and the drone also has metal rods. At the same time, the use of electronic components, as seen in the video, is reduced to a minimum number of boards. It should be noted that the South Korean startup Peach also has a larger development, the Papidrone-1800, the parameters of which are not disclosed, but the payload of the drone is obviously larger. Its conceptual idea is similar - to use the cheapest possible components. Thus, according to defense market analysts, the low price of the PapyDrone-800 allows even small military units to have access to advanced intelligence technologies without the financial burden associated with traditional and more complex unmanned systems. This opens up new opportunities for countries and organizations operating within modest budgets, especially in regions with limited military resources. Video: Presentation of PapyDrone-800 UAV.

Letters on behalf of the US non-governmental organization Freedom House with alleged calls to the Ukrainian military to leave the service are fake. Enemy propagandists used a fake email address and logo of an international organization to give the message weight and authenticity. But again, they could not avoid typical language mistakes and Russianisms used by people who do not speak Ukrainian. Freedom House also quickly reacted to this manipulation, calling it part of a campaign to discredit the Ukrainian army: -We have noticed cases of sending fake e-mails pretending to be messages from Freedom House. These letters contain false information directed against the Ukrainian military and are aimed at undermining trust in our organization and the morale of the defenders of Ukraine,- the message reads.

This was reported by the Deputy Prime Minister for the Reconstruction of Ukraine - the Minister of Community Development and territory of Ukraine Oleksiy Kuleba. At the meeting chaired by the President of Ukraine, with the participation of representatives of the Government and the Verkhovna Rada, the main indicators of the draft state budget for 2025 were considered. A decision was made to maintain the reverse subsidy in the budgets of communities located in the front-line zone. In particular, the draft budget provides for the redistribution of 14.9 billion hryvnias of the reverse subsidy to support de-occupied and front-line communities, which, according to Kuleba, is -a fair and necessary solution for people working in the most difficult conditions of war.- In addition, an additional 37.5 billion hryvnias are allocated to communities that suffered losses due to Russia's large-scale armed aggression. The Ministry of Development of Communities and Territories also expressed a position regarding the preservation of 64% of the personal income tax (PIT) in the budgets of communities. This solution will contribute to increasing the capacity of local communities and supporting their viability. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukraine will receive the sixth IRIS-T air defense system from Germany by the end of the year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/13/pidtrymka-pryfrontovyh-gromad-novyj-byudzhet-peredbachaye-149-mlrd-grn-reversnoyi-dotacziyi/	2024-11-13T12:28:34-08:00

The Ministry of Defense commented on the proposal to disband the TCC and JV	About this he told on the air -Suspilne Novosti-. -It is still too early to draw any conclusions.

However, 36,000 people actually work there, of which almost 7,000 are civilians. In particular, among the military, 18,500 are disabled and 3,000 are women. If we talk about those with limited fitness, then for many this status was acquired on the battlefield, these people defended the Motherland with weapons in their hands. This should also be taken into account, and these moments should be treated with caution. In addition, the spokesman of the IOU commented on Roman Istomin's statement that it is impossible to create a single brigade from TCC employees. -If you approach purely quantitatively, then it is possible. But these people perform other tasks. You can treat corruption scandals and unpleasant moments in different ways, but if there are any reorganization measures, we will communicate. Currently, they continue to be under the command of the Land Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,- Dmytro Lazutkin noted. Also, the spokesman once again emphasized that 18,500 servicemen of the TCC and SP are of limited suitability who have already fought. As reported by ArmyInform, appearance of TCC and police officers in public places are not -raids-, but warning measures, and if the visitor violates the rules of the military accounting or legislation — the police have legal grounds to detain him.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/13/u-minoborony-prokomentuvaly-propozycziyu-pro-rozformuvannya-tczk-ta-sp/	2024-11-13T11:34:50-08:00

The Cabinet of Ministers has changed the conditions for receiving aid for the families of missing an...	About this informs the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Corresponding changes to the order of payments were approved by the Cabinet of Ministers at the proposal of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Previously, the three-year deadline for submitting documents to receive a one-time cash benefit was calculated from the date of death indicated in the certificate. It is noted that this led to the fact that close relatives of military personnel, whom the court declared dead after a long period of absence, could lose the right to assistance due to the expiration of the terms even before the court decision itself was passed. Now the counting of time for registration of assistance starts from the day of entry into legal force of the court decision declaring the serviceman dead. This will ensure social guarantees for the families of the fallen defenders. The Government has also introduced an extraordinary payment of one-time cash assistance to persons with disabilities of the 1st group. This is due to the fact that such people need urgent and expensive treatment. Often, due to the long waiting period in the general queue, they do not have time to receive assistance in their lifetime. Amendments are made to Resolution No. 975 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of December 25, 2013 -On approval of the Procedure for the appointment and payment of one-time cash benefits in the event of death (death), disability or partial loss of working capacity without establishing disability of servicemen, conscripts and reservists who are called up for training (or inspection) and special meetings or for serving in the military reserve-. Resolution No. 168 of February 28, 2022 -Issue of certain payments to military personnel, rank and file officers, police officers and their families during martial law- was also amended.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/13/kabmin-zminyv-umovy-otrymannya-dopomogy-dlya-rodyn-znyklyh-bezvisty-ta-zagyblyh-vijskovyh/	2024-11-13T04:21:55-08:00

An agent of the special services of the Russian Federation who corrected enemy strikes on Chernihiv ...	This was informed in the SBU.

As reported by ArmyInform, The Defense Forces of Ukraine hit the enemy formation PMM on the territory of the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/13/nastup-okupantiv-zahlynuvsya-na-vsih-napryamkah-zsu-vidbyly-ponad-150-atak-voroga/	2024-11-12T21:07:30-08:00
Next, probably, cavalry, bicycles: an expert on stocks of military equipment in the Russian Federati...	-If we talk about the replenishment of the enemy's troops with combat equipment, then, for example, the entire tank repair industry of the Russian Federation with joint efforts produces about 150-160 tanks every month. About 30% of them are the newest - those assembled from scratch at the Uralvagonzavod. All the rest are cars that have been restored after they were wrecked in Ukraine. Or these are machines that were taken from storage, reanimated and sent to the front. Accordingly, if the enemy produces 150-160 vehicles per month, they will collect 1,920 tanks in a year. The Dutch site Oryx counts the losses of this war. But he counts not just the ones shot down in battle, but the completely destroyed machines that can no longer be restored. So, the Dutch counted a total of 3,494 destroyed tanks from the Russians for the entire time of the fighting. That is, with a production rate of 1,920 tanks per year, the enemy covers its losses without problems. But there is one caveat. The tanks that are now being delivered to the Russian army are older years of production. Because this is what is taken for storage, reanimated and supplied to units. If we receive cars from the allies somewhere in the 70s, 80s - if we are lucky, the first half of the 90s, then the enemy has them in the 60s. The difference in technical capabilities is obvious. the Russian Federation does not produce tank sights at all. They buy them in Belarus. Joint-stock company -Peleng- takes care of their production. It collects 145 -Sosna- sights and 40 of the latest -Sosna-U- sights in a year. On the eve of a large-scale invasion, the Russians purchased optical sights from France. All this was sanctioned. Accordingly, it is necessary to buy in Belarus. According to the sights, it turns out that the Belarusians are able to provide for the Russians. The Russian Federation even has the ability to change broken sights on tanks and keep something in stock. The situation in the Russian Federation is worse with artillery, because cannon barrels, first of all, are long. Second, it is a laborious process. Thirdly, the machines that are needed for drilling and cutting are high-precision equipment that cannot be bought so easily in the market. There were rumors that 10 machines were purchased by the Russians through Austria. But there are fewer than a hundred such machines throughout Russia. And the need for cannon barrels is thousands. Therefore, you can take what you have, repair it and give it to the troops. Accordingly, no one cancels the concept of -fatigue- of metal. The laws of physics apply. What was in storage will definitely have a shorter service life. Separately, it is necessary to say about the means of anti-aircraft defense of the enemy. It was already known in 2022 that the Russians do not have enough workers at factories. Russia produces such devices, but these are high-tech systems that require a lot of components, radio electronics, processors. And they are not produced in the Russian Federation. Accordingly, all this is imported through gray routes, very long supply chains are used. This is far from always military products, it can be purely civilian radio electronics, and it has other, for example, temperature ranges&#8230; And, accordingly, they can do something with air defense, but it will take a long time. And as we knock out their anti-aircraft missile systems, it becomes more and more difficult for the enemy to replenish them. Plus, friends from Iran urgently asked for S-300. the Russians took them to Crimea and sent them to Ayatoli. Then Israel flew there, crumbled everything into a fine vinaigrette. All five of the five long-range radar stations were destroyed. Ayatollah says: -Well, guys, give me more, because I need it, because they will fly again.- And the Russians are on such a normal split now: either for themselves or for their allies. But the Allies gave the Russians ammunition of scarce denominations, for example, 115 mm shells for T-62 tanks, which have a specific gun with such a strange caliber. British intelligence estimates that the adversary will exhaust its reserves of armored vehicles, meaning tanks and armored fighting vehicles, by the fall of 2025. Next, probably, cavalry, bicycles, what else could be there&#8230; We have already seen electric scooters. But we cannot yet talk about the fact that the Russian defense industry is on the verge of collapse. It still has considerable potential. Their much bigger problem is the lack of skilled labor. Also, these are problems with components, which are becoming more and more difficult to get. After all, the expert community and volunteers monitor what and where it comes from, and through diplomatic and not-so-diplomatic ways, partners are provided with data about it, and such schemes are cut off wherever they can be detected. Therefore, this is exactly what will restrain the Russian defense industry. They are now at their best. Because they should implement the fourth shift? Well, the day is not rubber. Switch to an eight-day work week? But they have already switched to a seven-day one. In the area of ​​the same Uralvagonzavod in Nizhny Tagil, in the 23rd year, they began to build a zone where it was supposed to concentrate specialists with technical skills, who are serving sentences for any articles. Probably in order to attract them to work at the tank factory. Therefore, they have already exhausted all the possibilities that the Russians have. There is no possibility to increase something. In particular, also in aviation: because they are already involving Belarusian specialists to restore the MiG-29. Therefore, I think that we will not see the collapse of the Russian defense industry, but we will see a certain stagnation. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/13/dali-mabut-kavaleriya-velosypedy-ekspert-pro-zapasy-vijskovoyi-tehniky-v-rf/	2024-11-12T21:01:44-08:00
-Cossacks- in the service of the Defense Forces of Ukraine: how they created the well-known armored ...	It is about the family of these BBMs, its history and development that the correspondent of ArmiyaInform talked with Andriy Kharuk, a well-known researcher of military equipment and armaments, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaydachny. — Andriy Ivanovych, in accordance with the distribution of machine-building production capacities in the former USSR, Ukrainian enterprises, in particular, manufactured formidable tanks and tractors, while the republic's car factories could only boast of rather clumsy -Zaporozhians- and -scary- Volynyankas. Therefore, during the collapse of the Union, our state did not inherit enterprises for the production of wheeled armored vehicles. Where did the -Cossack- genealogy begin? — If we recall the history of the company producing the current BBMs -Kozak-, the private joint-stock company -Praktika Scientific-Production Association- was founded in Kyiv in 1993. Initially, it was engaged in the production of civilian armored objects - bank safes and vaults, secure server rooms, etc. In 1998, the company mastered the production of collector armored cars, and ten years later tried to enter the market of military armored vehicles. — And what was the start of this enterprise in the defense market? — In 2009, -Praktyka- produced a prototype of an armored car on the Iveco Daily 55S18W all-wheel drive chassis. The machine, which received the name СРМ-1 -Козак-, had a welded body of MILUX steel armor (Finnish production) with four side doors and one aft. A 7.62-mm or 12.7-mm machine gun, or a 30- or 40-mm automatic grenade launcher could be installed on a manually operated turret on the roof of the hull. SRM-1 was relatively light - 5.5 tons. This indirectly indicates a not too high level of armored protection (armor thickness was only 5 mm, armored glass in the windows - 56 mm). Designers paid attention to mine protection: the passenger capsule has a double V-shaped bottom. Additional protection against the blast wave is provided by the batteries and the fuel tank located in the double floor. That -Kozak- was equipped with a four-cylinder Iveco F1C turbodiesel (3-liter displacement, 176 hp) and a six-speed ZF6S gearbox. The prototype was displayed at the Independence Day parade on August 24, 2009. The firm launched an extensive marketing campaign, showing -Cossack- at various exhibitions. Interest in the armored car was apparently shown by Nigeria, Pakistan and about a dozen other countries, but it was not possible to receive a single order. The low price did not help either - the company declared that the price of the SRM-1 in the basic version will be only 125 thousand dollars. Even cheaper should have been the version on the chassis of the GAZ-66 truck (with the replacement of the carburetor engine with a diesel one). - That is, at the prototype level, the activity of the manufacturing company in the field of defense then stopped? - Interest in the -Cossack- grew after the beginning of Russian aggression in 2014. On September 2, 2014, the prototype was demonstrated at the National Guard training ground in Novy Petrivtsy, Kyiv region, and on September 24-27, in Kyiv, at the exhibition -Weapons and Security - 2014-. However, in its current form, SRM-1 did not interest the military. In the end, the prototype -Cossack- was bought from the company by the US Embassy and handed over to the Ukrainian border guards on January 20, 2015. - However, a powerful enemy onslaught clearly cannot be stopped with one machine, let alone a prototype. How did events develop further? — The beginning of Russian aggression in 2014 became an incentive for many Ukrainian manufacturers to offer their products to the Defense Forces. However, SRM-1 did not suit the military. The main drawback of the first -Cossack- was insufficient protection, and it was not possible to strengthen it due to the weak chassis. So in 2014, when Praktiki specialists started designing a new armored car, they chose a heavier Iveco Eurocargo 150 E28 4×4 chassis (in the Iveco line, the Eurocargo family occupies an intermediate place between the light Daily cars and the heavy Stralis). The prototype, known as -Kozak-2014-, retained the general features of the SRM-1, but the use of a different chassis made it possible to strengthen the armored protection - it corresponds to level 2 according to the STANAG 4569 standard. The combat weight increased to 15 tons, but the dynamic characteristics did not deteriorate thanks to the diesel 250 hp engine Depending on the purpose of the car and the layout of the internal volume of the body, it can transport from 5 to 11 soldiers plus two crew members - a driver and a commander. — But this armored car, as far as is known, was only an intermediate option, right? — In the spring of 2015, a new version of the armored car appeared on the Iveco Eurocargo chassis — -Kozak-2-. It was distinguished by a significantly improved body, a six-cylinder Iveco Tector diesel engine with a working volume of 5.9 liters and a power of 279 hp. and a number of other improvements. The front suspension is an independent spring, the rear is a dependent spring. The armored body is welded from MILUX steel sheets. Italian anti-trauma seats with five-point seat belts are installed for the crew and landing party. The machine is equipped with a filter ventilation unit of Turkish production and a radio station of the Ternopil plant -Orizon-. Armament in the basic version was mounted in an open tower of the -crown- type. The first two copies of Kozak-2, shown on March 14, 2015, at the training ground in Novy Petrivtsi, were armed with 12.7-mm NSVT-12.7 machine guns. However, other weapons options were also allowed - a 7.62 mm machine gun or an automatic grenade launcher. And in May 2015, the Kozak-2, additionally armed with the Stugna-P ATGM, was demonstrated at the training ground of the 169th Desna training center. - And how did this BBM sample perform in field tests? - Tests of the Kozak-2 armored car were conducted simultaneously in the interests of the National Guard and the Armed Forces. In January-February 2016, the machine passed state tests at the training grounds of the State Scientific and Testing Center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Chernihiv, the training center of the National Guard of Ukraine in the village of Stare of the Kyiv region and on the basis of PJSC -NVO -Praktyka--. In particular, on February 17, one of the prototypes at the National Guard training ground underwent practical tests for anti-mine and anti-bullet resistance. A charge of TNT weighing 6 kg was detonated under the bottom of the cars, and the armored car was also fired at with a 5.45 mm AK-74 machine gun, a Dragunov sniper rifle, and a PKM machine gun (7.62 mm caliber). Although the armored car was damaged, the crew in a real battle would definitely survive in the event of such damage. These tests were the first in Ukraine to be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the STANAG 4569 standard. - So the -second- Kozak satisfied the military? was officially adopted by the National Guard of Ukraine under the designation SBA (specialized armored vehicle) -Kozak-001-. The Ministry of Defense was more scrupulous when making decisions: on November 3, 2016, Kozak-2 was admitted to operation during a special period (Order No. 588), and on March 21, 2017, it was taken for armament by Order No. 158. This document justified that -Kozak-2- is designed -for the transportation of personnel, samples of weapons, military cargo and property on all types of roads and terrain; conducting tactical operations such as patrolling; escorting vehicles during special tasks; transmission of orders and provision of communication; fire support of personnel in battle, as well as for the protection of the crew and cargo, personnel from the fire of small arms caliber 7.62 mm, fragments of ammunition and mines.- - And when was their serial production started? - The National Guard ordered the first 22 Kozak-2 armored cars in June 2015 - a year before the official acceptance for armament, and even before the completion of state tests. Obviously, the production of these machines was already underway, because the customer received the first ten of them already at the beginning of July. On February 11, 2016, the first six -Cossack-2- were handed over to the State Border Service of Ukraine. The Armed Forces of Ukraine received the first batch (ten Kozak-2 vehicles) in November 2017. At that time, the National Guard and the State Border Service already had more than 100 such armored vehicles. In August 2019, the general director of Praktika reported that more than 200 Kozak-2 armored vehicles have already been handed over to law enforcement agencies, and another batch of 40 vehicles is being prepared for handover. Another batch, which included more than 40 armored vehicles, was handed over in December 2020. — Regarding the Ministry of Defense: where did these BBMs come from? — In the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Kozak-2 armored vehicles were supplied primarily to units of the Airborne Forces - assault troops. For example, in March 2019, 33 such vehicles were transferred to the 13th separate airborne assault battalion of the 95th separate airborne assault brigade (Zhytomyr), and in December of the same year, Kozak-2 was delivered to the 81st separate airborne brigade (Kramatorsk). In December 2020, the 88th separate marine infantry battalion (Bolgrad) of the 35th separate marine infantry brigade received about 40 armored vehicles of this type, and in 2021, the 36th OBrMP also received such vehicles. Twelve -Cossacks-2- from this brigade took part in the parade in honor of Independence Day in Kyiv on August 24, 2021. The cost of Kozak-2 in 2017 was UAH 8.4 million, and for the contract concluded in December 2019, it reached UAH 9.28 million. This was explained by the increase in the minimum wage and the increase in energy prices. - If it's not a big secret, do you know how much special car data has been collected? Did they take part in the battles in the east of Ukraine? - The total number of Kozak-2 armored cars produced is not known for sure, but it can be estimated at about 300 units. In 2020, two of them were exported to Indonesia for testing, the rest are actively used by the Defense Forces of Ukraine. The National Guard tested its Kozak-2 vehicles in combat conditions in the area of ​​the anti-terrorist operation back in 2015. Later, the armored vehicles of the Armed Forces also visited the battle, in particular, in January 2020, 35 OBrMP vehicles arrived in the zone of operation of the United Forces. - But the most active and serious tests awaited these BBM already during the large-scale invasion of the Russian invaders - After the beginning of the large-scale Russian invasion, Kozak-2 armored vehicles are actively used in battles on all fronts. At the same time, as a result of the redistribution of Kozak-2 equipment, new units appeared in the arsenal - for example, in April 2023, two such armored vehicles were handed over to the 101st Territorial Defense Brigade. - However, even production vehicles need improvement. During operation, the military sees certain defects and expresses its wishes for modernization. And how was it, Professor, with this sample? — A significant drawback of the Kozak-2 armored car is the frame structure with the use of a civilian chassis (albeit with four-wheel drive). This limits the vehicle's ability to pass. Therefore, the next stage of the evolution of armored cars from their manufacturer was the creation of a car with a monocoque supporting body. This variant was called -Kozak-2M1-. It uses the same units (diesel engine, six-speed manual transmission) as on the Kozaku-2, but the undercarriage is completely redesigned. The suspension of all wheels became independent (its elements are supplied by a specialized company from the Czech Republic), and the ground clearance increased from 392 to 430 mm. At the same time, thanks to the rejection of the frame, the overall height of the car even decreased. -Kozak-2M1- differs from its predecessor in significantly better cross-country ability, smoother movement, higher speed of movement over rough terrain. The capacity of the armored car and armament correspond to the -Cossack-2-. The Kozak-2M1 prototype was first presented at the -Arms and Security-2016- exhibition in the fall of 2016. From October 2018 to July 2019, the machine underwent state tests, which were completed successfully. On April 3, 2020, by order of the Minister of Defense, the -Kozak-2M1- was adopted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is classified as an -armored combat wheeled vehicle- - BBKM. — And what decision did the military leadership make regarding this vehicle? — In January 2020, there were reports of an intention to purchase 140 Kozak-2M1 armored vehicles for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Ministry of Defense has officially announced that starting in 2020, the purchase of Kozak-2 and Varta vehicles will be stopped, and Kozak-2M1 will be purchased instead. Public opinion -expressed dissatisfaction- with the significantly increased price, which amounted to 10.5 million UAH (above, we indicated that -Kozak-2- cost 9.28 million UAH; for comparison, we cite the prices of other armored vehicles: -Varta- - 6.9 million , Novator 8.1 million, Oncilla 8.3 million). However, as it seems to me, an explanation can be found: unlike the Kozak-2 and Varta, the Kozak-2M1 armored car does not use a civilian -militarized- chassis, but is a special military design with much higher performance characteristics. In November 2021, tests of the Kozak-2M1 armored car equipped with a remotely controlled Sarp Dual module (with 12.7 and 7.62 mm machine guns) produced by the Turkish company Aselsan were completed. However, serial machines were delivered with an old version of armament - a -crown- type turret. — That is, literally on the eve of the great war, these machines entered the troops. Where exactly? - December 6, 2021. The first batch of Kozak-2M1 armored vehicles - 44 armored vehicles - was handed over to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 20 of them went to the 122nd separate battalion of the 81st OMBr, and the rest went to the Special Operations Forces: 14 to the 3rd Separate Special Purpose Regiment and 10 to the 73rd Naval Special Operations Center. Data on the supply of new batches of these machines after the start of the full-scale Russian invasion were, for obvious reasons, not published. There will be&#8230;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/13/kozaky-na-sluzhbi-v-sylah-oborony-ukrayiny-yak-stvoryuvaly-znanyj-u-vijskah-broneavtomobil/	2024-11-12T20:40:59-08:00

Representatives of -Zlaya Mavka- noted that they do not write on behalf of the movement to anyone in personal messages and do not do mass mailings. -Now we can definitely say that it was a coordinated and expensive attack. Various messengers, mail, posts on separatist pages (thank you, monkeys, who promptly sent all the screenshots and followed up, and who immediately understood that it was a fake). As we can see, this attempt was unsuccessful, but the level of it shows that they feel threatened by the very thought that we are here at the TOT and are doing non-violent resistance. We do not know what they wanted to achieve, scandal or discrediting of the Zla Mavka movement. But it's not interesting. We have to do our own thing,- they said on the official Telegram channel of the resistance movement. the Russians send similar messages to sow panic among Ukrainians, because in reality there are no plans for the mandatory mobilization of women into the ranks of the Armed Forces. Women's mobilization will continue to be voluntary.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/13/rosiyany-rozsylayut-ukrayinczyam-fejkovi-povidomlennya-vid-imeni-zloyi-mavky-shho-pyshut/	2024-11-12T20:07:23-08:00

The President of Ukraine thanked Canada for supporting NATO membership and allowing the use of long-...	He wrote about this in his Telegram channel. As Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported, he expressed his gratitude to Canada for comprehensive assistance, in particular for the principled support of the Ukrainian Victory Plan. Particular attention was paid to the issue of Ukraine's membership in NATO. The President emphasized the importance of continuing Canada's efforts to advocate for the first point of this plan — Ukraine receiving an invitation to the Alliance. He urged Justin Trudeau to continue working with allies both in multilateral meetings and in direct negotiations. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also thanked Canada for its public support for the permission to use long-range weapons for military purposes on the territory of Russia.
