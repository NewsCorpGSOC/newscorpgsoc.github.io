Digitization of the provision of the Armed Forces: the DOT presented the innovative DOT-Chain system	-If earlier the term of delivery of products could be up to two months, after the introduction of DOT-Chain, this term should be reduced by approximately four times,- said Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. -The digitization of procurement processes in defense is a strategic step in increasing the efficiency of supplies of all necessary military equipment.- -DOT-Shain is another important step towards a military that values ​​people, time and efficient processes instead of filling out hundreds of papers. Thanks to this system, the procurement of products will become clearer and more transparent, and the possibility of expanding it to other products will significantly simplify the logistics processes in the Defense Forces,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Digital Development, Digital Transformations and Digitalization. The creation of DOT-Chain has become the largest digital project in DOT. A team of IT specialists of the State Rear Operator worked on the development. -We were faced with the task of changing the old system so that the non-lethal support of the Armed Forces was more effective. Currently, DOT-Chain functionality extends to food. The DOT IT team has digitized the entire procurement process, from submitting product applications to issuing invoices and documents. In the future, the system can be quickly scaled to cover other categories of goods,- said Alyona Zhuzha, IT adviser of the DOT. 1. Digitized paper documents to optimize the work of the military. This is an important step towards abandoning the -paper army-. Instead of 30 thousand paperwork that the military had to process every week is now just a few clicks into the system. This significantly reduces the amount of work of salespeople. 2. Simplified the process of paying for goods. It will be four times faster, because expense invoices are immediately uploaded to the system, and DOT, having signatures from the military unit and the supplier, can immediately pay for the shipment. 3. Optimized data exchange. Information from the system is used, in particular, by the Ministry of Defense. This allows the military to adjust its needs according to the data aggregated by DOT-Chain: the number of requests, supply information, and the amounts accepted or not accepted by military units. 4. Adjusted the interaction between the parties involved in the process of providing the Armed Forces. In the DOT-Chain system, all procurement and supply documents are visible for each request. In fact, DOT becomes a third party that takes care of both procurement and suppliers and can quickly respond to changing requests from military units. State rear operator (DOT) is a procurement agency under the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, which provides the rear needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: food, property, fuel and lubricants. As reported by ArmiyaInform, a new model of food supply for the Armed Forces presented by the Procurement Agency of the Ministry of Defense -State Rear Operator-. As a pilot project, it will be operational in several regions of Ukraine as early as 2025.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/czyfrovizacziya-zabezpechennya-zbrojnyh-syl-dot-prezentuvav-innovaczijnu-systemu-dot-chain/	2024-09-11T03:38:08-07:00

From the contract to the front line — 20 days: whom the Russians throw into battle externally	The personnel of the occupiers involved in the hostilities characterized on the air of the telethon -Social News- by the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU Vitaly Sarantsev. — Among the Russian servicemen there are also former prisoners who were dragged into this war under coercion or deception. There are representatives of foreign countries. There are actually different sections of the population, he said. Russians also use propaganda and coercion to force residents of temporarily occupied territories to join the invading forces. The motivation of such soldiers is extremely low. — These people are not motivated, and in connection with this, we note the numerous refusals of personnel of the armed forces of the Russian Federation to perform tasks. This happens both on the Hlyboke-Lyptsi route and on other routes, in particular in the area of ​​the settlement of Tyche. The 136th separate motorized rifle brigade recently entered there. They started to perform tasks just a few weeks ago, but we are already seeing numerous refusals of personnel to perform both combat missions and special missions, the spokesman said. The occupiers refuse not only to storm the positions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, but also to perform tasks related to the adjustment and provision of logistics or the arrangement of fortifications. — This indicates that the Russians are gradually losing their offensive potential and they are forced to use anyone and any personnel in order to continue pushing into this war started by Russia, — explained Vitaly Sarantsev. At the same time, he noted that the enemy is actively replenishing not only tactical, but also operational and strategic reserves, paying the necessary attention to comprehensive training of servicemen. — Attention will be paid there to both combat training of personnel and, as they call it, military-political and ideological training. Therefore, we are not relaxing, we understand that, sooner or later, the enemy can supplement its current set of personnel with more trained military personnel, the military officer emphasized. Currently, the enemy does not feel the lack of personnel in the Kharkiv direction. — The forces and means that he currently maintains in our direction are sufficient for the enemy to continue to carry out active actions, to carry out offensive actions, to carry out assaults, to carry out sabotage and reconnaissance activities in non-attacked areas of the Russian-Ukrainian border with the aim of destabilizing the situation, with the purpose of carrying out intelligence tasks, Vitaliy Sarantsev reported. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast, enemy attack aircraft are sabotaging the orders of the command in whole groups and refusing to carry out their tasks, and also showed a video with captured fighters of the -Charter- brigade of the NGU by the Russian military, who said that signed a contract for military service on August 23 of this year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/vid-kontraktu-do-peredovoyi-20-dniv-kogo-rosiyany-kydayut-u-bij-eksternom/	2024-09-11T02:40:58-07:00

How to apply for family leave, read here . There are also certain requirements for registering a marriage in Diya. We will remind, previously Ukrainians had the opportunity to submit an online application for marriage registration. But the ceremony itself was still supposed to take place in DRACE. The only exception was military personnel. A simplified procedure was developed for them, which made it possible to get married remotely. That is, without the presence of the bride or groom. This procedure is valid even now, so a few words about it. What is needed? To submit an application to your immediate commander, in which to indicate information about yourself and your significant other - surname, first name and patronymic, date of birth, citizenship and chosen surname, if you wish to change it. Next, the commander must send an application to the DRATS to which the serviceman submitted the application. The fact of marriage registration is certified by an act, which is drawn up without the physical presence of one or both brides and grooms. However, they must be currently connected to the video procedure. The deed record of marriage is drawn up on the day of receipt of the application for the registration of a marriage or deed by the DRATSS department. This option also remains valid, but the new service in Diya greatly simplifies the whole procedure. As reported by ArmiyaInform, during the beta testing of the service the first , who married in this way, was a military serviceman.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/shlyub-u-diyi-yak-vijskovomu-odruzhytysya-onlajn/	2024-09-10T20:12:29-07:00
How the world helps Ukraine with the treatment and rehabilitation of wounded soldiers	Vadym Svyridenko, the adviser to the President of Ukraine on issues of rehabilitation of combatants, told about this during an interview with ArmiyaInform. — After the return of the fighters, we ask for their feedback: how do they like the prostheses, how was the rehabilitation, what did they learn there. And I am very glad that our rehabilitation and prosthetics are not behind in the world. And partner countries are already contacting us, interested in our experience. Because our military, like no one else in the world, faces such combat injuries. And we know what it is and how to deal with it. That is why specialists, for example, surgeons from Canada or America, are already coming to us. They, among other things, helped perform operations for facial injuries, says Vadym Svyridenko. We tell you more about how partner countries help our wounded defenders to recover their health and return to action. This country has an extensive network of cities and institutions where Ukrainian servicemen undergo treatment and rehabilitation. As of January 2024, 1,044 victims, including 735 military personnel, were evacuated to Germany. Also, 125 children with oncological diseases are being treated in the Federal Republic of Germany. In particular, the -Sharite- clinic accepts Ukrainians for treatment - military personnel with severe burns and mine-explosive injuries as a result of Russian military aggression are also treated here. In April 2024, another 13 Ukrainian defenders with amputations left Kyiv for Berlin. In a German military hospital, they are to be fitted with innovative prostheses. In general, German specialists expressed their readiness to provide prosthetics to 60 Ukrainian military personnel in Berlin. Our servicemen are also treated and rehabilitated in the city of Wiesbaden - here they have the opportunity to fully recover and receive the highest level of care. Poland has been helping with military rehabilitation since 2014. Ukrainian soldiers, in particular, are patients of the -Good Brother- rehabilitation and recreation center. In this institution, they can undergo a course of rehabilitation and recovery. Several hundred soldiers have already taken advantage of this opportunity. -Despite the fact that my right leg is completely iron, and the left one is missing about 75% of tendons and 50% of muscles, Polish rehabilitators taught me how to properly control my body. And not only did I return to a more or less normal life, but I even performed tasks in the area where the OOS was held,- Lt. Col. Ihor Chuprun, who underwent rehabilitation in Poland, recalled at one time. Already after the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the assistance of the Republic of Poland in matters of rehabilitation and treatment of military personnel only increased. In particular, Poland offered Ukraine to provide treatment and rehabilitation to 2,500 wounded Ukrainian servicemen. In addition, at the Military Medical Institute in Warsaw, Ukrainian specialists are trained in the field of rehabilitation of the wounded, as well as diagnosis and treatment of people who have suffered war injuries. Here, they improve their knowledge of accompanying patients during rehabilitation and modern methods of prosthetics. In Spain, there is a whole program of treatment and rehabilitation of Ukrainian servicemen and veterans who were injured in the war. In addition, this country also helps in the organization of recreation for Ukrainian children affected by the war. The country -stepped in- in aid from the first days of a full-scale invasion. In particular, wounded Ukrainian border guards (about 30 servicemen) who were wounded in 2022 in the first days of the enemy's invasion were treated in Spain. Our defenders also receive rehabilitation and treatment in the military hospital of the city of Zaragoza. This Orad y Gajías General Defense Hospital is one of two controlled by the Spanish Ministry of Defense. And he started receiving our fighters as early as 2022. The Netherlands also operates a rehabilitation program for Ukrainian military personnel. More than one group of servicemen used it. And in the Netherlands, Ukrainian military personnel undergoing rehabilitation and volunteers assemble drones for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Volunteers look for funding and order parts, while the military assembles the drones. Professional instructors help beginners. The finished device is thoroughly tested before being sent to Ukraine. From June 2022, the French Ministry of Defense will organize assistance to the Ukrainian wounded. One of the facilities that contributes to the treatment and rehabilitation of our soldiers in France is Percy Hospital. In March 2024, it was known that wounded army personnel were being taken to French civilian and military hospitals in the Paris region and Grand Est. As of spring 2024, there were more than two dozen groups of Ukrainian military personnel who arrived in France for treatment. Back in 2018, Bulgaria launched a two-year rehabilitation program for soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who were wounded, injured and maimed during hostilities in eastern Ukraine. In addition, Bulgaria had the status of a leading country within the NATO Trust Fund project in the field of medical rehabilitation in Ukraine. Our wounded defenders are receiving rehabilitation services at Kaleroya Military Medical Hospital in Hisar. Indications for physiotherapy in Kaleroya are injuries of the musculoskeletal system, injuries of the peripheral nervous system of the upper and lower extremities. And in 2020, the Project of Medical Rehabilitation of Ukrainian Veterans in Bulgaria was launched. Wounded Ukrainian military personnel (both those undergoing military service and those on reserve/retirement) and civilian personnel of the security and defense sector were sent for treatment. Expenses related to the procedures and accommodation of persons in the clinic were provided by the Bulgarian side, and international and local transportation, medical insurance and food for this period were provided by the NATO Trust Fund in Ukraine in the field of medical rehabilitation. The Baltic countries are friendly to Ukraine and our wounded defenders. For example, in April 2024, Lithuania started a special program for the rehabilitation of the Ukrainian military - about 15 million euros were allocated to Ukraine. These funds should be directed directly to the reconstruction of hospitals and the training of specialists. And the Latvian Support Fund for Ukraine, founded in 2014, collects donations for the treatment and rehabilitation of wounded Ukrainian servicemen, is an intermediary between the state, Latvian clinics and Ukrainian wounded who need help. Thus, as of the end of August 2024, more than 540 Ukrainian servicemen who were wounded in the war with the Russian Federation were treated in Latvia. At the beginning of June, the government allocated 184,000 euros for the rehabilitation of the soldiers of the Armed Forces. Estonia is not lagging behind - as of June 2024, it was known that more than 240 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine had already completed a rehabilitation course in Estonia. America supported Ukrainian wounded defenders even before the large-scale Russian invasion. For example, in 2019, the US government allocated about 5 million dollars and accepted 10 seriously wounded Ukrainian servicemen for treatment. For this purpose, the Americans have identified 10 hospitals that will receive Ukrainian servicemen for free treatment. It was then known that the average cost of treating one, as Americans calculated, is half a million dollars. And in December 2022, in New York, just in time for the Day of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the House of Heroes was opened for the rehabilitation and prosthetics of Ukrainian soldiers who lost their limbs during the war. The house is located in the Staten Island area, not far from the ocean. Oleksandr Rubtsov, head of the charity organization Kind Deeds, who owns a real estate company, implements the rehabilitation program for the wounded. According to him, he rented a house for this purpose and is accumulating donor funds for the further rehabilitation of Ukrainian soldiers. In addition, American specialists come to Ukraine and help in the treatment of our military. So, in 2023, American microsurgeons operated on wounded soldiers in Uzhhorod. According to Andrii Novak Transcarpathian Regional Clinical Hospital, this is the second visit of microsurgeons from the USA. During the visit, American doctors performed 7 operations on military personnel: it is about eliminating post-traumatic defects of bones and soft tissues of arms and legs. Canada is also helping our wounded defenders get stronger and healthier. Thus, in 2023, Ukraine and Canada signed an agreement on medical partnership in the field of mental health and military rehabilitation. According to this document, the Ukrainian Center for Mental Health and Rehabilitation -Lisova Polyana- has a sister company, the -Atlas- Institute of Veterans and Their Families. Both medical institutions specialize in the field of mental recovery and military rehabilitation. But this country helped our wounded even before the large-scale invasion. For example, in 2019, a project on the rehabilitation of patients with severe neurotraumas was implemented in the Rivne Region with the participation of Canadian specialists. And the Canadian instructors from the UNIFAIR training mission, who teach the Ukrainian military to provide first aid in case of wounds and injuries, have already become a familiar story for us.

The next conquerors of Tysa did not even have time to get their feet wet	About informs the State Border Service of Ukraine. It is noted that the detainees were residents of Vinnytsia and Ivano-Frankivsk regions. A 60-year-old resident of Nizhnya Apsha in Transcarpathia drove them to the river in his vehicle. According to a previous agreement, the Transcarpathian was supposed to assist the Vinnytsia and the Ivano-Frankivsk in illegally crossing the Ukrainian-Romanian border. Dilock planned to earn 15 thousand dollars from his -clients-. Despite the fact that the Transcarpathian tried to escape, the border guards also detained him. It was possible to expose the illegal device thanks to information provided in advance by operatives of the detachment. Upon detection of signs of the crime provided for in Art. 332 KKU, the border guards informed the police officers. Currently, operatives of the Mukachevo detachment are establishing all the circumstances of the offense and the persons involved in the organization of the scheme of illegal transportation of men of draft age. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces or recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/chergovi-pidkoryuvachi-tysy-ne-vstygly-navit-nig-namochyty/	2024-09-10T11:35:30-07:00

Intelligence officers reported to the President about opportunities and threats for Ukraine	This was announced by the head of state on September 10 in an evening address. According to him, they see the steps that Moscow is planning and will act accordingly - just as tough as it should be for the sake of Ukraine. -And I want to say now to everyone in the world who still wants to somehow help Putin: we will do everything not just to protect our state and people, but for the real consolidation of the world for strong responses to the instigation of war or any attempt to prolong the war,- he said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He emphasized that Ukraine's priority is a just peace. -And to every missile, to every drone, and to all the enemy's steps, to every attempt to make this war longer and more brutal, there will inevitably be a response from the world.

The accomplice of the enemy turned out to be a resident of Kherson. After the capture of the regional center, she got a job at the occupation -electoral office-. Being part of the pseudo-institution, the woman was a member of the so-called mobile voting groups, which went around the homes of local residents and agitated them to support the fake referendum. At the same time, the collaborator required people to sign the -ballots on joining- the region to the Russian Federation. After the liberation of the regional center, the criminal remained in the city, where she tried to -lie down- and avoid justice. The security service documented the criminal actions of the suspect and detained her. The perpetrator faces up to 10 years in prison with confiscation of property. Complex measures were carried out by SBU employees in the Kherson region together with the National Police under the procedural guidance of the prosecutor's office.

The IOU and NATO delegations discussed speeding up the promised aid to Ukraine from the allies	About this informs September 10 Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. NATO Assistant Secretary General for Operations Thomas Hoffus and the new head of the NATO Representation in Ukraine Patrick Turner visited the capital. The main topics of discussion were the need for progress on interoperability with NATO and the acceleration of promised aid from allies. The proposal discussed the use of Ukrainian suppliers and manufacturers to speed up the supply of property and support the economy of Ukraine. -We are glad to welcome you to Ukraine, which demonstrates your involvement and interest in our victory. But we have to raise the issue of the fulfillment of promises and the operational logistics of helping our military,- said Oleksandr Balanutsa, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for European Integration. He emphasized that what was promised for September should be in Ukraine in September. Sticking to schedules is important on the battlefield. The parties discussed the implementation of a number of joint projects with NATO - NATO's initiative to support Ukraine in security issues and NSATU training, the Joint Center for Analysis, Training and Education (JATEC) and the implementation of projects of the NATO agency for support and supply of NSPA. The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Stanislav Heyder, thanked for all the assistance provided by NATO to Ukraine. He also called for speeding up the implementation of projects within NSPA. -Unfortunately, the speed of implementation of NSPA projects, if we are not talking about fuel and turnstiles, remains at an extremely low level,- said Stanislav Heyder. NATO Assistant Secretary General for Operations, Thomas Hoffus, also introduced the new head of the NATO Representation in Ukraine, Patrick Turner, and once again assured of unwavering support for Ukraine. -We want close cooperation to increase the level of compatibility, progress and Ukraine's entry into NATO. Ready to act more actively from our side in matters of assistance from allies and consultations where necessary,- assured Patrick Turner. The NATO delegation was briefed on the operational situation on the battlefield, needs and intelligence data on the enemy, to which Ukraine should respond asymmetrically. Expanding the geography of airspace violations of NATO countries is a problem that requires a bold solution, which is why the Minister of Defense of Ukraine previously initiated discussions on the creation of a -humanitarian shield- for critical infrastructure facilities. As reported by ArmyInform, as Senior Representative, Patrick Turner lead PNU and take over the focus of NATO interaction with the Ukrainian authorities in Kyiv.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/delegacziyi-mou-i-nato-obgovoryly-pryshvydshennya-obiczyanoyi-dopomogy-vid-soyuznykiv/	2024-09-10T09:50:14-07:00
As much as I fight, there is not a single fragment in me - the story of the soldier Fartovoy, who fo...	About the soldier was told on September 10 Armed forces. Such a call sign was given to him by a sergeant, also a marine, at the training center. The military man says that at that time there was no special reason for the call sign -Fartovy-. However, the nickname did become prophetic. The boy signed a contract with the army at the age of 22. It was January 2023. Fartovy shared a video from this -celebration-, when his brothers greeted him just in the positions. The guy was prompted to sign the contract by a video from TikTok. -I watched the video of the Third Assault. The boys are having a good time like this. I wanted too. This is their form, the ARKs&#8230; But, in fact, it turned out to be a completely different story in the army: -kalash- and -pixel- uniform, - smiles Fartovy. The soldier reinforced the status of a forward in battle: -As much as I fight, there is not a single fragment in me. A few contusions only, but that's it. I think I have this fart just because of the call sign. Near Urozhany, when a shell flew into the trenches, there was a boy near me, 200, and I just had a severe contusion. Then there was a direct hit into the trench. Well, there was a drop from a drone in Krynky. Two meters in front of me. Everyone around has 300, but I have nothing,- said Fartovy. For -Fartovy- month, he underwent basic military training at the training center. After that, he joined the ranks of the 505th OBMP. Already in the battalion, he studied for another three months and went through combat training: he practiced shooting at the range, learned the tactics of fighting from his more experienced comrades. After completing the training, as the commander of the grenade launcher unit, -Fartovoy- was sent to the Donetsk direction. Subsequently, he fought in the Zaporozhye direction and again returned to the Donetsk direction. And then there was the most difficult aspect of the front for -Fartovoy- among all the places he visited - Krynka. -The worst thing there is the forest. Because when you go and storm the landing, you have 12 enemies, well, at most, one or two of them can jump out somewhere in the field, and in Krynky, you go into the forest and they can run out from any side. Because of that, it was much harder there. Well, they had a lot of equipment there. Tanks, armored personnel carriers were rolling out on us&#8230; They had a lot of equipment there. But a lot of their equipment was stolen there by our FPV-schneiders,- recalls Fartovyi. Currently, -Fartovoy- performs the duties of chief sergeant of the fire support company. In order to enter the position fully, he still has sergeant courses ahead of him. At the same time, the soldier trains new arrivals to the battalion of fighters in the internal training center. ArmyInform told the story of a fighter who, despite the decision of the VLK, remained in the DSHV. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/skilky-voyuyu-zhodnogo-ulamka-v-meni-nemaye-istoriya-bijczi-fartovogo-yakyj-72-dni-byvsya-u-krynkah/	2024-09-10T09:37:37-07:00
The 12th Banderiv Readings will be held in Kyiv. ArmyInform is a media partner	This was reported by the organizer of the readings, sergeant of the fire support company of the 5th separate assault regiment, director of the USSD National Center Yuriy -Mamai- Syrotyuk. -During the conference, it is planned to revive the destroyed, erased and forbidden history of the long-standing resistance to Moscow imperialism of the peoples enslaved by Russia. Each people, nation, on whose land the Moscow occupier came, did some part of the more than a century of resistance to the Moscow empire. For centuries, Moscow destroyed the disobedient, encouraged traitors, and rewrote history. The time has come for every people in this prison of nations to find out -who they are, by whom, for what they are imprisoned- and to make their own decision - whether to die in Russian captivity, being a blind tool in the hands of the Kremlin, powerless on their land, deprived of language, history, identity, or to remember the glory of their ancestors and to fight for freedom,- noted Yuriy Syrotyuk. The Russian-Ukrainian war opened up a unique opportunity for peoples enslaved by Russia to throw off the yoke of Moscow colonialism and imperialism, and finally become the masters of their own destiny on their own land. The organizers of the 12th Banderiv readings invite researchers of Russian colonialism and the struggle against it, as well as active representatives of national liberation formations of peoples enslaved by Russia, to participate in the conference. The second panel will be dedicated to the actual prospects of the national liberation struggle. Based on the results of the readings, an electronic version of the participants' speeches will be prepared. As part of the XII Banderiv readings, it is traditionally planned to hold a Youth Essay Competition on the specified topic. In addition, on the eve of the event, the book -Involuntary Accession: The History of the Liberation Struggle of Peoples Enslaved by Russia- will be published in Ukrainian, English and an electronic version in the language of the occupiers. The media partner of -Banderivskyi readings- is the -ArmiyaInform- information agency. The Bander Readings project was founded in 2014 at the height of the Revolution of Dignity as an intellectual discussion of Bander's ideas and the creation of a vision of the Ukrainian state. It traditionally takes place in the first days of February at the time of the creation of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in 1929 as a movement that set the goal of establishing an independent Ukrainian cathedral state, its preservation and development. Past 11th Bander readings -The Liquidation of the Russian Empire- were held on February 10, 2024. It was possible to hold the conference in a new format and to publish the book -Liquidation of the Russian Empire- in English and Ukrainian, which has already been printed in three editions and has become a notable phenomenon among research on this topic. More details about the terms of participation and the possibility to support the project are available on the organizers' page.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/u-kyyevi-vidbudutsya-xii-banderivski-chytannya-armiyainform-mediapartner/	2024-09-10T09:17:49-07:00

The soldier's story was made public on September 10 by the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -I commanded a combat position that was semi-surrounded for nine days. Every day we repulsed several assaults of enemy infantry, which climbed on us as if possessed. To say that it was difficult then is an understatement,- recalls Serhiy. During that situation, several of his subordinates were wounded, and he himself received a concussion. However, despite this, and artillery and mortar shelling, which practically did not subside, and drops from enemy drones, the paratroopers did not leave their position, waiting for help. The brave soldier says that one of those days he was very surprised by a Russian who tried to storm the paratroopers in a slightly strange way. -A man in a black Adidas tracksuit, wearing sneakers and armed with a machine gun ran towards us. There was no helmet, no bulletproof vest, no first-aid kit, no other military equipment on him,- Serhiy is surprised. The Ukrainian paratroopers then decided that in this way, the Russian was trying to make it easier for himself to advance to their positions. But the soldiers did not have time to think for a long time, why he decided that it would help him. Therefore, they destroyed this -experimental athlete- with accurate fire. As well as other enemy fighters who climbed into their positions. Serhii notes that participation in active combat operations, when the situation on the battlefield changes very rapidly, has taught him to often make important decisions independently and act without waiting for the commander's order. -Once, during the shelling, I saw that an artillery shell hit the house where our soldiers were staying. There was no time to delay, so my partner and I, without waiting for the shelling to end, ran to help our people,- Serhii recalls. It turned out that the soldiers risked in vain: after freeing the entrance to the basement of the destroyed house, filled with broken brick fragments, the paratroopers rescued four brothers who were blocked in the underground room. -Who knows how the situation would have turned out for the boys if we had waited for the next team,- the fighter ponders. Serhiy went through so much in the war that one gets the impression that he has been serving for a long time, but this is not the case. The man joined the army in February 2024. Until then, he worked as a construction worker. He says that in his 43 years of life, he has never been in the army, but having joined the ranks of the paratroopers, having passed the appropriate training and having been in battles, he feels confident. To those who are still hesitating, he says not to be afraid. -Prepare physically and mentally. Everything else will be taught to you - no one will send you to the front line without training,- concludes Serhiy. His wife and three children are waiting for the paratrooper at home with Peremoha.

Commanded a missile attack on Okhmatdyt: the suspicion was reported to the Russian general	About this informs September 10 SBU. He turned out to be Lieutenant General Serhii Kobylash, who at that time held the position of long-range aviation commander of the Air Force of the Russian Aerospace Forces. Subsequently, after the strike on Okhmatdyt, he was promoted and appointed commander of the Russian Air Force. This was announced by Deputy Head of the SBU Serhii Naumyuk during a working meeting with Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan and Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin. -During the period of the investigation, the SBU, together with the Prosecutor General's Office, carried out tremendous work. We interrogated 112 victims and 50 eyewitnesses, conducted explosive, forensic and other examinations, analyzed videos from surveillance cameras,- Serhiy Naumyuk said. As the investigation established, by order of Kobylash, on July 8, 2024 at 9 a.m. 15 minutes a Russian Tu-95MS missile-carrying bomber launched an Kh-101 missile at a children's hospital in Kyiv. According to the Deputy Head of the Security Service of Ukraine, the 22nd Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Division of the Long-range Aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces carried out the shelling of Okhmatdyt. -It was established that the enemy plane took off from an airfield near the Russian city of Olenegorsk, and the missile was launched over the Saratov region of the Russian Federation at a distance of almost 600 km from the border of Ukraine,- the report said. From the territory of Russia, the Kh-101 entered the airspace of our country in the region of Chernihiv Oblast and began to maneuver, constantly changing its flight path through the territories of four regions. This indicates that the missile was programmed to maximally -bypass- Ukrainian air defense and further hit the medical facility. At approximately 10:45, a Russian X-101 hit the department of intensive and efferent therapy of acute and chronic intoxications of the Okhmatdyt hospital. At the scene of the incident, law enforcement officers found the remains of an enemy missile with markings indicating that it was manufactured on the basis of the Russian Raduga design center in the second quarter of 2024. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed Kobylash about suspicion in absentia under Part 2 of Art. 28, part 2 of Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (violation of the laws and customs of war, combined with intentional murder, committed by a group of persons according to a prior conspiracy). -Kobylash is currently suspected of committing other war crimes in Ukraine. In particular, attacks on civilian energy infrastructure were carried out under his leadership in 2022-2023. In March 2024, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Kobylash precisely for these war crimes,- emphasized Serhiy Naumyuk. Since the perpetrator is on the territory of Russia, comprehensive measures are underway to bring him to justice for crimes against our state. We will remind you that on July 8, Russia carried out a massive attack on Ukraine. The enemy fired about 40 rockets of various types.

15 km per day through enemy territory and the myth of strong intelligence of the Russian Federation:...	Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmyInform about this: -The Kursk operation is actually very, very successful. I would call it (an operation. — Ed.) global order. And it is necessary to understand why it happened. The first point: this is really an attempt to divert the enemy's forces and means from the main Donetsk direction. Only at first glance, this issue is unrealized. But in reality it is not so. Why? Because the combat army reserves are between 10 and 15 percent. So, if the enemy has 600,000 personnel along the battle line, then the mandatory reserve: 60,000-70,000 is still engaged. This is a very important moment. Next, this is a completely and definitively dispelled myth that one cannot enter the territory of the enemy, because, they say, it is a nuclear country, and the apocalypse will definitely happen. However, the apocalypse did not happen. And the most important goal, and it is, in fact, very promising: sooner or later it will reach the negotiation process. We are well aware that there will be no direct conversation between Ukraine and Russia. But according to the grain agreement, when we, Ukrainians, signed certain agreements with the Turks and the UN, and then Russia signed certain agreements with the Turks and the UN, then such a scenario could happen. And at this point we have to have a very, very strong position-. If for the enemy, Donetsk region and Luhansk region are of principle, then Kherson region and Zaporizhia region are not so principled. And according to the principle of such exchange — i.e., we return Kursk Oblast to them, and they return Zaporizhia and Kherson Oblast to us — such a scenario is quite possible. From the point of view of the organization's tactics and strategy, the operation is brilliant. Why is it shiny? Because it is breakthrough. In the first days of the operation, our forces moved at a speed of up to 10 km per day, and in some locations up to 15. I must remind you that the enemy covered almost the entire dry the weather passes several kilometers in the direction of Pokrovsk. Therefore, our speed is incredible. And most importantly: there is a myth that Russia has very strong intelligence. If the Russians could not calculate and see such an operation, then their intelligence is very, very bad. Any war, and especially the current one, has only three main laws. This is the concentration of the enemy's forces and means, the coordinated work of the military branches, and the third law, it was fully implemented here and very qualitatively, this is the hidden management of the troops. Being able to assemble several shock combat brigades, move them efficiently, provide them with equipment and break through the border — this is really a sign of the great quality of our operational art.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/15-km-na-dobu-vorozhoyu-terytoriyeyu-ta-mif-pro-sylnu-rozvidku-rf-ekspert-pro-blyskuchu-operacziyu-syl-oborony-na-kurshhyni/	2024-09-09T20:30:37-07:00
Combat took 14 tankers and two marines out of the encirclement: the story of lieutenant colonel Grud...	&#8230;On February 23, 2022, a battalion of a separate tank brigade named after Kostyantyn Pestushka was raised due to an alarm, and Oleg took it to a designated concentration area. - To be honest, there was nothing to indicate that a large-scale invasion would begin. The relevant order was received, we went out according to the training plans. But on the morning of February 24, around 4 a.m., the connection was dead. Reports began from posts that explosions were heard and bright flashes were seen at the base camp. In addition, we used the Viraj-tablet air defense system. The operator called me to see what was happening, and there were about 30 planes on the radar. We understood that a serious war had begun, the officer recalls. Around 10 o'clock Oleg Grudzevych's tank battalion reached the border in the Volnovakha district. There, the tankers found the first hours of a large-scale invasion. It was very hot near Volnovakha - the Russians broke through the defense of one of the infantry battalions. — Our unit suffered its first losses there — the tank crew was killed. We went away with hard fights - pearls scattered like mad. According to intelligence data, there were convoys of 70 units, and 50, 30, 20. I remember how successfully one crew - an officer's crew - worked. The thing is that Major Serhii Brovkin, the deputy commander, was there for the gunner, and Captain Pavlo Grelya for the tank commander. So they destroyed two BMP-3 with one shot. The armor-piercing projectile pierced both cars of the Rashists, and it was so successful that they exploded one after another, inflating like bubbles. And the column did not even stop, the Rashists simply did not understand what had happened, says Oleg Grudzevych. He remembered the first days of the large-scale invasion as continuous battles, maneuvers, retreats, counterattacks, and at the same time the realization that the Rashists could be beaten. And he still cannot forget how the local population helped the Ukrainian soldiers. When our tanks simply ran out of fuel on February 27, volunteers from one of the settlements, which is currently temporarily captured, came to help. Farmers shared the fuel, pouring 200 liters into each tank. As Oleg recalls, he managed to gather his units, and on February 28, the tankers entered Mariupol on the territory of the Azovmash plant, where, together with the marines, they began fighting for the city. Oleg tells about those battles calmly, as if it were about ordinary work: - The schedule of the orcs was like a working day. It's dawn - they're on the move, small arms are working. It begins to pout - shooting battles stop, artillery and aviation begin to work. On the 13th, a mechvod (mechanic-driver. — Ed.) died. We tried to protect the team link, but still they had to take risks, there was simply no other strength. Already on the 2nd or 3rd day of the fighting, we moved to the basement. Battalions were still stationed around the city perimeter, tanks were moving out, there were constant skirmishes, Russian artillery and aviation were already in full swing. They calculated the location of headquarters on -Azovstal- and -Azovmash-, and aviation worked on them. Mines and -Hradi- were already flying to the plant. The Azov people came to us and said: -We don't understand their mathematics: 50 people attack every day from one direction. 20-30 turn around, they will lose a lot of equipment and tanks. The next morning it's 50 again.- The fighting continued at this pace until the end of March. On March 15, the tankers ran out of drinking water and food. Oleg thinks, then continues: - We started drinking water from the fire-fighting ponds that were at the factory. Water and green, but there was no way out. There was also no supply of ammunition and food, later we began to count literally every projectile for tanks, sukhpai. The ring was getting tighter every day, we were moving away little by little. Orcs were literally pelting us with cannon fodder. We had no news or communication, but we stood on the perimeter of the plant, holding Azovmash - 800 meters, in the roundabout. I had 2 combat-ready tanks left, mine and one more, and 2 or 3 vehicles were from the 36th brigade. They went to work in pairs. Scatter on all sides of the pearl. All the anti-aircraft gunners and tankers I had were already working as infantrymen, going on 8-hour shifts. I remember how on April 5, an enemy tank broke into the territory of -Azovmash-, but it was knocked out. Every evening, as soon as it got dark, the Russians came out and began to -pour- everywhere with a double frenzy. We understood that we would not last another week. Oleg recalls that the first attempt to break through the encirclement was on April 10. They tried to break through the territory of the Ilyich plant, but, unfortunately, the attempt was unsuccessful. The next day, another breakout attempt, this time successful. Two tanks that remained from Oleg's battalion with the remains of shells: one had about 20 shells in the conveyor, the other tank had 15. The unit left the factory. — Our plan was as follows: to the road, if there is an opportunity, we break through on equipment. When the tanks stop, then we blow up the equipment, and then we move on foot, in groups of 10-15 people. The connection was reset and checked. On April 11, around midnight, they started moving. Next to my tank was a -motolyga- (light armored multi-purpose transporter. - Ed.), people were sitting on it, including the wounded. I tell the officer that I will divert fire on myself. And I will not leave them alone. I give tasks to the commander, the mechanic. We were lucky that it was raining that night and there were no drones. I say to the commander of another unit that was with us: -While we are shooting for 30-40 minutes, stay a kilometer away from me. You see the transfer of fire - move behind us to the distance that we have advanced. And this is how we move - from border to border.- &#8230;The breakthrough was frantic - tankers opened fire, burned Russian equipment, the infantry also did their job. Then the tanks ran out of fuel and stopped. There were no shells either. Tankers took out night lights, radios, sights and destroyed everything they could. They took with them small arms, ammunition, grenades, remnants of sukhpay, water. They moved behind the rear of the Rashists. Today, few people can imagine what it is like to move in the enemy's environment. Expect a shot, a rupture, a mine detonation, a random meeting with the occupiers or local traitors at any moment. Oleg speaks sparingly about the exit. — Before the breakthrough, thanks to Starlink, I downloaded an offline map and took a normal one. We knew roughly where our units would be and how far we had to go. It was 138 kilometers straight, and all 175 to bypass the Rashisti. They planned the movement as follows: we walk at night, warm up at the same time, and hide somewhere during the day. The only thing that bothered me a lot was the cold. Although, perhaps, it saved us in the end, because the enemy also did not want to peek somewhere in such abominable weather. On the first day, the main thing was to get as far away from the abandoned equipment as possible. Population centers were bypassed. But we went to one, Znamenivka, not far from Anatolia - there was a bridge over the river near the reservoir. We came across a Russian DRG near the bridge. We -put down- one occupant, ran across that concrete bridge and lay down in a rather large landing. From 8 in the morning to 9 in the evening, they stayed in that landing. The opponent was afraid to comb her. For 4 hours, they drove next to each other, released only a few queues in our direction. Then we got somewhere - they probably thought that we had gone along the creek. We were very tired, because we had been out for the 3rd day. So, after resting a little in that landing, they filled up with water and moved along the river. There they ran into another group of Rashists. There was a short fight, one of them was definitely -killed-, but a bullet or two hit our fighter in the backpack. The soldier is running, the backpack is on fire, I shout to him: -Drop that backpack!-, and he: -Go away, there are grenades!- — -All the more, throw him to hell!-. He tore off that backpack and threw it away. We then broke away and went for several days without fire contact. Somewhere on the 6th or 7th day, they finished off the remaining sukhpai, began to look for sorrel, rummaged through garbage cans - they thought they would find something. On one of the days we almost got caught. We leave the next landing - and here our soldier noticed a tent 20 meters away, and some antennas there. They passed 300-400 meters. In the morning I already say: -Let's not go anywhere, because our legs hurt, our stomachs hurt, it's raining.- There are still about 40 kilometers to the front. Next is a quarry with sand, they thought to wait in it, and there were 20 Urals with Zetkas. We hear - somewhere behind, the generator started up, 400 meters away. I think they have come. It saved that the weather was bad, it was raining. So they lay near the quarry. Orcs were loaded with sand, no one else was seen until evening. Then they went very carefully - I sent a patrol of 2-3 people ahead. At 500 meters, if clear, they turned back, and we continued. Walked all the time with their phones turned off - I warned them to charge the power banks before leaving, and everyone turned off their phones except for me. I say - if I see someone's phone, I will shoot my knees! Of course, I wouldn't have done that, but no one was using the phones, because the Russians track cellular communications clearly. About 15 kilometers before the collision line, I see one -Life- strip appeared on my phone, but I couldn't make a call. On the 9th day, 2 -sticks- appeared on the phone. He called the brigadier general, he didn't recognize us at first, then he was happy. I got together with the unit commander who was ahead of us, and for the last 12 hours he helped us go. I remember how he tells us that there is a small area that will have to be run. And our legs are no longer carrying us, and our stomachs hurt, I was vomiting blood. The guys took my machine gun and backpack from me, they say: -We will deliver them, your task is to prove us.- And so they came&#8230; They cried because they almost didn't believe that we would make it. They have experienced so much&#8230; They came, fell down, we were given a cigarette and water to drink. He called his commander back, the next day our brigade came to pick us up. There were 16 people with me. Two of them are from the 36th Brigade. For this breakthrough from Mariupol and exit, in fact, he received the -Golden Star-. I do what I can, no more and no less. At the moment, we are temporarily on recovery, soon they will give a new command, because the Rashists must be beaten in order to return home as soon as possible. In addition to the -Golden Star- of the Hero of Ukraine, which was personally awarded to Oleh Grudzevych by the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi during a visit to the unit, for the battles near Volnovakha and Mariupol, the officer was also awarded two orders of Bohdan Khmelnytsky III and II degrees.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/kombat-vyviv-z-otochennya-14-tankistiv-i-dvoh-morpihiv-istoriya-pidpolkovnyka-grudzevycha/	2024-09-09T20:19:14-07:00
-Dirty bomb-, biolaboratories and what are the Chechens doing here: what is the Kremlin mouthpiece c...	During the meeting of the Ninth Eastern Economic Forum on September 5, he again changed the goal of the war against Ukraine and stated that the main task of -his- remains the capture of the Donetsk region. He also called it a -sacred duty- of Russian soldiers to retake part of Russia's Kursk region, which is currently controlled by the Ukrainian military. Putin declared: -The invasion of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation into the border regions of the Russian Federation failed.- And this is despite the fact that the Armed Forces continue to perform all the assigned tasks in Kurshchyna. The Russian dictator also hinted that Russia did not refuse negotiations with Ukraine, but on the basis of -documents- agreed in Istanbul in 2022. It will be recalled that at that time the Russians demanded the actual capitulation of Ukraine. In the annexes to the Istanbul Agreements, Russia prescribed a number of restrictions for Ukraine, while no restrictions were foreseen for the Russians. This was said by the former US Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland. -The Istanbul agreements prohibited Ukraine from having some weapons systems, so, in essence, Ukraine would be weakened from a military point of view, while there were no similar restrictions on the part of Russia: Russia was not required to withdraw, it was not necessary to have a buffer zone on the border, Russia was not it was forbidden to keep any weapons on the border. -Ukraine felt that this could be a trap, so after consulting with its allies, it withdrew from the negotiations,- said Victoria Nuland. Putin could get a castrated demilitarized country for nothing. He obviously liked this, so now Putin only creates the appearance of readiness for negotiations, and all he wanted and wants is the surrender of Ukraine. For this purpose, the Russian dictator is manipulating the ephemeral -Istanbul Agreements- in the Russian interpretation. Ukraine needs a just peace, according to the norms of international law, according to the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which the head of the Kremlin constantly avoids. In addition, during his speech at the forum, Putin continued to say that the current authorities of Ukraine are not interested in ending hostilities because they do not want to hold presidential elections. He was supported by the dictator's spokesman, Dmytro Peskov, who declared: -Zelenskyi's regime is de jure illegitimate, although in fact it continues its activities.- We will remind that, according to the Constitution of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi remains the legitimate head of state and will exercise his powers until the moment of taking office as the new President, whom Ukrainians will elect in the elections. Zakharova, the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, was also noted for another batch of disinformation published on the air. She stated: -Ukrainian criminals guilty of serious international crimes against their own and Russian citizens, as well as their accomplices, will be brought to court and they will suffer the deserved punishment.- As is known, during the war, Ukraine strictly adheres to all international conventions and rules of warfare, unlike Russia, which constantly violates them. Zakharova also emphasized once again that the alleged main customer and instigator of the aggression of the -Kyiv regime- is the -collective West-. The statements of the Russian propagandist are populist in nature and do not have any legal basis. In addition, they cannot withstand any criticism and have no limits to cynicism. It was Russia that attacked a sovereign state, kills Ukrainians every day and destroys entire cities. There is only one aggressor, whose name is Russia. But this does not prevent the terrorist country from constantly accusing Ukraine of preparing terrorist attacks. So, last week, the RIA Novosti channel published an interview with an alleged Ukrainian prisoner of war, who said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine were preparing ammunition with the banned chlorpicrin in a laboratory near Kramatorsk. Also, Russian propagandist Veselovskyi said: -Ukraine has already made a dirty nuclear bomb long ago and would be ready to use it, but it does not use it,- and a collaborator from the Russian Federation, Ganchev, said that the threat of attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants will remain. Let us remind you that it is Ukraine that strictly adheres to the requirements of the international nuclear security regime, unlike the aggressor country, which constantly uses nuclear blackmail for manipulation and intimidation. In addition, Ukraine, as a signatory to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons, strictly adheres to its obligations. Therefore, all the statements of propagandists are fakes, in which only Russians believe. And with plots on its own television, the propaganda of the aggressor country tries to justify the aggression of the Russian Federation and to cultivate hatred of Ukrainians among its citizens. For example, on the anniversary of the terrorist attacks in Buinaksk, Volgodonsk, and Moscow (September 4-16, 1999), the story of propagandist Dmytro Kiselyov is being circulated in the Russian Federation, in which Ukrainians are equated with -Chechen terrorists.- According to Kiselyov, now Ukrainians resisting the Russian invasion are -doing the same thing- as the terrorists who blew up residential buildings in Russian cities. Propaganda directly threatens - the defenders of Ukraine will either be destroyed or a Russian prison, -where life is worse than death.- In fact, using the pretext of -fighting terrorism- to justify wars is a classic Kremlin tactic. According to many independent investigators, the FSB was involved in the terrorist attacks in 1999, in which more than 300 people died and which became the reason for the Second Chechen War. It is the terrorist country Russia that constantly uses terrorist methods and commits crimes against the civilian population in both Chechnya and Ukraine. To write the review, materials from the Center for Combating Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine were used.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/brudna-bomba-biolaboratoriyi-j-do-chogo-tut-chechenczi-pro-shho-znov-volaye-rupor-kremlya/	2024-09-09T20:10:59-07:00
Because it is the most long-range: the US Navy puts into service the AIM-174B air-to-air missile	The fact that the Indo-Pacific region has been chosen as the prime territory for the deployment of these weapons, in the opinion of Reuters agency analyst, can significantly change the balance of forces in the air, in particular in armed confrontation with China, ArmiyaInform reports. The missile was developed by a well-known American manufacturer in the field of aerospace engineering - Raytheon - based on the SM-6 system , making it currently the longest-range missile ever used by the US, and was officially commissioned in July. It should be noted that the Pentagon did not officially present the new charge. Therefore, defense sector researchers are only making assumptions about the capabilities of the new missile based solely on its external image. Photos of F/A-18E/F Super Hornet aircraft with a new type of armament have appeared online. The new missile program and its implementation may mark a scientific and technical revolution in the fight against air targets&#8230; and even more. Yes, by data by The War Zone, the AIM-174B is a new air-to-air missile. Its appearance marks a significant increase in the capabilities of the US Navy in the fight against air targets, although the use of new weapons may extend beyond the air sphere. As confirmed by Naval News, the missile, also known as SM-6 ALC (Air-Launched Configuration), has been officially adopted by the US Navy. Weapons photographed by air adjusters during RIMPAC 2024 maneuvers while which has not been officially announced. The sudden appearance of a new missile without a pre-presented development program in the press remains largely a mystery. This reflects well the ability of the United States to conduct secret programs and the ability of Americans to avoid leaking information to the press when necessary. There are many indications that the F/A-18s will receive weapons that could radically change the balance of power in the Pacific. As can be seen from the photos published on social networks, the missile is suspended on the underwing pylon of the BRU-32B/A type of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. A few years ago, visually similar weapons were spotted under another aircraft of this type. However, that rocket was painted orange, which could mean that it was just an experimental product, a mass-sized mock-up, or maybe just a flying target. All three F/A-18E/F VFA CVW-2s are attached to the aeroplane of the Carl Vinson aircraft carrier and apparently received the AIM-174B air defense system. In recent weeks, the new missiles have been spotted in a gray color with a white fairing, which is typical of production air-to-air missiles adopted by the US Air Force and Navy. The airframe of the rocket can also be seen in great detail in the pictures. On its case there is a spoken marking DATM-174B. The abbreviation means that the missile is special, test, the common designation of the combat missile is AIM-174B. The RIMPAC exercise also saw F/A-18E/F fighters with underwing pylon-mounted missiles bearing the NAIM-174B index, with the N prefix indicating modifications for special tests where no return to the original configuration is planned. The model number in the missile designation -174- and the geometric and aerodynamic exterior of the missile airframe reveal the mystery of the weapon's origin. RIM-174B is the ship-to-air missile designation, also known in the US Navy as the SM-6 (Standard Missile-6) Block IA. In the US Navy, it is used to combat aerodynamic and ballistic targets, and also has limited capabilities to attack surface targets. The AIM-174 is a variant of the SM-6 adapted for use on combat aircraft. A missile modified for air carriers can use the altitude and speed of its carrier as launch conditions. For this reason, it lacks the Mk 72 solid propellant booster used in the original RIM-174B, which is launched from the Mk 41 shipboard Vertical Launch System (VLS). The AIM-174B missile without the Mk 72 booster weighs 1,890 pounds ± 14 lbs (857 kg ± 6 kg). The missile's terminal velocity can reach Mach 3.5 (1,050 m/s) when intercepting aerial, aerodynamic, and ballistic targets at altitudes up to 110,000 feet (34,000 meters) or Mach 2.5 (825 m/s ) when hitting land and surface targets at a range of 200 nautical miles (370 km). The missile has an active AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air homing system for end-of-flight targeting, but, unlike the AMRAAM, is not equipped with an inertial system as the primary missile control system in the initial and mid-range of the flight path, but programmable GPS navigation system, which is more accurate and allows you to do without a radio altimeter when attacking surface and ground targets in flight at low and ultra-low altitudes. It seems that as a result of this modification, the weapon does not lose its aerodynamic parameters, in particular, regarding the launch range. In this aspect, an air-launched missile may even win against a prototype ship-based missile. Given that estimates of the launch range of the -traditional- ship-based RIM-174B range from 240 to 460 km, this means that the AIM-174B could prove to be the longest-range air-to-air missile in its class, surpassing the Russian P-37 (AA 13 Axehead in the NATO nomenclature), the Chinese PL-15 (CH-AA-10 Abaddon) or the European Meteor. AIM-174B — new missile -air — air- of the US Navy for long-range F-18 Super Hornets.

Heavy fighting in tracts and islands: the intensity of enemy assaults on the Left Bank of the Dniepe...	Captain Dmytro, the spokesman of the operational group of troops -Tavria- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- Lykhova - In three days - Friday, Saturday and Sunday - 30 combat clashes took place there. The opponent had no success. Today, since the beginning of the day, there have already been 7 combat clashes there, while they are not taking place in one place, but are scattered on different islands, tracts, on different areas, which are stretched over a considerable length of the Dnipro coast, he said. This is an atypical situation, because previously most of the enemy's ground offensive operations were carried out in Zaporizhzhia, namely on the Robotynsky ledge in the Orihiv direction. Now the situation has changed. — Over the course of yesterday, 13 enemy assaults were repelled in our entire operational zone, of which three took place in the Orichiv direction, none in the Gulyajpil region, and 10 attacks were repelled at once in the Dnieper direction. This is such an atypical activity, the spokesman noted. The military believes that the Russians want to oust units of the Defense Forces from their positions on the bridgeheads on the Left Bank of the Dnieper. — They want, so to speak, to do it in such a leap. There are no other explanations. But in principle, their activation is the greatest in the last couple of months after the end of the active defense of Krynok, when our units — marines and other units of the Armed Forces — moved to other designated positions on the Left Bank of the Dnieper, he said. Dmytro Lykhovii suggested that the intensification of offensive actions by the Russians on the left bank of the Dnieper is related to their concern about a possible Ukrainian offensive in this direction. — There was information that the Russians were waiting for our offensive there. There were active actions, in particular, by the special forces of the Main Directorate of Intelligence with amphibious landings on the Kinburn spit, on the Tendriv spit. So the Russians keep their contingent there also for defense reasons. But now we are dealing with an increase in the number of assaults on their part, the spokesman said. In general, the Russians did not relax their attention to the SSU-held bridgeheads on the Left Bank of the Dnieper, even when they transferred their units from other directions in the South in view of the Kursk offensive operation of the Defense Forces. — It can be said that after the start of the Kursk offensive operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, when the enemy in a certain way transferred his units to threatened areas, in particular to Kurshchyna, he took most of these units from the Zaporizhzhia region. Whereas in Kherson Oblast, the number that was there actually remained. There, the Russians did not weaken the group. On the contrary, they conduct rotations at the front edge of their units, transfer -storm- detachments there in particular to maintain the intensity of assault actions, in order to be able to attack in the future, said Dmytro Lykhova. On the other hand, in other directions in the South, the number of assaults by the occupiers decreased. — If earlier most of the combat clashes took place in Zaporozhye, in the Orichiv direction, specifically on the Robotynsky ledge, now there are very few of them there. For example, yesterday there were three of them, none before that, today two have already happened since the beginning of the day. At the same time, the enemy is actively using unguided air missiles. In the Gulyajpil direction, there have been three weeks without significant changes, that is, there are no ground assaults, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform showed that our soldiers destroyed a warehouse of enemy watercraft in the South.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/09/v-urochyshhah-i-na-ostrovah-vazhki-boyi-zrosla-intensyvnist-shturmiv-voroga-na-livoberezhzhi-dnipra/	2024-09-09T10:28:16-07:00
The President: Russia should lose the most combat capability in the Pokrovsky and Kurakhiv direction...	This is discussed in the message of President Volodymyr Zelensky on September 9. -First of all, about the Donetsk directions. Thanks to all our units at the front, who ensure full implementation of the tasks and really steadfastly repulse the Russian assaults and restore our positions. This is important,- the head of state noted. According to him, it is also important to destroy as many enemy forces as possible. -The Pokrovsky direction, Kurakhivskyi - that is where the Russian army should lose as much combat capability as possible. I am proud of all our soldiers, who by their actions are teaching Russia to clearly know where its land is and where its neighbors are,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy continues to use special munitions equipped with dangerous chemicals against the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/09/prezydent-rosiya-povynna-vtratyty-najbilshe-boyezdatnosti-na-pokrovskomu-kurahivskomu-napryamkah/	2024-09-09T10:00:51-07:00

They talked with a captured Kazakh who went to kill people for money. We often meet people who think they can sit in the back, make money, and everything will be fine. But when they get into the Russian military system and face reality, everything falls into place,- the Ukrainian military said. -Это что вообще такое? You go according to the contract, you sign the contract, and you go and spend your money. Those are contracts that you get, you earn,- complains a serviceman of the aggressor state of the Russian Federation. Instead, in captivity, he was fed and given the necessary clothes. However, only he was so lucky - all the other henchmen of the Russian died. -Russians, you live in a country that kills you more than any other. Your Russian -tsar- killed more Russians than any Ukrainian. We will continue to destroy anyone who chooses to play the -great conqueror-. We have something to fight for - for our home, our families, our future,- Ukrainian soldiers emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform showed how ->in the Vovchan direction, the border mortars of the -Hart- brigade reliably and deeply buried the Russian invaders who were trying to build fortifications.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/09/prokarmlyvalys-samy-polonenyj-na-kurshhyni-rosiyanyn-rozpoviv-pro-zabezpechennya-v-armiyi-rf/	2024-09-09T09:57:52-07:00

Where is the most dangerous place in Kupyan Oblast and how evacuation takes place on the air -Suspilne Novosti- the head of Kup told Andriy Besedin of the Yansk City Military Administration. — The situation is very difficult in the settlements of Kivsharivka, Kupyansk-Vuzlovy, the left bank of the city of Kupyansk itself — Zaoskilya district, the central part of the city. Now there is no such place on the territory of the Kupyan community that we can say is safer, he said. Enemy artillery is practically non-stop, the Russians are striking with UAVs. However, even under such conditions, a significant number of local residents refuse to evacuate. — Unfortunately, evacuation is neglected, refused. Now more than 7,000 residents are on the territory of the community, 155 children remain on the right bank of the city of Kupyansk, said the head of the Kupyansk MBA. Employees of the Kupyan city military administration work with them every day, persuading them to leave the territory of the community, which has become deadly dangerous. — Now it is critical to leave the territory of the community to safer places. The whole algorithm is worked out, everything is created - from the hotline phone to the cities that can receive our people. If people want to come to the city of Kharkiv, they will be provided with compact accommodation and all the necessary services and conditions. If people want to go to safer regions, that is also an option. A large number of sister cities of Kupyansk are ready to receive our people, Andriy Besedin said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Kupyansky district suffered the most from shelling in Kharkiv region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/09/pid-obstrilamy-na-kupyanshhyni-lyshayutsya-tysyachi-meshkancziv-de-v-gromadi-najnebezpechnishe/	2024-09-09T08:48:13-07:00

Married to the mother-in-law: a story about unexpected love on the border with Poland	She informed about them State Border Service of Ukraine. In one case, a 28-year-old resident of the Rivne Region married his 40-year-old mother-in-law, a person with a disability of the 1st group. According to the version of the -newlyweds-, they were going to Warsaw to treat the sight of their -wife-. -The couple showed their acting skills until the end and assured that the marriage was concluded in July - out of great love. Later, the man admitted that his new wife was his mother-in-law. And the marriage was concluded with the purpose of leaving Ukraine,- the border guards said. As the border guards found out, on September 7, the husband's real wife left the country by train. -On the same day, the man and his mother-in-law tried to leave through the car checkpoint in Volyn. When the plans of the -couple- were exposed there, on September 8, the -couple- went to the Rava-Ruska checkpoint,- the report says. The other two cases were recorded at the -Krakowec- checkpoint. Both -spouses- were allegedly going to treat their wives. At the end of August, a 41-year-old native of Ivano-Frankivsk region married a 46-year-old woman with a disability of the II group.

The Ministry of Defense is updating the food supply of the Armed Forces: the pilot project will be l...	About this reported in the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The main task of the new approach is to ensure better quality of products supplied to the Armed Forces and to increase the efficiency of the supply process itself. It was introduced to potential suppliers, manufacturers and distributors. -From February 2025, two models will operate in parallel: the one under which DOT works now, and the new pilot model. This approach is used to ensure the stability of the system and the continuity of the supply process. Transformations in the food model for the military should increase the efficiency of supply and, at the same time, ensure compliance with high standards of product quality,- said Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. The pilot will operate throughout the year and will cover such regions as the city of Kyiv and the Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Cherkasy, and Kirovohrad regions. The main changes concern the financial model of interaction with the supplier, the product model and the quality control process. The supplier will receive compensation for the cost of goods and a fee for services (warehousing and transportation) subject to the SLA. The marginal cost of the catalog will be determined and fixed. For most types of products (75%) through open procurement platforms, the DOT will choose manufacturers who will be contracted by suppliers. For the remaining categories, suppliers will independently identify subcontractors. DOT, in turn, can block them for quality inconsistency and for violating integrity norms. All products will pass through the distribution center and only then be sent to military units. This is an additional stage of quality control, to which DOT specialists will be involved. DOT will apply a -black list- to suppliers and manufacturers - a new tool to prevent participation in the process of providing food for the Armed Forces in future periods of those entities that have already violated contractual obligations . -The idea of ​​the pilot model is to change the philosophy of interaction with suppliers and manufacturers due to the change in their incentives and the openness of the terms of cooperation. We see this approach as the basis of partnership.
