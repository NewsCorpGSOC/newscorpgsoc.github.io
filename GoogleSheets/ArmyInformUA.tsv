The length of the border is shorter within the borders of Chernihiv Oblast, as well as within the borders of Kharkiv Oblast, the border guard noted.

Almost always, the occupiers hit civilian infrastructure and local residents. - These shellings, unfortunately, fall on populated areas, as a result of which civilians living in border areas are killed. There are deaths, injuries to people, and destruction of infrastructure. In fact, Russia does not cease to confirm its status as a terrorist state by taking such actions, he said. At the same time, the spokesman of the State Border Service of Ukraine noted that in the Sumy region, attempts by hostile subversive and reconnaissance groups were also observed, although the number of such attempts or the activity of enemy DRGs has significantly decreased in the last period.

As ArmiyaInform reported, on November 9, 2024, Ukrainian military intelligence intercepted radio talks the North Korean military involved in the war against Ukraine by Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/u-moskovskij-oblasti-spalyly-shturmovyj-gelikopter-mi-24-gur/	2024-11-10T22:54:05-08:00
The commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces worked in parts and units in the Kursk direction	He wrote about this on his page on the morning of November 11. -If it weren't for the resilience of our soldiers, these tens of thousands of enemies from the best Russian shock units would have stormed our positions in the Pokrovsky, Kurakhiv or Toretsk directions, which would have significantly worsened the situation at the front. Now, following the order of their military leadership, they are trying to dislodge our troops and advance deep into the territory we control. Our task in this direction is to deter and destroy the enemy on his land,- said the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to him, the work was devoted to providing assistance to commanders in the organization of combat operations, increasing the effectiveness of fire damage to the enemy, and solving issues of comprehensive support and preparation of reserves. -I am grateful to our soldiers for their steadfastness and bravery in the fight against the Russian aggressor. Glory to Ukraine!- Oleksandr Syrskyi wrote. As reported by ArmyInform, General Alexander Syrsky held another telephone conversation with the commander of the US armed forces in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/golovnokomanduvach-zsu-praczyuvav-u-chastynah-i-pidrozdilah-na-kurskomu-napryamku/	2024-11-10T22:42:24-08:00
The Left Bank, cable crossing and chemical weapons: how the South of Ukraine was defended in the sum...	In the continuation of ArmiyaInform's interview with the spokesman of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Captain Dmytro Lykhoviei, read about Krynky, the left bank of the Dnieper in Kherson Oblast, the Gulyaipil and Orikhov directions and the Robotynsky ledge, as well as the difference between chemical weapons and ammunition with poisonous substances. The first part of the interview: What it's like to be a military spokesperson: Captain Lykhovy on mobilization, civil media and the famous Turkish Olympic shooter - What was the situation in the South of Ukraine in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Tavria- air defense missile system when you were there on a business trip and acted as a spokesperson? - This year I had two business trips. The first - in the operational and strategic group of troops -Tavria-, to the zone of responsibility of which the Avdiyiv direction belonged, the second - in the operational group of troops -Tavria-, in the zone of which were the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions. If in the East during the first mission the situation was tense and controlled, then in the South it was controlled and stabilized. In the huge zone of responsibility of the Tavria anti-aircraft missile system, from the sea to Donetsk region, in August and at the beginning of September, there were sometimes even days when no enemy assaults took place. Often there were several enemy infantry attacks that could be counted on the fingers of one hand. At the same time, about 50 combat clashes per day could take place in the Pokrovsky direction alone, which refers to the Khortytsia air defense system. According to my conclusion, the Russians lacked (and now lack) the forces and means to conduct active offensive actions in many directions at the same time. Although this does not mean that we in Tavria had some kind of -lull-. After all, the enemy actively used artillery, attack aircraft, guided aerial bombs, unguided aerial missiles and other means of destruction every day. —What was the Ukrainian society interested in then, which news reports about the situation in the South attracted the most attention?—The media was most interested in the situation with the withdrawal of units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine from the village of Krynka on the left bank of the Dnieper in the Kherson region. This is actually what started my rotation. It was also about the prospects of the enemy's offensive in the Zaporizhzhia region and details about the nature of the Russian assaults, the results of the combat work of our units in terms of defeating the enemy's personnel, weapons and military equipment, and capturing them. I can single out the regular comments I gave for regional media. We have developed very high-quality cooperation with Zaporizhia and Kherson media regarding the situation in specific regions. I prepared for them special information reports on shades in these areas, which took into account the specifics there. I would like to single out the local editorial offices of -Suspilny- as an example of the high-quality work of regional media. —You mentioned Krynyk. Was it possible to communicate this moment with the bridgeheads on the left bank of the Dnieper, to explain to society what is happening there and why exactly this is happening? — The beginning of my rotation at the Strategic Communications Center of the Taviya Air Force Base fell on the period when, in July, units of the Defense Forces — marines and others - finally withdrew from the village of Krynky on the left bank Dnipro. After all, this settlement was completely destroyed by a long-term complex fire attack on the part of the Russians, there was no longer anything to hold on to. Actually, Krynky ceased to be a settlement a long time ago. At the same time, our troops continued to hold other designated positions and bridgeheads on the left bank of the Kherson region, not allowing the enemy to take control of the Dnieper riverbed. In particular, intensive combat operations by units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine continued with the Russian invaders on the islands in the Dnipro river delta - Milky, Kozatskyi, Bilogrudiy and a number of others. The specifics of the terrain there are such that it is difficult to use a significant force of attack aircraft and armored vehicles, instead, you have to use boats, jet skis, etc. for logistics. These enemy vessels were regularly destroyed by our forces. At one point, even a rope crossing across one of the straits was affected. - And how did the occupiers act in other areas - where there were no such water obstacles? - As a rule, the Russian occupiers carried out assault operations in small infantry groups of up to a detachment. Sometimes it was from 3-4 to 8-10 people. Attacked without the use of armored vehicles, but with extensive use of light equipment, ranging from motorcycles, buggies and the like. For the first time to resort to such tactics, in my memory, they started in February-March 2024. Half a year later, mass use of this tactic began. All this happened during my rotations at OSUV and OUV. The same can be said about the use of ground robotic platforms - in six months, from March to August, it went from the first attempts to mass use. That is, being a member of the military administration, I was able to see for myself how the tactics of conducting military operations change in half a year, how technological innovations become common tools for use on the front line. — How did the situation on the Gulyaipil and Orihiv directions change during this time? —In the Gulyaipil direction, from mid-July to mid-September, the enemy actually avoided infantry attacks (for example, in August there were only two). Announcements by some Western media, in particular the German newspaper -Bild-, about the preparation of a massive offensive by Russians from Pologhi to Gulyapole, although they alarmed the inhabitants of the Zaporizhzhia region, did not come true. In fact, there were no drastic changes in the nature and actions of the enemy, and no signs of the formation of an offensive group were detected. Then I kept stressing it, calming the audience down. I believe that I have fulfilled my mission, and this was true and objective information. In August, several units of brigades and battalions of the armed forces of the Russian Federation were redeployed from Zaporozhye to the Kursk direction. Thanks to this, the threat to Gulyaipol has decreased. In the Orikhov direction, the main fighting took place around the Robotynsky ledge. There, the enemy had little tactical success in some places, but for more than half a year of attempted assault actions, the Russians were still not able to completely -drain- the salient, which was deoccupied by the Defense Forces of Ukraine in 2023. In some cases, on the contrary, our units improved their tactical position, established or restored observation posts, firing positions. It was in this direction that the Russians suffered the greatest losses in manpower and equipment. In the Dnieper operational direction, as I have already mentioned, at the beginning of my term of office, units of the Defense Forces were withdrawn from the village of Krynka to other positions and continued to conduct a defensive operation, also on the left bank of the Dnieper, about which there was appropriate communication. At the same time, in all directions, the Russians actively used artillery, attack drones, such as Lancet and Privet. Also, the enemy massively used drops from drones and strike aircraft - hit with KABs (guided aerial bombs) and NARs (unguided aerial missiles). Our units also inflicted complex fire damage on enemy positions. —The reports of the Tavria military intelligence agency often referred to the use of chemical weapons by the Russian military. Please tell us more about it. — Every month, the Command of the Support Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine provides general statistics on chemical attacks by Russian troops against the Defense Forces and conclusions on their dynamics. The messages of the spokesperson of the -Tavria- OUV referred to a part of these statistics in a specific operational area. During the period of large-scale armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the enemy, along with the use of conventional means of fire damage, uses special ammunition equipped with dangerous chemical substances against the Defense Forces. The definition of -chemical weapons- in relation to these munitions is incorrect, but the use of munitions with poisonous substances in war is also expressly prohibited by the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction.) This is, in particular, the use of hand gas grenades by the enemy type K-51 and RG-VO, which are means of combating riots and prohibited for use as means of warfare. Mostly Russians use chloracetophenone. Formally, it is not a chemical weapon. It is a combat poison of irritant action. The Chemical Weapons Convention defines chloroacetophenone as a chemical anti-riot agent. It is a chemical that can quickly cause irritation of the senses or physical disorders in the human body, which disappear after a short time after the action ends. That is, tears, snorts, fogging and the like. The enemy, in addition to violating the Convention, is clearly aware of the effectiveness of these applications. Because the very means of fighting street riots is to arm the police to get the protesters to disperse and cease their actions. In the event of the use of dangerous chemicals at the front, the serviceman remains at his position - continues to be in a chemically dangerous environment. These are deliberate actions of the enemy to violate and injure our troops through the use of dangerous chemicals. For example, there is a dugout or a trench, the Russians try to demolish them with artillery, drops from UAVs, FPV drones, sometimes UAVs. Despite this, several servicemen continue to hold defense in the dugout. When occupiers see the ineffectiveness of other means of destruction, they use munitions containing poisonous substances, which are prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention. Thus, during August, the enemy dropped 196 munitions with poisonous substances from UAVs in the operational area of ​​the Tavria air defense system. Relatively more - in the Zaporizhzhia region, but also in the Kherson region, many such cases were recorded. - As for incendiary ammunition, how often did the Russians use them? What exactly? — In addition to poisonous substances, the enemy uses drops with incendiary substances. This is another set of weapons based on using the combat capabilities of incendiary substances to destroy defensive positions. The statistics of their use are much lower than the discharge of ammunition with poisonous substances. The Russians resorted to this tactic, in particular, on the Dnieper islands, where it is easy to cause a fire and in this way forced the o/s to leave the position. —You kept statistics of enemy losses in the South. Can you share the general results for the time you were in the position of the spokesperson of the Tavria military command center? - Daily filling of tables in Exel format is a convenient way to track the trends of combat operations, both in terms of the number of assaults and shelling, as well as in terms of damage statistics. In July, the enemy lost 1,371 units of weapons and military equipment in the operational zone of the -Tavria- anti-aircraft missile system, in August - 1,041, and in the middle of September - about 400. That is, the statistics gradually decreased. These are the data based on the daily official summaries of the -Tavria- OUV. —Finally, I want to return to the question of the main message that, in your opinion, military communicators should convey to society. What and how should Ukrainians be informed first of all? - The task of military communicators is to maintain constant communication between the fighting army and the rest of society. To do our best to ensure that this connection is not lost, because a part of our society, perhaps, the further from the front line, the more calmed down it is. And the further from the beginning of a full-scale invasion, the less the desire to mobilize, the stronger the desire to sit in the rear. In fact, nothing is over. In my opinion, the best way to communicate in the military is objective information, as well as communication of problems that have been solved. I believe that problems cannot be kept silent, they must be identified and responded to. At the same time, we should also talk about many real positive points that exist in the army. It should also be explained that the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Defense Forces of Ukraine as a whole, is a large complex organism in which there is a place for everyone. Perhaps, and within the limits of his civilian profession. Because the army also needs builders, tractor drivers, truck drivers, accountants, lawyers, cooks, journalists - almost all civilian specialties. After becoming military personnel, they will actually continue to work in their profession, but at the same time will be part of the Defense Forces and will contribute to the defense of Ukraine, while receiving decent financial support, benefits and public respect.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/livyj-bereg-kanatna-pereprava-ta-himichna-zbroya-yak-boronyly-pivden-ukrayiny-vlitku-2024-go/	2024-11-10T22:41:39-08:00

The assault group of Russians was advancing through a forest strip when it was stopped and partially hit by artillery fire. Then our drones further -polished- the occupiers. But some of the invaders were able to get stuck in the cracks and required surgical removal. The scalpel of the operation was the Leopard tank, which drove up close and shot the Russians. Friendly escort was provided by the M113 armored car. -The occupiers turned the wrong way - their group was met with merciless discharges and fire from artillery brigade units. But later, the deep and dark situation in which they found themselves became even more critical. The dark avenger -Leo- and our predator -M-ka- went to the field,- commented the video in the brigade. &nbsp; As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 33rd mechanized brigade suddenly destroyed the enemy armored personnel carrier with the help of a daring tank attack.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/svyata-trijczya-bpla-arta-i-duh-svyatyj-leopard-borotba-z-pihotnoyu-nechystyu-voroga/	2024-11-10T21:19:49-08:00
The enemy carried out fifty airstrikes and over 600 drone strikes — General Staff of the Armed Force...	Operational information as of at 22.00 on November 10 was published by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The defense forces are directing efforts to disrupt the execution of the Russian invaders' offensive plans and exhaust their combat potential. In the Kharkiv direction, one skirmish continues near Vovchansk. Five enemy attacks have already been repelled by our defenders in the districts of Starytsia and Vovchansk. The enemy used aviation and carried out three airstrikes, dropping 4 anti-aircraft missiles in the areas of Kharkiv, Vilcha and Vilkhuvatka settlements. The enemy launched three attacks on our fortifications in the Kupyan direction. At this time, all of them in the districts of Kindrashyvka, Zagryzovy and Zeleny Gayu have already been repelled. On the Lymanskyi direction, Russian troops stormed the positions of Ukrainian defenders five times during the day in the areas of Terny, Torske and Serebryanka settlements. All enemy attacks are stopped. The defenders of the Ukrainian land are restraining the onslaught of the enemy in the Siversk direction, currently one enemy attack is underway in the area of ​​the Verkhnokamianske settlement. In the Kramatorsk direction, three attempts by the invaders to advance near Stupochky and Chasovoy Yar ended in failure. The enemy launched airstrikes in the areas of Chasovoy Yar and Sloviansk. In the Toretsk direction, the occupiers stormed the Toretsk and Shcherbinivka districts 14 times today. There, as well as near Shcherbinivka, enemy aviation was active. Fighting continues in six locations. The enemy is intensively attacking the Ukrainian defenders in the Pokrovsky direction. During the day, he carried out a total of 35 assault and offensive operations. The Russian occupiers are most active in the areas of Myrolyubivka, Promenya, Hryhorivka, Selidovoy, Lysivka, Sukhoi Yar, and Petrivka. Nine clashes in the direction are still ongoing. The enemy used aviation means of destruction in the areas of the settlements of Lysivka, Kotlyne, Sukha Balka, Oleksandropil. According to preliminary calculations, today our soldiers eliminated 145 and injured 204 occupiers. Two units of automobile equipment, two UAV control points, a buggy and a quad bike were destroyed. Two units of automobile equipment, one howitzer and a quad bike were also damaged. At this time of the day, there are 46 clashes in the Kurakhiv direction. Enemy attacks were repelled by our soldiers near the settlements of Illinka, Vozdvizhenka, Novoselidivka, Novodmytrivka, Sontsivka, Maksimilianivka, Antonivka, Dalnye and Katerynivka. Four attacks are still ongoing. The occupiers dropped anti-aircraft missiles in the areas of Kurakhove, Romanivka and Dachne settlements. In the direction of Vremivka, the enemy tried 13 times to break through to Trudovoy, Konstantinopolsky, Uspenivka, and Makarivka, but our courageous defenders stood in the way of this. Eight attacks have already been repelled. At the same time, the enemy actively used aviation means of destruction in the areas of Andriivka, Velyka Novosilka, Novodarivka and Zelene Pole settlements. In the Orihiv direction, the occupiers twice tried to break through our defenses in the areas of Novoandriivka and Malaya Tokmachka, and at the same time launched an airstrike on Temyrivka. In the Dnieper direction, the operational situation has not changed significantly. The enemy conducted seven unsuccessful assaults. There were no significant changes in the situation in other directions. Today we will celebrate the Ukrainian soldiers from the 110th Territorial Defense Brigade and the 124th Territorial Defense Brigade, who are steadfastly holding back the onslaught of overwhelming enemy forces on the Eastern Front. -Let's beat the enemy and bring our Victory closer! -Glory to Ukraine!- - said in a message from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, occupiers became active in the Vremivsk direction. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/vorog-zavdav-pivsotni-aviaczijnyh-udariv-i-ponad-600-udariv-dronamy-genshtab-zsu/	2024-11-10T21:02:41-08:00
Cartridges are collected even in Britain: at Interflex, automatic machines are -falling apart-	The correspondent of ArmyInform tells about rifle training during the BZVP within the borders of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. Most of us hold a machine gun for the first time in our lives, so we don't notice anything strange. However, Ukrainian instructors accompanying us during training in Britain, as well as those who served in Ukraine, note the unusualness of the Kalashnikov assault rifles issued to us for training. Indeed, this is not an AK-74 or any other modifications common in Ukraine, such as the AKS, although at first glance, and especially from a distance, it is difficult to distinguish them even for an experienced shooter. However, if someone who has dealt with the AK family of automatic weapons in Ukraine takes the weapon issued by the British in his hands, he will see a lot of differences, some of which are quite significant. How Britain trains the Ukrainian military in Great Britain / BFBS Forces News report The most noticeable detail that immediately catches the eye is the bright yellow muzzle, which is neither a muzzle brake nor a flamethrower . This is a compensator device that is an adapter for blank firing. It is designed to contain and divert powder gases to the side during firing with a blank cartridge. However, it is not this most noticeable detail that determines the fundamental difference between the machine guns issued to us and the AK-74, because if necessary, a similar or similar compensator can be installed on any model of the AK family. The fundamental differences are different and not so obvious until you pick up the weapon. Among the details that are immediately obvious even to a novice, the most noticeable are also the unusual folding tubular stock and the duplicate safety / fire switch on the pistol grip under the right thumb. With the example, the situation is about the same as with the adapter for blank firing - nothing fundamentally different from the usual AK modifications. The second fuse, on the other hand, is actually a very unusual thing that will cause a number of problems for some of us. The caliber of cartridges is also unusual - these are not the traditional 7.62 mm or 5.45 mm cartridges on our territory. It is a caliber of 5.56 mm of the NATO standard, intermediate in its power between cartridges for pistols and cartridges for rifles. This caliber was adopted as the second standard service rifle cartridge for NATO forces in 1980. Since then, it has spread not only in the countries of the North Atlantic Alliance, but also beyond it. After all, even replicas of the AK, the main individual small arms of the USSR and the Warsaw Pact Organization, which were the main antagonists of NATO during the Cold War, began to be produced under the 5.56 mm cartridge. In particular, such modifications were created in Bulgaria by the armory company -Arsenal-. The most famous Bulgarian modifications of the Kalashnikov assault rifle, including those chambered for the 5.56 mm cartridge, were the AR-M1 / AR-M1F and AR-M9 / AR-M9F. The letter -F- is used to denote the folding tubular metal stock, which helps to identify the AKs made by Arsenal's Bulgarian gunsmiths. Due to the availability of a significant number of 5.56 mm cartridges, the Ministry of Defense of Great Britain purchased and uses for training Ukrainian military Kalashnikov assault rifles of the AR-M9F model. This particular model has a right-hand thumb safety/fire switch and a folding tubular stock, as well as a number of other less significant features such as a polymer buttstock or pistol grip. Ukrainians train with Bulgarian AKs manufactured by Arsenal We get used to the weapons we receive quite quickly - they are really high-quality and easy-to-use automatic weapons for training in handling weapons and shooting during basic general military training. In terms of basic parameters, the AR-M9F is almost identical to the AK-74. However, the AR-M9F has a number of disadvantages. Oddly enough, it's primarily a collapsible tubular stock and a duplicate safety/fire switch on the pistol grip. These improvements of the Bulgarian gunsmiths created some problems for some of us. It is really very convenient to remove the weapon from the safety or to put the machine on the safety with a slight movement of the thumb of the right hand. However, the AK-74 in Ukraine does not have such an improvement, so the instructors forbade the use of a duplicate fuse. In conclusion, those of us who, for the sake of speed, tried to use the fuses on the sleeves without the instructors noticing, did ourselves a disservice. After returning to Ukraine, they had to get used to the usual AK-74 fuse. However, there were practically no offenders who regularly used a backup fuse. The instructors were vigilant, and we ourselves understood how negative the consequences of faulty muscle memory can be on the battlefield in Ukraine. Instead, the problem with the tubular stock was of a different nature. After long-term use in some submachine guns, the butt assembly attachment loosened, which obviously had an extremely negative effect on the accuracy and accuracy of the shot. To prevent this, we were forbidden to make an example. The ban on folding the stock helped, but not enough - as a result of long intensive training, the machines could not withstand and sometimes practically -crumbled- in someone's hands. It cannot be said that it was too massive, but the depletion of weapons was significant. So the aiming bar, which fell off during shooting due to vibration, did not surprise anyone. To be fair, the problematic weapon was replaced immediately. My first machine gun, which regularly jammed from the first day of shooting, was replaced already on the next field trip. After that, there were no problems with the re-received weapon until the very end of the training. In the same way, problematic submachine guns were also exchanged for other soldiers of the platoon. The British were extremely careful with their weapons and meticulously inspected them for the slightest complaint. Our Danish instructors demanded of us the same careful attitude towards the machines. The instructors were no less scrupulous about collecting cartridges after training. However, such vigilance when it came to empty cartridges was caused not in any way by the need to count all the fired cartridges and collect all the casings from them, so that the number of cartridges issued clearly coincided with the number of cartridges. During the firing of empty cartridges, no one counted their number, so it was possible to replenish the ammunition, filling the stores to the brim, as needed at any time. I think that each of us fired about 800 to 1,200 blank rounds during training. However, the lack of record of empty cartridges did not exempt from the obligation to carefully select cartridges in thick grass or among fallen leaves and brushwood. This was done in order not to pollute the environment, and also because the collected cartridges were processed for the production of new batches of empty cartridges. What's more, cardboard boxes from cartridges, which were asked not to be torn, were also collected in a separate bag. These neatly opened boxes were not thrown into the trash, but were also to be used for repackaging cartridges. Such -recycling- in the British way may seem trivial to someone, but a combination of care for the environment, frugality and strict adherence to really useful and important rules cannot fail to command respect. By demanding compliance with these and other simple rules, the instructors strengthened our discipline, brought up a responsible, cautious and careful attitude to weapons, taught us to strictly observe safety measures. All this later came in handy during the firing of live cartridges, when the instructors' requirements for compliance with safety measures and cartridge control became significantly stricter.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/gilzy-zbyrayut-navit-u-brytaniyi-na-interflex-avtomaty-azh-rozsypayutsya/	2024-11-10T20:54:14-08:00
How the Armed Forces forced the Buryats to jump: the story of a soldier who mastered everything from...	How is it to be on the defensive when you are assaulted three times a day? What tricks do the occupiers resort to on the front line? The soldier told our correspondent about this: -In the summer of 2022, I took part in the assaults. It was the Neskuchny, Velika Novosilka district. After one of the storms, I went to the hospital: I was wounded in my right heel, it was torn by a splinter. Nothing like that, the bones were intact, just tore the foot&#8230; In 2023, we were assigned to the 1st tank division and held positions near one of the villages in the south. It was already autumn-winter last year. It was difficult there, the enemy attacked us three times a day. In such difficult situations, the most important thing is that the soldiers in the positions do not withdraw into themselves, continue to communicate with their comrades, and listen to experienced fighters. It is important to take more ammunition to the position. Because this is not a very good option when the fighter takes a lot of stew, and BC - only four stores. If you yourself do not bring more BC to the position, then no one will do it for you. During the war, I mastered many types of weapons, from the RPG-7 to the M-240 and the Browning M2, but I loved the RPG the most. Because you can take this -pipe-, as it is called, and walk with it: I can find shots in almost any trench, ammunition is in everyone, they are interchangeable. Once upon a time, we carried out assault operations in Velika Novosilka. And there, the enemy AGS started working on our boys. Then the group commander told us to try to suppress him. This AGS behind the houses stood diagonally to us, and we saw it a little. With two shots from the RPG-7, we didn't just suppress him, we cut him down altogether. In one of the settlements in the south, I remember, we had two positions. The commander then ordered me to install American Claymore mines in front of them. It is an analogue of the Soviet MON-50. And then one day the Russians came to storm us again. They always entered from three sides: in the center and from two flanks. The battle began and we blew up those Claymores on both the left and right sides. Then the enemy was well mowed down by these mines. Then we captured two Russians. We squeezed them in a pincer between our two positions. One 19-year-old boy from Kamchatka did not hesitate. And the second one - a Buryat, he was 40 years old - even jumped on a mine in order to destroy the convoy group and himself. In the same area, the Russians had a custom of making -horseshoes- from their corpses. Because all the plantations there were already destroyed, only the stumps themselves. Then the occupiers placed three corpses of their comrades in front of them between two tree stumps, they also placed them on their sides and made a window between the bodies to conduct fire. In the same way, Russians often hid under the bodies of their dead after assaults in order to save their lives. Because then our drone could not see them very much.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/yak-zsu-prymusyly-buryata-strybaty-istoriya-voyina-yakyj-opanuvav-vse-vid-rpg-7-do-m-240-i-dvoma-postrilamy-vyrubyv-vorozhyj-ags/	2024-11-10T20:40:43-08:00
-Crush- everything: Israeli designers have created a laser installation that will shoot down UAVs, m...	How informs the official portal of this high-tech weapons manufacturer from Haifa, the latest defense equipment was recently presented at the largest military exhibition in North America AUSA, which is organized by the Association of the US Army, reports ArmyInform. The device Lite Beam (-Light beam-, in Ukrainian) is designed to quickly neutralize aerial threats, including swarms of drones. This 10 kW laser system is designed to enhance force protection during mobile ground operations, combining economy with cost-effective use. Lite Beam is part of Rafael's strategy to expand the use of directed energy weapons to counter a variety of air and ground threats. This mobile model is an adaptation of the Rafael system Iron Beam (- Iron beam- - in Ukrainian), a fixed laser with a power of 100 kW, capable of destroying targets at a distance of several kilometers. These weapons can be mounted from light vehicles and deployed in a variety of operational areas, allowing to counter a wide range of threats, from drones and missiles to mortar shells. In addition, the system can neutralize identified improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and other ground-based threats, increasing its versatility on the battlefield. The new version of the Lite Beam presented at AUSA 2024 has an updated increased power compared to previous models of 7.5 kW, matching similar systems such as Jupiter from MBDA and Rheinmetall. With an effective range of several hundred meters to approximately 2 km, the Lite Beam excels in its ability to accurately track targets with an advanced tracking system that can also be integrated into other anti-drone systems (C-UAVs). Design modularity allows the Lite Beam to be installed on a variety of platforms, including armored vehicles, ships, and fixed land platforms. As for the source of consumed energy, this combat laser station can be powered by diesel generators or batteries depending on the operational needs. One of the key features of the Iron Beam is its lower cost per shot compared to conventional interceptor missiles. Each Iron Beam intercept is valued at $1,000, which is significantly lower than the $40-$50,000 per Tamir missile the Israelis use in the Iron Dome (-Iron dome- in Ukrainian) from the same Rafael. Other international players are rapidly developing high-energy laser technologies: in particular, MBDA, Rheinmetall, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are also developing 10 kW solutions. Among them is the ATHENA from Lockheed Martin allows multiple lasers to be combined to achieve an output power of 30 kW, while HELWS from Raytheon is designed for extreme mobility and can be mounted on a simple pickup truck. Although this technology is still in the early stages of development with many systems being researched or tested, it offers promising potential for future defense applications. Lite Beam's ability to provide fast and accurate laser protection in a mobile format highlights Rafael's achievements in this field, positioning it as a potentially strategic tool to counter emerging threats. The Rafael laser installation has an unlimited -store- of cartridges, which allows you to use it without the need for reloading. In addition, no fragments of intercepted targets remain after the shot, which reduces the risk of collateral damage. According to the authors of the publication Army Recognition, this is especially important in the context of the conflict in Israel, where the country's air defense forces faced a shortage of ammunition for Iron Dome. Analysts cite data from Israeli economists who note that the war in Gaza has already cost the Israeli economy more than $67.3 billion, but the use of high-energy lasers such as Iron Beam or British DragonFire, about which in its publications repeatedly ArmyInform told, it also has its own problems. Atmospheric conditions such as clouds or rain can affect the ability of the beam to reach the target. Because the laser must remain focused on a moving target for several seconds to provide enough energy to destroy it. This requirement can limit its effectiveness against multiple threats at once, such as a barrage of missiles. In addition, some targets may be protected by materials resistant to laser attacks, which may reduce the effectiveness of the system. High-energy Iron Beam laser weapons system.

And again, nuclear blackmail: the Russian Federation took out a dirty bomb from the closet	However, in reality, such statements are part of the systematic nuclear blackmail of the Russian Federation, aimed at discrediting Ukraine, and are false. Russian statements about the so-called -dirty bomb- serve as a cover for its own actions that pose a threat to international nuclear security. This is written by the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security. Russia itself has repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons, occupied the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, and also provokes fears about possible incidents at the Zaporizhzhia and Kursk nuclear power plants. Russian forces are also moving tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus and conducting exercises using the nuclear arsenal, which is causing concern to the world community. Such Russian fakes aim not only to discredit the Ukrainian leadership, but also to divert attention from their own crimes in the nuclear arena. Statements about the possibility of Ukraine using nuclear weapons are purposeful propaganda aimed at undermining international trust in Ukraine and justifying further nuclear escalation on the part of Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/i-znovu-yadernyj-shantazh-rf-distala-z-shafy-brudnu-bombu/	2024-11-10T20:11:28-08:00

-Our first assault was just on Easter-: -Otaman- from the TCC told about his service in the assault ...	His story was told in OK -Pivnich-. Currently, 56-year-old Oleksandr Boyko is a military officer of the Eighth Department of Poltava District TCC and SP — Mashiv Poltava District TCC and SP. -I quickly put things in order, gathered myself and came to the TCC on March 1, where I mobilized to the Armed Forces. Although they didn't really want to take it, because they are 53 years old, they have enough ailments: hypertension, diabetes, weight 140 kg. I have had to take a handful of pills every morning for years. But all the same, it is necessary to protect the Motherland - who, if not us? And he didn't think about the difficulties, he had to, and he left,- Sergeant Oleksandr Boyko says. A few days later, representatives of the separate combined assault unit -Odin- came to the department and offered Oleksandr Boyko to join its ranks. I agreed. The formed unit was sent to the training center in Chernihiv region for coordination. Later, the platoon was sent to perform combat missions in the Sumy region near the Russian border. Their task was to hold positions, preventing a possible penetration of the enemy's DRG. There were shellings, but there was no direct fighting during that period, notes the sergeant. With a surplus, this -peace- was compensated later - on the outskirts of Liman, in Serebryan Forestry. -Our first assault was just on Easter. They received an order to storm the position taken by the Russians. We walked through the forest for several kilometers. They carried only BC and water - no food was taken. The battle was expected to last 4-5 minutes, but it lasted more than 20. There were about 80 of them, and 27 of us. But we still fought back what we had,- says the sergeant. Two weeks later, Oleksandr received a contusion and injury. After several months of treatment and rehabilitation, Oleksandr returned to the Eighth Department of the Poltava District TCC and SP in Mashivka. The state of health requires constant treatment, so he periodically has to return to the hospital, the soldier admits. So far, he is not considering the possibility of dismissal from the ranks of the Armed Forces, because he sees that civilian men are in no hurry to defend the country. -Men don't want to come here to protect their families - mothers, children, women. On the contrary, they hide behind their women. I don't know how they have enough conscience! I can't do that,- says -Otaman-. Among his responsibilities now, in addition to protection, there is also notification of citizens. It is necessary to communicate a lot with conscripts, check documents, issue summonses for clarification of data or passing of the VLK. The most difficult thing, the sergeant notes, is when people do not understand what military duty is. They start scandalizing, insulting, humiliating. They often ask why he does not fight himself. -It is so insulting in my soul that I fought for myself and for them, shed blood, and they are not only hiding, but also dissatisfied. But go fight yourselves, we have already won back ours. If you love your family, your children, you must go to protect them. Don't people realize that they won't be able to do anything when the enemy gets here?-, says the sergeant. ArmyInform reminds you of the opportunity to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/10/pershyj-nash-shturm-buv-yakraz-na-velykden-otaman-z-tczk-rozpoviv-pro-sluzhbu-v-shturmovomu-pidrozdili/	2024-11-10T09:43:24-08:00

About this on the air -Suspilne news- told the commander of the battalion of attack unmanned aircraft complexes -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket chieftain Ivan Sirk, captain Yury Fedorenko. According to Yury Fedorenko, the enemy did not manage to fully gain a foothold on the left bank of the Oskil River in the settlements of Kruglyakivka and Kotlyarivka. However, the enemy continues its attacks — it constantly sends additional manpower to the assaults, its cheapest resource. -Recently, the weather conditions were favorable, now the leaves have fallen in the forest plantations, a count was made on a small strip by the number of Russians killed. In one landing, 127 servicemen, representatives of the occupying forces, are now lying dead. And they continue to walk over the corpses, on their own,- Yuriy Fedorenko said.

The occupiers first forced people to register real estate according to Russian legislation, and now they are looking for unregistered housing and property. To do this, the ions go around houses, study all documents, even respond to advertisements and comments on the Internet. Housing taken from Ukrainians has already begun to be sold -as a mortgage- to Russian mercenaries, security forces, local traitors and imported -specialists-. -Extortion of the property of Ukrainian civilians on the TOT is a war crime. All transactions made regarding property in the occupied territory are invalid, Ukrainians remain the legal owners of the property on the TOT,- Ivan Fedorov stressed. As reported by ArmyInform, in October the Russian occupiers dropped in the South of Ukraine, about 500 bombs, and in the first days of November - about 150.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/10/vorog-posylyv-majnovyj-tysk-na-ukrayincziv-na-tot-zaporizkoyi-oblasti/	2024-11-10T07:31:47-08:00

Today, the invaders lost 65 servicemen killed and wounded in this direction, our soldiers also destroyed an armored combat vehicle, an artillery system, 20 UAVs, eight units of automobiles and three units of special equipment; significantly damaged three artillery systems, seven units of automobiles and a unit of special equipment. Eight times the enemy attacked our fortifications in the Kupyansk direction near Kucherivka, Kruglyakivka and Lozovoy. At this time, five clashes are ongoing. The enemy attack is currently being repelled by Ukrainian soldiers near Grekivka in the Limansky direction. Fourteen enemy assaults during the day were stopped near Grekivka, Nevsky, Torsky and Bilogorivka. In the Siverskyi direction, our units repelled an attack near Verkhnokamyanskyi. In the Kramatorsk direction, two attempts by the invaders to advance near Bila Hora and Stupochky ended in failure. In the direction of Toretsk, the occupiers stormed nine times today in the area of ​​Toretsk, Dilyivka, Shcherbinivka and Nelipivka. Fighting continues in four locations &#8211; the enemy is pressing, trying to advance in the Toretsk area. The enemy is intensively attacking the Ukrainian defenders in the Pokrovsky direction. During the day, in total, he carried out 36 assault and offensive actions. The Russian occupiers are most active in the districts of Promenya, Lysivka, and Hryhorivka. Three clashes are still ongoing. According to preliminary calculations, today our soldiers eliminated 180 and injured 210 occupiers in this direction. Three tanks, ten armored combat vehicles, 19 vehicles and four mortars were destroyed. Also nine units of automotive equipment and one artillery system. It is also hot in the Kurakhiv direction, at this time of the day there are 40 combat clashes. The terrorists tried to advance in the districts of Illinka, Novoselidivka, Novodmytrivka, Maksimilianivka, Dalnyi, Katerynivka, and Antonivka. The fighting is still going on. In the Vremivsk direction, Ukrainian soldiers repelled five attacks by enemy units in the areas of Bogoyavlenka, Trudovoy and Maksimivka. In the Orihiv direction, units of our troops repelled one enemy attack in the direction of Novoandriivka. In the Dnieper direction, three enemy assaults failed. In Kurshchyna, Ukrainian fighters hold the defense, repelling four enemy attacks; in total, the enemy made 18 attempts to attack our units today. There were no significant changes in the situation in other directions. Today we will celebrate the Ukrainian soldiers from the 128th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade of the Transcarpathia and the 68th Separate Hunter Brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush, who steadfastly restrained the onslaught of overwhelming enemy forces on the eastern front. -Let's beat the enemy and bring our Victory closer! -Glory to Ukraine!- - said in a message from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, from the beginning of the day at the front there was /?utm_source=mainnews&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=traficsource->108 combat clashes. The greatest activity of the occupiers is observed in the Pokrovsky and Kurakhiv directions. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/10/vorog-18-raziv-atakuvav-na-kurshhyni-genshtab-zsu/	2024-11-09T21:05:28-08:00
-Queen in the trenches- as -Thunder in the sky-: what movie news to expect this winter. Interview wi...	In an interview with ArmiyaInform, their producer, reserve colonel Oleksandr Driz, told about these new movies. - Let's start with the nearest date - December 6. I am very pleased that for this holiday we have a gift in the form of a movie called -Queens in the Trenches-. This is a film about women in the army based on the example of three people who had very good jobs before the war. One of our heroines, Oreste Brit, studied at the Sorbonne University and lived in Paris. In 2006, she became a beauty queen, received the title of -Miss Kyiv-, her photo was decorated by the best foreign publications. Another heroine is Diana -Dana- Vinogradova, a very interesting person who stood near the origins of -Right Sector- and currently holds the position of deputy brigade commander. She is the only woman in the Armed Forces of Ukraine who holds a position of this level - the deputy commander of the brigade for moral and psychological support. Now she is studying at the National University of Defense, there is also a fragment about this in our film. The third heroine is a designer, participant and organizer of various music festivals. This is Yulia Sidorova, her call sign is -Kuba-. Everyone already knows her as a very famous medic who saved a huge number of servicemen and continues to do so in the 92nd Brigade in Kharkiv. She saves lives and has her own team that she has chosen. All this will also be told in our film. The main goal of this film is to use the example of these women to show both girls and men how to act in modern conditions. Oresta Britt is a well-known volunteer. She was an adviser to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny, now she is very active in volunteering, and is engaged in REEs. It has many different directions of assistance to the Armed Forces and we show it all. Our other two heroines officially joined the military during the large-scale invasion, signed contracts and are now very successfully serving in the ranks of the Armed Forces. We hope that this project will have a positive effect on the mobilization campaign, that people will see how these girls, having such serious successes before the war, went to defend Ukraine during a large-scale invasion. - You mentioned the mobilization campaign. What do you think can activate this process so that new people go to the army? – I think that only a positive example of others. By the way, Orestes Britt in our film tells what advantages a person receives when he now goes to the service, goes to war. Yes, it is very dangerous there, you can stay there both on the battlefield and on the shield, as they say, return. But the fact is that during such service, a person receives both recognition and status in the country that will win - a worthy place, honor and respect in society. And he will also find the best friends and will feel like a real citizen, a real patriot who did not hide, but followed the call of his soul and heart to defend our country. Therefore, in such a situation, of course, we cannot influence some administrative or organizational measures for mobilization, but in a spiritual way, in the fact that people may have a desire to leave after listening to these girls - I am sure. Many people are currently in a state of uncertainty, so this film of ours will, I think, help them orient themselves and make the right choice, because the Armed Forces of Ukraine currently offer a lot of vacancies. - And whose story impressed you the most? b> – All three of them are such extraordinary and very bright heroines. But I was personally impressed by -Dana- Vynogradova. She is an artist, she had exhibitions in Lviv. In addition, she writes poems, publishes patriotic books. She is involved in the army, starting from training and ideological work with personnel to purely military operational, operational-tactical matters, where she takes a direct part. I just wonder where she got such a range of knowledge, skills and abilities. She is very young, now a senior lieutenant, but she has held the positions of lieutenant colonel, and now she will probably have higher positions after the National Defense University. And it's not just like that. Even the brigade commander, who was her commander, was amazed at how she, being in the rank of lieutenant, handled all her duties very confidently. Therefore, this is really the kind of story that impressed me the most. - Now tell us about your second film - -Thunder in the clear sky-, the main character of which is the Hero of Ukraine Rostyslav Lazarenko, call sign -Thunder-. – We created a project called -Fighting Families-. The co-author of his idea is, together with me, the head of the Department of Public Relations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Bohdan Senyk. Each series of this project is dedicated to a certain type of Armed Forces. The films have a career orientation load and also promote military professions. During the large-scale invasion, two series were created, dedicated to the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The first series was called -Defenders of the Sky- about the profession of military pilots. And the second - -Air defense is working calmly.- Rostyslav Lazarenko also took part there, but he was not the main character, there was another main character. After that, we decided that Rostyslav, as a Hero of Ukraine, as a very well-known and respected person, needed a separate film and we are currently creating -Thunder in the Clear Sky- as a portrait project. This is a portrait of a hero who experienced a lot and deserved a lot. Just imagine that today he has almost doubled the record of Ivan Kozhedub himself. Rostislav graduated from the military educational institution named after Kozhedub. He is an unsurpassed personality and the film is about him and partly about the team of those with whom he is. Because his boys, as he calls them, are a fighting family. They have their own corporate culture, their own awards, and tattoos, and bracelets, and many symbols that are fundamentally important to them. This film reveals more broadly the life of the hero, the leader of the stormtrooper pilots. Undoubtedly, there are also tragic stories about his brothers who have already died. How difficult it all is for him these days... He says: -For me, when the war ends, it will be a very difficult period, because then I will be able to remember everyone. And not like now, because now there are constant sorties-. He has already destroyed an insane number of enemies and continues to destroy them. Unfortunately, this is already the history of today. Despite everything, he believes in Victory and aims his boys at the victorious activity of destroying the enemy. - When will you be able to see the films? - Both of these projects were commissioned by the Ukrainian Cultural fund where we won the competition. -Queens in the Trenches- is scheduled to premiere on Armed Forces Day on Channel 24. After that, the film will go to other TV channels, streaming platforms and other sources. And the second project -Thunder in the Clear Sky- has, in our opinion, a cinema perspective. That's why we want to launch it in cinemas in January first. Even now, the -Planet Kino- chain and some cinemas want to rent it. Therefore, only after the film is shown in cinemas, it will be released on television. - Tell us about your creative plans. - Today we want to continue the aviation theme. Apart from Rostislav Lazarenko, there are many other worthy people there. By the way, the Hero of Ukraine Vadym Voroshilov, call sign -Karaya- and the pilot, squadron commander, who is currently also studying at the Defense University of Ukraine, Ivan Smerechansky - -Smereka-, also participate in the film -Thunder in the Clear Sky-. We want to expand the palette of these heroes, so we are planning another film about attack aircraft. And then we want to talk about bomber aircraft and fighter jets, which we have in all projects. That is why we have very good prospects in aviation, I believe. But we will not forget about other troops. Perhaps it will be possible to continue the -Fighting Families- cycle. We did about the infantry, marines, assault troops, special operations forces. In the continuation of -Fighting Families- we would like to touch on other military professions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/10/koroleva-v-okopah-yak-grim-sered-neba-yaki-kinonovynky-chekaty-cziyeyi-zymy-intervyu-z-oleksadrom-drizom/	2024-11-09T20:41:50-08:00
How to survive in battle, or What useful things will be taught at BZVP: life hacks from a DSHV instr...	ArmyInform asked the instructor about how paratroopers are prepared for war with the enemy, as well as how to communicate with society so that people stand up for the defense of Ukraine. -The deeper you dig into the ground and properly arrange the dugout, the more likely you are to survive the battle,- Comroty Roman explains the importance of engineering training to the mobilized. Theoretical block: instructors talk about the nuances. They explain to people at the classes how to act and what to do during enemy attacks with guided aerial bombs: - the Russians use anti-aircraft missiles on the front, aim them directly at our positions. Guided aerial bombs are divided into different types and types, that is, they have different charge equivalents. People in positions must understand: in order to survive, deep holes must be dug, overlaps must be arranged, and so on. In the winter of this year, the 79th DSHV brigade, Mariinsky direction. Then the Russians made 13 KAB strikes against our advanced positions. After that, I talked with my brother, the boys survived because they dug in well. Everything was -according to - according to-, there were no -two hundred-, two - -three hundred-, concussions. This is a real-life example of how the ability to dig in well saves the lives of defenders on the front line. These are tactical, fire, engineering, intelligence training, work with/against UAVs and tactical medicine, communications. We focus on night classes using drones. Interaction is important on the battlefield. The mobilized work as part of tactical groups, divisions and platoons. Let's see which of them is the leader to determine the commander of the department. Actions in defense and attack, assault actions, tactical movements inherent in various types of combat. Small group tactics: hit and roll. Repelling an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group, how to counter the meaty assaults of the Rashists. That is, all working moments that are in a real combat situation. Due to the fact that the enemy is now massively using drones with resets, we show them what elements can unmask them during missions. That they can give out during the day, or in the dark. Working with weapons and shooting is, of course, a priority.- The key point of training: the instructors in the classes share their own combat experience. Again, there are different terrains: an urbanized area, a plantation, a field, some kind of body of water. Accordingly, the combat tasks are different: - In 2023, during the counteroffensive in the south, I, as part of the 46th Airmobile Brigade, performed tasks in the -fire sack- near Robotyny in Zaporozhye. The task was to keep two plantations and approaches to them for 6-7 days. Our group consisted of 8 servicemen. In principle, there were no fixed positions there, but there were, as we called them - -coffins- - small pits, where we held the defense. SPs were set up, sectors of fire were determined. To say that it was very hot there is an understatement. The enemy worked around the clock for us: Vasylok, LPG, AGS, aviation with anti-aircraft guns, and barrel artillery. In short, solid trash. Plus the enemy used small group tactics, launching groups of three at night to determine where we were. Of course, we destroyed them on the approaches. The drones hung in the air by themselves. One day, a command came from the management: storm the next landings. Disguising smoke was launched to indicate the direction of the landings and the starting point of the assault. I don't know how, but our tanks somehow got into positions in this area, until that time none of our heavy equipment had left at that point, and they worked on the enemy. After which there was an assault, another unit from our brigade took these two landings. Next was to be our replacement. We already realized that the enemy had hacked our radio communication and knew the evacuation point already during the withdrawal from the positions. They flew at us with -fan- mines, then drones joined. But all my soldiers were prepared for any close approach, they all knew what they had to do, followed by always voice commands and onward movement, on turns at a run, no one stopped anywhere. We walked the entire route (several kilometers in fact), although we also had our own weapons and shells, we took everything as befits paratroopers. Somehow we reached the trenches of our neighbors. They flew there. Hecked out. Got in touch. They waited Our driver was injured then, so there had to be another car. The enemy struck again with mortar fire. Aimed at 120 mines for 15 minutes, and it seemed like an eternity. There was darkness in everyone's eyes, screams, it is clear that the head was bursting from pain, contusion. Our brother's leg was torn off by shrapnel, already in the dugout they provided him with medical assistance, they wanted to save him. But, unfortunately, the heart couldn't stand it&#8230; What am I leading to? In battle, the main thing is not to lose control and the ability to manage people during combat. Quality training saves the lives of military personnel on the front lines. Therefore, using such personal examples, we explain to the mobilized what reality awaits them and why it is so important to be ready for anything. The contingent of mobilized people are completely different people in terms of psychotype, social status, with different life problems and the like. We determine the degree of motivation of each person, for this we conduct testing, and we continue to work with them in classes on national and patriotic training. When working with recruits, psychological preparation is also important. Their combat effectiveness directly depends on the emotional health of servicemen. After all, we understand very well that things happen differently in war, in moments of panic, in stressful situations, a person can go -into a stupor- and, unfortunately, die. Therefore, we teach how to cope with stress and pressure, make decisions and, most importantly, work in battle as part of a team. So how to master yourself in crisis situations. There is such a simple exercise -Square-. It is quite effective. To calm down, a serviceman must breathe. He visualizes a square, on inhalation he moves his gaze to the right corner, on exhalation lowers it, on inhalation to the left corner and again on exhalation to the upper corner. In such a simple way, a person distracts himself, focuses on breathing and calms down over time. Next, it is important to teach the unit commander how to act in similar situations. He is the commander, the leader. And he should not shout at a subordinate when he is not in his right mind. The great war has been going on for three years, and the people who are coming now, unfortunately, are not prepared at all. Many people do not even know elementary things, this is primarily some basic knowledge of tactical medicine. There is YouTube: there are a lot of video courses on tactical medicine, which demonstrate in detail what the MARCH algorithm is. See how the machine is disassembled and assembled. There are shooting ranges, airsoft training that everyone loves, it's all available. People should study before they join the army. It will be easier for instructors in training centers to prepare you, because there will already be some basis. And, again, even if you've already joined the army, don't feel sorry for yourself. Especially during the preparation period. Work at the maximum, at 200%, at 300%, so that it will be easier for you in the future. Absorb as much information as possible, ask questions, always be interested in everything. It will be easier for you in battle. I will give an example. We had a set where we conducted BZVP for contractors. The youngest was only 18, and the oldest was probably 27 years old. So, they came to us already charged, hungry for knowledge. You know, it's like a blank slate on which you can write your best story. Or like the clay from which you mold that perfect fighter. To this day, thank God, the boys are unsubscribing, thanking them for the training. And as always, the next guys are asked to -pump- even more. Every Ukrainian man must protect his family and country. This is an axiom. You are either here in the army or, due to your health, you work for defense in the rear. There are many professions in the Armed Forces where you can be useful. Now there are recruiting centers, they will help you choose your profession. Prepare yourself for the fact that Ukraine must be defended. It will not be the case that some fight and others sit and wait for the war to end by itself. Will not end. We have such a category of citizens who say: they will come to my home, to my city or village, then I will go to fight. But it will be too late. The military, who were in the war, they understand this perfectly. They say that many Ukrainians are simply afraid of dying in the war. Yes, people are afraid, everyone is afraid. A person who is not afraid is just crazy, I think. Fear is good. If there is no fear, it is bad, especially when you are at war. Some say they are afraid of TCCs. We have already found a solution for you: allow military units to mobilize people directly, bypassing the TCC and SP. In my opinion, this should be done much earlier. There would be fewer negative stories, which Russian propaganda is very fond of spreading in order to discourage mobilization in our country. Mobilization is a matter of state survival. It is necessary to change the military at the front, who have been fighting there for almost 1,000 days.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/10/yak-vyzhyty-u-boyu-abo-chogo-korysnogo-navchat-na-bzvp-lajfhaky-vid-instruktora-dshv/	2024-11-09T20:31:31-08:00
They no longer know how to scare: the Russians have seen Poles in the TCC	However, this is a fake, said the UNITED24 platform, because it has never published such ads or posted such a video. In the fake video, they say that approximately 47% of the staff of the TCC are Polish citizens who have signed contracts with the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Such a step is apparently necessary in order to fight corruption during mobilization in Ukraine and to increase the efficiency of the TCC. The video itself was assembled by propagandists from footage that has nothing to do with the so-called -mass service of Poles- in the TCC. For example, with the help of a reverse search fact checker -Vox Ukraine- united24-> found a photo of the former head of the Odesa regional TCC and SP Oleksandr Okhrimenko, on which the Ukrainian chevron is visible. The photo was taken on December 12, 2023, during his press conference in Ukrinform. First, the Russians showed Okhrimenko's real chevron, and then a redacted one with the flag of Poland. In the original pictures, only the Ukrainian flag is present. There are also grammatical errors in the video. For example, -territorial center of recruitment and social support- was translated as TRSSCs, but it is correct TCR and SS (Territorial Centers of Recruitment and Social Support). The main goal of this and similar fakes is to disrupt the mobilization campaign in Ukraine. Russians no longer know how to scare Ukrainians so that they do not join the army. Each time their lies are more and more detached from reality.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/10/stopfejk-uzhe-ne-znayut-yak-lyakaty-rosiyany-pobachyly-v-tczk-polyakiv/	2024-11-09T20:11:04-08:00
Even the bridge to the Crimea is protected by the Russians not by quality, but by quantity	The spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain of the 3rd rank, told about this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon Dmytro Pletenchuk. — The enemy is indeed taking steps to strengthen the defenses of this facility. Accordingly, it is impossible to say that these actions have absolutely no result. Whatever quality, whatever principles these weapons are used, in any case, of course, quantity matters, he said. So even in the case of the Kerch bridge, Russians traditionally try to increase quantitative indicators for themselves and do not improve quality. — Just in the case of the so-called -Crimean- bridge, we see that the Russians very often take precisely the quantitative indicator. Because, as practice shows, it is quite difficult for them to repel attacks of even not the most modern weapons with the systems they use, the spokesman explained. However, the number of weapons collected to protect the bridge is still capable of producing results. — Given the amount of anti-aircraft they have attracted, they can still do this from time to time. They try to protect it both from the air and from the water. For this, they use various hydrotechnical structures and aviation patrols, Dmytro Pletenchuk said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that threat of strikes -calibres- from the Caspian are not zero, but extremely insignificant.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/navit-mist-do-krymu-rosiyany-zahyshhayut-ne-yakistyu-a-kilkistyu/	2024-11-09T12:21:59-08:00
Maneuver defense and -meat- assaults: the operation in Kurshchyna continues	told about this on the telethon -Edyny Novy- > spokesman of OTU -Siversk-, Colonel Vadym Mysnyk. — The enemy continues to maintain the intensity of shelling along the entire strip of the northern border. These are Chernihiv, Sumy and part of Kharkiv regions in our area of ​​responsibility. By terrorizing the local population, in addition to this, they are thus tying up our combat units. These are hundreds of kilometers of the border so that we cannot concentrate them or use them in the hottest areas of the front, he said. The occupiers hit the territory of the Kursk region most intensively. — The greatest concentration of shelling and fighting, [concentration] of enemy forces on the territory of the Kursk region is where fierce battles are currently taking place. They have a nimble nature on our part, the spokesman said. Instead, the enemy tries to fight not with skill, but with the number of personnel and equipment, in the usual way. - They are constantly forced to bring various reserves here - both from the depths of their territory and from other areas of the front. -When they run out of armored vehicles, they send small groups of infantry to attack,- he said. The Russians use the accumulated forces and resources extremely inefficiently. — The enemy uses the tactics of meat assaults. We do not see anything new. They accumulate manpower, equipment and try to use their advantage precisely in this with assault actions. But our soldiers in defense are very good and the enemy's losses in the last two days have been significant, Vadym Mysnyk said. The Russian invaders treat their own civilian population on the territory of Kurshchyna just as ruthlessly. - Just demolishes all its settlements to zero. Over the past day, the enemy used 46 anti-aircraft missiles in Kurshchyna, and 15 anti-aircraft missiles this afternoon. Dropped 60 UAVs, 32 [hits] by FPV drones, the spokesman said. The occupiers are also actively using artillery and mortars. Over the past 24 hours, 264 shellings and about 1,200 explosions have been recorded in the Kursk region controlled by the Defense Forces. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that voyuvaty-po-inshomu-rosiyany-ne-vmiyut/->Russians -take their own settlements to zero and hit their own population-, because they don't know how to fight in any other way.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/manevrena-oborona-ta-myasni-shturmy-operacziya-na-kurshhyni-tryvaye/	2024-11-09T12:06:32-08:00
The number of KAB drops in Kharkiv region has increased: the purpose of the enemy has been explained...	A representative of the communications service told about this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon with the public of the -Charter- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev. — The beginning of the Kursk operation had a certain result, for example, in the fact that the number of used anti-aircraft guns in Kharkiv region significantly decreased. If there could have been dozens in May-June, then they practically disappeared, he said. However, in recent weeks, the number of guided aerial bombs dropped by the enemy on Kharkiv region has increased significantly. — In the last few weeks, the enemy has started using guided aerial bombs again. -Mostly in the city, on civilian infrastructure, mostly in the evening or at night, although there are also daytime shellings,- said the guardsman. — It is very difficult to find logic in the application of [CABs]. Sometimes they just hit the highway. Sometimes, like last night, in the center of the square, in Derzhprom, which is a UNESCO monument, or simply in suburban buildings. It is very difficult to find any logic, apart from the fact that these are obviously attempts to intimidate the population, Volodymyr Degtyarev noted. He said that the detonation of a guided aerial bomb is truly depressing. — Those who have watched even the video of detonation of guided aerial bombs, see that the blast wave from them reaches hundreds of meters. Their impression is simply incredible. And, in fact, now it is one of their main means of such, one might say, massive destruction, - emphasized the representative of -Charter-. ArmyInform previously reported that lyudyna-distala-poranen/->Russian troops shelled Kup'yansk again: two people were killed, one more person was injured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/chyselnist-skydiv-kabiv-po-harkivshhyni-zrosla-metu-voroga-poyasnyly-v-sylah-oborony/	2024-11-09T11:51:47-08:00
The threat of strikes - calibers - from the Caspian: not zero, but extremely insignificant	The spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain of the 3rd rank, told about this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon Dmytro Pletenchuk. — There are currently no confirmed facts of the Caspian Sea being used to launch missiles that could fire at our territory. There are cruise missile carriers there, that's a fact. Their technical characteristics allow them to be used from such a distance - this is also a fact. However, there are currently no confirmed examples of such use - and this is also a fact, he emphasized. The military noted that there are at least two Caliber carriers in the Caspian Sea who fled there from the Black Sea. -There are at least two carriers that are being tested for the Black Sea Fleet, which were forced there from the Azov-Black Sea region,- the spokesman said. In view of this, the danger of using -Caliber- sea-based missiles from the Caspian Sea is not zero, but extremely small. — The danger can be considered to be present, but the distance is quite large and it will allow to react in time to such launches. Considering the technical characteristics of these missiles, the probability of their destruction is very high, Dmytro Pletenchuk emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that enemy fleet The Black Sea fleet is on deaf defense: defenseless Russian ships are protected from drones by aviation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/zagroza-udariv-kalibramy-z-kaspiyu-ne-nulova-ale-vkraj-neznachna/	2024-11-09T11:34:35-08:00
Enemy KABs in the South significantly increased: the results of disappointing statistics	About this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- mentioned the spokesman of the OUV -Tavria - Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn. — From the beginning of September, the Russians made certain changes in the design of guided aerial bombs and these bombs began to fly further. They hit with these bombs, struck even in the center of Zaporozhye, he said. The military gave the following statistics of the dropping of KABs in the South for October. -In October, in the Southern direction, the Russians used about 500 guided aerial bombs specifically on Ukrainian positions and on populated areas near the line of combat,- said a military officer. About a third of these 500 CABs occur in the last week of October. — Already this month, during the first 9 days of November, the enemy also used about 150 guided aerial bombs. That is, the enemy began to use guided aerial bombs more, because they bring him a certain result and it is very difficult to fight with this type of weapon. It is better to fight him when these bombs are still on the ground, and not somewhere in flight or already on the ground, Vladyslav Voloshyn emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the South the occupiers are preparing for assaults and have named which areas are most at risk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/vorozhyh-kabiv-na-pivdni-suttyevo-pobilshalo-pidsumky-nevtishnoyi-statystyky/	2024-11-09T11:19:59-08:00
The number of enemy assaults in Toretsk decreased, but Russian losses increased	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. — The number of assaults has decreased in this direction. However, if we look at the nature of these assaults, it has [also] changed. -We can see that the enemy is using more personnel,- she said. This leads to a significant increase in the casualties of the occupiers. — They suffer much greater losses. Today, every day we see that the enemy loses 50-70 people killed and wounded, which is about 5% of the total losses of the Russians per day, the officer noted. This is how the spokeswoman described the Russian assaults in the urban development of Toretsk. - You can imagine what these assaults are like: there are a lot of Russian personnel in the urban development.

In order to bring the bridge, at a minimum, there should be no active fire [from the Defense Forces], she said. Gunners of units of the Defense Forces keep the canal under fire control. — We, in our turn, protecting this channel, of course, will not give such an opportunity [to the enemy] and we will take every opportunity to stop the crossings and keep this channel under the watchful eye of our artillery, — Ukrainian drones will also not allow vehicles to cross the enemy channel . — Also, FPV drones work very skillfully.

In the South, the occupiers are preparing for assaults: which areas are most at risk	The most endangered areas on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- named the spokesperson of the OUV - Tavria- Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn. — At the moment, the situation in general is not much different from the situation that has been here for two or three weeks. The enemy continues shelling, continues strikes. They are shelling not only the positions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, but also the cities located in the front-line zone and in the South of Ukraine in general, he said. The officer reported that the Russian command is accumulating forces and means with the aim of intensifying assault operations on certain sections of the battle line. — Russian troops, according to our intelligence, are quite actively preparing to conduct assaults on certain sections of the demarcation line. They are carrying out and some have already carried out the occupation of [positions], they have pulled up the replenishment. Ammunition has been received and is being replenished, and engineering and aerial reconnaissance of our positions is being actively conducted, the spokesman said. All this indicates that the enemy is preparing for assaults, and some assault groups have already been moved to advanced positions. — They are preparing to start assault operations. Some assault groups have already been moved to forward positions. This indicates that sometime in the near future the enemy will start storming our positions, the military officer explained. However, according to him, we are talking about some kind of large-scale offensive, namely assault actions in separate local areas. -I don't mean any big offensive, but assault operations will begin on one of the sections of the combat line,- said Vladyslav Voloshyn. Also, the spokesman of the -Tavria- military command center named the most threatened sections of the combat confrontation line in the South. — The most dangerous look, and we know about it, that the opponents are preparing to carry out assaults there, this is the area in the Vremivsk direction, where the settlements of Levadne and Rivnopil are located. This is a plot near Gulyaipol. This is a section of the battle line, the so-called Robotynsky salient, where our counteroffensive took place and certain territories were liberated, the military said. There, the enemy will try to align the battle line. -In addition, there is certain information that on the coastal territory on the left side of the Dnieper, where Kamianske is located, the enemy is also concentrating a certain amount of forces and means for the preparation of assault groups with further assault actions,- said the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV . Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the zone responsibility of the -Tavria- military command center, the Russian command uses a wide variety of units from different military districts of the Russian Federation, the quality of personnel training in which differs significantly.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/na-pivdni-okupanty-gotuyutsya-do-shturmiv-yaki-dilyanky-najbilsh-zagrozheni/	2024-11-09T09:42:37-08:00

Survival and Fear of the Commander: The motivation and drive of the occupiers remain unchanged	A representative of the communications service told about this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon with the public of the -Charter- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev. -Their basic motivation is survival, their basic driver is fear of the commander and the barriers,- he said. Soldiers of the Russian army do not trust their own commanders and do not expect any help when wounded. Their only chance to stay alive is to surrender in captivity. — They understand that if they are injured, they have virtually no chance of evacuation or quality tactical medicine. Therefore, most of those who come to us to surrender, they come with injuries, expecting that at least here they have a chance to survive, - said the soldier. However, despite a low level of critical thinking and only basic training, the enemy remains dangerous due to its sheer numbers. — The mere fact of having such a mass of people allows them to be used as consumables. In principle, they have minimal functions: to get here and there, to shoot in this direction, - explained Volodymyr Degtyarev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, who and how who and how is Russia fighting in Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/vyzhyvannya-i-strah-pered-komandyrom-motyvacziya-ta-rushij-okupantiv-lyshayutsya-nezminnymy/	2024-11-09T09:21:39-08:00

The last personnel reserve of the Russian Federation: the enemy is recruiting teenagers	notifies the Service of Foreign intelligence of Ukraine. The number of vacancies for teenagers aged 14 to 18 increased by 76% during the year. From July to September 2024, the demand for young professionals increased several times. Minors are most actively employed in large companies. In particular, the number of employees under the age of 18 increased ninefold in the -Magnet- retail chain. At the same time, the number of minors working informally is increasing. There are 6 million citizens aged 15 to 17 in the Russian Federation, but a little more than 1% of them work. By the end of 2023, the number of employed persons aged 15 to 17 increased by 40% to 87,000. In 2022, their number was 61.6 thousand. persons The total shortage of personnel in the Russian Federation reaches 5 million people. The involvement of minors is facilitated by the state policy of the Russian Federation aimed at simplifying the employment procedure for them. Employers, in conditions of acute shortage of personnel, are forced to create jobs that involve part-time employment and a flexible schedule especially for young people. A draft law on easing the admission of minors to harmful and dangerous work has been submitted to the -State Duma- of the Russian Federation. Thus, under the conditions of the war, underage workers became a personnel reserve for the Russian Federation against the background of a serious labor shortage.

Expendable material goes on foot and carries everything on itself: who and how is Russia fighting in...	A representative of the communications service told about this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon with the public of the -Charter- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev. — For a long time now, they have mostly been walking. It's about walking quite a long distance to get into the forest strips they still control, he said. The -foot tactics- of the enemy are evidenced by various data, in particular, the losses of the enemy in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Charter- brigade. — If we look at the figures of enemy losses on our site for the past month, we will see that 200 enemies have been destroyed and a total of 20 pieces of equipment. These are mainly light vehicles and light vehicles, motorcycles, ATVs, just one tank. This indicates that, at least in this area, for certain reasons [the technique] is not used, the military said. It is possible to learn about the reasons for the enemy's refusal to use the equipment only on the basis of objective data, since the prisoners that the -charters- manage to capture have an extremely low level of situational awareness. - Why exactly, what are these reasons, we can only make hypotheses, because the captives we take are usually expendable material. All the prisoners we have taken in the last few months are yesterday's prisoners with a very low level of critical thinking. They have no connection with the world, any means of communication is taken away from them. All they know is what their commanders tell them. They get minimal information, the guard explained. The tasks of the enemy soldiers are simple, if not to say primitive - to run to a certain point, deliver some cargo. - Their task is to try to get from point to point where they are met by the next guide and sent on. The calculation is that out of ten, at least a few will make it, and eventually, somewhere in the accumulation point, there will be enough people to make some kind of movement in our direction, Volodymyr Degtyarev said. Equipping such -disposable- enemy combatants is easiest with basic soldier gear. — Basic soldier equipment. Given that they have to carry basically everything on their person, this is the basic small arms. In the forest areas, where they have been for a long time, they have accumulated quite a lot of weapons, which we are trying to track down and destroy. However, in the main, those with whom our fighters face in battle, if we are talking about some shooting battles, are equipped only with basic shooting weapons, the -charter- said. Earlier, ArmyInform explained why the occupiers are saving equipment for Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/vytratnyj-material-jde-pishky-ta-nese-vse-na-sobi-kym-i-yak-voyuye-rosiya-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-11-09T08:42:59-08:00

Fighters of the Belarusian regiment named after Kastus Kalinovsky defeated the Russian assault group. In this they were helped by the automatic grenade launcher Heckler &amp; Koch GMG.

Who is in the boat, who is under it: five men tried to conquer the Tisza on a two-seater watercraft	About this reports State Border Service of Ukraine. The incident happened in the evening when the border patrol noticed a group of people moving quickly towards the border. The attackers had already tried to board the boat, but the craft was too small for everyone, so some men jumped into the river, trying to swim across it on their own. Border guards pulled the men out of the cold water, detained them and took them to a unit where they were able to warm up. The detainees were residents of Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy and Zakarpattia regions. The men said they paid between $8,000 and $11,000 for a -safe- border crossing.

Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces: Drones have become a key element of success on the battlefie...	He wrote about this on his Facebook page. At the monthly meeting with the commanders of the UAV units, General Oleksandr Syrsky listened to the report of the commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Vadym Sukharevskiy, about the creation of drone units and the results of their use in combat conditions. The participants discussed the experience of using drones in difficult circumstances, including the use of interceptors and drones for long-range missions, even in the face of Russian electronic warfare. Considerable attention was paid to the implementation of the latest technologies and tactics of using drones. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine thanked the combat commanders of the unmanned units, in particular the crews of the 414th regiment of the CSW BPS and the 412th battalion of the BPS SBS, for their high level of professionalism and efficiency. He emphasized that despite the difficult weather conditions, the UAV units of the Armed Forces demonstrate high efficiency. The biggest impression on the battlefield is made by strike bomber drones, which have completed more than 7,000 combat missions. During October, these complexes struck more than 52,000 targets, including destroying 129 artillery systems, 221 pieces of radio equipment, and more than 4,000 enemy soldiers. -We continue to destroy the enemy 24/7,- concluded General Oleksandr Syrskyi. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov announced the introduction of a new function in the Rezerv+ application, which allows you to get a postponement from mobilization in an online format.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/zsu-fokusuyutsya-na-rozvytku-bezpilotnyh-system-dlya-posylennya-bojovyh-spromozhnostej/	2024-11-09T04:03:50-08:00
The weather will not stop the enemy's infantry: that will give the defenders the desired result	told about it on the air -Suspilnye News- Captain Yuri Fedorenko, commander of the battalion of unmanned attack air systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirk. — As long as the enemy has manpower, this will not significantly affect, in my opinion, the conduct of hostilities. Again, where it started is my subjective opinion, for the first time mass assaults in any weather - in snow, in rain, and in mud - were carried out precisely by -Wagner- on the flanks of Bakhmut. It didn't matter then - if the equipment doesn't pass, the infantry soldier passes, he said. This was effective for the enemy, but only up to a certain point - as long as he had enough reserves. — It gave results. Regardless of the fact that the losses were disproportionate, the enemy was still able to push through. But, if you remember, at that time at some point they pearl-pearls, it seemed that there was a very difficult situation, and then at some point -Wagner- ran out. They began to be replaced by -regulars-, and at that time the Defense Forces stabilized the situation, Yuriy Fedorenko said. In the same way, even now the enemy will not be able to carry out shock-assault actions without regular replenishment of manpower, which is massively knocked out by units of the Defense Forces. — It is fundamentally important for them to be fed with additional personnel. For this, they are currently using the services of North Korea and are currently building additional personnel in one way or another in order not to stop pressing, the drone commander explained. How long the Russian command will be able to act in this way depends on many factors, primarily on the effectiveness of the destruction of enemy manpower by units of the Defense Forces not only directly on the battle line, but also in the enemy's rear. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast, the enemy is storming with active fire support.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/pogoda-pihotu-voroga-ne-zupynyt-shho-dast-zahysnykam-bazhanyj-rezultat/	2024-11-09T03:39:40-08:00

It feels like it,- he said. The military said what factors affect the effectiveness of UAVs. - Fog, rain, wind, dusk that comes earlier - all this has a significant effect. The weather still makes adjustments and reduces both the enemy's capabilities and certain of our capabilities, Yevgeny Romanov explained. Earlier, ArmyInform explained why in Kharkiv Oblast, Russians walk over their own corpses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/imla-doshh-viter-sutinky-bezpilotnykam-na-harkivshhyni-staye-dedali-vazhche/	2024-11-09T03:21:16-08:00

From a factory guard to a school director: the collaborator turned Vovchansk into a center of Russif...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informed about this. It is noted that an indictment has been sent to the court against a 36-year-old resident of Vovchansk, who is suspected of collaborative activities. According to the investigation, during the occupation of the city of Vovchansk by Russian troops in the summer of 2022, the man agreed to cooperate with the invaders. Before the invasion, he worked as a security guard at a local factory, but after the occupation, he voluntarily took the position of director of school No. 1, created on the basis of the Vovchansky Lyceum. In his new position, the suspect organized the transfer of the educational process to the Russian language and planned to teach Ukrainian schoolchildren according to Russian educational standards. He also collected lists of teachers to send to courses in Belgorod and received methodological recommendations from the occupation administration. In September 2022, before the deoccupation of the city by the Armed Forces, the man fled with the Russian military to the territory of the Russian Federation. He is currently wanted, and his case will be heard in absentia in the Chuguyiv City Court. The suspect faces up to three years in prison. As reported by ArmyInform, the man who became the hero of the propaganda video and organized the broadcast of Russian channels.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/dyrektor-kolaborant-peretvoryuvav-vovchansk-na-oseredok-rusyfikacziyi/	2024-11-09T02:51:10-08:00
UAVs, -solntsepok-, FPV-drones: in Kharkiv Oblast, the enemy is storming with active fire support	About this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- spoken the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Lt. Col. Yevgeny Romanov. — The enemy does not stop storming the positions of Ukrainian troops in the Vovchansk region. With the support of air strikes, the enemy tried 5 times to storm the positions of Ukrainian servicemen, but all these attempts were in vain. An enemy that advanced like this and was left lying on the battlefield, he said. The spokesman told what forces and means the occupiers use during the assaults — usually they use powerful KAB strikes. Tonight, 5 rockets were used against the TOS-A-1 -Sunset- flamethrower system, FPV drones are used and, of course, artillery fire, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast Ukrainian soldiers burned two enemy heavy flamethrower systems.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/kaby-solnczepok-fpv-drony-na-harkivshhyni-vorog-shturmuye-za-aktyvnoyi-vognevoyi-pidtrymky/	2024-11-09T02:38:53-08:00
Animal fear, 15 kilometers on foot and 90% loss of equipment: why in Kharkiv Oblast Russians walk ov...	told about it on the air -Suspilnye News- Captain Yuri Fedorenko, commander of the battalion of unmanned attack air systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirk. — [Enemy] tactics remain the same. When the enemy has the opportunity to actively use lightly armored or armored vehicles, he uses them. But the enemy loses a significant amount of this equipment on the battlefield - up to 90%, which is in the zone of damage of both our anti-tank weapons and drones. For long-range logistics, the enemy will use light armored vehicles quite actively, he said. When the enemy's armored vehicles run out, the occupiers switch to motorcycles and buggies, and when they run out, they go on foot. — When the enemy runs out of this technique, he resorts to assaults at the expense of highly maneuverable vehicles - two-wheeled motorcycles, buggies, other pickup-type vehicles. When they are lacking in a moment of time, it is mostly living power. They move along landings, run across a clear field and thus try to shorten the distance as much as possible and accumulate, the military said. In some places, enemy soldiers have to cover very considerable distances on foot just to reach their own forward positions or assault lines. — At some rallies, the enemy went through the entrance to advanced positions in the region of 12-15 kilometers. Step by step, they are trying to reach, accumulate and move to shock-assault actions, Yuriy Fedorenko said. At the same time, the losses of the occupiers are extremely high, but they still continue to go. — During such movements, the enemy suffers very significant losses, indeed very significant losses. The question arises why they stick, why they do not surrender to captivity, which can motivate in a clean field to run from one landing to another, realizing that out of 8 people who run, out of 8 occupants who run, one or two will catch up, they are see what motivates you to move forward? - the officer asked the question and then answered it himself. According to the commander of the drones, the occupiers are driven by an animal fear of their own henchmen. — This is an animal fear of one's spouse. The occupier understands that if he returns to the rear, he will not be able to be heard by his own - he is guaranteed to be either destroyed or publicly punished, and there are still a number of tools and coercion. Therefore, the occupier chooses death on the battlefield rather than returning to his people, he explained. For the first time, the Russians saw the effectiveness of the described tactics and attitude towards their own soldiers under Bakhmut and later scaled it to the entire Russian army. — This tactic gave the enemy results during the Bakhmut campaign, when the -Wagner- was pushed forward. After that, the Russian occupying forces assumed that manpower is the cheapest resource, that this tactic works, and today most units of the Russian occupying forces - both contractors and those that support them - special forces and private military companies of the type -Storm Zet-, Yuriy Fedorenko told. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that mozhe/->in the Kupyan region in the Kharkiv region, the enemy -does everything they can-, suffering colossal losses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/tvarynnyj-strah-15-kilometriv-pishky-ta-90-vtrat-tehniky-chomu-na-harkivshhyni-rosiyany-jdut-po-vlasnyh-trupah/	2024-11-09T02:21:42-08:00

The defense forces managed to hold the enemy in those areas where we are carrying out combat missions, he said. However, the situation at different points where the Achilles fighters are defending is different. — This is a shade of Hlyboky, where the initiative is fully in the hands of the Defense Forces.

However, during the past day, despite numerous attempts of assaults, the Russian occupiers did not manage to achieve any success. — Over the past day, the enemy had no success at the rally, managed to repulse numerous attacks and hold all positions.

Ukrainian companies will participate in the production of women's military uniforms for NATO	About this informs the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. This was discussed at a meeting chaired by the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General of Justice Serhiy Melnyk. In particular, Ukrainian manufacturers can participate in the production and supply of a part of women's military uniforms, which will be financed by the countries of the Alliance. It is about more than 10,000 sets of uniforms, shoes and other equipment for female military personnel worth $7 million. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken announced the transfer of this form earlier. To participate in NATO tenders, Ukrainian manufacturers need to register on the NSPA trading platform, which unites potential suppliers for the Alliance. After agreeing on all organizational issues, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine will be able to provide recommendations to reliable domestic manufacturers for participation in NATO tenders. This will allow faster and better provision of the Defense Forces of Ukraine within the limits of international assistance. Also, during November and December of this year, a number of meetings with NATO representatives are planned, during which the Ukrainian side will discuss opportunities to accelerate the transfer of military uniforms for female military servicemen from partners to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -This cooperation with NATO countries will contribute to attracting additional funds to the Ukrainian economy, which is especially important in terms of repelling a large-scale Russian invasion,- said Deputy Defense Minister Serhiy Melnyk.

You can't even call this a drone: the French military is interested in the MALE Aarok UAV weighing 5...	UAV developer Turgis &amp; Gaillard is actively promote to the market its MALE Aarok drone (Medium Altitude Long Endurance, in Ukrainian - great endurance at medium altitude), ArmiyaInform reports. French developers, when presenting the new Aarok drone, immediately called it the first European military drone of the MALE class. MALE is an American acronym for the medium-altitude, long-duration drone community. Thus, Aarok MALE can be considered a direct competitor and analogue of the American reconnaissance and strike drone MQ-9 Reaper (-Reaper-), which our editors detailed told in one of her publications. Interestingly, the French drone is developed by a comparatively small private company, Turgis &amp; Gaillard. The company was founded in 2011, has about 300 employees, and an annual turnover of 50 million euros. The 5.5-ton UAV will stay in the air for 24 hours thanks to a turboprop engine that produces 1,200 horsepower and is relatively quiet. According to unofficial information, the power plant will be the Ardiden 3TP Safran engine. At the air show in France, a model with a PT6 engine from the Canadian branch of Pratt &amp; Whitney. The manufacturer separately emphasizes the high strength characteristics of its drone, which allows it to take off even from unprepared airstrips. It is possible to operate from ground airfields in any weather conditions in the automatic take-off and landing mode. The cruising speed of the French drone is 250 knots - 463 km/h, the cruising altitude is 9150 meters (echelon FL300). Technical characteristics of Aarok: Like the American Reaper, the French drone Aarok can stay in the air for up to one day. This allows the use of UAVs to operate over the open sea for maritime patrol and reconnaissance tasks. The drone is equipped with a retractable landing gear. Among the interesting features, the optical-electronic surveillance station is installed closer to the tail of the drone. The station includes electro-optical and infrared cameras and a laser range finder. Laser target illumination and guidance of guided weapons are possible. In the middle part of the drone's fuselage, a multi-mode radar can be installed, which is used, among other things, for ground surveillance and mapping tasks. It is also possible to search for sea and air targets. The manufacturer reports that the drone can carry up to 4 high-precision guided munitions (GPS-INS, laser or infrared guidance) weighing 250 kg or up to two munitions weighing 500 kg each. The stated target engagement range is 35 km. In addition, the drone can carry up to 16 air-to-ground missiles with a range of up to 15 km. Most likely, we are talking about AGM-114 Hellfire missiles or analogs, specific models are not disclosed. Compared to its competitors, the UAV is much lighter and cheaper than the EuroDrone, which is currently being developed by Airbus Defense &amp; Space. In the future, the French Air Force should receive six EuroDrone systems, currently four copies have been ordered for an amount of approximately 2 billion euros. General Stéphane Mille, chief of staff of France's Air and Space Forces, thinks it is a -quite attractive- aircraft, reported by the Zone Militaire portal. -And I'm willing to pay to see, because there is sometimes a gap between what we announce and what we can do,- he told a parliamentary hearing. -Aarok is a very interesting project, to be very clear. Overall, the work is of a high quality and is carried out in a relationship of trust between Turgis &amp; Gaillard and the departments of the Ministry,- noted the country's Minister of Armed Forces, Sebastien Lecornu.

Massive attacks by Shaheds: why the enemy chose such tactics and how many reserves he has. Expert op...	-There are several reasons why Russia started to use Shaheda so massively against Ukraine. The first is geopolitics. Elections were held in the USA, there is a new president. And all geopolitics today is built on strength. Putin is showing the collective West and the USA that Ukraine remains important to him and the Russian Federation. And in order to stop this horror of war, he trivially raises the stakes. He wants to be spoken to on the terms he needs. The second point is also related to Donald Trump. During the election campaign, Trump announced that he would end the war in 24 hours, and that he would end aid to Ukraine as such. Russians have a very simple logic. If the US stops helping Ukraine, then missiles for Patriot air defense systems will become less, as well as for all other types of weapons, for example, for Stinger MANPADS. By the way, our defenders perfectly beat the Shaheds with them. That is, the Russians want to use their relatively inexpensive UAVs to deplete the Ukrainian stockpile of anti-aircraft missiles. Fewer rockets means a lower knockdown ratio. And then, according to the classics, launch a major missile attack on Kyiv and Ukraine. For the occupiers, our capital is not only the main goal in their war of aggression against Ukraine, it is also a sacred place. They cannot accept that the -Russian city- is resisting. Therefore, daily UAV attacks are another attempt to put constant psychological pressure on the population, with the aim of breaking the motivation for resistance. Rashists think that sooner or later the people of Kyiv will not endure and will start internal riots against Ukrainian statehood itself. He said, it is necessary to end these horrors of war and to agree on something. This is absurd. What is the enemy's logic? Even if at least one -Shahed- has achieved its goal, it does not matter whether it is a critical infrastructure object or a residential building, then the terror must continue. Another goal of the Kremlin is the economic terror of the Kyiv agglomeration, which is the largest in Ukraine. Many large enterprises that pay taxes to the state budget are concentrated here. When an air alert is declared, all these businesses cease operations. Accordingly, output decreases, and this, of course, leads to a decrease in tax revenues. After receiving in the second half of 2022 the first batch of Iranian Shahed UAVs, Russia was able to launch their mass production on its territory, as well as significantly modify them. The enemy managed to increase the production of -Shaheed- to about 2,000 pieces per month. That's a pretty big number. But, I think, they will not go higher. They have the highest explosives production capacity. They managed to raise by 30% the production of alcohol compounds used in explosives, gunpowder and aluminum powder. They also have a problem with the workforce. Of course, there are enough workers. But everything that they could put in order, they have already put in place. Without the direct help of China and Iran, the Russians will not be able to further increase the production of Shaheds.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/masovani-ataky-shahedamy-chomu-vorog-obrav-taku-taktyku-i-na-skilky-u-nogo-vystachyt-zapasiv-dumka-eksperta/	2024-11-08T20:48:50-08:00
Subletting and lifting: about the amount of payments and why it is profitable to enter into a contra...	What is the difference between -sub-hire- and -elevation-, and who can receive such assistance, ArmiyaInform tells. This is, in fact, compensation for housing rent at the place of service. It is paid if the serviceman does not have his own housing in this territory. It should be noted right away that the procedure for issuing compensation is not very simple and fast. And it may also require certain costs, in particular for obtaining certificates. The basis for payment is a serviceman's report, as well as list of documents, determined by Cabinet Resolution No. 450. But if you go this way and arrange everything, you can get quite a good amount of compensation. In particular, the following amounts have been set for 2024: For servicemen with three or more family members, compensation amounts will increase by one and a half times. This is the assistance that is provided in the event of the relocation of servicemen to a new place of military service in another settlement in connection with appointment to a military position, enrollment in military educational institutions and military colleges or training centers, the term of study in which is six months and more, without retaining the position at the previous place of service or in connection with the redeployment of the military unit. Or after graduating from military educational institutions with appointment to positions in units in other settlements. More details about who can receive such assistance is prescribed in the Order of the Ministry of Defense No. 45. How much is paid? Moving allowance is paid in the amount of a monthly allowance for a military serviceman and 50 percent of a monthly allowance for each member of his family who moved with him to a new place of military service; Per diems are also paid for each day of stay on the road to a serviceman and each member of his family who moved with him. Who are considered family members? These are the persons listed in the serviceman's personal file, in particular: How many times can you receive in the event of a frequent change of duty station? Moving allowance is paid no more than for two moves of a serviceman during a calendar year. What is needed? They are paid on the basis of the order of the commander of the military unit, which is issued on the basis of the serviceman's report. In addition, the order specifies whether the wife (husband) is a military serviceman. If necessary, the commander can organize verification of the authenticity of data on the relocation of family members of a serviceman. If both the husband and the wife are military servicemen, the lifting allowance for each of them is paid at the new place of military service, for family members - from the monthly allowance of one of them. Currently, this applies to servicemen serving under a contract or enlisted officers. Unfortunately, mobilized servicemen do not have such an opportunity. But this may be one of the motivating factors for signing a contract with the Armed Forces of Ukraine. More about the opportunities provided by the contract service you can read here. And about the peculiarities of concluding a contract martial law actions, here.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/pidnajom-i-pidjomni-pro-rozmir-vyplat-i-chomu-vygidno-ukladaty-kontrakt/	2024-11-08T20:36:47-08:00

In addition to the traditional grammatical errors in the text of the screenshot, which indicate a fake, any user of -Actions- will notice a font that is not typical for this application. This fake is another propaganda attempt to discredit the Ukrainian state system and inflame tension in society by spreading false information about the alleged forced imposition of Ukrainian identity on citizens. In addition, the fake name change is a typical example of -mirroring-. For Ukrainians, such practices are absolutely atypical, but for Russians, the compulsion to change names and surnames to ones that are considered Russian is a phenomenon that has been widespread since the 17th century. In the 30s and 40s of the 20th century, the -Russification- of surnames became massive in the USSR: on the one hand, people saved themselves from repression, on the other, they sought career growth, which was impossible with a -non-Russian- surname. Among the most famous examples is the father of the ex-leader of the Ministry of Murder of the Russian Federation, Shoigu Kuzhuget, who, in order to appear more -Russian- and to pursue a party career, changed his first and last name. Even now, the Russians have not given up on this: in the occupied Ukrainian territories, people are encouraged to change their Ukrainian surnames when obtaining Russian passports.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/buv-lebedyev-stav-lebedenko-rf-poshyryuye-fejk-pro-ukrayinizacziyu-prizvyshh-v-diyi/	2024-11-08T20:09:33-08:00

Patrolling of the airspace of the United States of America, including F-16 fighters, is carried out as part of the comprehensive control of North American airspace and airspace, which is provided, implemented and coordinated by the United States and Canada's Joint Aerospace Defense System. The joint US-Canadian air defense and missile defense system is subordinate to the North American Aerospace Defense Command. Abbreviated from the first letters of its name in English, it is known as NORAD. NORAD's headquarters and command center are located at the US Peterson Air Force Base, but the command is joint US-Canadian and is responsible for the airspace security of both countries. There are three regional headquarters under his command: the Alaska NORAD region at Elmendorf Air Force Base; the Canadian NORAD Region in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and the Continental NORAD Region at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. An F-16 Fighting Falcon from the Minnesota ANG performs a simulated interception of an aerial target during the EAA AirVenture 2024 air show in Oshkosh, Wisconsin NORAD's primary mission is to protect the sovereign airspaces of both nations by responding to unknown, unwanted, and unauthorized actions in the airspace. and the surrounding area of ​​North America. Forces and assets under NORAD monitor the airspace around the clock with the aim of detecting unauthorized actions, track air targets and, if necessary, carry out a set of measures with the aim of diverting them from their flight path, forcing them to land or destroying them if they can pose a potential threat. NORAD works in close cooperation with the US National Guard, law enforcement agencies, special services and all other components of the security and defense forces of the United States of America and Canada. Patrolling American airspace, NORAD pays increased attention to the places of stay of the President of the United States. The American media has repeatedly drawn attention to the significant increase in costs for the security of the first person of the state, including due to the fact that F-16 fighters must be constantly in the air with the support of refueling aircraft in order to provide combat air patrol (CAP) within the limits of the temporary no-fly zone around the president. During the presidential elections in the United States, the protection of the candidates for the position of the President of the United States is provided not only by the Secret Service, which is responsible for the protection of senior political figures, but also by other components of the security and defense forces of the state. This year, even the Pentagon joined the protection of candidates in the presidential elections. NORAD is also traditionally involved in patrolling the airspace in the places of rallies and other meetings of candidates for the President of the United States of America with voters. This was done both during the recent presidential race and in previous election campaigns. Increased attention to the protection of US presidential candidates is fully justified, because assassination attempts are quite frequent. Among the latest high-profile cases, we can mention the assassination attempt on the now elected US President Donald Trump on July 13, 2024 at a campaign rally in the town of Butler near Pittsburgh in the state of Pennsylvania. Then the bullet hit Trump's ear, which for a while became a symbol of the unity of the electoral core of voters around the figure of a charismatic candidate. Judging by the results of the vote, the shots to the side and next to the candidate for President of the United States ultimately contributed to his victory. However, this is far from the only and not the first time that Donald Trump's life was or could be in potential danger during the election campaign. During one of these incidents, an F-16 patrol fighter of the NORAD mission took a prominent part in preventing a possible attempt on his life. The incident occurred during a Donald Trump campaign rally on October 28, 2020 at Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport in Bullhead City, Arizona, when an unidentified aircraft entered the closed airspace without authorization, creating a potential threat to the then-current To the President of the United States of America. The pilot of the offending aircraft did not communicate with the air traffic controller and did not respond to radio warnings. NORAD's statement on the incident states: -A NORAD F-16 aircraft tracked a general aviation aircraft that failed to communicate with air traffic control and entered the temporary restricted flight area around Bullhead City, Arizona without proper clearance.- Seeing that the offending aircraft did not respond in any way to the initial interception procedures, the F-16 fighter pilot fired a warning shot, using flares to attract attention. After that, it was possible to establish radio communication with the offending aircraft and it was taken out of the prohibited zone. The firing of F-16 flares became a bright part of the pre-election show. The US president and the crowd of protesters in his support were delighted by what they saw, although they did not understand exactly what was happening. -Oh look at that! Look, look, look! They pointed to the future President! How about that?- - shouted Donald Trump, instantly noticing how to take advantage of the situation. After that, the politician, who is prone to outrage and is not picky in his words, did not forget to scold the Democrats and the American media. According to him, they never report or show anything really interesting and important, and even seem to have deliberately turned the cameras in the other direction in order not to film the F-16. It is not difficult to make sure that Donald Trump's statements turned out to be far from reality - the incident was reported in detail by dozens of local and national American media. Instead, the statement that the F-16 pointed to the future President of the United States by firing signal missiles turned out to be quite true, although somewhat premature. Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential race then but won the current 2024 US Presidential election by a landslide.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/08/f-16-zahystyv-donalda-trampa-odnak-ne-vluchyv-shhodo-kadencziyi/	2024-11-07T20:58:47-08:00
It destroys what it cannot seize: the Kremlin already realizes that it will not be able to take Odes...	Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmiyaInform about this: -Ukraine is one of the five largest countries exporting grain and leguminous crops in the world. Almost 500 million people around the world are supplied with Ukrainian grain, primarily African countries. This is a huge number. This is also a serious source of foreign currency income for our state. Therefore, the Russian strikes are aimed at reducing the export potential of Ukraine, which for grain and other crops is carried out mainly by sea. racists want to undermine our country economically. There is an important nuance. Russia is also among the top 5 grain exporting countries. The Russian Federation produces from 70 to 140 million tons per year and sells two thirds of it. So if we do not grow and sell our grain to foreign markets, then Moscow will replace us, enrich itself even more and replenish the budget for military purposes to continue the war of aggression against Ukraine. An interesting point. If the Russians set about destroying our port infrastructure, this is a sign that the Russian Federation will no longer be able to return Ukraine to its circle of interests. If the enemy understood that he could completely return Ukraine, he would not destroy the golden hen that lays the golden eggs. That is, the Kremlin already realizes that it will not be able to take Odeschyna. We need to strengthen our air defense, particularly in the south. There is a reflection on the part of South Korea regarding the transfer of anti-aircraft missile systems of their production to us. This is the Cheolmae-2 medium-range air defense system, a rough analogue of the German IRIS-T system. By the way, the Korean complex was developed using technologies from the Russian S-350 and S-400 air defense systems. Maximum range to the target: 40 km. But, again, we must understand that it will not be possible to completely close the airspace over Ukraine. Even if the maximum number of air defense systems is installed in Ukraine, there will still be a breakthrough.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/08/znyshhuye-te-shho-ne-mozhe-zahopyty-kreml-vzhe-usvidomlyuye-shho-vzyaty-odeshhynu-ne-zmozhe-dumka-eksperta/	2024-11-07T20:53:15-08:00
-- Russians? Drop your weapon-! They didn't quit. And I shot: as Junior Sergeant Dobosh broke throug...	Mr. Ilya is 48 years old. In the army - since May 2022. Joined the ranks of the 51st separate rifle battalion of the 63rd separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Military accounting specialty is machine gunner. Behind his back is a term of service in the Crimea, in Feodosia, from 1994 to 1996, after Ukraine declared independence. Served in the ranks of the construction battalion. He recalls how his military unit could not -say goodbye- to the Soviet -stars- on their uniforms for a long time - although the neighboring unit had already switched to tridents. In civilian life, he managed to master many professions: a driver, a logger, a security guard, and a forester. Originally from Transcarpathia - from Mukachevo. -Why did I join the army in 2022? Because I understood that if everyone stays at home, then the Russians can be at my doorstep. Besides, my brothers went to war. When I learned about it, I also went to war. Do I regret going into the army all the time of the full-scale war? No,- says the army man. The military man has a number of hot spots behind him, including battles for Bakhmut. Now he is on the difficult Lyman direction. The other day, at the end of October, during combat missions, he destroyed up to 10 enemy personnel and prevented a breakthrough in his position. The military recalls: -I was just at training - mastering a new combat vehicle, MTLB. He came back on Saturday, on Monday he took a turn at the front. And here they go, 20 meters away from me. I ask: -Russians? Drop the weapon!-. They lined up like goslings. The weapon was not thrown. I shot. A few hours later, a new batch arrived. They were also shot,- the unit commander succinctly recalls. The most terrible thing, says Mr. Ilya, during a large-scale invasion was when the brothers were on one side of the battle, and he was on the other. -It was scary whether I would see them again: whether I would survive or they would survive. Then it was really scary. But everyone survived, thank God. It's hard to lose your friends&#8230; Recently, I lost a close friend: a landmine flew and he was cut by shrapnel. I pulled him out of the trench, he was dragged into the car on a stretcher, but, unfortunately, he was not taken to the hospital. Three children remained and the wife&#8230; -. Mr. Ilya suffered a concussion during those events. Now undergoing treatment. But they try to find time during the war for jokes - where would we go without that. -Once they said to the fellow: -Listen, the commander was urgently looking for you! Run as fast as you can to him!-. He rushed, ran 300 meters, and only then remembered that the commander was on vacation. He stopped and turned around - and my friends and I were lying there, laughing,- Mr. Ilya recalls. The need for people in his department is palpable, says Mr. Ilya. But he emphasizes that reliable fighters are needed. -I have to be sure of my brother - that he will not let me down and will not run away anywhere. As in his commander. And this, in fact, is one of the main tasks of the commander: the fighter should not be afraid of him. He should, by his own behavior, encourage him to perform his duty well, and not to -jump on his skis- and go home. You have to treat your soldiers humanely, otherwise he won't be a good soldier, he won't want to serve.- When asked what victory will be in the Russian-Ukrainian war, Mr. Ilya answers: -When I return to my family. When my brothers, alive and well, return to their families. Someday there will come a time when we will all gather in some cafe and sit together, remember the service, remember those who are not with us. Let's remember all the good and not so much. This will be a victory for me.- Photo from the personal archive of Ilya Dobosh	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/08/rosiyany-kydajte-zbroyu-ne-kynuly-ya-j-postrilyav-yak-molodshyj-serzhant-dobosh-proryv-na-lymanskomu-napryamku-vidbyvav/	2024-11-07T20:26:46-08:00

Jumping into holes and pretending to be a hose: the Russians are trying to save themselves somehow	The head of the planning department of the 13th brigade of the operational assignment -Charter- of the National Guards of Ukraine Lieutenant Colonel Anton Baev. - They have chosen such a system - we partly forced them to this, because during their movement we constantly inflict fire damage on them, constantly hit them. They hide in those -holes- that they equip and dig on the routes of their tracking. A very large number of -burrows-, everywhere along all the routes they mainly use, he said. The guardsman described the usual tactics of the occupiers: - When the fire attack begins, there is a -hole- somewhere, where they all climb. If not everyone climbs there, then they hide under the trees. In the same case, if Russian soldiers are found while moving in open areas where there is no shelter, they fall down and pretend to be dead. — If we find them in some areas where their usual tactics are impossible, then they simply fall down and either pretend to be dead, or just lie there and not move, hoping that they will not be seen. But it doesn't work, the military man emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform explained that prompts Russians to surrender as prisoners in Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/strybayut-u-nory-i-prykydayutsya-shlangom-na-harkivshhyni-rosiyany-namagayutsya-vryatuvatysya-hoch-by-yak/	2024-11-07T11:53:25-08:00

Distrust and trust: what motivates Russians to surrender in Kharkiv Oblast	This was told by the commander of the 13th Brigade of the operational assignment -Charter- of the National Guards of Ukraine Colonel Ihor Obolenskyi. — During several months of defense of Kharkiv Oblast, -Charter- fighters took more than a dozen prisoners. Very often, prisoners surrender already during the wounding due to despair in their troops.

Captured Russians complain of lack of support from their own Russian people and indifference from henchmen and command. — Very often they cry, complain that no one helps them, that Ukrainians treat them much better than their own people. Unlike the Russians, our soldiers help captured enemy fighters, because we understand that each of them is a possible prisoner exchange. Each of them is a possible life of a Ukrainian soldier who will be returned to our land, Ihor Obolenskyi emphasized. The Charter commander explained how important prisoner exchanges are for every Ukrainian soldier. — When we see that such exchanges happen, when our fighters return home, we see their eyes, their happiness, then for us and for all the soldiers of our brigade, this is a sign that our political power President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi Head of Office Andriy Yermak, Parliament all in order for our fighters to return home. So we are grateful for that, said the soldier. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Kharkiv direction, Russian soldiers are more afraid of their own commanders than of Ukrainian ones of the military, but they surrender only because there is no way out.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/znevira-i-dovira-shho-sponukaye-rosiyan-zdavatysya-v-polon-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-11-07T11:07:05-08:00

Reinforced concrete or earth holes: can the enemy gain a foothold in the north of Kharkiv region	The head of the planning department of the 13th brigade of the operational assignment -Charter- of the National Guards of Ukraine Lieutenant Colonel Anton Baev. - Enter immediately and it is possible to pour concrete if the enemy enters and we do not have a stable line of defense. Currently, there is no such situation in our direction. We see everything that happens. We hold the lines, we are entrenched and equipped, we control all approaches, approaches of armored vehicles for 5-8 kilometers, he said. The military explained that it allows to control the actions of the enemy, who has no way to build powerful fortifications or shelters. — The enemy was forced to walk small for long distances to their positions. Sometimes even the route from point A to point B can take more than 24 hours. We see them, we accompany them. Therefore, we are not talking about any kind of concrete here, - emphasized the officer. However, this does not mean that the occupiers are not trying to fortify themselves - they are constantly digging earthen shelters. - Digging - yes, they dig all the time. They dig with a tool, they dig without a tool, but there is no concrete at the moment, Anton Baev emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the military explained the importance of evacuating civilian residents from the north of Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/zalizobeton-abo-zemlyani-nory-chy-mozhe-vorog-zakripytys-na-pivnochi-harkivshhyny/	2024-11-07T10:32:47-08:00

Property is not worth life: the military explained the importance of evacuation from the north of Kh...	About the importance of timely evacuation on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon the representative of the communications service told Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev of the -Charter- Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine. — Liptsi is a strategic settlement, because it is located on commanding heights and from there it is possible to hit Kharkiv with barrel artillery. From there, we managed to knock out the Russians back in May, and we continue to knock them out [further]. However, now it is practically a ghost village with no civilians because it is constantly hit by both FPVs and other means and artillery, he said. The military officer noted that there are no hostilities on the territory of the village itself, but it is absolutely impossible to live in it under constant fire from the Russian military. — There are no hostilities as such, but there is no life there, no population, because all civilians have been evacuated from there. And here I would like to remind you about the importance of evacuation from front-line zones because property is not worth human life - the Guardsman noted that the evacuation of civilians from the zone of active hostilities also significantly facilitates the work of the Ukrainian military and gave a specific example when the absence of civilians made it possible to neutralize a Russian manned aircraft a bomb that did not explode. — It makes it easier to get around, to locate, and basically to work. For example, recently our sappers had to neutralize an unexploded anti-aircraft gun that fell into one of the sheds right in Liptsi. There is no possibility to take out the KAB, that is, they have to be blown up. This is an explosive wave that can reach a quarter, and it is obvious that we definitely need to be sure that there are no civilians nearby, Volodymyr Degtyarev emphasized. Earlier, ArmiyaInform showed how the -Charter- fighters destroyed a 500-kilogram KAB in Liptsi.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/majno-ne-varte-zhyttya-vijskovi-poyasnyly-vazhlyvist-evakuacziyi-z-pivnochi-harkivshhyny/	2024-11-07T09:11:55-08:00

The fog hides everything: in the north of the Kharkiv region, the enemy is being watched despite the...	The head of the planning department of the 13th brigade of the operational assignment -Charter- of the National Guards of Ukraine Lieutenant Colonel Anton Baev. — Weather conditions are changing and are currently changing for the worse. We are seeing more phenomena such as fogs, which last longer during the day and are very disruptive. It starts to get darker earlier, the night part of the day gets longer, more cold comes. That is, the conditions of the war are changing and now everyone is adapting to them, both us and the enemy, he said. However, the activity of the enemy in view of the weather conditions has not decreased - the occupiers are intensively preparing for the onset of winter with further significant cooling. — The enemy is currently accumulating, pulling up its reserves. We see enemy soldiers approaching with heavier loads, gear and equipment. Perhaps they are bringing to their positions and preparing various insulation for winter, the military said. Instead, enemy offensive actions in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Charter- brigade decreased. — The enemy has not carried out offensive actions in the last 2-3 days. Armored vehicles were not recorded, but a lot of movements are recorded, the guardsman noted. The officer explained that the weather affects both sides equally, and who uses it to their advantage depends a lot on planning and preparation. — The weather affects both sides equally: both us and the enemy. How to use it depends on the task and the mind of those who use it. But the fact that it complicates the work is precisely because even the same intelligence - both winged intelligence and intelligence through drones that is taking place - its quality becomes worse, the officer explained. This forces the soldiers of the Defense Forces to look for new ways to detect the enemy, and not just rely on the usual reconnaissance with the help of UAVs. — We understand that we can no longer fly so far, we can't hang for so long, the fog hides everything, that is, thermal imaging devices on drones do not always help. This is a powerful factor that greatly affects intelligence and it is necessary to take it under close control and constantly look for some alternative sources of information and somehow solve it, because there is less information due to the fact that we do not see each other, Anton Baev emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform explained, who will take advantage of the change in weather conditions in the Kharkiv direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/tuman-vse-pryhovuye-na-pivnochi-harkivshhyny-za-vorogom-stezhat-popry-zminu-pogodnyh-umov/	2024-11-07T08:27:09-08:00

At first, the pilots of the 14th brigade of operational assignment -Chervona Kalina- tracked the enemy's infantry, waited for them to enter the dugout, and after that began to destroy their positions. After the -Baga Yaga- worked, the -dragon drones- began to destroy the Russians. In the Kharkiv region, drone operators from the -Sharp Cartouches- special unit of the NSU -Omega- tracked down three Russians who were calmly chatting near a burning house. Due to the noise from the fire, the enemy did not hear how our drone with a reset hovered above it, so the pilots had enough time to aim. The mine clearly got between the Russians, two of them managed to get away on their own, and one of them landed in the place of the drop. The Ukrainian Su-25 destroys the Russians with four unguided S-24 missiles. Usually S-24 is used to destroy fortifications and manpower in shelters.

A representative of the communications service told about this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon with the public of the -Charter- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev. — The weather is getting worse, weather conditions are getting more difficult. At night, in the morning and for most of the day, there is fog, which, accordingly, limits the use of UAVs, both reconnaissance and strike, both enemy and ours, he said. The military explained that the more prepared side will be able to take better advantage of the change in weather conditions. - It is clear that this is used by someone who is prepared for it. From our side, we see that the enemy is trying to bring down separate small groups of fighters, to replenish their losses, which they have suffered in recent weeks, in particular in our sector, - said the guardsman. Currently, in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Charter- brigade, the occupiers have practically given up the use of equipment. - They practically do not use trucks, cars, and armored vehicles, because we have successfully burned almost everything that appears in recent weeks. Therefore, their tactic is to move in small groups that carry ammunition, food, rigging groups trying to bring in some fuel, - said Volodymyr Degtyarev. The spokesperson of -Charter- reported that currently, despite the deterioration of weather conditions, the guardsmen continue to effectively destroy the enemy with the help of heavy night drones. - We understand from the intercepts, we hear that they are restless, because, despite the weather, our night drones continue to disturb them, bomb their fortifications every night. They have difficulties with evacuation, because it is practically non-existent, because the equipment does not come, so most of their wounded remain there and sooner or later turn into two hundred, - said the representative of the public relations service. He also spoke about the enemy's losses during October. — If we look at the results of enemy losses for the past month, we can see that we hit a hundred and they will never see this world again, and more than a hundred are wounded. However, it is possible to assume with great probability that these losses are also irreversible, - noted Volodymyr Degtyarev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Russians are gradually being -pushed out- - from the north of the Kharkiv region - in October, they completed the de-occupation of 400 hectares of forest massif within the boundaries of the Lipetsk community of the Kharkiv region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/pole-boyu-v-tumani-vijny-hto-skorystayetsya-zminoyu-pogodnyh-umov-na-harkivskomu-napryamku/	2024-11-07T05:52:16-08:00

A similar function in the Russian Federation is performed by -Cossack communities-, which the Russians set up on the TOT with the same goal. Now the Kremlin has decided to merge these two fake structures. Hoping in this way to at least slightly increase the number of fighters in the -battalions-, as well as to emphasize the narrative that, they say, -Cossacks- support the aggressor. However, all these reorganizations are not successful, because, as mentioned above, these structures are not capable of carrying out combat tasks and are just a mass that lives on grant funds from Moscow. We would like to remind you that in the Russian Federation oil refining is being stopped.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/vorog-planuye-integruvaty-kozakiv-do-fejkovyh-dobrovolchyh-bataljoniv-na-tot/	2024-11-07T04:49:43-08:00

Sanctions work: oil refining stops in the Russian Federation	This is reported by Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The shutdown of the refinery is predicted to have a negative impact on the domestic volumes of oil refining, the fulfillment of export obligations, worsen the situation with the supply of fuel to the domestic market, and increase the costs of maintenance and modernization of enterprises. It is expected that the volume of oil refining capacities during downtime will be 1.8–2 million tons per month. The real reasons for the downtime of the refinery in the Russian Federation are limited access to Western equipment and components due to international sanctions and the impossibility of replacing foreign spare parts necessary for the maintenance and modernization of the refinery. In fact, the Russian import substitution program did not produce significant results. Actually, Russian equipment manufacturers provide only about 30-45% of market needs, and only in some components (pumps, compressors, reactors, etc.). Also, the Russian Federation failed to use China as an alternative supplier of equipment, since Chinese technologies are not always compatible with Russian equipment, which sometimes requires a complete replacement of equipment and significantly increases repair and maintenance costs. Earlier ArmyInform reported , that the Russians forcibly throw men from TOT into the infantry in Kurshchyna.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/sankcziyi-praczyuyut-u-rf-zupynyayetsya-naftopererobka/	2024-11-07T03:53:04-08:00

In Siversko-Donetsk, the occupiers are forcing the townspeople to refuse in writing from demonstrative repairs. Only in the presence of a written statement is there a slight possibility that the builders will not replace the surviving windows with cheaper ones, will not dismantle plumbing fixtures, doors, and will not remove valuable items and furniture from the apartment. However, these statements are not collected centrally. Only contractor companies accept them. Therefore, in order not to be left with nothing, the locals try to apply in writing to several teams of repairmen at the same time.

The Ministry of Defense commented on the possibility of creating a ranking of commanders	She gave her answer in the new project Army TV. Kateryna Chernogorenko emphasized that for the digital team of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, an obvious priority is the growth of commanders, the launch and operation of -social elevators- in the Defense Forces. -We will be very motivated to make a digital tool , which will allow our commanders to grow quickly: the way they grow according to the success of their military operations,- explained the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine. At the same time, she noted that in this matter, a very balanced approach to the creation of tools should be taken - such an assessment should be made anonymous, any possibility of potential pressure should be eliminated and, of course, a balance should be maintained so that commanders do not lose motivation.

What do you think, Comrade Kim: The Republic of Korea presented a -monster rocket- weighing 36 tons	For a long time, official Seoul kept its new development - the Hyunmoo-V missile - a secret. Now it was officially presented at a military parade in South Korea (ROK), ArmyInform reports. In the words of X platform user Mason (@mason_8718) who reports regularly and in great detail about South Korea's defense industry, the Hyunmoo-V is classified by the ROK military as a -super-capable ballistic missile- (UPBM). Although the Hyunmoo-V was previously announced profile publication The Defense Post, the South Korean military has not yet provided any precise or definitive information about its characteristics. Usually, such information is deliberately withheld in order to make it difficult for an adversary to obtain information about new developments. However, the experts of the Army Recognition defense portal made some technical explanations. With a height of 15 to 16 meters, a diameter of 1.6 meters and a weight of 36 tons, the Hyunmoo-V has the dimensions of an intercontinental ballistic missile. For comparison: the modern American ICBM Minuteman III has a length of 18 meters, a diameter of 1.7 meters and a weight of 35.3 tons. Intercontinental ballistic missiles are usually equipped with nuclear warheads and have a range of more than 10,000 kilometers. In Minuteman III, the nuclear warhead weighs 400 kg; the missile can cover a distance of 13 thousand kilometers. For the Hyunmoo-V, the corresponding figure should be only 3 thousand kilometers - and that is under the conditions of using a warhead of reduced weight. Weapons experts have estimated that the range is only 300 kilometers when fully loaded. But the explosive power of the rocket is huge. The heaviest warhead reportedly weighs up to 9 tons. This means that the Hyunmoo-V may now be the most powerful conventional (non-nuclear) weapon in the world when it comes to explosive power. Until now, the American GBU-43/B aerial bomb was considered as such a weapon, better known as MOAB, which contains 8.48 tons of explosives. Ballistic missiles cannot even come close to such parameters. They are designed for nuclear warheads that cause great destruction at a much smaller mass than conventional explosives. The closest to the Hyunmoo-V in terms of parameters is the Chinese Dongfeng 21C, which can carry a 2-ton conventional warhead at a distance of up to 1.7 thousand kilometers. This begs the question: Why would a weapon as large and bulky as an ICBM but with a much shorter range be needed because it has an extremely large payload? The point is that Hyunmoo-V was built for a specific purpose and to be used against a specific opponent. The warhead, which reportedly weighs up to 9 tons, is so heavy because it is a penetrating part, also known as a -bunker destroyer.- Her kinetic energy must penetrate walls and the ground before exploding. North Korea's fortified facilities are the target. These include command centers in the mountains, weapons factories in tunnels, command bunkers and underground nuclear facilities where North Korea is stockpiling nuclear materials. At the beginning of 2024, South Korea announced the successful test of Hyunmoo-V missiles. According to preliminary data, the tests probably took place in December 2023, when the missile was launched from the west coast and hit a group of islands located at a distance of about 185 kilometers from the launch point. This distance is comparable to the distance between Seoul and Pyongyang, which underlines the missile's importance to South Korea's defense. In theory, Hyunmoo-V could also be used as a hypersonic glider, for example, to destroy ships. South Korea is working on one of them, but it has not yet been unveiled. Photo 5. South Korean strategic missile system Hyunmoo-V on parade in Seoul (ROK). Photo: Hanwha Aerospace It is planned to launch missiles not only from cargo launchers, but also from a new type of ship. The Joint Strike Ship (JSS) is currently in the concept development stage. It is designed to be able to launch as many cruise missiles of different sizes and for different purposes as possible. Construction of the three ships is scheduled to begin in 2030. Official Seoul plans to purchase at least 200 Hyunmoo-Vs. They are manufactured by the South Korean company Hanwha Aerospace, which is a key player in missile development of the Republic of Korea.

According to him, a fire broke out on the 33rd floor on an area of ​​50 m², which led to the partial destruction of the building structures of the 34th technical floor. The fire has been extinguished, there are no casualties, residents are being evacuated. Debris from drones was also recorded in Obolonskyi and Solomyanskyi districts. In the Obolonsky district, debris caused a fire on the upper floor of a business center, there is no information about the victims. In Solomyansk, debris fell on the territory of an industrial enterprise and a medical center. So far, medics have hospitalized one victim from the territory of the enterprise. In addition, a two-story private house is on fire in the Podilskyi district, and units of the State Emergency Service were dispatched to the scene. As reported by ArmyInform, as a result of the attack by drones of the Russian armed forces on Kyiv, in the Holosiivsky district, an apartment in a residential building was damaged. Also in this area, a fire was registered on the territory of the garage cooperative. Rescue services are already working at the scene. In addition, next to the garages that caught fire in the Holosiivskyi district, a fire broke out at a nearby service station. The total area of ​​the fire is 300 square meters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/naslidky-udariv-dronamy-po-kyyevu-v-misti-palayut-budynky-poshkodzheno-medzaklad-ta-biznes-czentr/	2024-11-06T20:55:36-08:00
War in the sky: an expert spoke about the enemy's new developments in the field of UAVs	And now it is important to understand what is in the enemy's arsenal in order to effectively implement new developments to actively counter the enemy's drones. A well-known expert, former deputy chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, lieutenant general, spoke in more detail about this Ihor Romanenko: -After the events of 2014, we saw that unmanned aerial vehicles have a future. And what's more, by 2014, under my leadership, we developed the concept of combating the enemy's unmanned aerial vehicles, which was approved by the then Minister of Defense of Ukraine Yezhel. But due to the fact that his position, I I understand that it changed under the influence of the Russians, so this matter did not go beyond the concept. That is, this Minister only verbally promised to further promote this direction. But then, after all, our group from the Central Research Institute of Weapons and Military Equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine worked in this direction. It was in 2015-16 at the front, already during the Anti-terrorist operation. The group consisted of two parts. The first was involved in the implementation of our drone developments, which we had: Stork, Fury and a number of others. The second part of the group, which I headed, resolved the issue of how to fight the enemy's unmanned aerial vehicles. And at that time we focused on the means of radio-electronic warfare. The Russians were also developing all this, they worked out their developments. Unfortunately, at the end of 2022, the situation changed: the enterprises of the military-industrial complex of Russia overtook us in this direction. On our side, all this time the development of electronic warfare tools, which were supposed to suppress Russian drones, was going on. > This year, the enemy has modernized its drones in a number of directions. The first thing he did was apply artificial intelligence. What we are talking about here: when the enemy's FPV drone is aimed at an object that is covered by our electronic warfare means, at this stage the drone loses control and does not hit the target. And in order to overcome this, the Russians began to use elements of artificial intelligence. That is, they control the drone to the appropriate distance, and then the control passes to artificial intelligence, and EW tools do not affect it. So then the drone -captures- the target and then automatically points to it. The Russians have also modernized and are installing fiber optic cable on the drones. Optical fiber follows the drone, and it is controlled via a cable. Accordingly, our means of radio-electronic warfare do not affect the enemy drone. And this is how the target is hit. And now, from our side, there are developments that will fight with such means: in addition to fire damage, other options are offered. We must also say that due to the fact that we affected the enemy's A-50 long-range radar reconnaissance aircraft, the Russians have now switched to the use of tactical-level strike-reconnaissance systems. That is, they use a reconnaissance drone that can operate at a range of more than 100 kilometers. It scouts and drops data for the -Iskander- battery, which is working on purpose. ... Our Defense Forces, in turn, during 2023-2024 are actively scaling up the production of drones. Maybe we don't have much money for it, but there are talented developers. And by the way, the private sector is also now actively and effectively helping the army in this area. Well, there is always a question of time. We don't have time for everything yet, but the main thing is that we have the latest developments.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/vijna-v-nebi-ekspert-rozpoviv-pro-novi-rozrobky-voroga-u-galuzi-bpla/	2024-11-06T20:48:32-08:00
UBD benefits: as a participant in hostilities, you can park for free in the capital	ArmyInform tells about how combatants can take advantage of this benefit. According to the rules of improvement of the city of Kyiv, the right to free parking of vehicles is used: As reported in -Kyivtransparkservice-, at the moment, when parking, participants in hostilities need only attach a document entitling them to benefits to the lower left corner of the windshield. In particular, a copy of this document can be made and attached, and personal data can be redacted. In the future, the system of preferential parking should change. A corresponding algorithm is being developed. It is not yet known when exactly it will become operational. Therefore, it is worth following updates on the -Kyivtransparkservice- website. Please note that parking at municipal lots is paid only on weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. At other times on weekdays and during the day on Saturdays and Sundays, parking is free. In total, 3 zones with parking lots are defined. You can read more about the addresses of the locations of such sites on the Kyivtransparkservice website.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/pilgy-ubd-yak-uchasnyku-bojovyh-dij-bezkoshtovno-parkuvatysya-u-stolyczi/	2024-11-06T20:33:39-08:00
Counterfeiters issue humanitarian aid for support from the state: why should they?	However, this is a fake, are written in the VoxCheck project. Despite the fact that the order shown in the video is real, the help shown in the video is unlikely to have been provided by the Ukrainian authorities. Most likely, this is humanitarian aid. After all, among the demonstrated items, there is not a single one that would be produced or sold in Ukraine. Instead, propagandists passed it off as state support for the families of fallen soldiers. The goal of such fakes is quite obvious - to devalue the life of a Ukrainian soldier and discredit the state authorities of Ukraine. We remind you that the families of Ukrainian soldiers who died at the front receive a one-time payment of 15 million hryvnias from the state. If a soldier died during the period of service, but not during hostilities, his relatives are provided with monetary assistance in the amount of 750 subsistence minimums. As of January 1, 2024, the subsistence minimum is UAH 3,028 for able-bodied persons. That is, the family of a fallen soldier receives almost 2.3 million hryvnias. However, this amount may change with changes in the size of the subsistence minimum. These sums, 2.3 million or 15 million, are divided equally between all members of the deceased's family. The following have the right to receive funds: parents of the deceased; one of the spouses who did not remarry; children under 18 years old; dependents. Also, families of soldiers who have gone missing, in addition to maintaining monthly payments for a soldier (postal salary, salary according to military rank, allowances for years of service, other monthly additional types of financial support), are provided with an additional payment, which was assigned to a soldier for participation in hostilities, in the amount of 100,000 hryvnias. The family is deprived of such payments if the soldier voluntarily surrendered, deserted or voluntarily left the military unit or place of service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/fejkoroby-vydayut-gumanitarnu-dopomogu-za-pidtrymku-vid-derzhavy-nashho-cze-yim/	2024-11-06T20:07:28-08:00

Without pants at the kobzon concert - the Russians were caught undressing their own dead	The looting video was released on November 6 on the brigade's channel. Our pilots were recording the numerous bodies of the slain occupiers scattered in the bushes, when they accidentally came across a group of three living Russians. These three tried to pull off the pants of the murdered brother. Another naked Russian was lying nearby, whose pants had already been taken off. After a long struggle, the Russians were finally able to pull off the pants of the second comrade, after which they happily carried the loot to the dugout.

Three agents of the Russian Federation who aimed Russian missiles at Prykarpattia received 13 years ...	This was reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. SBU officers detained the attackers in the western region of Ukraine in the first days of the full-scale war. The accomplices of the aggressor turned out to be three residents from Kyiv, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, who were recruited by Russian intelligence back in 2021. The agents acted as part of a group and -locked in- to several Russian curators, with whom they communicated through anonymous chats of the popular messenger. According to the instructions of the occupiers, those involved were supposed to prepare data for a missile attack on the airfield in Prykarpattia, and after the enemy attack to -report- on its consequences. In order to carry out the enemy's task, the agent from Kharkiv acted under the guise of a -travel blogger-, who used a drone to make a video of a panoramic view of a strategic object and posted the recorded files on Instagram. Another agent, a resident of Kyiv, settled near the airfield on the eve of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation in order to record aircraft takeoffs and landings in real time. She provided the received information to a third member of the Russian agency to forward the intelligence to the occupiers.

Operation Gabriel: details of Russia's war crime against Ukrainian children	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. We are talking about the commander of the 205th separate motorized rifle brigade of the Russian Armed Forces, Dzhabrail Yusupov, with the call sign -Gabriel-. According to the investigation, in July 2022, under his command, a group of 20 armed invaders broke into the Novopetriv special school and kidnapped 15 children. The children, together with the school principal and her husband, were taken to the Crimea, and later to Anapa, Krasnodar region of the Russian Federation. For a month, they were kept in a boarding house, where the children were forced to sing the Russian national anthem. Only in November 2022, thanks to one of the charitable organizations, it was possible to take the children from the Russian Federation through third countries and return them to their homeland. Based on the collected evidence, Yusupov was notified in absentia of suspicion for violating the laws and customs of war (Part 2 of Article 28, Part 1 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). Currently, measures are being taken to search for him and bring him to justice. This is not the first time that the SBU investigates such crimes. Earlier, an occupation official of the Kherson region was exposed, who also participated in the deportation of Ukrainian children. The investigation is being conducted under the procedural guidance of the Prosecutor General's Office.

- Trump will be more decisive, he will resolve the battle deep into Russia, and the end of the war-,...	Some commentators were outraged, because -not a single US president has done anything good for Russia. Everyone contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union, and now Russia.- Other swamp dwellers are outraged by the fact that -no one wants to work in our country- everything is not the same, and Trump will be more decisive. In his name, he will resolve the battle in the depths of Russia. And that's the end of the war.- Some -narrow-minded- tried to push the narrative that -Trump has traditional values, and that means Russia.- However, such a wretched man immediately received answers in the form of -He was shooting white tomahawks over the heads of our base in Syria, and then he said that his daughter had advised him so and he decided to strike!- Why do we need such a traditionalist who is ready to start a nuclear war?-. The rest of the Muscovites were very excited, because -under Trump, we received the most crippling sanctions-; he also gave more weapons to Ukraine than Obama. Israel also supports Trump, and therefore Russia's ally, Iran, will also be bad. It's not worth rejoicing.- One of the representatives of the Mokshan filth writes that -The elections will end and they will not go to the next one.

This was discussed during the meeting devoted to issues of inclusivity and barrier-freeness, held under the chairmanship of the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General of Justice Serhiy Melnyka. Yes, field trials of demi-season uniforms for women are currently underway. And the first samples of the winter uniform are prepared for scientific and research tests. -The introduction of women's form is important, in particular, because the dimensional grid of the form for men is not relevant for women,- Serhiy Melnyk said. At the same time, he added that the process is slowing down due to the low interest of manufacturers to provide test samples for the tests necessary to develop technical conditions for production. The Ministry also takes into account the results of field testing of summer uniforms and underwear. Changes to the technical conditions of certain elements of military clothing are already planned, taking into account the feedback of female military personnel. Serhii Melnyk also emphasized the need to provide women's bulletproof vests that would meet the protection requirements when reducing the weight of armor plates. Also within the scope of the -Wounded Package- project initiated by the Ministry of Defense this year, requirements for adaptive clothing that will be provided to wounded servicemen are being developed. According to the plan, from 2025, a set of such clothes will be issued irrevocably and free of charge at stabilization points and during inpatient treatment. The project covers all units of the Defense and Security Forces, therefore it requires interdepartmental agreement and the adoption of the relevant resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. In addition, as part of the implementation of the National Barrier-Free Strategy of Ukraine The Ministry of Defense will reconstruct part of its buildings by the end of 2024. -For this year, work on 10 medical facilities of the Ministry of Defense was planned and financed. Elevators, ramps and other equipment will be built and put into operation there, which will make life easier for servicemen who have received disabilities and have corresponding needs.

President Trump: great risks or great opportunities for Ukraine?	-During the months leading up to the US presidential election, I was asked many times the question: 'Who is better for us: Trump or Kamala?' The following answer seemed the most correct: Thus, with the victory of Donald Trump, we find ourselves on the threshold of a period of change. Despite the flurry of despair in the popular media, there is good reason to hope that the new administration's actions will be favorable to us. Let's find out why this is so. The years of Joe Biden's administration (2021-2025) will go down in history as a catastrophically unsuccessful period for the United States in the context of foreign policy. The surrender of Afghanistan to the Taliban, the large-scale Russian-Ukrainian war, the aggression of Iran and its proxy forces against Israel, the deepening of ties along the -axis of evil- Russia-China-Iran-North Korea - this is just a list of the main failures committed by Washington in previous years. Against this background, Trump's first term (2017-2021) was distinguished by an exemplary foreign policy strategy. Let's recall how in the mid-2010s terrorist attacks by the Islamic State took place in different parts of the world. Under Trump, the US military, together with its allies, eliminated the IS threat. At the beginning of 2020, the legendary (and infamous) Iranian general Qassem Soleimani was eliminated. Several Arab states signed a peace treaty with Israel (the Abrahamic Pact). A treaty was signed between North and South Korea. Currently, three actions of the Biden administration that prompted Vladimir Putin to attack Ukraine can be singled out: Donald Trump is now promising to do two things on his first day in office: close the southern border and restore oil production permits to make the United States the world's largest oil producer again. This should collapse the price, which has been holding for a long time at the level of $70-80 per barrel, favorable to the Russians. We have heard Trump's statements many times that he will stop the Russian-Ukrainian war in 24 hours. He even said several times that he would do it even before the inauguration, which is scheduled for January 20, 2025. Obviously, this will not happen so quickly, but the fact is that the newly elected president sees the Russian-Ukrainian war as a problem that needs to be solved as soon as possible. It is not for nothing that he, unlike Kamala Harris, mentioned Ukraine during most of his speeches on the eve of the elections. At the beginning, the priority of the new administration will be to stop hostilities, that is, to freeze the front line in current positions. Of course, one should not hope that Trump will immediately convince Putin to release all Ukrainian lands. But it is worth recalling his words a few months ago: -If Putin does not obey me, I will arm Ukraine to such an extent that he will regret it.- That is, the acceleration of the pace of arms delivery is considered by Trump as a way to deter Moscow. Let's not forget that it was during Trump's first term that Obama's embargo on the supply of lethal weapons to Ukraine was lifted. An extremely important factor is the fact that the Republicans won a majority in both houses of Congress. Full one-party control will ensure a high speed of decision-making, in particular regarding new aid packages for Ukraine. Broad bipartisan support for pro-Ukrainian initiatives will remain in the Senate and the House of Representatives. A negative factor can be Trump's entourage, led by his vice president JD Vance, Tulsi Gabbard, Robert Kennedy and others. Vance is known for his statements regarding the inappropriateness of large-scale US intervention in the Russian-Ukrainian war. He outlined his vision in an article for the New York Times, where he described the optimal scenario, in his opinion: freezing the front line and starting negotiations. However, it is worth noting that Vance never spoke about openly handing Ukraine over to Moscow. The activation of US foreign policy in other directions should be positive for Kyiv, in particular: Over the past four years, Washington has made many mistakes that need to be corrected immediately. We hope that an exemplary foreign policy strategy will be a feature of Trump's second term as well. Be that as it may, the main difference between the Trump administration and its predecessors should be the determination to achieve the chosen strategy, whatever it may be. Biden, Blinken and other incumbent officials have always made loud statements about supporting Ukraine to the very end, ensuring victory, etc. But their actions differed significantly from what they said: the weapons always arrived with many months of delay and in insufficient quantities. The USA did not provide Ukraine with everything it needed when we could develop success in the second half of 2022 (the Kharkiv operation and the liberation of Kherson), or when we were preparing for an offensive in the summer of 2023. Currently, the main task of President Zelensky is to direct Trump's determination in the direction we need. The Victory Plan presented by us should become the main argument during Trump's talks with Moscow. A period of indolence and indecision on Capitol Hill is being replaced by a time of great change and great opportunity. Opportunities that we should take advantage of.

$4,000 each from a swindler — in Transcarpathia, the head of the regional TCC and the deputy command...	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on November 6. According to the materials of the National Police investigators, both figures acted separately, but used similar -schemes-: in exchange for bribes, they offered conscripts to avoid conscription on the basis of forged documents about -bad- health. To do this, officials provided potential conscripts with fictitious medical reports of the VLK about the presence of serious diseases. In the future, evaders used a forgery to remove themselves from military registration and could illegally leave Ukraine. The cost of such -services- was from $4,000 per client. On the basis of the received evidence, both officials are suspected (according to the crimes committed) under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: An investigation is ongoing to establish all the circumstances of the crime and bring the perpetrators to justice. Perpetrators face up to 10 years in prison with confiscation of property. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/06/po-4-tysyachi-z-uhylyanta-na-zakarpatti-vykryly-ochilnyka-rajtczk-ta-zamkombryga-teroborony/	2024-11-06T06:46:05-08:00
The General Staff of the Armed Forces explained why they are creating new brigades instead of replen...	The conversation with Dmytro Lykhoviei was published on November 6. -Recently, the enemy has increased the number of regiments, brigades and divisions and the number of personnel by almost 100,000 people. The length of the front line also increased. In order to close the front, new brigades must be created within the Armed Forces,- Dmytro Lykhova said. According to him, there is simply no other effective way to counter the enemy who prevails, as today there are 1,300 km of frontline with active combat clashes. He also noted that the Russian occupiers have a significant advantage, sometimes fivefold, on the battle line. -Therefore, when during hostilities there is a threat of losing the positions and lines of defense of certain brigades, the redeployment of individual battalions of other military units is used here. This is a logical and regulated method of action to strengthen the defense: when there is a threat of a breakthrough in problematic areas of the front, units from unattacked areas are transferred to it,- Dmytro Lykhova assured. He noted that in conditions of insufficient forces and means, this is the optimal way to counteract the prevailing enemy forces, thus reducing the risk of a breakthrough. Also, according to the spokesman, it should be taken into account that currently the Armed Forces do not have the opportunity to quickly replenish the brigades with personnel. -Such a need is scheduled a month in advance. It is also necessary to understand that the people who join the unit must undergo adaptation and coordination in it, and this takes time. That is why, to strengthen the section of the front, where there is a threat of a breakthrough, an already formed unit is used, which is ready to perform the task in a short time,- explained Dmytro Lykhova. In addition, Lykhovi emphasized that brigades are also needed for rotation and replacement of already existing brigades. -You can't limit yourself to the simple replenishment of brigades that have suffered significant losses either - because they need combat coordination. New brigades are needed to replace them and withdraw them from the area of ​​hostilities,- noted Dmytro Lykhovi. As reported by ArmyInform, the spokesman of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Captain Dmytro Lykhovii kinczya-roku/->told about the consequences of the audit for the IT sphere in the Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/06/genshtab-zsu-poyasnyv-dlya-chogo-stvoryuyut-novi-brygady-zamist-popovnennya-nayavnyh/	2024-11-06T06:32:53-08:00

Ukraine expects a new tranche of aid from the EU in the amount of 1.9 billion euros — Rustem Umyerov	He wrote about this on his Facebook page. In addition, Rustem Umyerov expressed his gratitude to the head of the Committee, Mrs. Delphine Pronk, and the EU ambassador to Ukraine, Katarina Maternova, for their constant help and support. Thanks to European partners, Ukraine is successfully implementing a number of important security initiatives, in particular as part of the EUMAM Military Assistance Mission, which since October 2022 has already provided training for more than 62,000 Ukrainian military personnel in EU countries. By the end of the year, this number will increase to 75 thousand. The minister welcomed the EU ambassadors' decision to extend the mission's mandate for another two years and expressed hope for conducting exercises directly in Ukraine, which would speed up the training of Ukrainian defenders. The Minister of Defense also called on European countries to invest in military production in Ukraine, proposing to conclude long-term contracts for the joint production of drones, long-range weapons and ammunition. He emphasized the expectation of a new tranche of aid from the EU in the amount of 1.9 billion euros at the expense of frozen Russian assets, as well as the importance of allocating an additional 6 billion euros from the European Peace Fund to strengthen the Ukrainian army. Rustem Umyerov emphasized that the future of Ukraine lies in the European Union and NATO, and the country will continue to strengthen cooperation for a joint fight against the coalition of dictatorships led by Russia. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov congratulated Patrick Turner in Kyiv on his first official visit as the head of the NATO Representation in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/06/ukrayina-ochikuye-novyj-transh-dopomogy-vid-yes-u-rozmiri-19-mlrd-yevro-rustem-umyerov/	2024-11-06T06:02:27-08:00

After interrogation, it turned out that this Pitkevich has quite a long combat experience. In October 2022, while serving a sentence in one of the Russian colonies, he agreed to sign a contract with the private military company Wagner. As part of the units of the PKK, he initially participated in the storming of the settlements of Soledar and Bakhmut. In June 2023, he took part in the -hike- to Moscow, which was then organized by the leader of the -Wagner- PMK. In June of this year, he signed a new contract and entered the service of the 155th Marine Infantry Brigade of the Russian Federation. In August, when the brigade was transferred to Kurshchyna, he took a direct part in the hostilities as an assistant grenade launcher. At the end of September, he witnessed the murder of two Ukrainian prisoners of war near the settlement of Hlushkove. According to him, the order for the execution and subsequent removal of the heads from the bodies was given by the commander of the unit. -The prisoner of war gave his name, as well as the names of the soldiers - the direct perpetrators of this war crime!!! According to intelligence reports, currently the 155th separate marine brigade of the Russian Pacific Fleet has suffered very significant losses in Kurshchyna, due to which the personnel of the unit often leave combat positions and refuse to carry out orders. All criminals will be punished!-, said the message of the 47th brigade.

The commander of the 95th airborne platoon told about this on the broadcast of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- - of the Polish Assault Brigade Stanislav Krasnov. According to Krasnov, the aggressor's losses are huge — dozens of killed Russians remain lying on the defense line every day. That is why, he believes, it was necessary to attract foot soldiers from North Korea. Although Ukrainian defenders perceive Koreans more as a joke. -No one takes the infantry from North Korea seriously as a combat unit. Everyone perfectly understands that this will be another cannon fodder, a complete waste, which is unlikely to be able to have any impact,- the representative of the 95th Airborne Assault Brigade shared his impressions.

Even at the entrance, the enemy was accompanied by a drone-bomber, which waited for an opportune moment and dropped a grenade on the heads of the Russians. Three occupants were wounded, the rest tried to hide in the landing nearby. In the end, the drone pilots and scouts finished the job — destroying the enemy BMP and the remnants of the infantry.

the Russians executed at least 109 unarmed Ukrainian soldiers	This was reported by the National Information Bureau with reference to an interview with the head of the Department for Combating Crimes Committed in of the armed conflict, Office of the General Prosecutor Yuriy Belousov. According to him, the number of executions of captured Ukrainian soldiers began to increase significantly at the end of last year. Prior to that, the facts of torture prevailed. Yuriy Belousov emphasized that the physical destruction of Ukrainian soldiers in captivity, in particular through executions, torture and terrible conditions of detention, shows the elements of genocide. Ukraine collects evidence of the aggressor's crimes from all possible sources. These are the data of our military, intelligence, information from interrogations of Russian prisoners of war, etc. Despite all the complexity of investigating cases, caused by the impossibility of access to the scene of the crime, bodies and conducting an examination, there are real sentences for war criminals. In the future, not only the perpetrators will be brought to justice, but also the entire vertical of the organizers of such crimes: those who incited, gave orders and did not respond to such crimes.

An ecological disaster is approaching in the community and district. Next year, the Russians will leave Luhansk Autodor without large orders and, accordingly, without additional funds. Because contracts with this company are concluded only for the maintenance of highways. Repairs, in particular, and capital ones, will be carried out by contractors from Russia. Currently, five enterprises from the regions of the Russian Federation have already been selected, which will be involved in the work in the so-called LNR. The occupiers do not need foreigners.

That is why it was decided to conduct an offensive operation to overtake with the transfer of hostilities to the territory of the enemy in the Kursk region. For almost three months of the operation, as of November 5, 2024, the losses of the enemy in the Kursk direction in terms of personnel amounted to 20,842 people, of which: liquidated - 7,905, wounded - 12,220, captured - 717.

The enemy has concentrated about 45,000 troops there. And it is trying to increase their number. Russia's own troops are not enough for this direction, so they are trying to attract troops from North Korea there. The Russian occupiers wanted to seize more territories in the north of Ukraine in the Sumy region. However, the Defense Forces of Ukraine took a preventive step and continue to destroy the enemy on its territory. About 2,000 Ukrainian servicemen were awarded state awards for their heroism and successful actions during the Kursk operation.

Against infantry and tanks: what is known about the M136 Volcano remote mine system	As write the authors of the Taiwanese magazine The Liberty Times, created by American designers back in the 80s of the last century, the M-136 Volcano remote mine laying system is still in demand on the world arms market, ArmyInform reports. At least the military from this island immediately ordered 14 sets of these installations from the United States. The relevant agreement entered into force last year after the US State Department approved a proposed $180 million arms package that included Volcano systems and M977A4 HEMTT trucks. But in September of this year, Taipei received a message that these -remote miners- will not be delivered to the island until 2026. The M136 Volcano is an automated mine delivery system that can rapidly deploy large minefields in a variety of environments using prepackaged containers. This weapon is capable of quickly laying both anti-personnel and anti-tank mines over a large area, creating deterrents against potential enemy landings and vehicles. Defense publication experts Army Recognition underline the universality of the deployment of this weapon. -Volcano-, which is how the name of the installation is translated, can be both ground-based (Ground Volcano) and air-based (Air Volcano). The system is quick to assemble and disassemble and uses modified GATOR mines available in active or inactive canisters. The Ground Volcano modification is optimal for setting deep and tactical minefields. This system uses an M139 dispenser and an easy-to-operate dosage control unit. Ground Volcano uses modified GATOR mines, available in both combat and training versions. The system includes three main components: M87A1 ammunition, M88 and M89 training ammunition. Each M87A1 container contains six anti-tank mines and one anti-personnel mine. Anti-tank mines are equipped with magnetically induced detonators that are activated when objects with metal components move. This makes the mines particularly effective against armored vehicles. Anti-personnel mines, in turn, are activated with the help of strings that can reach up to 12 meters in length. The mines are 12 cm in diameter, 6 cm high, and each mine contains about 605 g of explosives. Mounted on an Oshkosh Defense HEMTT A4 M977A4 truck, the Volcano system can carry 960 anti-tank and anti-personnel mines, deploying a minefield up to 1,100 meters long and 120 meters wide within 4-12 minutes. This factor ensures operational protection of important facilities and strategic points on the battlefield. Mines are equipped with a self-destruct mechanism after a specified time, which ensures that unexploded ordnance does not pose a long-term threat. The M977A4 truck used to transport the Volcano system is equipped with a number of modern technologies that make it a reliable and maneuverable vehicle. Its features include a 500-horsepower Caterpillar C15 diesel engine, traction control, anti-lock braking and air suspension. These characteristics ensure high passability, including overcoming water obstacles up to 1.2 meters deep. The M136 Volcano system is a powerful tool for creating minefields, providing reliable protection against enemy offensive operations. Its mobility, speed of deployment and high efficiency make it an integral part of the arsenal of modern armed forces. M-136 Volcano remote mining system.

Currently, these self-propelled guns are used in units of the 148th separate artillery brigade of the Zhytomyr Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The gun commander with the call sign -Chrom- was among the first Ukrainian artillerymen to master this technique in Denmark. >He talked about the advantages of French self-propelled guns and their use in the conditions of modern warfare in a conversation with the correspondent of ArmiyaInform. He also worked in this specialty abroad. He says that he joined the Military Commissariat at the end of spring 2022, but in the end he was accepted for military service only at the beginning of summer. &#8211; I got a position as a driver-mechanic in the 95th Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, I worked on the self-propelled artillery howitzer 2C1 -Gvozdika-. After the training center, he arrived in the eastern direction, the Svatovo-Kreminna district. Already two weeks after my arrival, I was put in the crew, - recalls the gunner. Then the crews were constantly on trips and there were not even close to such a number of enemy drones. - Only the first time they saw -Lancet-, they didn't know what it was yet. He then hit the equipment, at first we thought it was an RPG projectile. The intensity of the work was much higher, our self-propelled guns stood at a distance of 2-5 km, they fired along the front, it was possible not to hide very much, - says -Khrom-. About six months later, he received a concussion, already during hostilities in Serebryansky forest in Kharkiv region. A mine flew next to his ACS, so close was the crew to the front line. For a while, Khrom dropped out of the crew, and at the same time he was offered to go for training on the CAESAR ACS. - I said that there are guys with more experience, but the combatant answered: -Their experience is for these guns. And you will do better for CAESAR,- he recalls. In Denmark, Ukrainian gunners trained for only two weeks, but this time was enough to master the machine. Every day there were classes from 8 in the morning to 9 in the evening. Then there was an accelerated course to train people before the arrival of the first batch of these self-propelled guns in Ukraine. Now the training period has increased. — At the time of training, I was a driver-mechanic, but after returning to Ukraine I was appointed a gun commander. At the same time, I was transferred to the 148th artillery brigade, which was being formed at the time, - adds -Khrom-. At the beginning of the summer of 2023, -Khrom- and its crew used the French self-propelled guns for the first time in the Zaporizhzhia region. They mainly fired in the direction of Robotyny, where there were enemy fortifications. He mentions that even there there weren't as many drones as there are now in the East. - Now we interact with the air reconnaissance unit, they report enemy -birds-, then we determine when to work. The main advantage of this machine is mobility. We can make a march of 100 km, shoot back and leave, - explains the commander of the gun. But in combat conditions, the weather sometimes makes corrections, the self-propelled gun weighs 35 tons and it is more difficult for it to move in the mud. Also, due to its considerable size, it is more difficult to disguise. - Before arriving in Ukraine, our machine fired 55 shots, it was actually new. We have already fired about 1,500 shells. Some machines have 3-4 thousand rounds, says Chrom. Among the other advantages of the CAESAR self-propelled guns are an armored cabin and anti-mine protection, as well as a French guidance system known throughout the world. > —We mostly work in the rear, throw shells at them behind the front line. The optimal shooting range is 18-20 kilometers, but we also shot at 34 km. However, accuracy is lost from the range, the crew adds For the self-propelled guns, different types of projectiles are provided, the crew chooses them depending on the task and the targets identified for hitting. The division says that most of the repair works on French self-propelled machines are carried out by their own efforts. — For example, our mechanic Oleksandr, who used to repair combines. He determines the problem by the sound, these guys are the ones who keep these machines. He could already tell the French manufacturers about all the nuances in combat conditions and how these self-propelled guns can be improved, - praises his brother -Chrom-. According to him, there are enough people in the division, they are quite willing to join the artillery . A new addition has arrived recently, young guys. Now the new recruits are undergoing training in Ukraine, the training center has such a machine and there is an opportunity to get basic knowledge. At first, newcomers work in parallel with other crew members and gain experience. Gradually, independent trips begin, for example, to shoot at the ban, -Khrom- explains. It is not difficult to master the machine, the gunners say. Already in the brigade, experienced colleagues will tell and show everything. In the same way, specialization will be determined on the spot. A person can come as a gunner, but in the commander's opinion, a novice can be more effective as a loader. - Everything is checked in practice, otherwise no way. Currently, Ukraine has the largest combat experience of using these self-propelled guns. Their application was developed without taking into account EW, drones. Drones have changed everything and we are already learning how to use CAESAR in a new way, -Khrom- summarizes.

Elections in Moldova and Georgia: what they have in common and how it will affect the situation in U...	Oleksandr Chupak, an expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Research-, tells about this in an exclusive comment to ArmiyaInform. -Both in Georgia and Moldova, the elections were accompanied by numerous reports of interference by Russia and violations of democratic standards. In both countries, there were cases of falsification and manipulation at the polling stations, which were noted by observers of the OSCE and other international organizations. Pro-Russian political forces in both countries used propaganda and tools to pressure the electorate, emphasizing the dangers of rapprochement with the EU. Both countries have significant pro-European segments of society, especially among the youth and urban population, who aspire to integration with the EU. These people took part in mass demonstrations in both capitals to express their support for pro-European leaders and to resist pro-Russian pressure. In Moldova, this support helped the pro-European candidate Maia Sandu win, and in Georgia, despite significant resistance, pro-European forces continue their struggle.- -Despite the common features, the elections in these countries had significant differences. In Moldova, the victory was won by the pro-European force led by Maya Sandu, who was able to unite the electorate around the idea of ​​European integration, in particular thanks to the support of the Western diaspora and urban centers. In Georgia, the ruling Georgian Dream party, which is supported by the pro-Russian oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, maintains power thanks to administrative resources and extensive falsifications, according to the opposition. Her next victory in the parliamentary elections caused public protests that continue to this day. The general political climate is also different. In Moldova, the president has significant influence on political processes. In Georgia, President Salome Zurabishvili, although he supports pro-European values, has limited power, which allows the government to act in favor of pro-Russian interests; she condemned the falsifications during the elections.- -The events in Moldova and Georgia have a direct impact on Ukraine, as those countries are facing challenges similar to ours on the road to European integration. Ukraine, waging a full-scale war against Russia, should actively work with countries that can become our allies in the fight against the occupier. Especially with Moldova and Georgia, which, like us, suffer from the occupation of their territories by Russia. The situation in Georgia is a reminder of the risks that arise when pro-Russian forces hold power. A parallel can be drawn between Ivanishvili's rule and Yanukovych's time, when a clear oligarchic vertical of control over power and business was established in Ukraine. Under such conditions, the perspective is to approach the current status of Belarus, and the Georgian opposition understands this well. In the context of Moldova, the situation with Transnistria is always interesting for us. The Russian enclave should have been liquidated at the beginning of 2022, but then Maya Sandu did not want to spoil relations with Moscow. Sandu's victory means that Ukraine has the opportunity to strengthen its influence (political, economic, etc.) on Chisinau with the aim of preventing Moldova from returning to the Russian orbit.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/06/vybory-u-moldovi-ta-gruziyi-shho-spilnogo-ta-yak-cze-vplyne-na-sytuacziyu-v-ukrayini/	2024-11-05T20:17:47-08:00
Propagandists justify the involvement of the DPRK in the war: they invented a new fake	Responding to this, Russian Telegram channels began to write that there were -infiltrators- behind the controls of this military equipment. This is allegedly due to the fact that among specialists in the Armed Forces there are colossal losses and the training period of the Ukrainian military is shortened. So, according to the propagandists, taking this into account, the appearance of the North Korean military in the Russo-Ukrainian war is natural, and this should not be surprising. Propagandists seek to fuel the narrative by reporting on the -Nativs- who control Western military equipment. about a possible war of the Russian Federation against the entire NATO bloc, and not only against Ukraine. That Ukraine is allegedly only a puppet in the hands of the -NATO masters- and -NATO bases and troops- are located on its territory. For example, the -Nativites- are fighting on the side of Ukraine, so soldiers from the DPRK can supposedly fight for Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/06/propagandysty-vypravdovuyut-zaluchennya-kndr-do-vijny-vygadaly-novyj-fejk/	2024-11-05T20:02:33-08:00
From convicts to marines: which Russians are fighting in the South of Ukraine	Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- : — Our south is quite large and there [are] various Russian units of its connection. For example, representatives of Russia's -Northern Fleet- are stationed at Tenderivska Spit at the mouth of the Dnieper. These are the marines, there are also various units that the Russians also use in hostilities. Next are mainly representatives of their combined armies of the southern district. Closer to the east are the representatives of the Eastern Military District. In addition, we have several units of their -airborne troops-. The spokesman noted that the training of fighters of different units and units differs significantly. — As for their training, it is different. There are also professionals, -specialists-, and there are their so-called mobilized, who already have a certain level of training. In addition, there are small units, mainly in the assault squads, which are units of former prisoners. This phenomenon is not widely used, but it exists, said the spokesperson of the -Tavria- OUV. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the south The Russian army of Ukraine has concentrated about 200,000 troops, these forces also include the occupation troops in Crimea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/vid-zekiv-do-morpihiv-yaki-rosiyany-voyuyut-na-pivdni-ukrayiny/	2024-11-05T12:17:51-08:00
Cold and wind: how they have already affected the battlefield in Kharkiv region	toldabout how the change in weather conditions has already affected the battlefield in Kharkiv Oblast on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- /a> spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Lt. Col. Yevhenii Romanov. — The enemy now attacks mostly with infantry. We know that the enemy is constantly accumulating forces and resources. He imports ammunition, equipment, food, warm equipment, fuel and lubricants. He is preparing for the winter, he said. Answering the presenter's question about the possible accumulation of tanks by the enemy in the area of ​​the village of Hlyboke of the Lypetsk community, north of Kharkiv, the spokesman noted that the Defense Forces are monitoring all the actions of the enemy and are ready for any development, and tanks are a very vulnerable target in this regard. part of the battle line. — We are aware of our enemy's actions, but for obvious reasons we will not say what our troops are preparing for him in this direction. But I will note that tanks are a very vulnerable target in this direction and we are ready for it, the spokesman emphasized. The officer said that in recent days the nature of hostilities was significantly affected by the weather. — If we talk about the last two days, the weather had a very significant effect. The number of combat engagements and losses on the part of the enemy decreased by almost a third, the number of displaced equipment decreased, and their activity decreased. It snowed, it rained, it got colder, and the change in weather is making significant adjustments at the moment, the military officer said. The impact of changing weather conditions on the enemy's use of light UAVs is particularly noticeable. — Very strong wind. What flies in the air is quite vulnerable. Speaking about small FPV drones, -maviks- and similar unmanned aerial vehicles, the weather significantly affects them, Yevgeny Romanov said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, which remains the main consumable of the occupiers in Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/holod-i-viter-yak-vony-vzhe-vplynuly-na-pole-boyu-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-11-05T12:08:04-08:00
The occupiers again resort to forced medical examinations	This is reported by Center of national resistance. Inspections will be carried out in villages with the help of mobile medical complexes. Collaborators from district administrations are responsible for attending these inspections. During examinations, doctors will campaign to conclude a health insurance contract, for which you must have a passport of the Russian Federation. That is, one of the goals of these reviews is to identify those who have not received passports. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the enemy shelled Donetsk region again.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/okupanty-znovu-vdayutsya-do-prymusovyh-medychnyh-oglyadiv/	2024-11-05T11:57:55-08:00
A correctional officer of the Russian Federation and two collaborators were detained in Kherson	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on November 5. Another detainee turned out to be a resident of the regional center, an agent of the Russian military intelligence (better known as GRU), who adjusted enemy fire on the Defense Forces. To do this, the defendant traveled around the territory of the community on a scooter and tried to identify the locations of Ukrainian troops involved in hostilities at the front. The priority targets of the enemy were camouflaged headquarters, firing positions and strongholds of units of the Armed Forces. The agent sent the received information to the Russian game via messenger in the form of screenshots with the markings of military objects on Google maps. During the special operation, the Security Service detained the traitor in her own apartment and carried out comprehensive measures to secure the positions of the Defense Forces. Another detainee is a 60-year-old ex-law enforcement officer from Kherson, who after the capture of the community joined the local occupation administration of the Russian Federation. There, the former mayor of the city, Oleksandr Kobets, appointed the collaborator as his -deputy on legal issues.- Among his main tasks was the preparation of a pseudo-referendum of the Rashists regarding the accession of the region to the aggressor country. The third suspect, who was detained by the SBU together with the National Police, is also a resident of the regional center, which during its occupation was part of the so-called -Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Kherson region.- In the ranks of the pseudo-institution, the collaborator was engaged in the -passportization- of local residents through forced registration of Russian citizenship. Investigators of the Security Service informed the detainees of the suspicion (according to the crimes committed) under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: The perpetrators are in custody. They face from 15 years in prison to life imprisonment with confiscation of property. As reported by ArmyInform, a spy from Sloviansk received 15 years in prison. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/u-hersoni-zatrymaly-koryguvalnyczyu-rf-ta-dvoh-kolaborantiv/	2024-11-05T11:42:46-08:00
Everything will be repainted: how winter will affect the palette of war	Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — Cold weather always brings certain corrections, first of all, it increases the importance of various thermal imaging tools. That is, it is better to see where what warms whom, he said. Also, the cooling and approach of winter will lead to the fact that the battlefield will be repainted in the literal sense of the word. — In addition, when it is a cold season, firstly, the palette of the battlefield changes. This very arena, it turns a different color. In particular, if it was green, then it turns gray, yellow, then white. That's why camouflage and, shall we say, quality camouflage is essential. And not only for a person as camouflage, but also to hide equipment, the spokesman emphasized. The change in weather will also affect the fighters. - In addition, when such weather changes, it becomes much more difficult for a person to be in such a temperature field. Therefore, there are many different nuances of the changes that will occur when the colder period begins, the military explained. So far, the temperature regime in the South of Ukraine is quite comfortable, but cooling is inevitable. — But for the past few weeks in the south, the weather has been dry and we now have a temperature there of 3-4 plus at night, and 15-17 during the day, well 15, let's say, quite comfortably, Vladislav Voloshyn reported. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that during assaults in the South, the enemy uses vehicles almost exclusively as a means of delivering infantry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/vse-perefarbuyetsya-yak-vplyne-zyma-na-palitru-vijny/	2024-11-05T11:32:46-08:00

Means of delivery of infantry: in the South, the enemy uses vehicles as -taxi-	Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — Our situation has not changed much for several days, or weeks in a row. The enemy continues to launch rocket attacks on the positions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine and settlements adjacent to the battle line. The enemy continues to conduct a counter-battery fight. The enemy is conducting an assault, he said. Currently, the enemy's assault actions are mainly reconnaissance in nature. — We don't have as many assaults as in some other areas, but they do exist. The enemy is carrying out so-called combat reconnaissance in certain directions and is preparing to carry out assault actions in several directions, the military officer explained. The officer said that the tactics of the enemy's actions remain unchanged - these are assaults by small infantry groups. — Assault actions carried out by us are carried out by infantry forces, small infantry assault groups of 5 to 10 people. the Russians are not changing their tactics. During these assault operations, they use light vehicles such as motorcycles, ATVs, and buggies to cover the distance between the trenches as quickly as possible, the spokesman said. Armored vehicles are rarely used by the occupiers and mainly as a means of delivering manpower, not fire support for assault operations. — In addition, in certain directions, in particular, in the Vremiv direction near Levadny, the enemy also used armored vehicles several times, but not as a means of fire support for the actions of assault groups, but in order to transport these assault groups. The enemy drove them up, struck and destroyed them, Vladyslav Voloshyn explained. From this review, it is not possible to talk about the full participation of enemy armored vehicles in the assault. — It is currently not possible to say that the enemy used armored vehicles in offensive operations. However, it is on the battlefield and it is being prepared for use. In addition, in the Dnieper direction, the enemy is actively using such means, such equipment as boats, the officer said.

The retired FSB agent dreamed of -evacuation- to Russia and solving material issues	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. According to the case materials, the defendant was a military pensioner from the Mykolaiv Oblast, who came into the view of the occupiers during his trips to the Russian Federation even before the large-scale war. After the start of a large-scale invasion, an FSB employee remotely approached the man and offered him cooperation. In exchange for helping the Russians, the man was promised -evacuation- to Russia with further resolution of his material issues. On the instructions of a Russian special service agent, the agent scouted the locations of the Defense Forces, on which the Rashists planned to carry out airstrikes using Shahed-type kamikaze drones and missile weapons.

Over 3,000 shot down -shaheeds- in 3 months — the General Staff published the results of the air war	The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported this on November 5. Thanks to the coordinated combat work of the Air Defense Forces of Ukraine, it was possible to shoot down 3,063 enemy UAVs, which is 71%.

During the same period: May, June, and July 2024, 1,133 attack UAVs were launched on the territory of Ukraine. 1055 were shot down by anti-aircraft defense, 10 were lost in location. The percentage of shooting down for the period May–July 2024 is about 94%.

The decisive role was played by the professional work of Ukrainian artillerymen, who destroyed most of the enemy's armored vehicles with targeted strikes. Operators of anti-tank guided missiles were also distinguished, who eliminated several tanks with accurate shots. -Our fighters showed the enemy that his tactics of numerical superiority do not always work. Each of our soldiers knows what he is fighting for his people and has a clear goal. They once again proved to the Russians that Ukrainian land cannot be broken,- one of the officers of the 10th Mountain Assault Brigade emphasized. -This failure once again demonstrated the weakness of Russian tactics, which are based on numerical superiority and -massive attacks- that disregard the lives of soldiers.

BZVP of students: when and from what course will universities teach how to defend Ukraine	Mykhailo Vinnytskyi, Deputy Deputy Minister of Education and Science of Ukraine, told about this on the air of Novosti.LIVE . — The adopted law obliges us to introduce basic general military training in institutions of higher education in 2025. Obviously, this does not apply to freshmen, because they are mostly seventeen years old. It is most likely that it will be the third year, where the students have already reached 19-20 years of age and are of legal age, he said. Educational innovation, according to the deputy minister, is in no way connected with mobilization. — The mobilization age remains 25 [years]. It's just that a person who graduates from higher education should be able to handle a weapon, know where meetings are held in case of need, how to defend themselves in case of need, how to provide first aid with tactical medicine in case of need. All these things are included in basic general military training, explained the Deputy Minister of Education and Science of Ukraine. Currently, the system is being developed, training grounds are being prepared, and from January 2025, the training of instructors will begin. — This is a continuation of the initiatives that the Ministry of Education has now introduced to reformat -Defense of Ukraine- as a subject in high school, Mykhailo Vinnytskyi emphasized. The Deputy Minister also announced that in 2025, the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine will develop a project for the training of reserve officers. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Defense Forces participate in the reform of the school course -Defense of Ukraine-, The Cabinet of Ministers will finance the purchase of modern equipment for the updated course, and military training teachers in schools under the project of the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Veterans will become war veterans.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/bzvp-studentiv-vidkoly-i-z-yakogo-kursu-u-vyshah-navchatymut-zahyshhaty-ukrayinu/	2024-11-04T22:27:25-08:00

From the steering wheel -medevak- to the NRK remote control. A frank conversation with a stormtroope...	We met with him not far from the combat mission area and talked about the war for an hour and a half. Let's quote the direct language of -Makara-. I grew up in such an environment, had such an upbringing that for me the question did not arise when the war began: to go or not to go. The answer was self-evident. There was only a question of where to go, with whom to move and to which part of the front. There were calls, they said, let's go abroad. But I didn't get into such conversations, I clearly understood what I wanted and where I was needed. It would be a breach of conscience for me not to get involved in the problem that exists at this stage of history. My field of activity changed every year: in the Kyiv campaign I was an infantryman, in the Zaporizhzhia direction - a driver of a -medevak-. During the Bakhmut campaign, he was transferred to the assault company to the position of a machine gunner, then he was a mechvod, an M113 gunner. The commander of the assault group in the end. The most difficult was in Avdiivka, it cannot be compared with anything. Now I am responsible for a completely new direction for us - ground robotic complexes. It just needs good infantry experience, an understanding of the battlefield, tactics and how everything is arranged on the front line. I was always interested in developing something new. All these positions, it was not in the format that I was forcibly placed, given an order. It was a choice moment. I could stay and continue to work in the medical service, I could remain the same machine gunner, driver mechanic. In our team, you can choose what you want to do. I have a lot of people now who are not directly involved in the battlefield, but they are as useful as possible to support the infantry, in general, to the life of the battalion. We understand that there will be no benefit from a person who does not have the desire to do this or that. At the very beginning of the great war, motivation was very powerful. I went to war with the thought that I would not last more than two weeks here. Nevertheless, I will do something useful and right, even if it leads to my death. Then this motivation changed: the more professional I become, the longer I will live on the battlefield and in this war in general. And the more good things, actions that lead to victory, I will be able to do. After the loss of my brothers, the motivation changed dramatically, and now I want to avenge these guys. War is constantly changing: almost every six months there is a different style, character, technology, opportunities for conducting both defensive and offensive actions. Both with us and with the enemy. The armed forces are developing very quickly. We have surface drones, our own long-range drones that attack the Russian Federation. But still, the human resource on the battlefield will be the main one, because everything is focused on the fact that the same FPVs, drop systems, ground reconnaissance complexes, everything is adjusted to destroy the infantry that holds the lines. But we can do everything with the help of technology to help the infantry do their jobs. Infantry will be the main factor on the battlefield in any case. The infantry will always be the most important argument, because if there is a person there, then it cannot be assumed that it is our line. It will never be possible to completely replace a person in the trenches of work. We've had cases recently where most of the enemy's infantry simply didn't make it to our front lines simply because they were being maxed out by drops and FPV drones. Out of 100% of personnel, 10% reached the front line. This already simplifies the infantry's work as much as possible. She already has less impact on her positions and it's easier for her to do her job. &nbsp; &nbsp; A post shared by Kolya Makarov (@_kolya_makarov) 70% of my unit consists of fighters with assault infantry experience. And there is a young addition with no combat experience that just makes up for it. There are young guys 19-20 years old, and there are men who are already 30-40 years old. But in general, we do not have an age barrier. Age does not matter here, at all. It is decided by your experience, your ability to act, and the level of your motivation. And it very often happens that the commander of the department is a young guy, and he has men under his command who are 45 years old. They listen to him and do what he says. They consider him their commander and do not want anyone else. There are also girls in the teams, they are mostly in the positions of BpLA operators, NRK operators. But there are other examples. I was once given an infantry assault unit with a seconded group. There was a girl who had never been in battle before. And I had never been on the defensive with girls before and had never attacked. And the boys were critical of her. But literally a day or two later, everyone was in shock, because she dug trenches better than everyone else, carried out night combat duty better than everyone else, performed tasks better than everyone else. And later, already in her battalion, during the assault, this girl was left alone in the position, holding the defense herself. When reinforcements arrived, she led the group she was given. It was her third or fourth combat appearance. This shows that not everything depends on age and gender in war. Discipline, motivation and your inner core decide here. We need to put a new cadre of officers on their feet - young, active ones who have come through modern battles. Because what we are seeing now on the front line is largely the fault of the commanders. We can do the right thing in current situations, but we need a modern approach. In our brigade, there are only those people who came up from the infantry in commanding positions. A year or two ago, you were doing your job in the trenches, storming, defending, and now you are a platoon, company, battalion commander. Most of them are people aged 30-35. We have quite a few young group commanders in our battalion, who are 18-20 years old, and they show themselves very cool on the battlefield as commanders. A leader generally has a very strong influence on a team. It may be that the group is not motivated. But if the commander knows how to present information well, teach well, show people that they are important to him, he is ready to go with them to the end, and that it is really important to him that they know how, whether they have learned it, then the group becomes motivated . &nbsp; They understand that no one is going to abandon them just like that. And they are ready to work. I recently sent a very powerful cool branch commander to where he will grow and develop even more. He went to a higher position than mine, in fact, but I see that it was useful for everyone. Civilians do not fully understand what is happening here. In their eyes, everything looks like a person was stuffed into a -bus- and immediately taken to war. People do not understand what the front is like, what front-line cities are like, how the principle of work in the army is arranged, that not everyone is fighting on the front lines here. People need to be told more about how the army is organized. When they understand this and know what functionality awaits them in the service, the number of people who will voluntarily go to the army will increase. The rear and the front are different worlds, of course, it always has been. But I began to notice that when I see acquaintances, friends in the rear, they have a certain fear of communication, a certain fear of conversation, because they do not know what to talk about. And it is felt very strongly. I'm not pissed off by people in the back, I'm pissed off by people who aren't doing anything to win. When friends ask: -Well, what should we do?-. I say: just ask yourself a question every morning when you wake up. He set himself a goal and a task to do something for the country. I would like the civilians to understand: we can live in peace here in the rear only because there is someone who holds the defense, who died at night so that I could live this day. I would advise civilians to prepare. Medicine should be studied at least minimally. Tactics. We somehow didn't think about it. There are many opportunities for this in the country. When you are ready for something, you feel more confident. We have a test week of the attack aircraft, there is a cool FPV school. Come at least to talk to the military simply. In addition to the BZVP, we also have training at the brigade, battalion, and unit levels. When a person comes to me, he has time to join the team, to get used to it. If I see that a person is not ready, he will not go to the battlefield. A person must be prepared, and I can never ask a person to do something that I have not taught him myself. He was, is and always will be. Don't be afraid only of fools. During hostilities, fear goes overboard, but you need to be able to adjust it correctly and understand that on the battlefield there is only you, the enemy and death. And now you have such a game, who will throw this death into whose basket. And that nothing will help you at that moment, except yourself. Therefore, fear should be put in the background and act. If you give in to fear, then 100% you will not return from the battlefield. Or die in the next battles. It is necessary to understand that it is necessary to act now and already. And everything will depend on how you act. When you defeat yourself inside, break through all these moments of hesitation, then, in principle, not a single challenge will be scary for you. Fantastic question. Very often plans get in the way of work. We will plan when everything is over. My plans for now are to make sure that as few parents as possible cry for their sons who are forever in the war. Because this is the most difficult, the most painful moment - to look into the eyes of the parents of their brothers whom they buried. And at that moment you realize that you are ready to give everything so that all of this does not happen. Therefore, I advise all commanders, if you lose your soldiers, to go to their funerals and talk to their parents. This then gives a very great motivation to work even better, deal with personnel, do everything more professionally in order not to make even small mistakes on the battlefield. To save personnel as much as possible and to perform the combat task as efficiently as possible.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/vid-kerma-medevaku-do-pulta-nrk-vidverta-rozmova-zi-shturmovykom-pro-tyl-strah-komandyriv-i-plany-yakyh-nemaye/	2024-11-04T21:05:43-08:00
-Iron Fist- will provide Bradley: the US has ordered an active defense system	As informs the official portal of the US Department of Defense, profile an agreement was signed with General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems, which will install active defense systems. The total cost of the work is $191.2 million for BBM equipment with an unspecified number of these systems, ArmyInform reports. And the direct manufacturer of this equipment is one of the leading Israeli gunsmithing companies, Elbit Systems. Her site in May this year announced that the Haifa-based company has been awarded an initial contract worth approximately $37 million to supply Iron Fist active protection systems (APS) for General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems (GD-OTS) to upgrade the US Army's Bradley M2A4E1 infantry fighting vehicle (IPV). The contract will be executed within 24 months. Iron Fist (in Ukrainian - -Iron Fist-) APS is an advanced Hard Kill system aimed at increasing the self-defense capabilities of armored platforms against modern threats on the battlefield. It is the second generation APS of the Israel Defense Forces, characterized by high performance and low requirements for volume, weight and power consumption. The system provides armored platforms with 360-degree protection against a wide range of anti-tank threats, such as anti-tank missiles (ATMs), anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), unmanned aerial vehicles and threats located both in the open and in urban areas. . Thanks to the use of modern technologies, Iron Fist creates a protected hemisphere around the machine, effectively tracking and destroying threats. At the heart of Iron Fist's operation is the use of radars (Radars) that detect and identify missiles/projectiles/UAVs aimed at an armored vehicle. After detecting an enemy target, the information is transmitted to the on-board electronics, which coordinates the launch of the interceptors. These obstacles, created from flammable materials, minimize the number of fragments during an explosion and neutralize the threat with a powerful shock wave. Therefore, the threat is destroyed or deviated from the flight path, which significantly reduces the risk of hitting the target. Iron Fist has high application flexibility. The system can be installed on various types of armored vehicles, including light vehicles. At most, thanks to the use of electronic-optical sensors, the system is able to determine the location of the shooter, as well as automatically turn the BBM tower towards the threat, if this function is activated by the operator. An additional advantage is the possibility of installing Iron Fist in stationary positions, which makes it a universal means of protecting both mobile and stationary objects. Iron Fist launchers can be adapted to different customer requirements. The standard configuration includes two-charge installations, but options with an increase in the number of interceptors to six or even eight are possible, although the latter have not yet become widespread. For heavy equipment, as a rule, two launchers with different numbers of charges are used. Light vehicles such as the MRAP are equipped with a single installation. To simplify firing in response to light vehicles, you can additionally install a machine gun that will automatically turn towards the enemy object, which greatly facilitates the work of the crew. It should be noted that the first prototypes of the Iron Fist active defense complex were developed in the 2000s and, in addition to being installed on Israel Defense Forces (IDF) vehicles, were also offered for export. The system was primarily created to neutralize guided anti-tank missiles and rocket-propelled grenades, and is currently being tested to intercept armor-piercing feathered sub-caliber projectiles. Yehuda (Udi) Vered, General Manager of Elbit Systems Land: -Our Iron Fist active defense systems represent the highest level of innovation, offering comprehensive protection against emerging threats on the modern battlefield. Through this strategic collaboration with GD-OTS, we are honored to contribute to the advancement of the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, providing the US military with additional capabilities to effectively and safely accomplish their missions.- How reported ArmyInform, since the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine codified and allowed for operation in units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine almost 40 samples of foreign and domestically produced armored vehicles. Among them are M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. Iron Fist Active Protection System (APS) for Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles.

Чи вистачить резервів: експерт про втрати армії рф та її подальшу долю	But to what extent can this affect the overall power of the Soviet Union group in Ukraine? Simply put when people in the enemy army are over? But is there anyone else there to call up for military service? An expert of the Center for Defense Strategies, Viktor Kevlyuk, told about this: -If we talk about the mobilization reserve of the Russian Federation, then we should remember that their the previous defense minister said that Russia has up to 20 million people who could be drafted. Official Russian statistics say that Russia has a population of 143 million. Accordingly, about 27 of them are people of draft age. Therefore, if the Russian military medical commissions do not bother much, and that is what they are doing, there may be up to 25 million. in my opinion Again, we do not forget about the Russians who are serving their sentences, and the enemy is very actively recruiting them for military service, thus disposing of criminality. Now we have to talk about the active enemy army, its say, individual segments: what state are they in now. Special operations forces in the Russian Federation are quite small. Russian SSOs have -raked out- enough at the front in Ukraine to make their existence difficult, but the requirements for selection there remain quite strict, and the preparation &#8211; Quality. And I personally expect neither reduce their combat qualities or reduce their numbers. It is a specialized structure to get there anyone. On the other hand, they are part of the respective military districts and armies. These are special purpose brigades and regiments. They suffered very large losses in 2022, when they were used as a prepared infantry, and this is the way of using these specialists, in fact, led to very serious losses. Special forces of the Russian Federation has remained about half since 2022. All the rest are conscripts called up from the reserve, who previously served in the special forces and have the appropriate training. But they are a little older. Accordingly, they tolerate physical stress differently than young fighters. But they have experience, and many even have the experience of several military companies, including Syrian. Therefore, we will observe the tendency where the units of the Russian Federation will become worse and worse. Here they tried to select people, tried to prepare them. But when the task was set to deploy new divisions, the enemy took 31 separate landing brigades from Ulyanovsk, on its basis formed 104 airborne assault divisions, including a Motorial Regiment of Territorial Forces and another mobilization. . And they were simply assigned the name of assault troops. Although in both regiments, no person who at the time of reformat was served in them, had no airborne training. That is, these were ordinary guerrillas who were simply -lucky- to become paratroopers. Later in the division to include the 345th Parachut-Destant Regiment. are currently performing their tasks in the Kherson direction. They did not show themselves in any way, but they &#8211; -дєсантніки-. На початку вторгнення у противника були 76-та та 7-ма десантно-штурмові дивізії, 106-та та 98-ма повітрянодесантні дивізії. And there were three more amphibious assault brigades: the 11th, 83rd and 31st. Відповідно, всі ці -організми- зазнавали втрат, бо виконували роль штурмових загонів. Тож повітряно-десантні війська рф залишаються високомобільним компонентом, вони маневрують вздовж всієї лінії фронту. Вони відносно непогано укомплектовані, відносно непогано забезпечуються. Але, по-перше, це легка піхота, а по-друге, це підрозділи, які зазнають величезних втрат, бо виконують завдання непритаманні повітрянодесантним військам. According to those who started the war, about 40-50% remained in the ranks. British intelligence claims &#8211; 50% And in some military units, probably less. For example, from the 331 regiment, which -distinguished- in Bucha, there is little left, because as soon as it fell into the field of view of the forces of Ukraine's defense forces, it was mowed by everything than it is. Marines. Її намагалися підтримувати на певному рівні, але це дуже важко робити через те, що та морська піхота, яка нині воює проти нас, це – партизани в бригадах другого чи третього формування. Приміром, 810 бригада Чорноморського флоту переформовувалася три рази: після боїв за Маріуполь, після боїв на Херсонському напрямку, і зараз добивають її третій склад у Курській області. Інформація, яку я бачу у відкритих джерелах, дозволяє стверджувати, що на відміну від спецпризначенців і десантників, у морській піхоті рф час від часу лунали відомості про підрозділи, укомплектовані колишніми в&#8217;язнями. Це говорить про те, що морська піхота виконує задачі штурмовиків і людей там сильно не шкодують. Якщо перейти до підрозділів мотострілецьких, то – їх до біса багато, і це основа угрупування російських військ в Україні. І ми бачимо, що росія веде війну за зразком 1916 року, коли піхота своїми масами давить на противника за підтримки артилерії і, можливо, авіації. Тобто, коли ми говоримо про ворожу піхоту, то ми говоримо про війська, які мають базову підготовку і досвід ведення бойових дій. І важливий момент – ми спостерігаємо тенденцію поступового зменшення якості військ рф. As the Defense Forces of Ukraine knock out their bones, people without training and without special knowledge come to take the place of the fallen Russian soldiers. I think that the enemy group in Ukraine will gradually degrade. If in February 2022 it had from 150 to 190 thousand, in December 2023 &#8211; 400-450 thousand, now we are talking about 470 thousand. Але російська система комплектування поступово дає збої та не в змозі постачати поповнень, які б вже покривали втрати. Так, в період з 29 вересня до 24 жовтня вбитими, зниклими безвісти та дезертирами противник втратив десь 18100 військових та ще 39400 пораненими і хворими. 23% will not return to the army due to severe wounds and amputations. In total, about 5,7500 soldiers were departed from the system, and only 20 and 25 thousand were received for replenishment. Тому, мабуть, ще рік бойових дій і наприкінці 2025-го це угруповання фізично може перестати існувати-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/chy-vystachyt-rezerviv-ekspert-pro-vtraty-armiyi-rf-ta-yiyi-podalshu-dolyu/	2024-11-04T20:29:46-08:00
The enemy is dispersing a fake about a grant for -over a billion hryvnias-: what are we talking abou...	It is interesting that on the Derzhkino website there is indeed news about the announcement of the presidential grant competition in 2025. To participate, it is necessary to submit relevant documents: application, estimate, description of the film, etc. Similar conditions were previously seen in 2023 and 2024. But, of course, there is no mention in them of -positive coverage of TCC actions.- The real purpose of the competition is to provide state financial support to young artists for the creation and implementation of socially significant creative projects. Clear restrictions on project topics are not specified. In the forgery, an amount of more than one billion UAH was indicated for the creation of a film production, but only UAH 3.9 million was indicated on the official website. This is the amount of funds provided for the payment of three grants, in accordance with the Presidential Decree -On State Support of Culture and Art in Ukraine.- They are allocated from the budget of the Ministry of Culture and Strategic Communications. As in other similar cases, by inventing such lies, the enemy is trying to disrupt mobilization and sow enmity in society.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/vorog-rozganyaye-fejk-pro-grant-na-ponad-milyard-gryven-pro-shho-mova/	2024-11-04T20:14:44-08:00

Of course, the most attention is paid to the Donetsk destinations. But we also see Russian activity in the south of Ukraine. The defense forces must provide a response. The Kursk operation was discussed separately today. It will be three months of our active actions in Kurshchyna soon. And this is important — keeping this -sanitary zone- in designated areas near our state border. And we must appreciate the importance of this operation - the Kursk operation - to replenish our exchange fund. This greatly helped the liberation of our people from Russian captivity. I thank all the soldiers, sergeants and officers who are involved in our active actions in Kurshchyna,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. According to him, he listened to a separate report by the GUR and the Foreign Intelligence Service regarding the North Korean military on the territory of Russia. -There are already 11,000 in the Kursk region. We see an increase in the North Koreans, we do not see an increase in the reaction of partners. Unfortunately,- the President remarked. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also announced that he had a conversation with the President of Moldova, Maya Sandu, whom he congratulated on her victory in the elections and, in general, on the fact that Moldova's course towards real sovereignty has withstood the test.

Today is a professional day for almost 200,000 Ukrainian men and women. All employees of -Ukrainian Railways-. I had the opportunity to congratulate them, thank them. And please don't forget to always thank the people who work in such special industries of ours that carry everything else in the country. I am proud of our people!

GUR called on the people of Russia to unite in the fight against Putin's regime	The statement of GUR was published on his channel. -What kind of -unity- can we talk about when an aggressive Moscow is getting fat, and the regions are stably pale and poor. Take, for example, Ingushetia - every third resident here lives below the poverty line. The situation is similar in Kalmykia, Karachay-Cherkessia, and Tyva - every fifth person is in poverty there,- said the GUR statement. According to our intelligence officers, such -unity- of obedience and silence of those reduced to poverty benefits the Kremlin, because it is from the regions, and not from Moscow or St. Petersburg, that the Putin regime draws human resources for -meat- assaults. -During the criminal war against Ukraine, 3.5 times more Bashkir invaders died than Muscovites; residents of Tatarstan - three times more, Buryats - twice. The recipe for Moscow -unity- contains only two components - poverty and death,- the HUR reminded. But they said that it was time to stop and punish Moscow. -You can report on the movement of Russian troops, the location of their headquarters and military-technical developments through Main intelligence bot or in other safe ways,- the GUR statement said. As reported by ArmyInform, according to the data of GUR occupiers throw the wounded to the assault against the backdrop of heavy losses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/gur-zaklykav-narody-rosiyi-do-yednosti-u-borotbi-z-rezhymom-putina/	2024-11-04T11:29:35-08:00

A representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine passed the course -Information available for ...	The training took place in Riga, the capital of Latvia. A delegation of communicators from Ukrainian government structures took part in the event. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, in particular, was represented by junior lieutenant Vladyslav Dunayenko, who shared his impressions of the event with the ArmyInform correspondent. — Since Ukraine is moving in the direction of the EU, our Latvian friends organized a training called -Accessible information for all- for representatives of Ukrainian ministries and other state bodies on simplifying communication with people with disabilities. We learned to write texts according to certain standards that make them accessible to anyone - children, the elderly and people with disabilities, in particular, people with reduced mobility, people with visual and hearing impairments and even people with intellectual disabilities. The purpose of the training is to add these skills to the work of press services and press offices of Ukrainian ministries, - explained Vladyslav Dunayenko. The training program involved not only studying the rules of information dissemination, but also introduced seemingly elementary things: the presence of ramps, road markings, traffic light buttons, etc. The course participants visited the library for people with visual impairments, where they got acquainted with how books and other information materials are printed in Braille, how audio books and audio messages are created for people with visual impairments. They were also in the inclusive museum of Latvian culture. — Due to the fact that we have an increasing number of people with disabilities, this experience will be extremely relevant for Ukraine in the coming years. Creating such content and adapting the environment for people with special needs is important to us. The second aspect is about clear and simple language. In our state structures, as in most European countries, before these rules were introduced, the so-called -official language- is used, which is often incomprehensible to the common man. And this applies not only to state structures, but also to banks, insurance companies, etc. The integration of plain and understandable language standards will be appropriate in order for the society to be more aware of what is happening. After all, writing in a simple and understandable language will help to inform the society more effectively, - noted Vladyslav Dunayenko. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/predstavnyk-ministerstva-oborony-ukrayiny-projshov-kurs-dostupna-informacziya-dlya-vsih-v-mezhah-ryzkoyi-akademiyi/	2024-11-04T10:21:58-08:00

Among the topics are plans for 2025 aimed at even greater military aid to Ukraine. -Representatives of our intelligence provided detailed information to Lithuanian partners about the current situation at the front. The aggressive plans of the enemy for autumn and winter were analyzed. Today we see how Russia receives help from dictatorial regimes, including the involvement of manpower from North Korea. But I am convinced that with such reliable partners as Lithuania, we will defeat the aggressor. Together we are getting closer to victory!-, Rustem Umyerov assured.

According to the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Rustem Umyerov, over two and a half years, Lithuania has provided military aid to Ukraine in the amount of more than 705 million euros. - Lithuania has committed to annually provide support in the amount of 0.25% of GDP. This is a significant contribution to our struggle, to our joint victory. Only in 2024, Lithuania handed us 155-caliber ammunition, M113 armored personnel carriers, anti-drone systems and other equipment. I thank Minister Kaschyunas (head of the Defense Department of the Republic of Lithuania - ed.) for his leadership and support, Rustem Umyerov emphasized. He noted that today our country received another aid package: - Lithuania purchased 230 cars and 240 metal detectors as part of the Coalition for demining. This Coalition was created at the initiative of Lithuania and united 21 countries to support our army and our people. Very grateful for this support and this leadership. We must understand that the longer this terrible war continues, the more territories will be polluted and mined. For this we need the support of our partners. In turn, the Minister of National Defense of the Republic of Lithuania, Laurinas Kaschyunas, noted that the large-scale invasion of Russia made Ukraine one of the most mined countries in the world. - Successful demining is a prerequisite for Ukraine's victory. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and its Armed Forces are responsible for a wide range of mine action activities and today perform both combat and humanitarian demining. This requires significant international support, said Laurinas Kasciunas. And he added that this first batch of demining equipment is much more than just a set of tools: - It symbolizes our steadfast support for Ukraine. The head of the Administration of the State Special Service of Transport, Major General Oleksandr Yakovets, assured that the received pickups will increase the power of engineer-mining and engineer-assault units, provide operative and humanitarian demining units and make our life safer. The Commander of the Support Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Major General Dmytro Gerega, conveyed words of gratitude from the rank-and-file sappers, who directly perform combat tasks on the contact line, using equipment, weapons and equipment provided by our partners.

The second army of the world is again the first in looting - now in Kurshchyna	This was reported by the Center for Countering Disinformation on November 4. According to the Center, the Kursk TV channel aired a story about residents of the Glushkiv district of the region who reported cases of robbery by the Russian military. Also, Kursk Regional Duma deputy Oleksiy Zolotaryov told how the Russian military stole cows from local farmers. It is characteristic that the Ukrainian military has never been in these areas. Stories about mass looting by the Russian military in the Kursk region also regularly appear in local communities on social networks. Even the Z-warriors admit it. Instead, the local authorities call this data -Ukrainian IPSO- and pretend that nothing happened. -Cases of looting by the Russian military on its own territory reveal the same -mysterious Russian soul- as best as possible, which does not know any values ​​and moral principles, but only seeks to make money,- said the message of the CPD.

As for Kurshchyna, the most active shelling and bombing is there. the Russians do not stop trying to storm and use their usual tactics. -The enemy is simply destroying settlements, they are simply being wiped out below zero. It is the Russians, despite the fact that this is their population and their territory. They follow the same tactics as in Donbass and in the south of our country,- said Vadym Mysnyk. Earlier ArmyInform reported , that at a time when everyone is talking about the involvement of the Russian Federation in the fighting in the Kursk region of the North Korean military, only citizens of the Russian Federation continue to die in suicidal infantry assaults without any support from armored vehicles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/odnakova-taktyka-rosiyany-nyshhat-kurshhynu-tak-samo-yak-i-donechchynu/	2024-11-04T01:32:55-08:00

As reported by ArmyInform, in the Kurakhiv direction occupiers are risking everything, trying to remove damaged equipment from the battlefield - the change in tactics is due to the lack of armored vehicles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-pro-agresyvni-ataky-rosiyan-na-kurahivskomu-napryamku/	2024-11-04T01:20:23-08:00

That is, in fact, they transferred all actions in the Black Sea to an air format,- the spokesman said. According to Dmytro Pletenchuk, Ukraine is a world leader in the use of unmanned naval combat systems. Marine drones are also successfully used for mine clearance and reconnaissance. -And this allows us to continue the work of our grain corridor.

The soldier who took over the company. The story of a combat officer -Maxon-	This war has already brought up many worthy young commanders who went from soldier to officer, and today we will tell about one of them - Maksym Zaichenko, lieutenant of the Third Separate Assault Brigade. Correspondent of Armiya TV met with - Maxon- in the early fall near the combat mission area to ask him about 10 years of war, attitude to people and leadership in the current army. - You are from Zaporozhye. If you compare the city 15 years ago and now, what has changed? - I was born in Zaporizhzhia in 1992. He entered the football sector in 2007. Subsequently, repressive actions on the part of the then authorities against the fans began. This is me about the case of the Pavlichenkos. We supported the actions in Kyiv, for me it was a manifestation of my civic position. It happened that -Berkut- tried to put us on the asphalt simply because of the red and black flag. Both in Zaporizhzhia and at away matches. Therefore, it was precisely this press from the side of the state, from the side of law enforcement agencies, that forced us to unite. And when the revolution began, the fans came forward as a single force. Our city is very industrial, I had the impression that you only have to move along a typical vector: learn to be an electromechanic - school, vocational school, factory. It was important for me to think about my future so that it was determined by me, and not by the environment. I found like-minded people who believed that Zaporizhzhia is not only factories, but many different areas. Cossack spirit, how not to be cool. You just need to develop them. - Did you even then think that there would be a war? What will have to be fought for? — This became clear to me after the Revolution of Dignity. I was a student, I took an active part in the revolution both on the Zaporozhye Maidan and on the Capital Square. When all kinds of -militia- and Russians began to capture populated areas, of course, there was already an understanding that it was necessary to react. Ilovaisk became a critical moment. It was an understanding for me that the situation is not as rosy as I imagined. I understood that I had to join the army. I was supposed to go to the third year of the university, but I packed my things and went to Kyiv. We had a mobilization center at the Kozatsky hotel. He stayed there for several weeks, underwent training and went to the East. Arrived in Urzuf near Mariupol. Got weapons, got armor, it was a volunteer battalion of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. - How did those around you, loved ones, perceive your decision to go to war in 14th? - The family had a reaction that, they say, you can stay, you don't need to go - they can kill you there. But I have explained my position. And they supported me, saying that I was doing everything right. It was organic for me and my environment. Once again, I am an ordinary guy from Zaporozhye. — Tell us about your battle path. How did you end up here? - During the 2014-16 campaign, I was a grenade launcher, a machine gunner in an assault platoon, as it was then called. I was in the rapid response group, participated in the Shirokin operation. Stabilization actions were also carried out in Mariintka. Sometimes he performed the tasks of a unit commander, but he did not officially have a title. Retired as a senior soldier. Later in his civilian life, he began to delve into military topics. He formed a defense headquarters in our city, he immediately understood that it was necessary to acquire skills, not only in handling weapons, but also in medicine, tactics, and military management. Just before the large-scale invasion, he moved to Kyiv. And I knew that, in case of anything, the guys from Azov and I would gather at ATEK (plant in Kyiv). And on February 24, indeed, everyone was there. They say to me: -Maxon-, come on, you are a veteran yourself, gather people like you, people are coming from different regions, organize. So, literally on the first day, more than a hundred people gathered at my place. Some I knew, some just arrived. They came again. And in the evening they ask me how many people you have. At that time there were about one hundred and thirty. They put me in charge of a company, they say, deal with the distribution of personnel, structure, organize, think about support, think about combat training. For about a week, he was engaged in organizing this. Legally, it was just a group of people. At the same time, there were already situations when the enemy came very close to Kyiv. I gathered groups of people who were already ready to perform combat tasks and they went to perform such tasks already in those days. There was a kind of -commotion-, but work had to be done, for example, they helped one of the units of the 72nd brigade to hold the line on the Irpin River. There were a number of other similar combat missions. In just a few weeks, we were able to build a management structure, assign people roles according to their knowledge and skills. But there were also people who did not know much, they had to gain a basic level of training in these couple of weeks. In this way, we coordinated, formed a company, at that time it was a unit of territorial defense -Azov-Kyiv-. On the basis of this company, we later reformed into a company of the Azov-Kyiv SSO battalion. Being actually a company commander when he was drafted into the SSO, only then did he receive the rank of sergeant. - How did the events develop further? - Then we went to the Zaporozhye direction, where as a company we joined the battle and helped hold Vremivka. There was a difficult situation. The enemy then took possession of Neskuchny, there was very little left to enter Vremivka. We went there, reinforced our comrades from the territorial defense, from the Defense Forces. There was another episode when the enemy entered a settlement, and we immediately knocked it out: we were provided with three BMPs, our infantry drove into them and cleared this settlement. In this way, they worked to stop the advance of the enemy in the Zaporizhzhia direction. After that came the understanding that it was necessary to develop as a unit, because we did not have heavy weapons, armored vehicles, artillery, tanks. We realized that it is not promising to be permanently attached to someone. Therefore, it was decided to reformat and create a brigade within the Ground Forces. At that moment, I was offered to develop the battalion. That's how I got the primary officer rank - junior lieutenant. This is how I went from a senior soldier, then an actual company commander, I was still the head of intelligence in the Bakhmut direction, then I worked in the Avdiiv direction, Terny, and now I am here as a so-called acting officer. battalion chief of staff. - Are there people, commanders or soldiers that you look up to? - This is not about historical figures or any military leaders, but about the fact that there are a lot of guys around who look fear in the eyes. I understand for myself that everyone can have fear, but what distinguishes a brave person is not the absence of fear, but the ability to overcome this fear and fulfill the task that you have, that you have set for yourself. And it's not just about war, it's about life in general. And I am very glad that many of the guys we have here are, in fact, almost all of them are heroes. And everyone I see, I have a lot of respect for someone who is in our department and can be looked up to. In general, in response to this question, I can name many battalion commanders. We don't have -jackets-. The average age of the officers is probably somewhere in the region of 30 years. All of them grew up within the brigade, roughly speaking. Now we have reached the level where we have harmony between the officers and the rank and file, there is an understanding between the soldiers. And there are no questions, they say that an outsider came to command there. - If it were not for the Third Assault Brigade, in which brigade would you like to serve? - But there is no such brigade. It happens that people do not want to spend their own efforts, to come to everything ready-made. But the guys and I built this unit from scratch. Everything in the Third Assault Room was created from scratch. Created directly by the guys in this crew. Fighters of all levels. Both soldiers and command. And volunteers. Indeed, this is the child that we created, gave birth to together. I just can't say that I see myself anywhere yet. And it's not about us being perfect. We actually have a very wide range of areas that need to be developed. Nothing perfect exists. And even if somewhere we are the coolest, there is still room to grow. Therefore, everyone who comes, I am sure, will be able to realize himself with us. If the ideas are really competitive, then a person will show himself, and we will create all the conditions for this. - Tell us about how you prepare recruits? - We have recruiting centers. A person comes, asks what they are interested in, signs a contract. Next, our instructors provide basic skills, do everything to ensure that a person is first of all able to blend into the team. After a person has come to us, he also goes through adjustment. That is, it is not the case that a recruit arrived and was immediately sent somewhere. This is something that scares many. We don't do that. Because we would lose ground to an unprepared fighter. And it is not profitable for us to put an untrained fighter on the front line. We are interested in a person being ready to perform basic tasks. - Tell us about recent work (the conversation was recorded at the end of September, ed.). What is the current situation in your area of ​​responsibility? - If we talk specifically about our unit, the Second Assault Battalion, we have been in active defense since the spring, we were moved from the Avdiiv direction for recovery. But recovery takes place in combat conditions. And lately, the enemy has been trying to seize the bridgeheads, advance in the direction of Borova, to the Oskil River. The pressure is on several fronts. Including due to the range of responsibility of our brigade. But we are trying to dictate our own initiative. We suppress the enemy, accordingly, the defense is active, we carry out counterattacking actions. Somewhere we are helping other units. Right now, our soldiers are conducting active assault actions on the front. And the preparation for these actions was very exhausting, dynamic, it's a pity that I can't tell about it. According to our estimates, the main goal of the enemy is to seize specific settlements before winter. In order to cross the river on our site. So that they have a bridgehead and from it continue the offensive and seize Ukrainian territory further. - What was remembered during these days? - Is it that the enemy's infantry marches in droves every day. And now I sometimes have this feeling, especially in the morning, like a time loop, -groundhog day-. Almost every day the same thing. The enemy tries to climb, follows almost the same routes. We are waiting for him there, we meet him, inflict damage, squeeze like cockroaches. But they continue to do it the next day. And they use the same ineffective methods. - Do you expect that with the rains and cold weather the nature of the fighting will change? - There is a conceptual opinion, and there is a practical one. If you start from a practical point of view, it is always better to winter in basements, and not in dugouts in the ground. Therefore, purely from a practical point of view, the impression is that the enemy is trying to occupy populated areas in order to meet the winter normally. We faced the fact that actually wintering in the ground is a little more difficult than getting settlements. And from a more global point of view, the adversary needs to compensate for the reputational losses he has already suffered. Which were caused by the actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I have in mind both the Kursk operation and the situation with the fleet at sea, how we knocked them out. Therefore, they use a large human resource, a significant amount of equipment. And he will achieve some results, and indeed, this winter and these geopolitical moments will shape the reality that will take place in the spring. - Do the military talk about potential negotiations, some kind of truce? - I believe that such thoughts appear more among the civilian population and in the mass media. Not so in the military. We are thinking about the combat mission that is immediately in front of us. This is directly my attitude. We have, regardless of what happens in the offices in Kyiv or other cities, other countries, to fulfill the task that is clearly issued as a combat order. Hold the line. Provide maintenance in general. Each brigade has a line of responsibility. We need to get used to the fact that everyone should be responsible for their own line of responsibility. After all, when you fail in yourself, you thereby set others up. The same probably applies to people who try to shift responsibility from themselves to someone else. There is a citizen, his responsibility, it is written in the Constitution, in addition to rights. Yes? But there is still a responsibility to protect one's Motherland. Why is it often said that the Third is stormy, it has an ideology, there is some high psychological level. Because our people, first of all, are ready to take responsibility for themselves. And when you understand that you have a specific task, you will fulfill it regardless of other circumstances. That is why we are thinking about this. - What are your plans after the war? Will it ever end? — In war, it is difficult to talk about plans. But I know for sure that I will return to my family, to my wife, to my son. I am in contact with them, now video communication helps. But what I know for sure is that as long as I am in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, I will do my duty. I will try to bring this point as close as possible, I don't know what to call it, but this point is a clear understanding that the eastern neighbor, I hope, will no longer be in the form of the Russian Federation, this fragmented structure will not threaten our state. And, accordingly, to my family. And to the families of my boys, my brothers. That is, it is a matter of survival. We are not fighting because we are simply stubborn. Or we were told by our Western partners that we should fight. This is a question of survival. So I want to make sure my child doesn't have to fight. That my wife will not be in danger. Until there is this understanding, I will use the most effective methods, which is to defend the state with weapons in my hands. And to protect those people, citizens who live in this state. This is what we are doing now.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/soldat-yakyj-vzyav-na-sebe-rotu-istoriya-bojovogo-oficzera-maksona/	2024-11-03T21:11:52-08:00

Rocketman Kim's intercontinental antics: what is known about the ballistic missile he plans to launc...	As informs the Army Recognition portal, intelligence received during a confidential briefing indicates that North Korea has completed preparations for a nuclear test at its Punggyeri test site, with a special equipment and launchers, probably for the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile designed to demonstrate atmospheric reentry capabilities. As the authors of the portal note, the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, has been increasing his show of force in recent months, accelerating missile tests and opening a secret military enterprise for the production of uranium in September. According to South Korean intelligence, North Korea has deployed a mobile launcher, likely the 12-axis model recently shown in state media, to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles that could potentially reach the US territory. The move comes in line with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol's warnings that Pyongyang could stage major military provocations around the US election to pressure Washington and its allies. The ICBM, probably the Hwasong-18 or a similar missile, will check durability of atmospheric re-entry technology, which is critical for the warhead to withstand the extreme heat and friction en route to the target. While previous North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile tests have been conducted with launches at steep angles to minimize distance and avoid hitting nearby territories, analysts suggest that a more standard trajectory would represent a major advance in North Korea's missile program. Such a test would confirm North Korea's ability to target remote locations, including the US mainland. Escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula since 2022, particularly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have allowed North Korea to develop its nuclear and missile programs under less international scrutiny. In this context, recent reports from the authorities of the Republic of Korea leave no doubt about Kim Jong Un's intentions to continue developing weapons of mass destruction while strengthening alliances with states outside the Western sphere, such as Russia. For decades, North Korea has developed a nuclear capability to increase deterrence against perceived threats. Relying on asymmetric weapons strategies to offset the limitations of its conventional forces, Pyongyang has made significant progress in miniaturizing nuclear warheads and developing intercontinental ballistic missiles such as the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15 models. These capabilities position North Korea as a nuclear power capable of striking the United States, thereby increasing geopolitical pressure on the United States and its allies. As North Korea occupies a strategic position, the US and its regional allies continue to closely monitor these preparations to anticipate any potential threat. -The possibility of nuclear tests and the launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles during the election period in the United States creates an atmosphere of uncertainty, emphasizing the importance of maintaining international vigilance,- the authors of the article summarize. The launch of the North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-18.

About the great construction and the best servant of the soldier: why in Britain they teach the mobi...	No matter how well trained and highly motivated the soldiers are, no matter how many they are, and no matter how well they are equipped with the right weapons and ammunition, the fighters will not be able to hold their positions if they are not properly equipped. The correspondent of ArmiyaInform tells about how they learn to set up individual shelters, observation and firing positions during the BZVP within the limits of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. The task of our two detachments is to occupy a circular defense in a house on the outskirts of a small settlement called Eastmere. This is one of the locations of the famous STANTA - Stanford Training Area in the county of Norfolk in the northeast of England. Based on the approximate population size by Ukrainian standards, Istmir can be called a village, because it is unlikely that more than a thousand people can live in the houses there. However, in terms of infrastructure, it is more of a town, because it even has its own hotel. Before leaving the camp for the so-called -Urban- - training in combat tactics in urban development - I had time and will be able to surf the Internet well, so I not only know the general history of the STANTA district and the town of Eastmere, but I can also navigate its streets . Eastmere was built in 1942 when, during the Second World War, the British Army needed a combat training ground to train soldiers for urban combat. It was on the territory of STANTA that soldiers were trained for combat after landing in Normandy during Operation Neptune on the famous D-Day. There are a lot of photos and videos from Eastmere Training Village on the Internet, including media publications about the recent training of Ukrainian servicemen from previous rotations. This makes it possible to recognize not only the streets and houses of the town, but even individual rooms inside the buildings. The most interesting fact turns out to be the fact that from the end of the 1960s to the mid-1970s, the famous TV series -Dad's Army- (-Dad's Army-) about the so-called Home Guard (The Home Guard), which was originally called Local Defense Volunteers (LDV). The Home Guard can be called local defense units or, in a more familiar wording for Ukrainians, territorial defense. Volunteers who could not join the army in any other way due to medical reasons or because they had professions from which specialists were exempted from conscription went to the British Terrodefense during the Second World War. Most often, the British could not join the army in any other way, except for service in the Home Guard, because they were older than the mobilization age. Hence the title of the series -Dad's Army-, which jokingly plays on the age of the volunteers, most of whom are over 50 years old, while others are not supposed to serve for medical reasons or because of their civilian profession. The TV series -Dad's Army- became extremely popular in Great Britain, having a huge impact on society and popular culture. During its run in the 1970s, it regularly drew an audience of 18 million viewers, its characters became recognizable, and many of its catchphrases became catchy. In 2000, Dad's Army was ranked thirteenth in the British Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes, and in 2004, Dad's Army was ranked fourth in the BBC's poll of the UK's best sitcom. In the end, the extraordinary popularity of the series prompted the British in 2016 to make a full-length film -Dad's Army-. After reading about STANTA and -Dad's Army-, you involuntarily begin to associate yourself with the heroes of the series and British soldiers of the Second World War. So when we finally get to the town of Eastmere, its modern look is somewhat surprising, because we expected to see something from the 80s. But no, Eastmere has been renovated, updated and partially rebuilt. The middle of the last century is evidenced only by the rusty skeleton of an armored car left in the backyard of a city hotel. It has such an ancient appearance that it appears to be a message not even from the Second World War, but from the even earlier First World War. It is the two-story hotel building that our second and fourth units are to protect, while the first and third units are set up in the house across the street. There are a lot of rooms on two floors and in the solid basement of the hotel, so there are two fighters for each position. We are given the task of setting up observation and firing positions in a limited time and with the means at hand in such a way as to be able to repel the training assault that will be carried out by the instructors. Time is short, so we get to work right away and work non-stop right up to the deadline. I am lucky to work with -The Chinese- - he is younger than me and has some experience in military training, so he can orient himself better and faster than me. I myself am more useful in earthworks - rural childhood and the experience of archaeological expeditions are in evidence, but I feel less confident in urban development and with building materials. Our building material is bulky and inconvenient to carry wooden pallets, heavy sandbags and heavy clumsy stone building blocks, much larger in size than the standard bricks we are used to. We also find some fragments of metal structures, boards, netting - everything goes. Our -big construction- continues, the outskirts of Istmir have turned into an anthill, on the streets of which dozens of soldiers in pixels are dreaming, dragging everything that will help to set up positions. Our unit continues to work even when some fighters from neighboring platoons have long since finished their work and are resting. Only after the deadline, when the instructors are already leaving to evaluate our work, -The Chinese- and I have time to run around and inspect the work of our brothers and sisters. The quality is impressive, and -Grandfather- and his partner actually managed to build a real -Great Wall of China- - an impenetrable barricade. -Grandfather- in civilian life is a builder, so he knows what he's doing. The instructors praise our unit, and our position thanks to the -Chinese- is one of the best - comfortable, well protected, with a good field of view and firing. Instructor -Thomas- gets into position with the machine gun and nods his head approvingly - we did a good job. Then, when we go to inspect the positions of neighboring platoons, we will see positions that are even better than ours, and, unfortunately, significantly worse positions. Those who completed the work much earlier than us did it precisely because they neglected their own safety and built the fortifications badly. While we are visiting the neighbors, I remember the world-famous tale of the three little pigs, which, by the way, originally originated in England and goes back to the depths of folk folklore of the Middle Ages. The first piglet made a house out of straw. But the evil wolf blew - and the lightweight straw weaving flew behind the wind. The second piglet made a house out of branches, sticks and verbolos. However, the predatory beast tensed up - and destroyed the shaky weaving of the mouth. And only the third piglet built a real tenement with strong walls. So no matter how much the attacker tried to break his fortress, he could not even move a single brick or move even a single pebble. The third pig stubbornly struggled, while his fellows, hastily making a shelter out of straw and sticks, rested, played, sang and danced and passed the time in every other way. However, later, when it came to the fight with the enemy, it turned out that only the house of the third piglet was able to reliably protect the inhabitant. Instead, the straw and adobe -fortifications- crumbled to pieces at the slightest enemy pressure. The instructors do not read us notations, they only silently pay attention to certain shortcomings that are obvious even without their prompts. Only later, already during other classes, one or the other of them make small remarks, from the combination of which a simple but important moral emerges: -A good soldier always takes care of himself, his safety and his comfort. After all, how well he feels, how well rested, how safe and comfortable his shelter and position are, directly depends on both his survival and the performance of the combat mission. A soldier has no servants to do everything for him. He is his own best servant, who can and should take care of himself in the best possible way. So never be lazy, because your life depends on your work.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/pro-velyke-budivnycztvo-i-najkrashhogo-slugu-soldata-chomu-u-brytaniyi-mobilizovanyh-vchat-buty-tretim-porosyam/	2024-11-03T20:40:25-08:00
The battle for the White House: what is known about the strategic communications of Kamala Harris an...	Donald Trump's election campaign is built on the images of a -savior of the common people- and a national hero. His communication strategy is to consistently emphasize Trump's role as the only defender of citizens against the -system.- His slogan is-They didn't come for me, they came for you. I'm just standing in their way- resonates with thousands of American citizens, especially among supporters of the Republican Party. The key theses of Donald Trump's campaign are collected in Agenda 47, which includes ten priorities and twenty promises focused on the security and financial well-being of Americans. Trump's staff has made extensive use of micro-targeting, attracting support among specific groups such as parents, veterans and athletes through promises addressed to each audience separately. Opinion leaders are another important tool during election campaigns. As of today, 49 celebrities, including Elon Musk, Mel Gibson, Tucker Carlson, Kanye West and Fifty Cent, have expressed their support for Donald Trump. This greatly strengthens his position among voters, for whom the opinion of these people is authoritative. In response to Donald Trump's hero image, Kamala Harris' staff chose the archetype of a leader who faithfully serves the country and leads it to change. Her campaign builds on Harris' previous experience as vice president of the United States and California attorney general, emphasizing her accomplishments and work already done. The main audience of Kamala Harris' information campaign is middle-class citizens. In its strategy, it relies on the support of such famous persons as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jimmy Carter, Barack and Michelle Obama, Eminem and Taylor Swift. In total, she was supported by 81 famous people, which is a significant advantage for attracting the attention and trust of voters. The information campaigns of both candidates were also influenced by the publication of -Project 2025- by the think tank -Heritage Foundation-, which highlights the potential first steps of Donald Trump if he wins the election. The project has become a sensation and has caused concern among many US citizens, as its recommendations are considered a threat to democracy and civil rights. Donald Trump distanced himself from the project. At the same time, Kamala Harris began to use it as a tool for conducting -offensive actions-, forcing Trump to take a reactive position. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris' strategic communications show consistency and a clear structure. Both candidates go to great lengths to maintain their chosen image and to maintain the tone of their own brand. Kamala Harris is benefiting from the powerful support of opinion leaders, as well as the effect of the sensational release of -Project 2025-, which significantly increases her chances of winning the presidential election. At the same time, time and circumstances leave room for change, which adds uncertainty to the race for the White House.

The heart of a soldier of the Armed Forces for $70,000: Russians on the darknet are lying about -bla...	But as informs the Countering Disinformation Center, these messages are part of a long-running campaign by enemy propagandists, known as Black Transplantology. It dates back to 2014. Its main goal is to discredit the Ukrainian military and political leadership and to create a negative image of Ukraine on the international stage. This fake also works as a tool of psychological warfare, causing distrust in the Ukrainian authorities, speculating on emotionally complex topics and creating an image of the Ukrainian military as -victims of the system- rather than Russian aggression. The manipulation is aimed at destabilizing Ukrainian society and weakening the country's support from the international community. Propaganda often uses similar disinformation tactics to tarnish Ukraine's reputation as a corrupt state with a disregard for human rights. Ukraine, on the contrary, always adheres to international norms of humanitarian law and ensures proper treatment of fallen soldiers, strictly fulfilling international obligations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/sercze-bijczya-zsu-za-70-tysyach-dolariv-rosiyany-v-darkneti-breshut-pro-chornu-transplantologiyu/	2024-11-03T20:15:51-08:00

There is no public transport or heating at the TOT of Luhansk region	This reports the head of Luhansk OVA Artem Lysogor.

Active hostilities and destruction bypassed this settlement. Nevertheless, the reconstruction and opening made an event of national scale. However, customers are accepted there on a first-come, first-served basis. Because the Russians did not implement electronic recording in Aydar. We would like to remind you that in 2018, a modern European-level medical center with an electronic queue and new software for this area was opened in Novopskov.

The attacks of the Russians are more like the work of the DRG, when the enemy tries to get unnoticed either to the rear of our positions or close to them, climb into some hole or basement and try to accumulate. But our pilots quickly find such holes and cellars and try to destroy them,- Andriy Polukhin said. . According to him, the situation is difficult and tense, the enemy continues to attack.

Liptsi at a height: the main goal of the enemy is to hit Kharkiv with direct aim	A representative of the public relations service of the -Charter- brigade told about this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon - Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev of the National Guard of Ukraine. -The main place they are trying to capture in our zone is Liptsi, a village in the north of Kharkiv Oblast, which is located at a height from where it is possible to shell Kharkiv with barrel artillery with almost direct fire,- he said. In May, the enemy offensive was stopped at the approaches to this important village. — When we entered Kharkiv Oblast in May and began to repulse the offensive and stop the front, which was already moving back, we met them on the outskirts of Liptsi, and our fighters engaged in shooting battles right there in the city, — reported the representative of -Charter-. Then the guards, together with the adjacent units and units, managed not only to stop the enemy, but also to repel the enemy. -During these months, we managed to push them back several kilometers, occupy this commanding height and continue to move on,- said the soldier. However, the enemy did not give up his initial intentions. — However, of course, Liptsi and Kharkiv are their main goals in this direction. We can see this, in particular, by the way they shell Kharkiv every day from tactical aircraft, in particular with anti-aircraft missiles, where their target is simply civilian infrastructure, - said Volodymyr Degtyarov.

Assets of the Russian Federation at the service of the EU: frozen and ready for use	This is reported by Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The purpose is to cover losses related to the consideration of cases in Russian courts about the -illegality- of sanctions. In early 2023, the EU entered into an agreement with the said company, according to which 10% of the windfall from these assets is reserved for legal expenses, in particular in the event of legal actions from sanctioned parties. According to the latest data, since February 15, the company received about 3.9 billion euros from the frozen reserves of the Central Bank of Russia. -Euroclear- stated that it currently has numerous lawsuits in Russian courts regarding the cancellation of sanctions and compensation for seized assets. While Russian courts cannot compel the company to return dollar and euro assets, it risks losing its own funds held in Russian financial institutions and owned by Western institutions and companies. These companies will then have the right to make compensation claims against Euroclear.

From hopelessness: whom Russians fear the most and why they surrender	A representative of the public relations service of the -Charter- brigade told about this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon - Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev of the National Guard of Ukraine. - Almost every week we manage to capture someone from the Russians. They fear their commanders in some places more than us, he said. The military said that Russians most often surrender because of hopelessness and hoping for medical help from the Ukrainians. - It is usually rare that they surrender themselves. Most often, we create certain conditions for them when, for example, they are injured and understand that they will not receive help from their own, and then they start to show signs or go towards our soldiers, - said the guardsman. Russian servicemen of the same units who have long been in that part of the Kharkiv direction, which belongs to the area of ​​responsibility of the -Charter- brigade, are mostly captured. - Basically, these are the same units, but they have been recruiting former -convicts- for a long time, who sign a contract with the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. This is a new form of the -Wagner- army, only now instead of -Wagner- they come and representatives of the Russian Ministry of Defense communicate with them, - explained Volodymyr Degtyarev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported what are -hartiyi/->October losses of the Russian occupiers in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Charter- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/03/vid-bezvyhodi-kogo-rosiyany-boyatsya-najbilshe-ta-chomu-zdayutsya-v-polon/	2024-11-03T03:21:02-08:00
A living rebuke to the evasioners — 60 Czechs received permission to join the Armed Forces	About this informed the Czech radio spokesman for the president, Philip Platosh. Petr Pavel received a total of 181 such requests for permission to join the Armed Forces. The satisfied statements were approved by the ministries of defense, interior and foreign affairs of the Czech Republic.

In the fall, the Russians were counted, but they will not be cured: the October losses of the occupi...	The representative of the public relations service of the -Charter- brigade named the representative of the public relations service of the -Charter- - Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev of the National Guard of Ukraine. — If we look at the losses of the enemy only in the area of ​​responsibility of our brigade, we will see that we disabled up to 200 Russians. 89 of them will never see this world again, he said. Another 97 occupiers managed to be injured, and some of them also, most likely, eventually fell into the category of irreversible losses, given the extremely low level of training of enemy soldiers in tactical medicine and the almost unorganized evacuation. — Evacuation is very badly organized, there is practically no training in tactical medicine. It can be concluded that even this hundred will not survive. That is, 200 Russians were destroyed in a month - that's two full-fledged infantry companies. This is a lot, as for the section of the brigade, - remarked the soldier. Also, the representative of -Charter- reported that in October, the Guardsmen destroyed or damaged 20 units of enemy equipment, mostly cars. — Of course, this may indicate that they are preparing an accumulation, and we are ready for it, we are watching, we are preparing our anti-tank means. However, so far we can see that the ability for us to see deep and far enough thanks to drones and shoot through these roads does not allow them to use the technique, - explained Volodymyr Degtyarev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast, the enemy intensively spends manpower, but saves military equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/03/voseny-rosiyan-polichyly-ale-vzhe-ne-vylikuyut-zhovtnevi-vtraty-okupantiv-pidrahuvaly-v-hartiyi/	2024-11-03T02:42:45-08:00

About this in the interview Youtube channel The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine was told by Oksana Ferchuk, adviser to the Minister of Defense of Ukraine on logistics and IT. She reminded that SAP is the leading international system in the field of resource management, which is used by 28 NATO countries. This program was provided to the Armed Forces of Ukraine by colleagues from the USA and specially adapted for our country. The system automates supply processes, generates information about the balance in warehouses, orders, allows you to see the real need, procure and provide the army with everything necessary on time. About 240 large Ukrainian companies use SAP software to control and allocate their resources. -SAP is the digital core and will help us provide the most modern defense resource management process and is an integrated solution with other systems,- said Oksana Ferchuk. Also, thanks to SAP, control over the supply and accounting of weapons and military equipment at the main bases was automated. This also applies to spare parts for equipment that we receive as part of international technical assistance. According to Oksana Ferchuk, this system is implemented by a joint team with the General Staff and the command of the Logistics Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And now it is already used in 600 military units in the directions of 6 security services. -The result of the final implementation of the system should be the full automation of logistics processes and the complete rejection of paper document flow in logistics operations,- concluded Oksana Ferchuk, adviser to the Minister of Defense on digital development, digital transformations and digitization. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the IT coalition since its creation in September 2023 accumulated 157 million euros to support Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/03/systema-sap-dopomagaye-minoborony-kontrolyuvaty-j-avtomatyzuvaty-proczesy-zabezpechennya-postachannya-ta-finansuvannya/	2024-11-03T02:07:47-08:00

The enemy is trying to continue to take advantage of deteriorating weather or low cloud cover to advance and build up in small groups, he said.

Kalich regiments - the Russians force the wounded to go into battle	Maksym Bilousov, the head of the communications department of the 60th mechanized brigade, told about this in the ArmyTV stream. He was commenting on a video in which the pilots of the brigade fighting in the Lyman direction hit Russian attack aircraft heading towards our positions with FPV drone strikes. -I think that these comrades will replenish the Russian Kalich regiments.- Recently, we saw a conversation with a Russian man who said that he was concussed, he doesn't understand what to do, and he is being sent to storm,- Maksym Bilousov said. According to him, the accuracy of the brigade's drones is largely due to the fact that the boys used to play a lot of computer games. -On the video, the Russians were lying down and pretending to be dead in the hope that they would not be seen. And our boys see very well. Before that, they played computer games and are very good at using a joystick. Therefore, there is no problem for them to hit,- Maksym Bilousov said. (video from 14:05) As reported by ArmyInform, mortars of the 60th mechanized brigade demonstrated unique accuracy when working on enemy attack aircraft.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/03/kalich-polky-rosiyany-prymushuyut-poranenyh-ity-v-bij/	2024-11-02T23:51:22-07:00

Will North Korea go further than Kurshchyna: the expert named the country that can stop it	About how the actions of Putin and Kim Jong-un are perceived in Beijing, the expert on the history of Ukrainian-Chinese relations, candidate of historical sciences, leading researcher of the Institute of History of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Volodymyr Golovko, told in the ArmyInform commentary: -China is not very satisfied with this Russian-Korean initiative It should be remembered that it is with North Korea that China has an Agreement on Cooperation and Friendship, which provides for the provision of urgent assistance from the PRC if necessary, that is, in fact, a military alliance. Therefore, involving the only country to which China has such alliance obligations is a serious challenge for Beijing. Obviously, China will put pressure on both North Korea and the Russian side to limit the North Koreans' participation in hostilities against Ukraine. Obviously, Beijing will seek to ensure that the use of North Korean troops is limited in nature. Most likely, Russia and North Korea will be watching for China's reaction. And for the time being, the Koreans will not enter the Kursk region in large units. Further, both the Russian Federation and the DPRK will take into account both the reaction of China and the reaction of the Western world. If the reaction of China, as well as the Western countries, is strong, then the participation of the North Korean military will be limited to the Kursk region. If not, then the Russians will dare to transfer the Koreans to internationally recognized Ukrainian territory.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/03/chy-pide-pivnichna-koreya-dali-kurshhyny-ekspert-nazvav-krayinu-yaka-mozhe-zupynyty/	2024-11-02T22:06:11-07:00
Invisible heroes of a complex operation: how engineers of the Support Forces of the Armed Forces bro...	Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Veretko is the deputy commander of the 48th Kamianets-Podilskyi Engineering Brigade for psychological support of personnel. He devoted his whole life to service in the engineering troops. He started serving in the special forces in 1998, graduated from the Military Engineering Institute at the Podilsk Agrarian and Technical University in 2005, and the National Defense University of Ukraine in 2024. Went through the ranks from deputy platoon commander to deputy brigade commander. Now its military unit is one of those operating in the Kursk region together with other components of the Defense Forces. ArmyInform asked a military officer about the difficulty of an engineer's work during a breach of the state border, the special psychological training of a sapper, and much more. We are talking about this very thing today, November 3, when Ukraine celebrates the Day of the Engineering Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. - Do the specifics of your brigade's actions differ from actions on the territory of Ukraine and Kurshchyna? - On the territory of Kurshchyna itself, the specifics of actions do not differ from the tasks performed by our brigade on the territory of Ukraine. The only thing that was new was overcoming the border and engineering barriers of the enemy located on the border. — How did you interact with the units of the DSHV, SV ZSU? — We interacted in such a way that the sapper units of our brigade were placed under the command of the amphibious assault units, namely: battalions, companies, and directly our means of communication were adjusted under their communication. - Is there special psychological training for sappers? Briefly explain how this happens. — The sappers go through an obstacle course that simulates the conditions on the battlefield. Servicemen of the sergeant rank underwent combat stress courses to be ready to respond to critical situations in their units during combat missions. - How did your unit commanders prepare (psychologically, morally) their people for operations on the territory of the Kursk region? The deeper the knowledge and confidence in one's skills, the calmer and more confident a fighter acts in stressful situations. When a person clearly knows how to react in extreme conditions, in combat operations under KAB strikes, his body and psyche are less affected by panic or uncertainty. First, you need to learn to reduce your anxiety level. The work of a sapper is a constant risk, and if you keep it to yourself, you won't last long. We learn to control our breathing, quickly -switch- after tasks and maintain emotional calm, even when everything around us is turbulent. Secondly, it is important to be able to adapt quickly to a new team. When a sapper is attached to another unit, everyone has to understand each other's words, because there is no time for explanations in battle. Therefore, we often conduct joint training with other units in order to be -on the same wavelength-. Last but not least is exposure. The life of a sapper is a constant stress, and you need to be able to cope with it, recover quickly and stay focused. Conversations and explanatory conversations were held that this task is necessary for the army and the state as a whole. However, people were motivated to take these actions. — Were there ready-made engineering and fortification structures on the border with the Russian Federation? How was the border with the Russian Federation fortified (and was it fortified at all)? - There were high-quality engineering fortifications on the border with the Russian Federation, the border was fortified in terms of engineering. In addition to the fortifications, there were many mine-explosive and non-explosive barriers combined as a whole in the line of defense. — Due to what, in your opinion, did the Defense Forces manage to break through the state border: equipment, people, training? — The border was managed to break through due to the effect of unexpectedness, the training of people who had some combat experience and were equipped with good armored vehicles. —In the network, information is already spreading that the Russians are entrenched in Kurshchyna. Is that so? And the Defense Forces of Ukraine? - Almost from the very beginning, the Russians began to carry out fortification works for the defense of Kurshchyna. The Defense Forces of Ukraine, in their turn, also began to carry out fortification works in order to consolidate and defend units on this territory. —Is your crew adequately staffed? And the techniques? (for actions in Kurshchyna and in general). Do you need people who are specialists in civil life? - This is always a difficult question. On the one hand, we have a team that shows its strength, professionalism and confidence every day. But, on the other hand, motivated, goal-oriented people are always needed - because engineering forces have their own specifics, and there is always a need for those who are ready to work under constant drive. We do not have monotonous days: sometimes we are laying roads for equipment, sometimes we are clearing mines for special forces. And every new task needs those who can withstand the stress and make quick decisions. Therefore, even when it seems that there are enough people, new, motivated professionals will definitely not get in the way. - What would you advise civilians who have not yet decided to mobilize or not to join the Defense Forces of Ukraine - But come to us! Everything awaits you: drive, friendship, and, as they say, real tests of spirit and body. The work we are doing is not just a service, it is a battle for the future. At the front, we are not just defending the land, we are standing up for the right to live freely, for the lives of our relatives, for Ukraine, as we want to see it. Everyone who joins becomes a part of this struggle. It's a real challenge, yes, but is there anything more epic than fighting for your country and winning? In the engineering troops, there is not enough work only for sappers! Specialists of various profiles are needed in our team, because engineering troops are engaged in a wide variety of tasks - from the construction of defensive fortifications to the creation of routes for combat vehicles. And even after our victory, the engineering troops will still have a lot of work to do in demining, cleaning, and decontamination of our motherland of Ukraine from explosive objects. - What inviolable values ​​and principles guide you in your work? - In my work, I am always guided by the principle of justice, because it is the basis of true leadership. It is important to me that subordinate personnel feel supported and cared for. A fighter who has to perform combat tasks must not only be professionally trained, but also provided with everything necessary: ​​clothing, food and timely payment of financial support in full. These are basic needs that must be met so that a serviceman can fully perform his duties, knowing that he has reliable support. The job of a sapper is not just to carry out combat tasks, but to be always ready to be near any unit (airborne assault troops, special forces groups, tank units) that needs their help. Since sappers are usually attached to other combat units, they must be able to quickly adapt to new conditions and quickly establish contact with a foreign team. It is not easy, but this is the specificity of our work. - What does it look like in practice? Sappers do not always work in their usual team - they are constantly assigned to other units. This means that each sapper must be able to quickly get used to a new environment, understand the task, and at the same time be responsible for the safety of the entire unit. The work of a sapper is always a difficult and dangerous process, but, as they say, there are nuances. It's one thing to clear a path for tanks. This task is clear, understandable: the sappers know that there is an armored vehicle in front of them, which is ready to withstand a certain level of danger. The main thing here is to lay a safe corridor and to react promptly to a change in the situation. Demining for special forces and more is a completely different story. This is filigree work, where the life of the sapper depends not on the armor, but on the people who will then follow invisible paths to the enemy's rear. It requires absolute precision, accuracy and silent work without the right to make a mistake. You usually have to work at night or in unfamiliar territory, and any little thing can be decisive. At such moments, sappers must be psychologically prepared for high responsibility: they go first, providing a way for those who carry key tasks on the front line, and often become the invisible heroes of a complex operation. After all, it is not for nothing that the motto of our brigade is ahead of the first. - Whose exploits from among the personnel of the brigade would you single out, in particular, during the actions in Kurshchyna? Two servicemen of the brigade were awarded the Order of the -Golden Star- posthumously. These are Lieutenant Oleksandr Borshulyak and Junior Sergeant Denys Dorofeyev. In particular, several times Denis Dorofeev's unit was able to stop the advance of the enemy thanks to the minefields they installed. In total, they had thousands of installed mines on their account.

F-16, Tom Cruise and -Top Gun-: how -Maverick- helped Ukraine and whether it can help more	Why didn't Pete -Maverick- Mitchell choose the newest dual-lightning F-35 Lightning II for the mission, but was forced to fly the older -Rhino---Hornet- - -Rhino- F-18 Hornet? What is the most important component in a fighter plane and why can't a fighter pilot think? ArmiyaInform tells about how -Maverick- has already helped and whether it can still help Ukraine. The combat sequences of many, if not the vast majority, of feature films are more fairy tales than actual depictions of combat. However, the influence of the world of cinema, especially the masterpieces of world fame, on real life is undeniable and it applies, including international politics and the military sphere. This also applies to -Top Gun- - a dilogy of Hollywood films about the pilots of fighter jets. Its first part was published way back in 1986, and the second was published 36 years later - in the spring of 2022. The first -Top Gun- not only became extremely popular, collected more than 350 thousand dollars in theaters, made the actor of the main role Tom Cruise a superstar, and made the American heavy carrier-based fighter F-14 Tomcat famous. The 1986 film also significantly influenced the perception of military service in American society in the mid-to-late 1980s. At that time, Americans, in view of the detente in relations with the USSR and traumatic memories of the war in Vietnam, viewed the prospect of a military career rather negatively. Instead, -Top Gun- made military service popular again, causing a veritable boom in new recruits in 1986. About 90% of those who aspired to serve in the US Navy indicated that they had watched a feature film about fighter pilots with Tom Cruise. The second -Top Gun- also became a sensation at the American and global box office. Collecting more than $1 billion worldwide, it left behind such films as Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (just over $950 million), Batman (around $770 million) and Jurassic Park 3 (around $750 million). The very names of the films indicate that -Maverick- had to compete for the audience's attention with very powerful rivals. It was possible to win the battle for the audience thanks to the cooperation of forces and means - from the nostalgia of the fans of the first -Top Gun- and the star galaxy led by Tom Cruise to the dashing plot, talented direction and extremely realistic location shooting. The influence of this part of the dilogy also went far beyond the world of cinema, affecting world politics and international relations. First of all, he significantly raised the morale of Ukrainians and strengthened the anti-Russian position in the whole world. The main villains of the film flew precisely on Russian Su-57s and used the Mi-24 attack helicopter. This left no doubt that the unnamed country was at least on friendly terms with the Russian Federation. The way in which the latest American F-18 Hornet fighters and even the legendary, but already decommissioned F-14 Tomcat confidently crushed the latest Russian weapons left no doubt that the Russian aggressors can and should be defeated. To defeat the aggressor state of the Russian Federation, it is enough to provide Ukraine with the necessary weapons and train the Ukrainian military to use them - and the Armed Forces of Ukraine will ensure the desired result. The film, which was watched or at least well known by the citizens of all pro-Ukraine states and all the politicians there, did its job even when it was not mentioned. When it was possible to include the issue of providing Ukraine with the F-16 Fightin Falcon to the agenda, reminiscences from the dilogy began to work with triple efficiency. The spirit of -Top Gun- was felt in everything from quotes from the film in media publications to visual solutions. After all, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi took a photo in the cockpit of the -Fighting Falcon- in the same way that Tom Cruise did many times in many American fighter jets. It was in the F-16 that Tom Cruise was photographed on December 6, 2001 during a visit to the Joint Reserve Naval Aviation Base in Fort Worth (Texas). Volodymyr Zelenskyy did this at the Skridstrup Air Base in Vojens (northern Denmark) on August 20, 2022. It took more than two years for the first F-16s to enter service with the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Fighting Falcons- in the Ukrainian sky, the President of Ukraine presented > August 4, 2024. The next day Volodymyr Zelensky published several photos of the fighter jets, noting that -the F-16 is truly a reality, a reality in our skies.- Between the two August series of photos - in Denmark in 2022 and in Ukraine in 2024 - there is a gap of hundreds of hours of negotiations and thousands of hours of training of Ukrainian pilots, during which -Top Gun- was not only in the air, but also repeatedly mentioned directly by instructors and their students . -Did you see the last movie, Top Gun, where Tom Cruise says, 'If you think, you die,'- cites the American media Politico as saying Tom Richter, a former US Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornet pilot who later transferred to the F- 16. -No matter how Hollywood it is, it's true.- Watching films in the original language with subsequent discussion is always an important component of language training. It was urgently needed and received by Ukrainian pilots during F-16 training. Also, films are an important motivational tool that can, with the help of bright emotional images, establish certain thoughts in the audience, postulate certain theses, and form stable beliefs and principles. -Top Gun- is the best for this. The thesis -it's not about the plane, but who is the pilot- that is repeatedly repeated in the film emphasizes, first of all, the training, skill and fighting spirit of military pilots. The F-16 is a perfect fighting machine, but its main component is the pilot in the cockpit. It is thanks to the pilot that the fighter turns from a set of tools and functions assembled into a single body into a living organism capable of acting as a single entity with a person. In the hands of a well-trained military pilot, the F-16 becomes a direct extension of his consciousness, a part of his body, like an arm or a leg. It is at the moment when this union can be achieved and firmly established that the training can be considered complete. None of the parts of -Top Gun- show how Tom Cruise's character flies exactly on the F-16 - this would make the parallels between the films and life even more obvious. However, Pete Mitchell instead has the globally recognized callsign Maverick, named after the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-surface missile. AGM-65 Maverick is the standard, one might even say classic, ammunition for the F-16 Fightin Falcon multipurpose fighter. This missile is intended for Close Air Support aircraft during an all-out battle. -Maverick- is an extremely effective missile capable of hitting and destroying a variety of tactical targets - armored vehicles and ground vehicles, fuel and ammunition depots, stationary fortifications and enemy air defense facilities. However, the AGM-65 Maverick also has a weak point - a range of only 40 km. In view of this, using it over the battlefield in Ukraine under the current conditions is too risky, since to launch it, the F-16 will have to fly too close to the line of combat engagement. The risk of losing a plane due to the action of enemy air defense is too high and in the vast majority of cases it is absolutely not worth the destroyed enemy targets. So at the moment there is no need to talk about the transfer of AGM-65 Maverick to Ukraine. Under the current conditions, other air-to-ground munitions should become more important, primarily high-precision, medium-range glider guided bombs AGM-154 JSOW. However, one should not forget that the modern war has already surprised many times with non-standard solutions and changed the rules of the battle. Therefore, you should not completely forget about the AGM-65 Maverick - by changing a number of parameters, they may well turn out to be an effective means of combat. Similarly, in the fictional world of Top Gun: Maverick, the F-18 Hornet is not the latest F-35 Lightning II, disabled by enemy GPS jammers, but chosen for the mission. What's more, the old F-14 Tomcat puts up a decent fight and even comes out victorious in a confrontation with two enemy Su-57s. For all its fabulousness, the cinematic -Maverick- never crosses the fine line between realism and fantasy definitively. The chances that the dogfights shown in the movies could have happened in reality are extremely slim. But they are not absolutely zero. The chances that the AGM-65 Maverick can be effectively and safely used over the battlefield in Ukraine are extremely slim. However, Ukrainians know how to surprise and impress no worse than Pete -Maverick- Mitchell. Because -it's not about the plane, but who the pilot is.- Earlier, ArmyInform talked about JSOW guided aerial bombs from the USA: what kind of weapon is this and how will it help the Defense Forces of Ukraine and thought, what will be the task of Mirage 2000 in Ukraine, and also explained why they are fighting on the side of Ukrainestrong peanut John McClain, John Rembo, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Indiana Jones, Angus McGyver, T-800 terminator, Neo and John Wick and other movie heroes of world fame.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/03/f-16-tom-kruz-i-top-gan-yak-meverik-dopomig-ukrayini-i-chy-zmozhe-dopomogty-shhe/	2024-11-02T21:36:02-07:00
They twisted the essence: fake workers of the Russian Federation created a manipulation about the co...	Actually, in the interview, an excerpt from which the Russians seem to be spreading, Sergeant Tymochko did not say anything about -plans for the mobilization of women-, but only expressed an opinion about the need for civilians, in particular women, to undergo military training courses. Civilian training centers operate in Ukraine, engaged in both general military and specialized military training of civilians. Civilian women and men take the course in these centers voluntarily as part of preparation for military service and resistance to Russian aggression. So the propagandists, in their characteristic manner, twisted the essence of the message and made a short manipulation out of it. Since 2014, no woman in Ukraine has been forcibly mobilized. However, Russian propaganda regularly spreads fakes that Ukraine is about to start mobilizing women. This is one of the most favorite topics of propagandists, to which a certain number of gullible Ukrainians are -led- every time. We remind you: the service of women in the Defense Forces of Ukraine was and is exclusively voluntary. And the goal of such destructive narratives is to cause a split in society, to sow distrust in the Armed Forces and state authorities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/03/perekrutyly-sut-fejkoroby-rf-zlipyly-manipulyacziyu-pro-pryzov-zhinok-do-vijska/	2024-11-02T21:17:54-07:00
Billions for a new BMP: the US will replace the world-famous M2 Bradley	According to the information distributed by the author of the defense publication Army Recognition, the Pentagon allocated to General Dynamics (GDLS ) and American Rheinmetall for $800 million for the development of prototypes of this machine as part of the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) program, ArmyInform reports. The total cost of the rearmament program is estimated at $45 billion, and the United States Army plans to purchase approximately 3,800 units of new armored vehicles. In June 2023, GDLS and American Rheinmetall were selected from five competitors for the final stage of detailed design, while Point Blank Enterprises, Oshkosh Defense and BAE Systems were eliminated from the competition. Evaluating the concepts of the future BMP, experts from IKK Defense Express in particular stated that in fact we are talking about more than a classic modern BMP with a forward location of the engine and transmission department. And also deliberately emphasized armor protection in the form of, most likely, elements of dynamic protection in the lower frontal part of the hull and details on the sides, which are additionally reinforced with overhead elements. Specialists from the Army Recognition defense portal analyzed the novelty more thoroughly. The authors of the site believe that the XM30 will bring significant changes to the infantry fighting vehicle (IPV) category, having a 50x228mm gun in a remote-controlled turret, dual anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), an AI-enabled fire control system, and a hybrid powertrain. The XM30 will have a crew of two (mechanic driver and commander) and will carry six infantrymen. The vehicle's size and capacity were designed to maintain a balance between firepower and mobility, while preventing it from becoming too large or heavy, as was seen in some previous BMP designs. The combat vehicle will be designed to work alongside future versions of the M1 Abrams main battle tank and is expected to include protection against unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Digital engineering is central to the development of the XM30. In the early stages of the program, the five aforementioned contractors were awarded approximately $60 million each to create digital projects based on Army requirements. Through this process, which facilitated design, development and possible future upgrades, the US Army clarified the requirements for the armor and ensured that they were achievable, avoiding the problems that led to the cancellation of previous programs. For example, by using 3D models and simulations in the early stages of design, the Army has obtained assurances from contractors that all requirements and subsystems, including sensors and fire control mechanisms, are agreed upon before physical prototypes are built. This approach has minimized development costs and helps contractors and the Army quickly resolve any design issues that arise during the process. The XM30's modular design supports future technological upgrades, allowing new systems to be integrated with minimal changes to the vehicle's core architecture. Equipped with a hybrid-electric drive and various weapon systems, including a 50 mm cannon and anti-tank guided missiles, the XM30 is configured to meet current operational requirements while maintaining flexibility for future needs. The XM30 program is a continuation of the US Army's efforts to replace the M2 Bradley, which has been in service since the 1980s. Despite several previous attempts, including the Ground Combat Vehicle and Future Combat System, such initiatives were not successful. Mainly due to problems with requirements alignment, funding, manufacturing technology and prototyping schedule. Colonel Geoffrey Jurand, the XM30 project manager, emphasized that the current program is consistent in these areas and is supported by the use of digital technologies. This approach allows the vehicle to be designed and tested using digital models, avoiding some of the problems faced by previous programs. Both General Dynamics and Rheinmetall have been selected to move forward in the competition, with the US Army currently in the third phase of a five-phase schedule. These contractors will deliver prototypes to the military by the end of 2026, and the Pentagon will conduct a critical analysis of the design by the first half of fiscal 2025. The final selection of a single supplier for production will occur around the first quarter of fiscal year 2028 after testing and evaluation of prototypes. The program is also supported by a -digital trinity- approach that includes model-based systems engineering, digital engineering and development, security and operations (DevSecOps). This digital approach improved tracking and communication between contractors and the Army, and errors were identified and corrected early in the design process. XM30 is one of six programs identified by the Pentagon to demonstrate the benefits of digital technology. The US Army's use of digital technology for this project aims to improve design efficiency, reduce costs and ensure the armored vehicle's modularity and adaptability to future needs. The program has earned the trust of senior United States Army leadership, who have expressed support for its goals and its potential to deliver long-term benefits, including cost savings through its open architecture. As the program progresses, other phases will focus on prototyping, testing and evaluation. The US Army plans to begin testing prototypes in 2026, with a final production decision expected in 2028. Implementation of the program to create the BMP XM30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle.

Russia uses Western components for attacks on Ukraine — the President	Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated this in his evening address on November 2. -Today, first of all, gratitude to our soldiers. To everyone who protects Ukraine from the daily attacks of -shaheed- and rockets. In the month of October, more than 2,000 -martyrs- were against Ukraine, against our people. Literally every day. This number of -shahedis- is more than 170 thousand components that should have been blocked for delivery to Russia. Microcircuits, microcontrollers, processors, many different parts, without which this terror would simply not be possible,- said the President. According to him, all this is supplied to Russia from abroad. -And this, unfortunately, from companies from China, Europe, America - many micro-contributions to the constant Russian terror. This brings the world back again and again to the need to work much harder to control the export of specialty parts and resources. In order not to give Russia the opportunity to circumvent the sanctions that have long been imposed against Russia for this war,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. In his opinion, the situation is similar to that of the Shaheds and Russian missiles. -They all contain components from other countries. Fighting against Russian strikes means fighting, including for the strength of sanctions against Russia. Sanctions should increase and be effective. And every scheme to circumvent sanctions is a crime against people and the world. And it is precisely such schemes that allow Russia to also help the regimes in Iran and North Korea build up their muscles. This is a global threat. And only global, special pressure can overcome this,- the President assured. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy once again ataku/->emphasized that constant terrorist attacks on Ukrainian cities indicate insufficient pressure on Russia and its allies.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/rosiya-vykorystovuye-zahidni-komponenty-dlya-udariv-po-ukrayini-prezydent/	2024-11-02T12:31:59-07:00

Loud and unsuccessful escape at the border: shippers and -customers- detained at gunpoint	About this reported the State Border Service of Ukraine. Suspicious movement near the border was recorded by a video surveillance camera. The border guards reacted immediately and set out to search for violators. The fugitives were apprehended after several warning shots. It turned out that the detainees were residents of Kyiv, Kyiv and Lviv regions. During further search activities, border guards detained the 55-year-old organizer of the crossing and his accomplice, a female driver who transported illegal immigrants to their destination. As the law enforcement officers found out, the man organized illegal crossings through social networks, offering his services for 9-10 thousand dollars per person. The detained men were taken to the border unit, where administrative and procedural documents were drawn up against them for attempting to cross the border illegally. The organizers face criminal liability for h. 2 Art. 332 of the Criminal Code (-Illegal transportation of persons across the state border-), and the driver was also prosecuted for maliciously disobeying the legal requirements of border guards. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/guchna-ta-nevdala-vtecha-na-kordoni-perepravnyky-ta-kliyenty-zatrymani-pid-postrily/	2024-11-02T11:21:59-07:00
Dropping drones - the Russians use tourer drones in the direction of the main strike	Senior Lieutenant Andrii Bezsonov, head of the radio-electronic warfare service of the 18th Slavic Brigade of the National Guard, told about this on Army TV. -In my private opinion, there are Russian UAV crews that move from place to place, from direction to direction. And through this, they strengthen the direction that is most interesting to them at the moment. We have also had such people visit us and we can see it, first of all, by the quality of piloting. That is, we intercept the video and see how it flies, how it bypasses trees, how it approaches the target, how it counteracts our EW means,- said Andriy Bezsonov. According to him, the situation with enemy drones has improved somewhat in his brigade's area of ​​operation near Chasovoy Yar, mostly local operators are working, which our pilots call -husks- because they demonstrate very low efficiency. (video from 28:44) As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers are crossing the channel near the Time Yar, they are unable to gain a foothold, but they continue to attack.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/perekaty-drony-rosiyany-vykorystovuyut-dronshhykiv-gastroleriv-na-napryamku-golovnogo-udaru/	2024-11-02T11:03:43-07:00

Just from the street to the marines: what has the Russian marine corps turned into	About this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- told the spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain 3 rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. — The quality composition changes. The Marine Corps is an elite, and its elite is not only in the name, but also in the level of training. Just today I came across a material in which a former prisoner turned out to be a marine. That is, now the qualitative composition of these units does not differ significantly, he said. Now, there is no special training for Russian marines. — In fact, the organizational core of the marine corps is used, that is, the command structure, which, of course, is not directly applied on the battlefield. These units have become ordinary infantry units that fill up just off the street without any special training. Because [real] Marines is amphibious training, it's jumping, it's conquering the three elements, the spokesperson explained. Unfortunately, a similar situation is observed in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, although the Armed Forces of Ukraine still try, despite intensive combat operations, to better train marines. — If we take the training from us, the training of the marines continues periodically, despite the fact that they are in combat conditions. But, nevertheless, and there we can notice that now it can actually be called simply infantry, said Dmytro Pletenchuk. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the 155th Separate Guards Marine Brigade of the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Federation is known for its war crimes, it was even characterized as -very rotten brigade-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/prosto-z-vulyczi-u-morpihy-na-shho-peretvorylas-rosijska-morska-pihota/	2024-11-02T09:21:40-07:00

This time it was difficult for our operator, but he managed to get close to the Russian UAV and destroy it. But in the future it will be more difficult. Perhaps our drones will have to use new attack tactics, enter from the blind spots of additional cameras, or increase the combat part of our FPVs. Previously, the Russians tried to reduce the consequences of the -sky cutter-, the mass destruction of their reconnaissance -wings- by camouflage painting them, but this did not give results. Now they are trying to use artificial intelligence.

While most mapping technologies -focus on flat representations of the world,- Wilczynski said, Pinpoint will address -how you use that 3D representation to help drones determine their positioning, to help aircraft pilots navigate, to help understand when you're getting drone video or from the plane, what position is he actually looking at.- A representative of the firm noted that it could be an alternative to GPS, which could be vulnerable to adversary interference. That's important in part because of -all the obstruction issues we've seen in Ukraine,- he said. -I think what we're going to see in the next few years is a transition from this absolute GPS navigation system to a much more reference navigation system, more like what happened when you could sort of be in the middle ages on a ship and make your route through the stars-. Pinpoint plans to complete several pilot programs with domestic and foreign drone manufacturers next year, and then make the technology widely available. -We work with various companies throughout the project creation chain. Some companies produce suspensions, some produce completely (unmanned aerial vehicles). There are a bunch of different development options: free, more expensive, some with more durable UAVs. So we are trying to experiment with this market,- Vilchynskyi said. -This is a really fast-growing market right now as people in the defense community realize that the GPS we've relied on for so long may not be available in the next conflict,- said a Maxar spokesperson.

The situation in Toretsk was stabilized: where the enemy was stopped	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. — In Toretsk, we somewhat stabilized the battle line. The enemy, as before, is on the eastern outskirts of the city. We stop all attempts of the enemy to advance and, at this moment, all assaults on Toretsk are repulsed. There are strong units of the Defense Forces and they are not allowing the enemy to move, she said. At the same time, the spokeswoman noted that the occupiers are accumulating and concentrating forces and means with the aim of intensifying offensive actions. — We now see that the enemy is withdrawing reserves, the enemy is establishing manpower at the front line, replenishing military personnel, installing anti-aircraft missile systems. We see that they are preparing for some active hostilities, the spokeswoman said. The officer also reported on which divisions and units of the occupiers operate in the area of ​​responsibility of the Luhansk OTU. — If we talk about Chasiv Yar, then the Airborne Division of the Central Military District of the Russian Federation is stationed there. In other directions, these are motorized rifle units of the same military district, Anastasia Bobovnikova said.

In time for the cold weather: the occupiers concentrated their efforts on capturing Toretsk and Chas...	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. — The enemy is most active near such cities as Chasiv Yar and Toretsk. Near Chasovoy Yar, the enemy is trying to cross the channel. No success at this point, she said. However, the Russians take into account previous experience and change their tactics. — Now they have focused on the use of sabotage and intelligence groups and the so-called -secrets-, when one, two, three people run across the channel, hide in urban buildings, in basements, in holes and wait for replenishment or, rather, for the accumulation of sufficient forces for assaults. However, at the moment, such attempts are detected and the groups are affected and destroyed, the officer said. The spokeswoman explained why the named cities are important for the invaders. — These cities are a priority for the Russians, they want to capture Donetsk and Luhansk regions before the cold. As far as we know, the enemy is not preparing for the winter period, because they believe that they will achieve their goals before the onset of frost. Therefore, they focused their strikes on these cities, the officer said. However, the concentration of the enemy's main efforts on Chasovoy Yar and Toretsk does not mean that the occupiers have curtailed their activity in other areas. -In particular, in the Seversky direction, the enemy is also advancing with the use of equipment and simply infantry groups to one unit,- the spokeswoman said. However, currently all enemy assaults are successfully repulsing units of the Defense Forces. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the area of ​​Chasovoye Yaru, the drones of the Defense Forces destroyed the naval jet bomber of the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/vstygnuty-do-holodiv-okupanty-zoseredyly-zusyllya-na-zahoplenni-toreczka-ta-chasovogo-yaru/	2024-11-02T07:57:18-07:00

It looks futuristic, it burns even better: the jet bomber of the occupiers was destroyed in the area...	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. - Usually, the enemy uses the tactics of small assault groups, as mentioned earlier. However, there are other methods, using technology. For example, it is the transportation of the occupiers to the forward positions and the work of artillery, the work of drones and aviation, she said. Voyskova informed about the interesting fact of the use of a jet naval bomb launcher by the Russian invaders. This testifies to the occupiers' lack of weapons and military equipment and an attempt to use anything on the battlefield. — the Russians pulled up a Soviet RBU-6000 or -Smerch-2- jet sea-launched bomber in the direction of Chasovoy Yar. It looks pretty futuristic because it's a ship weapon. However, we can say that the occupiers are dragging everything they have onto the battlefield. Including the ship's bomb launcher, which was not destroyed by our Navy, the drone fighters of the operational-tactical group -Luhansk- did finish off. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the East the Russians are resorting to rat race tactics.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/vyglyadaye-futurystychno-goryt-shhe-krashhe-reaktyvnyj-bombomet-okupantiv-znyshhyly-v-rajoni-chasovogo-yaru/	2024-11-02T06:46:43-07:00

Hypersound has reached Turkey: Ankara will develop a charge based on a ballistic missile	How states the TurkishFacts4u page on the X social network, in the Republic of Turkey confirmed not only the fact of the existence of such a weapon, but also its practical testing, ArmyInform reports. Mach 5.5, and this fact refers Turkey to a rather narrow circle of countries that have hypersonic technologies. Defense market analysts who are the authors of the Army Recognition portal note that hypersonic missiles, the speed of which exceeds Mach 5, have high maneuverability and are practically invulnerable to modern anti-missile defense systems. Traditionally, the Tayfun missile in its basic configuration, the SRBM (Short Range Ballistic Missile) can engage targets over 500 km away. Turkish developers assured that its maximum range is up to 1,000 km. The missile in ballistic configuration with a length of 6.5 meters, a diameter of 610 millimeters and a mass of 2,300 kg identifies the target using a coordinate guidance system. The Tayfun, equipped with a pre-formed cluster warhead, has a high hit accuracy with a CEP (Circular Probable Error) value of 10 meters or less. The hypersonic version of this missile promises to significantly increase the speed, range and effectiveness of destroying targets. > Although detailed technical characteristics, such as range, payload and methods of evading countermeasures, have not yet been published, experts are already stating significant progress in the development of Turkish missile technology. Observers note that the company Roketsan, founded 1988, plays a key role in ensuring Turkey's self-sufficiency in the field of defense technology. The latest developments in the field of hypersonics demonstrate its ability to create advanced weapons. These successes confirm that Turkey is ready to compete at the world level and aims to become an important player in the global arms race, where hypersonic technologies are becoming one of the key directions. The development of this type of weapons shows Turkey's desire to strengthen its position on the world stage and significantly increase its strategic and defense potential. At the very least, the creation of a hypersonic version of the Tayfun SRBM can significantly strengthen Ankara's position in the Mediterranean, the Middle East and other strategically important regions, analysts concluded.

From -rat- to oath: how the military oath evolved in Ukraine	Taking the oath was started in the 9th century. with the arrival of the Varangians to the Ukrainian lands. Rata - that's what the oath to the prince was called. Accordingly, the soldiers were originally called -ratai-, that is, the one who took the rata (oath). Joining the wife, the soldiers swore their loyalty to the prince, and after that the soldiers were considered brothers. The Zaporozhye Cossacks inherited this tradition. When a new warrior came to Sich, he went through reception rites. Among them was a solemn oath of allegiance to the society and acceptance of Orthodoxy if the man was of a different faith. Subsequently, in the period of the XVII-XVIII centuries. the Cossacks were forced to swear an oath to the Russian tsars. It is obvious that at that time it was a forced measure, because the Cossacks swore to them for political reasons. The military oath of the Legion of Ukrainian Sich Riflemen also faced a test in the form of the Austrian military command, because the Sich Riflemen were part of the Austro-Hungarian army. According to the plan of the authorities, they had to swear an oath to the government of Austria-Hungary. But the volunteers who joined the ranks of the SSS went to the ranks of the army with the goal of defending their homeland from the Russians and serving their own Ukrainian people, so they had no desire to swear allegiance to a foreign state and its people. However, due to poor technical support and the threat of dissolution of the SSS, on September 3, 1914, the troops of the SSS Legion were forced to take an oath of allegiance to Austria-Hungary and its emperor. But the USS military did not put up with this and drew up its own alternative text of the oath of loyalty to the native Ukrainian people, although it did not receive official approval. The text was as follows: -I, &#8230;, the Ukrainian Sich Archer, swear to the Ukrainian princes, hetmans, Zaporizhia Sich, graves and all of Ukraine, that I will faithfully serve my Motherland, defend it from the enemy, fight for the honor of Ukrainian weapons until the last drop of blood. So, Lord God and Archangel Michael, help me. Amen.- Under the text of the oath, the soldiers who took the oath must sign. This made the oath more weighty. Special attention should be paid to the wording -to serve the Motherland, to defend it against the enemy- because this was the main motivation of the volunteers. On July 24, 1918, the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian State of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky passed the Law on General Military Conscription. They tried to recruit only those citizens who demonstrated -unconditional devotion to the idea of ​​an independent Ukraine- to the army. Hetman Skoropadskyi also approved the -Law on the Military Oath of Allegiance to the Ukrainian State-. The text of the oath was provided in short changes for conscripts of various religions and nationalities living in the Ukrainian State. The text of the oath: -I promise and swear by Almighty God and the Holy Gospel that I will serve, without sparing my life, faithfully and sincerely to the last drop of blood to the Ukrainian State and His Highness Hetman, the Supreme Commander of the Ukrainian Army and Navy. I will in all cases put up the greatest possible resistance to the enemies of the Ukrainian State, I will watch over all the interests of the Ukrainian State and sacredly guard the official secret entrusted to me and obey without objection all orders for the needs of the service and the State, conscientiously perform all my duties and do nothing for my own benefit to do something that would be contrary to my service and oath. I will never forsake my unit and my Flag, and in all cases I will behave as befits an honest, faithful, conscientious, brave and conscientious (officer or soldier). May God help me in this, and in the end I kiss St. Scripture and the Cross of my Savior. Amen.- This time, the Ukrainian army immediately had the opportunity to swear to its own people and native land. In addition, the Hetman administration took important steps in the organization of the future Ukrainian army. On November 13, 1918, in Lviv, the Ukrainian National Council of the ZUNR approved the text of the -Oath of Ukrainian Troops- by its resolution. It was set out in the following format: -We solemnly swear to Almighty God to faithfully and obediently obey the Western Ukrainian People's Republic, Its Supreme Authority, Its Government, Its Army, as well as to all Its chieftains and all Its leadership, to respect and protect them, their orders and suggestions in every service to be carried out, against every enemy, whosoever he may be, and wherever the will of Her Supreme Authority shall require, on the waters, on the lands, in the air, by day and by night, in battles, offensives, skirmishes and in all kinds of enterprises, in other words, in every place, at every time, on every occasion, to fight bravely and bravely, never to abandon our troops, flags and weapons, never to enter into the slightest understanding with the enemy, always to act according to the laws of war demand and how honest soldiers face to live and die in honor in this way. Yes, God, help us - Amen.- The Ukrainian Galician Army was the most capable Ukrainian military formation during the First Liberation Struggle in 1917-1921. In January 1919, the authorities of the Ukrainian People's Republic approved a sample oath or, as it was then called, -The Promise-. Subsequently, on March 12, 1919, on behalf of the Directory in Vinnytsia, Chief Ataman of the Army of the Ukrainian People's Republic Simon Petliura approved the new text of the oath of the Ukrainian troops. The oath took place solemnly, as a rule, it was attended by high-ranking state officials. Galicians freed from Serbian captivity swear allegiance to Ukraine and the Ukrainian army, August 3 1919. Photo: wikipedia.org Text of the oath: -I swear by the honor of a citizen of the Ukrainian People's Republic and I solemnly swear to Almighty God to faithfully serve the Ukrainian People's Republic, obediently obey its supreme authority of the Directorate, the government and the people's army. I swear to respect and protect the orders and all recommendations of their service, to carry them out exactly against any enemy of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the working people, whoever this enemy may be and wherever the will of the Supreme Republican Power will demand: on water, on land, in the air , day and night, in battles, offensives, skirmishes and all kinds of enterprises, in a word, in every place, at every time and in every case fight bravely and courageously to the last drop of blood. Do not throw away your military units, flags and weapons in any case, do not enter into any, even the smallest, understanding with the enemy, always behave as the military laws and the honor of a warrior-knight require, in this way and honor to live and honor to die Help me in this, Holy God, my love for my native Ukraine and the people.- The Ukrainian military organization was established in 1920 in the western Ukrainian lands. The members of the Ukrainian military organization were veterans of various military formations, first of all, the Sich Riflemen of the Army of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the Ukrainian Galician Army. Colonel Yevhen Konovalets, the former leader of the Sich Rifle Corps, headed the UVO. Each new member of the UVO had to swear an oath of loyalty to the organization. The oath was taken in a secluded place in a narrow circle of people. Those who took the oath raised the three middle fingers of their right hand, and put the left one on the weapon. And various texts of speeches were delivered. Usually, the oath was about unfailing execution of the orders of the leadership of the UVO and about signing a death sentence in case of treason. The OUN and the UPA, following the traditions of the UVO, presented their own text of the oath on July 11-15, 1944, at the founding Great Meeting of the Ukrainian Main Liberation Council near the village of Sprynya. It was prepared by the OUN leadership and the UPA Main Team. The oath entered into force by order of the General Military Staff of the UPA on July 19, 1944, and was published in the magazine -Povstanets- in November 1944. It was accompanied by instructions on the procedure for its preparation and celebration events. The oath was taken after the training, when the soldiers were already sure of their choice. For this event, the warriors prepared in advance by memorizing the text. The ceremony took place on a wide lawn, the rebels were festively dressed and with weapons in their hands, all this was accompanied by a divine service. The first collective oath was administered on August 5, 1944 by the Chief of the Main Military Staff of the UPA for the soldiers of the 3rd Hundred - -Snakes-, -Mace- and -Lions- - using the text approved by the UGVR. Text of the oath: -I, a soldier of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, having taken up a weapon, solemnly swear by my honor and conscience before the Great Ukrainian People, before the Holy Land of Ukraine, before the spilled blood of all the Best Sons of Ukraine, and before the Highest Political Leader To the People of Ukraine: To fight for the complete liberation of all Ukrainian lands and the Ukrainian people from the invaders and to win the Ukrainian Independent Cathedral State. In this struggle, I will spare neither blood nor life and will fight until my last breath and final victory over all the enemies of Ukraine. I will be courageous, brave and brave in battle and merciless towards the enemies of the Ukrainian land. I will be an honest, disciplined and revolutionary-vigilant soldier. I will follow all the orders of my superiors. I will strictly preserve military and state secrets. I will be a worthy brother in battle and combat life to all my comrades-in-arms. When I break or deviate from this oath, let me be punished by the strict law of the Ukrainian National Revolution and let the contempt of the Ukrainian of the people.- Modern Ukraine On August 24, 1991, together with the adoption of the Act of Proclamation of Independence of Ukraine, the resolutions -On the Proclamation of Ukraine's Independence- and -On Military Formations in Ukraine- were also adopted. In November 1991, at the 2nd Congress of the Union of Officers of Ukraine, where Defense Minister Kostyantyn Morozov was present, the participants took the first unofficial oath of loyalty to Ukraine. On December 6, the Council of Ukraine adopted the laws of Ukraine -On the Defense of Ukraine- and -On the Armed Forces of Ukraine-, and also the resolution -On the text of the Military Oath- approved the text of the military oath solemnly taken in the Verkhovna Rada by the First Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Colonel General Kostiantyn Morozov. After the VRU resolution -On the text of the Military Oath- was approved on December 6, on December 23, soldiers led by Martirosyan on the Independence Square in Rivne took it, publicly swearing allegiance to Ukraine. The text of the oath: -I, (surname, first name and patronymic), join the military service and solemnly swear to the Ukrainian people to always be faithful and loyal to it, to defend Ukraine, to protect its sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability, honestly and to honestly perform military duty, the orders of commanders, to strictly adhere to the Constitution of Ukraine and the laws of Ukraine, to keep state secrets. I swear to fulfill my duties in the interests of my compatriots. I swear never to betray To the Ukrainian people.- In peacetime, the day of taking the oath is declared a holiday for the military unit, usually it is a weekend. The commander determines the time and place by separate order, announcing to the personnel. Native military personnel and guests may be invited to the ceremony, priests or religious representatives may be present. Military personnel come in full dress uniform, but during martial law the uniform is determined by the commander. The party lines up, and those taking the oath stand in front. The ceremony begins with a speech by the commander, followed by speeches by representatives of the higher command and veterans. The military are called according to the alphabet, and they, with weapons in their hands, take an oath and put their signature. From this moment on, they officially become military personnel.

Preparation of the mobilized and -military rally -Paris — Dakar--: the chief sergeant of the Armed F...	— What are the features of training in wartime, in the conditions of the situation that has developed, what problems and difficulties exist? — The huge volume of personnel that needs to be trained. At the same time, the terms of such preparation are as limited as possible. Therefore, the number of those who need to be trained and the time limit: these factors definitely have a negative impact on the quality of training. Again, by the method of trial, error and testing in most NATO countries, they came up with the position that the basic general military training for those citizens who have never served before should be 3 months. This is the most optimal term to equip a serviceman with all the necessary skills and abilities. On the other hand, we understand that combat units and units need to be equipped as soon as possible, given the losses they suffer on the battlefield. And here two important factors come into conflict. The first is preparation speed and quantity, and the second is quality. And it is in wartime that we try to balance these three indicators so that in a short time it is possible to train a certain number of servicemen, but at the same time achieve a certain quality of training. Of course, quality suffers. In addition, everything depends very much on how training is organized in a particular training center. How staffed are the instructors at this center and how qualified are they? Plus, it is necessary to take into account the moral and business qualities of those who come to such training, whether they have the motivation to study or not. And a number of other factors that are reflected in different educational centers in different ways. Therefore, the quality of such training in different educational centers also differs. Where management managed to gather more trained and experienced instructors, the quality is better. Where leaders think about improving the educational process, while minimizing many distractions for cadets, such as daily uniforms, patrols, shifts, performing some work and so on, of course, the quality of training is better in such training centers. But it is different everywhere. Also among the main problems is the search and selection of qualified instructors. Since May 2022, the network of training military units and training units conducting BZVP has been significantly expanded. And a large number of new instructor positions were introduced, which must be filled with competent instructors. And it is necessary that they all have combat experience, are prepared, etc. This is very difficult to do even during two years of a great war. Next, it is necessary to send as many such instructors and sergeants as possible to the appropriate courses so that they acquire the methodology and become specialists in teaching. This is what we do, trying to do everything we can and even more. — Recently in social networks, some civilians have been spreading information about the alleged falsification of BZVP in the Armed Forces, what do you know about the above, are the facts being presented true? — Yes, there are cases when civilian bloggers or some experts quite often explain in social networks certain problems of training our military personnel, especially regarding BZVP. Indeed, there are enough problems. As I have already said, you can achieve quality in training only when you train the optimal number of military personnel and you have appropriate deadlines for that. Well, of course, there are other conditions: material and technical base, ammunition. So there are problems, and we know them. Even better than some experts. And we do everything to solve them. I am participating specifically in the area of ​​professional development, training of instructors from among sergeants. It must be said here that combat sergeants are also lacking in combat military units that directly fight the enemy at the front. Therefore, commanders do not really want to give their experienced subordinates as instructors to training centers. They need them there to carry out combat missions. Another of the main problems of the basic training of a soldier is the violation of the very technology of training a fighter to participate in combat operations in the fiercest war that can be on this planet. A full-scale war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine with the use of strategic aviation and all types of weapons and equipment, including the latest drones and so on. Humanity has practically never seen such a war. Only nuclear weapons are not used. Ideally, after basic general military training, a serviceman should get into his unit, where he must undergo further training, certain exercises and a stage of collective training of the unit before performing combat tasks. It is this process that helps a serviceman to prepare for combat operations over a certain period of time. But quite often this does not happen. We can compare the participation of Ukrainian servicemen in combat operations on the front line with the participation of car racers in extremely difficult and fierce rallies -Paris - Dakar- or -Le Mans-. Professional drivers have been preparing for these races for years. Our military does not have the ability to prepare for war for years. Most of our soldiers go to combat brigades immediately after the end of the BZVP. At the moment, unfortunately, we do not have a set of military units to fully replace units on the battle line, given the large length of the entire front. This would provide an opportunity for our units and units to periodically leave the areas of hostilities, recover, and undergo a full cycle of training. Therefore, the absence of this cycle, let's say, also greatly affects the quality of a soldier's training. Therefore, it is impossible to expect that after BZVP a soldier, who was a civilian before that, will come and fully fight the enemy on the front line alongside experienced fighters. To make up for certain shortcomings in his training, as well as in psychological readiness for combat, it is necessary to train with a military unit, for which an adaptation course should be held in it for two to three weeks. I recently worked in the Zaporizhia and Kherson directions, before that I worked in other areas of hostilities. So, in each military unit, sergeants and officers organized additional training for servicemen who come from training centers after the BZVP. And where it is organized effectively, the level of execution of combat missions is better, and there are fewer losses. As part of this training, sergeants who have combat experience and an understanding of the nature of combat operations in this area identify the shortcomings of a particular serviceman, and take such additional training into account. Soldiers are trained for those types of weapons that are specifically in a brigade or battalion. Due to the fact that our units sometimes have different types of weapons (in particular, even small arms), accordingly, the nature of hostilities in different areas of the front differs. Tactics of actions of both the enemy and ours in urban areas, plantations, fields, ruins of cities and villages are taken into account. The main thing is that motivated people come who are ready to fight the enemy, protect their families, homes, their country, the future of their children. — What real steps are being taken to increase the effectiveness of the BZVP, to ensure a higher quality of training for our soldiers? — First, the quality of such training is constantly being analyzed. This is work directly in the training units and units that carry out the BZVP, by checking the training process, interviewing the military themselves, and testing them. And work in combat military units when such fighters come. At the moment, a feedback system is being implemented between training centers and units at the front: reports with shortcomings are sent for further rapid response. Secondly, we are currently working on involving officers and sergeants with combat experience from combat military units to the basic general military training held in training centers. That they directly participate in the training of their future fighters. Such a practice is already in place at the Training Center of the State Academy of Medical Sciences, and it has proven its effectiveness. The main area on which we concentrate is improving the training of the instructors themselves, in particular the professional component of their training, improving their skills in fire, tactical and engineering training, for their transfer to cadets. We hope that the increase of BZVP from one month to one and a half will increase its quality, provide an opportunity to conduct more practical training with recruits, primarily in shooting and tactics.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/pidgotovka-mobilizovanyh-ta-voyenne-rali-paryzh-dakar-golovnyj-serzhant-zsu-rozpoviv-pro-problemy-bzvp-pid-chas-vijny/	2024-11-01T21:23:44-07:00

President: North Korean soldiers are already near the Ukrainian border	About this he said during the evening address. North Korea recently test-fired a new ballistic missile that set records for flight time and altitude. Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized that cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang has already allowed North Korea to improve its missile and artillery capabilities. Now the first thousands of North Korean soldiers are near the Ukrainian border, and, unfortunately, Ukraine will be forced to defend itself against new invaders. The president emphasized that the world cannot simply watch this threat grow. According to him, Ukraine has accurate data on the locations of the North Korean military on the territory of Russia, but it cannot carry out pre-emptive strikes due to the lack of long-range weapons. The provision of such weapons depends on Ukraine's partners - the USA, Great Britain, Germany and other states, which have so far refrained from active actions. Zelensky called for the active participation not only of Western countries, but and China, which declares its desire to end the war, but at the same time only observes the situation. The President of Ukraine concluded that North Korea's participation in the war against Ukraine poses a threat to the whole world, and it must be stopped as soon as possible. As reported by ArmyInform, in an interview with South Korean TV channel KBS Volodymyr Zelenskyi shared his thoughts on the danger posed by the involvement of the North Korean military not only for Ukraine, and why it is important to resist it together.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/01/prezydent-pivnichnokorejski-soldaty-vzhe-bilya-ukrayinskogo-kordonu/	2024-11-01T14:29:43-07:00

Modern cyber technologies for young people in defense of democracies: an international conference wa...	The event was organized by the non-governmental organization -International Academy of Geoinformatics- with the assistance of the Department of International Defense Cooperation of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and with the participation of the Kyiv Association of Military Attachés of the countries of the Ramstein group. The President of NAPNU, the head of the -Knowledge- Society of Ukraine, Vasyl Kremin, and the director of the NATO Documentation and Information Center in Ukraine, Vineta Kleine, addressed the conference participants with a welcome speech. -99% of all military aid to Ukraine comes from NATO. We all remember how we started. We started with light equipment, then added heavy military equipment, then anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems. Then drones, ammunition and tanks. And we have already reached the Patriot, IRIS-T and F-16 aircraft systems. We always emphasize that supporting Ukraine is not so much charity as our security interests. It is important to emphasize that during the last summit it was once again confirmed that Ukraine's membership in NATO is irreversible, and the question is no longer whether Ukraine will join NATO, but when. But for now, it's about increased military support and more security deals. And all this can become a bridge to Ukraine's full membership,- Vineta Kleine emphasized in her speech. ArcGIS technology, the core of NATO's geographic information system, was the subject of a 20-minute talk by Nick Sutherland, Executive Director of Defense and Intelligence at Esri European National Government Team. Col. Serhii Pryshchepa, representative of the Support Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told about the implementation of the tasks of creating geospatial data based on Esri technologies. The speech of the deputy chief for educational work of Lviv Lyceum named after Heroes of Krut, lieutenant colonel Taras Hrytsevich, was also interesting. Candidate of technical sciences Ivan Galenko, vice president of the International Academy of Geoinformatics, told about the command and staff game -Cyberjura-, which allows you to use cloud technologies to arrange the ArcGIS OnLine space. Other speakers also spoke about its practical application. The main target audience of the event was young people who are able to respond to the challenges of modern war with the help of modern technologies. The listeners of the online Conference were more than 300 registered participants, mostly from schools and military lyceums.

Russia is removed from participation in the cross-border payments project -mBridge- due to sanctions	About this informs Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The project was developed by the central banks of Hong Kong, China, Thailand and the UAE with the support of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS, which unites the central banks of 60 countries of the world). The purpose of the discussion is to prevent the creation of an alternative mechanism for international transactions, as this will weaken the effectiveness of sanctions pressure on the Russian Federation. In view of the risks of participation in the project of Russia or the transfer of this technology to it, the Bank for International Settlements is considering the possibility of closing the project - the Director General of BIS A. Karstens stated that the organization will not support projects related to countries under sanctions. Earlier ArmyInform reported that the enemy is planting drugs in order to create a pretext for detaining Ukrainians at the TOT.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/01/rosiyu-usuvayut-vid-uchasti-u-proyekti-transkordonnyh-platezhiv-mbridge-cherez-sankcziyi/	2024-11-01T11:18:18-07:00

They provide for classifying the organization of illegal migration as a particularly serious crime, making decisions on the administrative -deportation- of foreigners without a trial, and creating a -register of controlled persons - foreigners- who are illegally staying on the territory of the Russian Federation. Strengthening the anti-migrant policy will have a negative impact on the Russian economy - migrants provide cheap labor in construction, agriculture, transport, service, etc. A decrease in their number will lead to an increase in the labor shortage, an increase in labor costs and a slowdown in economic growth. In addition, such a policy will worsen the Russian Federation's relations with the countries of Central Asia. Since the beginning of the year, the number of illegal migrants in Russia has increased by 40 percent. The rate of cases of organizing illegal migration increased by 5.5 times. In 2024, the number of decisions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation to restrict foreigners from entering Russia increased by 50% to 180,000 cases. Over 106,000 violations in the field of migration legislation were recorded in ten months of this year. 20,000 people were deported from the Russian Federation, and 1,200 people were deprived of their Russian citizenship. As of October 1, 6.2 million foreigners were registered in Russia (8.5 million in 2023). At the same time, the population in Russia is rapidly decreasing. This is influenced by the declining birth rate, high mortality of young men and the outflow of citizens abroad. To maintain the population at the level of 146 million people, Russia must attract from 390 thousand to 1.1 million migrants annually. North Korean military personnel are not classified as migrants. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that 84,000 Kadyriv residents plan to die in Ukraine in the near future.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/01/kreml-posylyuye-antymigrantsku-polityku-cze-matyme-negatyvnyj-vplyv-na-ekonomiku-rf/	2024-11-01T11:04:56-07:00

The Ministry of Defense is looking for solutions to neutralize or reduce the effectiveness of these bombs. Challenge 2: Countering fiber-optic guided drones. The enemy uses drones controlled via fiber optic communication. This makes their radio jamming impossible. The Ministry of Defense is looking for a solution to effectively neutralize these drones. You can register for the Hackathon at the link. Deadline for filling out the form: November 8. - After registration, we will inform participants about the technical details of the calls.

They don't have armor, or they hide it: in the Kharkiv region, enemy infantrymen justify their name	The reasons for such a structure of losses of the enemy's ATS in the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- explained the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU lieutenant colonel Yevgeny Romanov. - What we give in our reports, what we observe, what we work on is about one and a half hundred dead and wounded every day. Armored combat vehicles and tanks are also being destroyed, he said. At the same time, in terms of losses of weapons and enemy equipment, the enemy's road transport prevails. — About three or four times more equipment losses are caused by motor vehicles. They save armor, or they run out of it and can't replenish their resources in time - craft them or restore them, the spokesman explained. In view of the lack or insufficient amount of armored vehicles, the enemy command tries to preserve them and throws Russian soldiers into battle on maneuverable, but virtually defenseless, vehicles. Or at all forces enemy infantry to attack exclusively on foot. — They use either automobile equipment or send personnel on foot to the attack, Yevhenii Romanov said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the north of Kharkiv region, the Russians attack on everything that has wheels, but for their equipment and infantry it is a road at one end.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/01/broni-ne-mayut-abo-hovayut-na-harkivshhyni-vorozhi-pihotynczi-vypravdovuyut-svoyu-nazvu/	2024-11-01T08:51:52-07:00

M1A1 Abrams Weapons of Victory: Uranium Shells, Gas Turbine Engine and British Armor: American Tank ...	In the 1970s, the US began developing a new main battle tank to replace the aging M60 Patton tanks. The result of this work was the M1 Abrams, which was accepted for service in 1980. Named after General Creighton Abrams, a commander during the Vietnam War, the M1 tank featured the use of composite armor (Chobham), high mobility thanks to a gas turbine engine, and the 105 mm M68A1 gun. To reduce the risks, it was decided to develop a tank according to the classic scheme with a crew of 4 and a high ballistic cannon as the main armament. Several armament options were considered: the M68 105 mm rifled gun, the British 110 mm gun and the German 120 mm smoothbore gun. The 110 mm option was rejected and the 120 mm was considered risky, leaving the 105 mm gun with the option of replacing it with a 120 mm later. During the development of the prototypes, the two companies were guided by the following basic requirements: The hull and turret of the M1A1 Abrams tank are of welded construction. The main material for the outer armor is MIL-A-11356 steel. The front parts of the hull and turret, as well as the side parts of the turret, use multi-layer armor based on the English Chobham armor. The upper front part of the case is a 50 mm steel plate. The main characteristics of the reservation: An important safety element is the presence of knockout panels, which allow to prevent an explosion in the event of an ammunition fire. Some tank modifications are also equipped with the Softkill active defense system to counter guided anti-tank missiles. Since 1985, Abrams tanks have been armed with the 120mm M256 smoothbore gun, which uses unitary projectiles with a partially incendiary case, including armor-piercing subcaliber and cumulative rounds. Due to the large diameter of the cartridges, the M1A1 ammunition was reduced to 40 rounds. Additional armament includes a 7.62 mm M240 machine gun mounted with the gun, another such machine gun near the loader hatch, and a 12.7 mm M2 machine gun on the commander's turret. The tank is also equipped with smoke grenade launchers for setting up a smoke screen. M1A1s were first used in combat during Operation Desert Storm. More than 1,800 tanks were used in the campaign to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi occupation, including 594 M1A1HA tanks and 1,178 M1A1s. The Iraqi army had about 1,000 T-72 tanks. Abrams tanks had significant advantages due to a modern sighting system, better crew training and the use of uranium ammunition. On February 26, in a battle with the Iraqi Tauvahalna division, Abrams tanks destroyed 24 T-72s, losing only 4 of their own. In the Iraq war, Abrams tanks were also actively used, but the style of their use was significantly different from the previous conflict. During the first month of fighting, 151 tanks were damaged and 2 were destroyed. By February 2005, 70% of the Abrams tanks in Iraq were damaged, of which 80 were beyond repair. In 2011, a tank company (14 vehicles) of the 1st Tank Battalion of the US Marines was deployed to Afghanistan. Tanks were used to detect the enemy, but their use was episodic due to the terrain. During the war against the terrorists of the Islamic State, 140 M1A1 tanks were given to the Iraqi army, but by the end of 2014 only 40 remained in service. And in June 2018, the Iraqis began to replace them with Russian T-90s. Ukrainian tankers especially note a number of advantages of Abrams: these are high-quality thermal imaging sights, accuracy of fire, maneuverability and reliable stabilization of the gun. Despite the considerable weight of more than 60 tons, this tank demonstrates excellent maneuverability on the battlefield. Thanks to its capabilities, Abrams effectively destroys enemy equipment and infantry, constantly adapting to the new conditions of modern warfare. In the story on the Army TV channel, the Abrams crew of the 47th Mechanized of the brigade recalls a case when they had to finish off an enemy T-62 after it was disabled by an FPV drone. This is a clear example of synergy between different types of weapons on the battlefield. Tankers note the lack of additional armor in some critical areas among the shortcomings of the tank. However, these nuances do not reduce its combat capabilities, which is demonstrated in successful operations.

-Four friends came to our unit, still serve together-: new recruiting opportunities and experience o...	Currently, this system is being worked out in many brigades, so the mechanisms of interaction between military units and TCC and SP are being honed. ArmyInform correspondents asked servicemen of the recruiting group whether the mobilization process has become easier and what opportunities volunteers have 46 separate airmobile brigade of the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. For volunteers who decided to mobilize directly through a specific military unit, there are currently two options: — come on the PPD, write a statement about the desire to serve in a specific brigade. After that, a referral to the VLK is issued to determine fitness for service. In the case of a positive conclusion, psychological tests follow, and then the processing of documents begins. For this, it is necessary to request a personal file from the TCC, but the procedure for issuing it is not yet fully worked out, the 46th brigade explains. — if a person cannot come to the PPD, he communicates with the recruiters of the brigade, who provide a sample application. The volunteer signs it, sends a scan and the original by mail. After that, a referral is made, which is transferred to the TCC for the place where the person wants to undergo the VLK. The person must pass it within the specified time. -According to the TCC procedure, the team must be informed that the volunteer has completed the VLC and send a conclusion. We already have the first person who went through this scheme, but we did not wait for the conclusion, he called and informed himself,- — says the head of the freelance recruiting group, Lieutenant Oleksandra Unknown. The TCC must also provide a list of names, according to which the mobilized person will come to the brigade, and a military ID (if he is a soldier or a sergeant). — The brigade does not issue military tickets, and without them we have no right to send a person to the BZVP. And according to the new law, after arrival and registration within three days, we must send him to study. And if a person does not have a military ticket, he will not be accepted there. And the TCC says that we do not know such a procedure. While this is a problem, — explains Oleksandra Nevydima. At the same time, a military unit can itself turn to the nearest TCC with a request to issue a military card for a specific person , who expressed a desire to serve. — This system is interesting and can help increase mobilization. It is only necessary to work out the algorithm of cooperation with the TCC. Then it will make our work easier, and people will not be afraid that even with the attitude they may not get into the chosen brigade and unit, - adds the recruiting group of the 46th brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the 46th brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, they emphasize that currently the majority of new arrivals are those people who come through the recruiting system. Young people choose the specialties of UAV operators, scouts, anti-aircraft gunners or communications 8217; porters. People aged 35-45 already choose more according to their civilian specialty and experience, for example, drivers of heavy equipment, repairmen. — We had a company of four friends from Dobropill , who came together and still serve together. For us, this is only a plus. This is already a well-formed team that understands each other in half a word. They came to the TCC with our relations, we talked to the TCC and said that these four guys should get to us, — recalls Oleksandr Nevidim. She emphasizes that recruiters never promise candidates a position if it doesn't exist. Moreover, there are always back-up options, if the position is filled while the person undergoes the BZVP, this sometimes happens. They also offer an alternative if there are no positions that the candidate is interested in. — We do not hide that the brigade is conducting combat operations in the Kurakhiv direction, this is already known to everyone. A person who knows what he is going for is more motivated. When recruiting began, all units said that people come more motivated, learn better and ultimately serve better, — explain the recruiters. In 46 brigades of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are convinced that one of the effective ways to attract volunteers is to inform about the combat path of the military unit. It is for this purpose that a documentary series is currently being filmed about all the key events in which the brigade participated. Five series have already been released, work on the sixth is underway. — A year ago, on the Day of Airborne Assault Troops, the idea arose to shoot a documentary series. The first series was devoted to the Makarov operation, where three battalion tactical groups of the 95th brigade were involved. From there, the birth of the 46th brigade began — on April 5, 2022, it was these 3 BTGr that formed the basis of the brigade, — says the head of the communications department of the 46th OAeMBr, Lieutenant Oleksandr Nevidimy. The series also tells about the coordination of the brigade, the long operation in the Kherson region and its liberation, and then about the battles in the East — in Bakhmut and Soledar. Work is currently underway on a new episode about the brigade's participation in the Zaporozhye counteroffensive in 2023. — Our fourth battalion broke through defense of the enemy at Robotyn, and the then battalion commander Oleg Dmytrouk was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine for this operation. We tell you how it really was at the level of our brigade. And so that the enemy does not tell it in his own way and does not distort it, - explains Oleksandr Nevymidy. A well-known Ukrainian producer helps the paratroopers of the 46th brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to create the series Ihor Kondratyuk. — No one from the military offered me this. I liked the idea. This is a young brigade, and if we do not write its history, then the Russians can write it. It helps awareness one hundred percent. People who are currently considering whether to join the military can see real servicemen, sergeants, officers, commands, how the brigade structure works. Such awareness must be there. Reports from the brigades — are important stories for mobilization. To choose a brigade, you need to know it at least a little from the inside, — he notes. Recently, the 46th Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine organized a two-day intensive for civilians. It is also part of the unit's recruiting campaign. Participants received all the necessary equipment. Among them were volunteers, wives of the dead and missing, as well as ordinary civilians who understand that war affects everyone. More you can read about this intensive in the ArmiyaInform report. We also remind you of the opportunity to use aggregator of vacancies in ZSU on our website.

As established by investigators from Vox Ukraine, it is a podcast of Spanish, not Colombian journalist Juan Luis Sanchez. In addition, the Russians faked the recording, because the Spanish media elDiario.es, where this journalist works, did not publish it. A separate search for keywords from the heading -Military conflicts around the world - Ukraine, Israel, Korea- (-Conflictos militares en todo el mundo Ukraina, Israel, Corea-) also did not yield results. According to Article 47 of the Additional Protocol 1 to the Geneva Convention, foreign citizens who officially fight in the armed forces of one or another party conflict, are not mercenaries. Therefore, all foreigners who serve in the ranks of the Defense Forces sign a contract, are considered combatants and have the full status of military personnel, not -mercenaries-. Similar fakes, as we have repeatedly emphasized, are aimed at cultivating a negative image of our country in the world and discrediting the military units of the Armed Forces in which they serve volunteers are citizens of other countries.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/01/kolumbijskyj-podkast-vyyavyvsya-ispanskym-rosiyany-rozganyayut-chergovyj-fejk-pro-dobrovolcziv/	2024-10-31T21:04:53-07:00
The occupation authorities carry out the systematic militarization of Ukrainian children at the TOT	Russia popularizes militarization as -military applied sports- and the way to a -healthy and safe lifestyle.- It turns Ukrainian children into objects of propaganda. Conducting such -schools- violates children's right to a peaceful childhood and prepares them to participate in the war against Ukraine. I would like to emphasize that the involvement of children in hostilities is contrary to the Geneva Convention for the Protection of the Civilian Population in Time of War and Additional Protocol I, which expressly prohibit the use of children in war. In addition, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court defines the recruitment and use of children in an international armed conflict as a war crime. However, the Russian occupation authorities disregard these norms, using children in the interests of their regime since the beginning of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation in 2014. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that on TOT a new batch of construction workers arrived from Belarus.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/31/okupaczijna-vlada-provodyt-systemnu-militaryzacziyu-ukrayinskyh-ditej-na-tot/	2024-10-31T12:54:13-07:00

The invaders destroyed the city's two largest metallurgical enterprises in the spring of 2022 - the Azovstal plant and the Ilyich plant. They promised to restore them, but instead they only loot. Metal and equipment are exported, which are then sold for hundreds of millions of dollars.

The European Commission presented a report on Europe's readiness to respond to crises	About this informs the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The document, along with the economic report of M. Draghi (Prime Minister of Italy in 2021-2022) on European competitiveness is part of the strategy of U. von der Leyen to strengthen the strategic capabilities of the EU and the role of the European Commission. The report emphasizes that the world is facing a new reality and focuses on Russian aggression against Ukraine, the pandemic and climate change. This requires changes in policy approaches and security measures from the EU countries. S. Niynisto states that today the EU's ability to respond to threats is slowed down by -institutional, legal and political limitations that make it difficult to quickly unite the relevant actors to manage the crisis.- The main proposals: creating the EU's own common defense treaty to provide assistance to one of the member states in the event of external aggression. The document should supplement NATO's collective security mechanism; endowment of the EC with broad functions in the field of defense and reorientation of 20% of the EU budget to security needs; creating within the EC a central hub for coordination between different sectors and increasing situational awareness; expansion of the powers of the Intelligence and Situation Center (EU INTCEN), including the collection of intelligence with the help of EU diplomatic missions and the conduct of counterintelligence operations; increasing military support to Ukraine to offset US aid in the event of a reduction.

For reconnaissance, this is one of the most dangerous directions. The enemy is motivated, the terrain is unfamiliar, because of this it is not always possible to work quietly. -In Kurshchyna, they entered the deep rear of the enemy. There was a case: we approached the village, gave the coordinates and waited for instructions. The voices of our two opponents were heard. It so happened that we were ambushed on the way. They did not agree to lay down their arms, so they transformed into another life. Next, we found the house where the -Akhmatovs- were. We had a fight there, not everything went according to plan, they ran away. We got a good foothold there, took control of the positions and led our boys. They did a good job,- adds the defender. Anton recently received the medal -For Military Service to Ukraine- from the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, for numerous successful combat missions and exemplary service. -For me, this award is proof that we are going in the right direction.

About the help of the army, mobilization, hate from Russian bots and family matters. Interview with ...	This was discussed in first part interview. Today is the final part of the conversation. - I would like to talk about this. In your streams, you constantly invite your viewers to help the army, including financially. Aren't our people tired of helping the army? - Absolutely not! I have never positioned myself as a volunteer. And I want to emphasize this. Because, with certain exceptions, and it was literally several times, I try not to collect anything on my map. And my principle in this case is very simple. Since I am not a volunteer, I do not plan to solve any strategic tasks there. There are people, we have giant funds, they solve complex approaches. Even certain weapons systems are introduced with public money, and then they are already purchased in large batches from manufacturers by the Ministry of Defense. My approach as a citizen is to help our army on a daily basis. When, let's say, I carol at people, it is primarily in the interests of certain departments. I actually have only one rule: these should be people who really defend the Motherland with weapons in their hands, who are really at war. Because the army is big. If these are our fighters in the Kursk region or Donetsk region, of course, we need to help, help, help! And from the meetings that I sometimes organize, I see: why should anyone get tired of this. A lot of donations are sent from abroad. And it is clear from the surnames that these are not only people with Ukrainian roots. A lot of money is sent to Israel, from the USA, Canada, and the Baltic States. There are also many of them in Ukraine, in particular in Kyiv. Therefore, the people are ready to invest in their security. And this, it seems to me, is an absolutely undeniable thing. - And how do you feel about hate, or twisting of true facts in the comments to your videos? - I wouldn't say that I cover it a lot there. Well, they actually show how those Putin bots react, that this is all a -team game- for them. For example, when there were fights for Vugledar, no matter what I said, a bunch of comments from haters were of the same type: -but our Uglidar.- If you just treat it like an ordinary person, then you understand that this is your job. Well, since recently. For example, when it was decided that the meeting in Ramstein at the level of the heads of state of the anti-Putin coalition would simply be postponed because of hurricanes in the USA. Before this topic, I saw the same type of messages that -even a hurricane is on the side of Russia, you were fired, you were abandoned- and so on. Although everyone perfectly understands that all necessary decisions from the military and military-technical aspect may not be as fast as we would like, but they are all being adopted. And Biden wants, on the contrary, to say it himself, those messages. And when they write that -Biden is not going, but Biden abandoned you-, it's even a little funny, because the bots write everything the same. They, our enemies, told us about this 10 years ago, and they are telling us now. And there is no way they can understand that Ukraine was, is and will be. Therefore, I simply do not pay attention to such attacks. Well, my mother corresponds with such a category of people, trying to prove something to them. And I say: if you do not know this person personally, then there is no point in entering into a conversation with him. —From political and public issues, let's move, if you don't mind, to a personal question. Not only the physical enemy occupation, but also the war itself separated hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian families: men were in Ukraine, women and children were forced to live abroad. This happened to you too. That you miss your family is understandable. Nevertheless, what changes and transformations are taking place in your family? - I don't think that my story is any different from others. This is a test. Our family has complete understanding in such a situation. And it still seems to me that if there is an ability not to hear air alarms and, accordingly, not to live in the risks in which we live, then children should be saved from this. I, of course, have a longing for them. They are growing up, but in fact they do not see their father as often as they would like. There, abroad, they master two languages. Foreign I notice that their Ukrainian is not as fluent as before. But many people have even worse conditions for dating, for personal communication than I do. It is clear that conscripted men are not allowed to travel abroad, because everyone is obliged to defend the state, be registered and, if necessary, join the army. What about the children? We have so many destroyed settlements. It is better for them to grow up in Europe than to fall into Russian captivity, like the children of Mariupol, for example. Therefore, the situation is complicated, there are many uncertainties. I think we should each do our own thing. Children should grow, learn, and we should defend our country. It is clear that not everyone will return from forced evacuation, from emigration. And this should also be said directly. It is clear that the demographic situation in general will be the number one issue in Ukraine. But it is equally clear that many will want to return after the war, if they have somewhere to return to. Because many simply have nowhere to go. Upon their return, they will have a completely different level of requirements for school, for their city, and many, many other things. I actually understand the risks, I'm not sure there's any point in talking about it right now because the underlying issue isn't resolved. The basic issue is security, it's a war that's still going on. Well, we are now in Kyiv, there are many children here, many have not left, many are here. This is a personal decision. Criticize, suggest: no one knows how to do the right thing unequivocally. When you don't know how to act, act as you see fit. But I'm optimistic: many people will still come back here. Because, first of all, it's great to live here in Ukraine. What's most upsetting us here right now? War! And if we take away the factors of war, then, of course, not everything is as perfectly organized here as in many European states. But our compatriots will come here with new knowledge, with new acquaintances, with a new vision of the world, knowledge of languages, etc. — Following this personal thread. During a previous meeting in our editorial office, touching on the topic of your family, you said that your wife is a role model for you, but she has one flaw: a foreigner's passport. After all, like your children, you brought your beloved wife to Ukraine after a long business trip from Moscow. Has it been possible to solve this -documentary- problem? - Not yet, but we have done a lot for this and have taken a big step towards it. About a month ago, I attended an interview at the Security Service of Ukraine, which was conducted by officers of the counterintelligence department. And I think that everything will be as it should be, regarding the wife's acquisition of Ukrainian citizenship. Of course, there are some legal issues involved. The attitude of the Ukrainian state and the majority of our people to the holders of Russian passports during the war is understandable. My approach: you need to look at what a person actually does, not at his passport. There are people who use Russian passports to fight for Ukraine. And to immediately understand who is a rogue, a spy or an -exiled Cossack-, there are special services in this state for this. I am confident that everything will be fine for my family. - Now the topic of mobilization is perhaps the most discussed in our society. You are a media person, you constantly communicate with our fighters from the front line, organize help for them. But you also know the opinions of civilians about joining the Defense Forces. Is there any transformation taking place here in people's awareness of the need to defend the Motherland? - It is clear that during the war, the first-line soldier is the greatest treasure of the state. That is, being a rifleman in the first division of the first platoon of the first company of the first battalion of any mechanized brigade is the most difficult, the safest. These are just realities. And service in the army can also be very different. But still the most dangerous thing is what is called infantry, on which everything rests. No matter what anyone says, no matter how many drones there are, if there is no Ukrainian soldier, then they, the occupiers, will go on, on and on. So there are two aspects here, maybe even more. In my opinion, the most important thing is that the state should be sincere with its citizens. If the President says that we have a plan for victory, there are points that are addressed to partners, then they should tell us that in order to achieve this, exactly what efforts should be made on the part of the citizens of Ukraine. Because, on the one hand, we hear from high-ranking officials that everything is fine with mobilization, but there are other opinions on this matter. And no one cancels the obligation. And that's what mobilization is all about. We even have some deputies with scythes in the Rada, they say: we are against violent mobilization. So, I would like to tell these stupid populists that mobilization is already coercion. The word is violent, it is so colored. Some parliamentarians say that, as they say, we think about Ukrainians, but the rest - the generals, the president, the chief of the general staff - do not. Such things should simply be cut off and broadcast the thesis that everyone should be registered and ready to be drafted into the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I am well aware of this and am registered with the TCC. I know that you are also standing. — As a video blogger, you are classified as an -opinion leader-. Roman Tsymbalyuk was one of the first in Ukraine to become a -millionaire YouTuber- by the number of subscribers. For this, the popular social network has a special award - the -golden button-. Did you get it? - Yes, this is the only thing I lack for complete happiness (laughs - Author). Two things, to be exact: victory in the war and the golden button. -Golden buttons- are currently not sent to Ukraine. On this popular video platform, they believe that we are in a military conflict zone. And that's why I don't physically have a -golden button- from YouTube. — So in the YouTube office, they associate such attention to your channel with Russian aggression? And in general, do you notice any decrease in the audience's interest in your page on this popular video hosting? Is there any personal secret to expanding the audience? - I think it's all about the content that the author makes. And in my case regarding the audience, the number of views, it's always this kind of multidirectionality in the graphs, -up and down-. That is, the audience in terms of the number of subscribers and views changes periodically, and you yourself need to change. This is YouTube, this platform is quite competitive. Many new authors appear. If there is no competitive television for the most part now, all the viewers have gone to YouTube. And if there is a desire to somehow keep your viewer so that he does not forget about you, then you have to work every day. And I work every day without a day off. And the main secret is that I just love this job. And specific surges of viewer interest are observed when significant events occur in domestic politics or in the international arena. But, I repeat, you have to work every day. Since 2022, since the beginning of the large-scale Russian aggression, it can be said that there is a decline in the number of views. Maybe 20 percent. And the very beginning of the war, it led to some crazy flourishing of the Ukrainian segment on YouTube. It seems to me that the rule I work by is actually not only inherent to how this particular platform works, but to life in general. The head of this organization once said: -I have only one piece of advice for authors. You should do what you love and talk about what you believe in.- If you follow this rule, even outside of YouTube, you'll be fine no matter what you do. If a person is a doctor, if a person is a soldier, if a person is a journalist, it doesn't matter. I live by this principle and it is equally good for me to look into the eyes of a specific person, my viewer, any audience. Because I do not change my opinion about what Ukraine was, is and will be!	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/31/pro-dopomogu-armiyi-mobilizacziyu-hejt-vid-rosijskyh-botiv-ta-spravy-simejni-intervyu-z-romanom-czymbalyukom/	2024-10-30T21:58:09-07:00
- It is important not to -philonit-, but to get the most from the instructors-. Mobilization, traini...	Now he is a junior sergeant, commander of the unmanned aerial vehicle division in the ranks of the 128th separate mountain assault brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Higher education, specialist diploma with honors in the field of IT. He is 31 years old. Before joining the army, he worked in real estate. After the large-scale invasion, he recalls, the field in which he worked somewhat -dimmed-. -There was no desire to sit and wait for an unknown amount of time. There was no certainty about tomorrow. There was no income for a month or one and a half. I came to our territorial defense, they promised to call me, but I never received a call,- the man recalls. That's how Roman found himself in the field of landscape design - he became a project manager. And once his team was offered to work with a facility in Transcarpathia. It was in May 2023. -To be honest, my colleagues were afraid to go there, but there was no way out. And when we were driving on the Torun Pass, we were stopped at a roadblock: the police checked the documents, and the representative of the TCC, after several clarifying questions, wanted us to move with him to clarify all the credentials. The next day I was already in Rivne at the training ground. There was no opportunity to get together, change clothes, grab something from home, everything happened somewhat spontaneously,- Roman recalls. Next came basic military training and leadership courses. We ask a military man what his impressions of BZVP are. -It's all individual. It doesn't matter what kind of training. What matters is that it exists. It is important to get the most out of what the instructors give you. It is important not to -philonit-, to turn on creativity sometimes in order to learn something and not to die in the first days on the battlefield. Maybe I'm wrong, but it's all very individual.- After that, he was assigned to the 128th separate mountain assault brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -I really didn't know until the end where I wanted to go and where I saw myself. At first I decided to go for a stormtrooper. We studied battle strategy, how to properly enter enemy trenches, etc. But then a person came to us who, according to certain criteria, selected people for the UAV unit. Two people were taken from us, the rest of the guys went to the fire support company. After that, we went directly to the site of hostilities - to the area occupied by our brigade.- Roman began training - first he mastered one type of drones, then he took up shock UAVs. It was already September 2023. During one of the combat missions, Roman eliminated the enemy's ammunition warehouse with two drops from a drone. We ask you to recall this case, but, he says, the crew sometimes does not even know that they are working on an enemy composition from BC. -We simply drop on specific targets that are pre-announced to us by operatives on duty or higher commanders. And then we see detonations, which give us the understanding that somewhere there was some BC&#8230; At first we threw it off - and then we already understand that we hit something fat and such joy overflows&#8230; And we understand that we are also contributing to the future victory.- In general, there are several crews in Roman's unit, which alternate among themselves, going on combat sorties. The longest such trip lasted 9 days. Roman also remembers the most delicious exercise: -We saw the enemy's equipment through the thermal imaging camera, which had recently been silenced&#8230; And we began to kill them with resets: we saw how they detonated, caught fire, burned! I can't say exactly the equivalent in terms of money, but it was definitely some BMP that brought the crew of their infantrymen to the assault.- Recently, Roman's crew came under fire. There were losses, Roman received a concussion. He says this is one of the hardest moments: losing colleagues. -I was always afraid of forgetting the algorithm of first aid, the sequence of actions when my brothers were injured. We pulled into the position, started to deploy, I was adjusting everything in the shelter&#8230; And the shelling began. When I came out of the shelter and saw what I saw, that was probably the most difficult thing: surviving that moment. Because there was no one to provide first aid.- The novel states: fear does not disappear from being in the area of ​​hostilities. -Yes, working for several days in a row, you get used to it to a certain extent and you begin to treat it somewhat easier morally. But the security measures we use come first. I think for myself and my staff. Therefore, I emphasize and repeat: for me, safety measures are in the first place. If I see some area where we can't pass because we might -burn- somewhere there, then I won't go, I'll just argue to the command that we weren't ready to take the risk. And in our country, by the way, the command is very loyal to this,- says the military man. He recalls that in the unit there were cases when people were lost. -And we drew certain conclusions from that. And we understand that we don't want to say goodbye to each other. And we are all well aware that we can wait literally 20 minutes and drive in safer conditions than risk it. Safety measures should not be taken lightly.- The novel advises civilians who, for various reasons, have not yet joined the ranks of the Defense Forces, to start studying the units that are actively participating in hostilities and to decide for themselves where they can go to serve. -It's mostly the fear of the unknown that can stop a person. And everyone is now terrified, afraid of any contact with the army, etc. But everyone had enough time to make a decision for themselves. If not ready to fight, there are other ways to be useful to the Defense Forces. You just have to put some effort into it.- In the end, we ask a military man what for him will be victory in the Russian-Ukrainian war. -Many moments affect the awareness and understanding of what victory is. For me, victory is when I come back. When I am demobilized. When there will be all the conditions for this. And when planes will be able to fly again in the peaceful skies of Ukraine. No matter how banal and childish it sounds.- Photo is from the personal archive of a serviceman	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/31/vazhlyvo-ne-filonyty-a-braty-maksymum-vid-instruktoriv-mobilizacziya-navchannya-i-vijna-komandyra-viddilennya-bpla-u-128-ogshbr/	2024-10-30T21:40:39-07:00

The technical goals of this update include improved protection against anti-tank weapons and drones, which are increasingly common in today's combat scenarios. According to information provided by the Defense Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Agency (ATLA) of the Ministry of Defense, three active defense systems were selected for evaluation: Rafael's Trophy and Elbit's Iron Fist from Israeli manufacturers and Rheinmetall's Strike Shield from German tank builders. These systems were selected based on specific criteria, including topside threat protection, 360° interception capabilities, and a total weight of less than 1,000 kg. At the same time, Japan's Ministry of Defense also decided to test the Kongsberg RS6 remote module equipped with a 30 mm cannon. It is expected that this module will be integrated into an active defense system and will have sensors capable of detecting high-speed objects, including UAVs. The purpose of such an innovation is to increase the ability of Type 10 tanks to face air threats, while providing effective protection against ground risks. While the exact number of Type 10 Hitomaru battleships to be upgraded has not yet been disclosed, Japan plans to purchase approximately 300 RS6 modules, which will be produced domestically at a rate of 10 units per year. In addition, the Far Eastern country continues to produce new Type 10 tanks, and in 2025 there are plans to order 12 more vehicles to increase the total number to 148 units. Ultimately, around 300 tanks of this type are expected to be produced. The Ministry of Defense is also considering the development of additional protection modules that could be installed on the Type 10 tanks. The combat vehicles will be designed with modularity in mind and will be able to install new systems directly from the factory, facilitating the integration of advanced technologies. In a broader context, official Tokyo continues to strengthen its defense capabilities, including the production of new Patria armored personnel carriers (about which our agency told in previous materials) for the Ground Self-Defense Forces of Japan, made on the island of Hokkaido. This initiative underscores the importance Japan attaches to modernizing its military forces in response to rapidly evolving global threats. Japanese Type 10 Hitomaru main battle tank.

Putin chauvinists put up imaginary posters in Kyiv: why is this the enemy	Quite unexpectedly, this slogan was mentioned again. This time in Kyiv. The so-called pro-Russian -resistance of the NOD-, which exists only in the sick imagination of chauvinists-Putinists, put up 1000 posters in the Ukrainian capital with this slogan and a portrait of a bunker rat. Naturally, no one has ever seen these posters, as well as -NOD partisans-, except for enemy telegram channels and other propaganda resources. But for fakers, this is not a problem. They took a photo of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra from an article in the Ukrainian media and pasted Putin posters on it in a photo editor. Locations in other photos and videos distributed by the Russians cannot be identified at all. There is no reason to claim that such postcards could have appeared in Kyiv and Ukraine in general. Most likely, this is a production whose purpose is to show that at least someone in Ukraine is -waiting- for Putin and does not perceive him as an aggressor.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/31/shovinisty-putinczi-rozkleyily-u-kyyevi-uyavni-plakaty-navishho-cze-vorogu/	2024-10-30T21:01:25-07:00

The next technology was guided munitions, which hit the target with high accuracy. They are automatically guided to the target and adjust their flight, which significantly increases the effectiveness of bomber drones in combat operations. Another important innovation was the robot-dog, a technology that is already actively used in military operations in the United States. The robot is capable of carrying out logistics and reconnaissance tasks in various weather conditions and landscapes. It can travel up to 10 kilometers on a single charge. Brave1 is already in talks with an American company to to ensure the introduction of dog robots in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. These technologies demonstrate high results and can significantly increase the capabilities of the Ukrainian army on the battlefield. As reported by ArmyInform, in Brave1 already has more than 2800 defense developments, most of which appeared after 2022.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/30/vid-royu-droniv-do-robota-psa-brave1-testuye-novi-mozhlyvosti-dlya-zsu/	2024-10-30T07:53:40-07:00

The occupying power is faceless: the Kremlin closes access to data on officials -LNR-	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, head of the Luhansk OVA. In addition, restrictions on access to information about the socio-economic status of the occupied territories, where a catastrophic budget deficit is observed, have already been introduced. The propaganda about the economic development of these regions, which the Russians had been spreading for decades, began to lose its effect when people saw the real numbers. It is these data that are planned to be classified. Access to the personal data of officials and security forces will also be restricted due to the fact that many Russians refuse to go to leadership positions in the -LNR- due to the high death rate among the occupation authorities. From November 21, residents of the -LNR- will be deprived of Russian citizenship if they do not take the oath. The law, which will take effect next month, invalidates all previous citizenship decisions. Those who do not swear an oath to the aggressor country by the specified deadline will be considered as never having Russian citizenship.

Deadly Hypervelocity Shield: The US military is developing a program to counter hypersonic weapons	As highlighted in a release posted on Northrop Grumman's official portal, this innovative defense system should be the first of its kind, specially designed to neutralize hypersonic threats, which are becoming more and more influential in modern conflicts, ArmyInform reports. The American firm noted that, in close cooperation with MDA, the three-year development phase of this project led by Northrop Grumman led to the creation of an individual solution aimed at countering current and new capabilities of hypersonic missiles. GPI represents a significant technological leap in missile defense with significant potential to play a key role in future conflict scenarios. Experts of the defense site Army Recognition learned some details and said that as the program moves into the next phase of development, Northrop Grumman will focus on several critical aspects. First, the company will continue to refine the previous GPI design to enable it to be deployed against ballistic missiles on US Navy destroyers, as well as the land-based Aegis Ashore system, using a standard vertical launch system. Next, Northrop Grumman will focus on demonstrating the interceptor's performance in hypersonic environments before moving on to a preliminary design analysis. In addition, the company plans to conduct early flight tests of interceptor missiles, relying on its proven test technologies. Finally, the use of advanced digital engineering techniques will streamline the design process and accelerate the development of interceptor capabilities. Wendy Williams, vice president and general manager of Northrop Grumman's launch and missile defense division, emphasized the strategic importance of the GPI program. -GPI provides warfighters with critical engagement capabilities in situations where distance provides a tactical advantage. Our solution adapts well to meet a variety of operational needs and is designed to succeed in an ever-changing threat environment,- said Williams. The GPI design includes advanced technologies such as scanning equipment for accurate threat tracking and the ability to use hit-to-kill technology (technology to intercept and destroy enemy missiles with kinetic weapons). Experts said that in the competition for the contract to develop the anti-hypersonic weapons program with Northrop, it won over such a serious competitor as the corporation RTX. The two firms were awarded a preliminary contract to develop the GPI in June 2022 after eliminating another competitor, Lockheed Martin. In addition to fulfilling its obligations to MDA, Northrop Grumman will work closely with the Japanese Ministry of Defense as part of a joint GPI development program. This partnership aims to provide interceptors that will enhance the defense capabilities of both countries against hypersonic threats. Northrop Grumman provides comprehensive solutions to defeat enemy missiles.

A philosopher with a weapon in his hands: a locksmith - Plato - told about the battles in the Pokrov...	-Plato- comes from Kyiv and is a philosopher by education. According to the man, this science helps him in the army, as the result of thinking becomes broader, thanks to this, it is possible to take into account a large number of factors that are happening now, and it helps to make quick decisions. — In the discussion, the truth is born, or something like that, and therefore there are many points of view and there are other points where they all coincide. And it is during communication and dialogue that these points are found, and this communication is called philosophizing, Plato said. He entered the army in 2023, when a summons came to his home. While still studying at the university, he graduated from the military department, so he was a reserve officer. — I have many acquaintances who have participated in ATO since 2014. They say, if the summons comes, we know you're ready, if we can, we'll serve together. And I listened to their advice and it so happened that a summons came, and I went to the Military Commissariat without hesitation, - said Platon. However, he did not manage to get into the service of his comrades. At the same time, the man did not think long about his future call sign. After all, it is worth reminding that Plato is a philosopher by education, so he chose his nickname in honor of the ancient Greek thinker of the same name. In the TCC, Platon was informed that the 401st separate rifle battalion was being formed, in which he later became a platoon commander. For several months, combat training of recruits took place near Kyiv, where there were classes in tactical medicine, fire and tactical training. — In principle, the preparation was good, and thanks to it, we were able to hold out quite well for a while, but the advantage of the enemy's strength sometimes does not give us a chance, unfortunately, said Platon. At the same time, the military man said that in the army, in addition to direct combat operations and work -at zero-, there is quite a lot of work with documents, which requires a lot of time. Plato believes that in the current situation, quality training of soldiers should be a priority, because they have to learn something new literally every day. — Because there is no pattern that can be followed in every situation. Because the situation changes every day, maybe every hour, every half hour. Factors can always be different. They may coincide, but the situation is different. There is nothing here that we did here a week ago and we will do it now. Not a fact that it will work. And war changes very quickly, he said. Already at the beginning of June, Platon went to the Bakhmut direction, namely to the Andriivka village area. They took part in battles together with other units. According to his recollections, enemy artillery, mortars and tanks were mostly working there. — Shooting battles, of course, also took place, but mostly it was a defeat at a distance. And it was felt that the enemy had more iron than we did. When I was in the position, I tell everyone, I had nightmares about -Cornflower- for four days. It's just dawning, a drone flies in, hovers, flies away. And we hear it there, pooh-pooh-pooh-pooh-pooh-pooh-pooh-pooh. And we know that they have crept up to us, said Plato. At that time, the shelling was so constant that they did not even raise their heads from the trench, and when there was a minimal lull, they immediately took up the shovel and dug in. Plato clarified that it doesn't matter what rank and position you have on the front line - everyone works. The man took part in defensive operations in the Andriivka region, and was also engaged in setting up positions. Bakhmut's direction in a warrior is associated with both fear and joy that all his boys survived. Later, the battalion was transferred to another area, namely to the Terny village near Liman. Plato remembered the battles in this direction with bitterness, because there the enemy behaved quite unpredictably. — They counted on one development of the situation, so I said that there is no pattern. And the situation is developing differently. You need to react quickly to it. Sometimes they made it, sometimes, unfortunately, they didn't make it, the man said. Near Terny, the battles were fought almost non-stop, the enemy tried to go to the side, and in some places even to the rear due to landings. However, the occupiers managed to be stopped and even pushed back to their former positions in some places. A month later, the soldiers were already transferred to another part of the front, because they were able to fulfill their task near Terny. At the moment, Platon, already in the role of deputy company commander, and his fighters are in the Pokrovsky direction. Platon calls the extensive use of FPV drones a feature of the battles on this part of the front. Previously, they tried to hit heavy equipment, but now they are used to hit manpower. And it does not matter whether it is a group of soldiers or a single serviceman. Therefore, the fighters continue to train new recruits, give them experience. One of the stages of training is working with drones, and not only controlling them, but also being able to distinguish Mavic and FPV by sound. — The problem here is that remote warfare is taking place, but not only with the help of artillery, but also with such means of defeat as drop and FPV. Now, in principle, the line of responsibility of our brigade has more or less stabilized, and the enemy has gone the other way, but this was achieved with a very great effort at the moment when we were somewhat led here. We are talking about Novooleksandrivka and Vozdvizhenka, because then the Russians had their main attack in that direction, towards the highway, - said Platon. Platon recalled how a column of invaders advanced to the area of ​​the village of Vozdvizhenka, but the brigade artillery worked well against them. The Russians were hit with tanks, 152 caliber artillery and D-30 howitzers. Most of the invaders became -good fertilizer- after that. According to the military, proper communication with neighboring units also contributes to successful defense. Thanks to her, the soldiers of the battalion managed to effectively restrain the enemy's offensive. Platon, in the role of deputy company commander, is engaged in building an effective management system, and also tries to maintain a positive atmosphere in his team. At the moment, his battalion has fully entered the structure of the 110th separate mechanized brigade. - First of all, there should be a correct division of functions so that a person is not given tasks that he cannot perform for some reason. This is the key point. Secondly, there are mistakes that it seems that a person knows something, I put him in a workplace, and then I see that he is not suitable for this work. It is necessary to change the task for her, Plato said. There is quite a lot of work in his mouth, so Plato does not manage to get a full night's sleep, but sometimes he finds a free hour in the middle of the day to, as he says, -lie down with his eyes closed.- After our victory, Platon wants to meet his friends and have a nice rest, and also get a cat.

From head to toe: the Russian Federation disperses a fake about the conversation of Oleksandr Syrsky...	In the conversation that actually took place, the commanders discussed the current situation at the front and the organization of Ukraine's defense in certain areas. As well as the possibility of hitting military facilities deep into Russian territory. According to Syrskyi, the British side is working on its own proposals as part of the practical implementation of the Victory Plan, which indeed contains a clause about long-range strikes on the territory of the Russian Federation. In particular, Ukraine wants its partners to lift restrictions on the use of long-range Western weapons. However, Russian propaganda has turned everything upside down by spreading fake news that Great Britain is participating in military operations against the Russian Federation. Such -throwbacks- have become more frequent recently. The Russians constantly try to accuse Ukraine of involving servicemen from NATO countries in hostilities, and they try to discredit foreign partners in the eyes of Ukrainian society by saying that they do not want to accept our country into the Alliance. Literally last week, there was a fake rumor circulating in the news space that there were seven NATO countries against the invitation of Ukraine to the Alliance. The main task of the enemy is to demoralize Ukrainians and make them quarrel with international partners. Only in this way will they have at least some chance to impose their conditions for the end of the war.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/30/z-nig-na-golovu-rf-rozgonyaye-fejk-pro-rozmovu-oleksandra-syrskogo/	2024-10-29T21:21:16-07:00
The enemy has not created offensive groups in the South, there are no significant advances	This was announced by the spokesman of the Southern Defense Forces on the air of the telethon Edyny News Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn of Ukraine. -Currently, the enemy has not created offensive groups, according to our intelligence, but in several areas he is creating additional assault groups to conduct assault operations with small infantry forces,- the spokesman said. Vladyslav Voloshyn emphasized that in each of the directions in the South, the enemy distributes its forces according to where it is increasing its efforts, as well as where it maintains defenses. -The enemy has no significant advances. A few days ago, due to constant assault actions, the enemy wedged in a short distance, to the depth of a platoon support point near the village of Levadne. Now the Southern Defense Forces are conducting a stabilization operation to level the situation,- said Vladyslav Voloshyn. According to him, the enemy continues air strikes, uses UAVs, there are missile strikes every day, and a counter-battery fight is underway. The spokesman also noted that the vast majority of islands in the Kherson region are under fire control of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russians began to use FPV drones with a fiber optic cable, soldiers of the 128th separate mountain assault brigade of the Transcarpathia encountered them for the first time.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/vorog-ne-stvoryv-nastupalnyh-ugrupuvan-na-pivdni-znachyh-prosuvan-nemaye/	2024-10-29T12:57:24-07:00
The Defense Forces reported the appearance of unusual enemy drones in the Zaporizhzhia direction	An officer of the press service of the 128th separate mountain-assault division told about this on Army TV Major Yaroslav Halas of the Transcarpathian Brigade. -For the first time, our team encountered the fact that the Russians used FPV drones with a fiber optic cable 10 km long in the Zaporizhzhya region. In practice, we encountered them for the first time,- said Yaroslav Halas. According to him, the use of such a drone was conditionally successful for the enemy, he managed to damage the shelter. But our fighters did not leave their positions. -These drones are completely invulnerable to EW devices, as soon as our guys saw them, they tried to shoot them down with small arms. Anti-aircraft guns are effective against them. A big disadvantage of these drones is the limited range of use. Also, they are ineffective for dense urban development or dense plantings,- the spokesman said. He also said that today the enemy aviation was active with anti-aircraft missiles, unguided air missiles. There were no assaults on our positions, although they occur regularly. The defense is being probed, the Russians are looking for our weak points. -We know from intelligence reports that the enemy is gathering forces and the Russians may try to break through our defenses, but there are no prerequisites to believe that these attempts will be successful,- Yaroslav Halas added.

She emphasized that the Russians cannot gain a foothold behind the canal there, they are quickly destroyed, and logistical routes are cut off. -The channel is under the cover of our drones and our artillery, so the enemy cannot storm it with equipment, as for this it is necessary to set up crossings, which is impossible,- explained the spokeswoman of the Luhansk OTU. Anastasia Bobovnikova also reported that the number of assaults has slightly decreased in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Luhansk- OTU, but the number of shelling from artillery and aviation has not decreased, even increased. -They understand that they cannot storm head-on in this direction, so they are trying to completely wipe out the surrounding cities. The aviation of the Russian Federation carries out 15 to 20 strikes every day, dropping at least 20 anti-aircraft missiles,- the spokeswoman added.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/otu-lugansk-okupanty-ne-zakripylysya-za-kanalom-u-chasovomu-yaru/	2024-10-29T12:09:13-07:00

Their discussion focused on the importance of a close strategic partnership between NATO and the European Union.

More than 130 enemy assaults per day: Russia is concentrating its efforts in two directions	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In addition, the occupiers are actively attacking in the Kupyan, Lyman and Vremiv directions. The terrorist state carried out 70 airstrikes, dropping 119 anti-aircraft missiles. The invaders also used 685 kamikaze drones for strikes and fired about 3,800 shots at the positions of our troops and populated areas. In the Kharkiv direction, Russian terrorists stormed the positions of our units in the Vovchansk region four times. Thirteen times the enemy attacked our positions on the Kupyansk direction. Near the settlements of Kolisnikivka, Sinkivka, Kruglyakivka, Pershotravnevo and Lozova, units of the Defense Forces repelled all enemy attacks. In the Lyman direction Russian troops attacked Ukrainian defenders 15 times in Grekivka, Zarichny, Terni and Torsky districts. In the Kramatorsk direction Ukrainian soldiers repelled two attempts by the invaders to advance in the Chasovoy Yar and Stupochky areas. In the Toretsk direction our troops repelled one enemy attack. In the Pokrovsky direction the aggressor attacked our positions 31 times. In the districts of Myrolyubivka, Promeny, Lysivka, Krutoy Yar, Selydovoy and Vyshnevoy, our defenders repelled all the assaults of the occupation forces. According to the available information, the losses of the occupiers in the direction are 151 people killed and wounded, two mortars, an armored fighting vehicle, a tank , a UAV control post and a car, a tank, three mortars and an armored combat vehicle were also damaged. The hottest in the Kurakhiv direction, where the invaders made 48 attempts to advance at this time of the day . The main battles are taking place near Zoryanyi, Maksimilianivka, Novodmytrivka, Katerynivka, and Antonivka. In the Vremivsk direction, the aggressor, with the support of aviation, stormed the front edge of our defense 12 times in the area of ​​Bogoyavlenka and Novoukrainka. In the Dnieper direction the enemy made two unsuccessful attempts to storm the positions of Ukrainian units. The Defense Forces of Ukraine continue the operation in the Kursk direction. Enemy aviation today carried out 28 airstrikes on Kurshchyna with the use of 39 anti-aircraft missiles. The department honored the soldiers of the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade named after Kostya Gordienko, the 38th separate marine brigade and the 425th separate assault battalion. As reported by ArmyInform, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces General Oleksandr Syrsky visited military units and units participating in the defense operation in the Zaporizhzhia region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/ponad-130-vorozhyh-shturmiv-za-dobu-rosiya-zoseredzhuye-zusyllya-na-dvoh-napryamkah/	2024-10-28T22:16:18-07:00
Microwave frying drones: the latest solution for the electronic fight against swarms of UAVs was pre...	In the official release of the developer of this high-tech equipment, the Californian company Epirus stated that the ExDECS system was designed with the Marine Corps' requirements in mind to combat the rapidly growing UAV threat . In particular, the designers of the device took into account the experience of using drones during the Russian-Ukrainian war, ArmiyaInform reports. ExDECS is the latest version of the Leonidas weapon system created by Epirus, which ArmiyaInform told in one of his previous publications. Epirus has released details of a profile contract in which it is partnering with the Office of Naval Research, the Joint Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Countermeasures Division and the US Marine Corps Warfare Laboratory to support expeditionary forward base operations and counter-unmanned systems missions for a total of 5 .5 million dollars. The program will include initial integration with the US Marine Corps' Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S), as well as field experiments and multi-platform testing in expeditionary scenarios to improve USMC (US Marine Corps) land-based air defense capabilities. Epirus has developed ExDECS, a solid-state, software-defined, long-pulse HPM system to support the US Marine Corps Expeditionary Force (EABO) and counter-unmanned systems missions. The system is designed to be compact and easy to maneuver. This makes ExDECS suitable for any expeditionary force mission. -As drone warfare dominates the daily headlines, we are proud to bring ExDECS to life and work with the Marine Corps to develop expeditionary HPM capabilities,- said Andy Lowery, Chief Executive Officer of Epirus. -We are committed to accelerating the delivery of operational HPM capabilities for cUAS across the joint force.- Leonidas Expeditionary, or ExDECS, is the latest addition to the Leonidas HPM product suite and uses Epirus' revolutionary approach to HPM, which significantly reduces system size and weight and provides greater operator control. The modular and scalable system is designed to be installed on a Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) trailer and complements the low-altitude air defense system during expeditionary operations. Authors of the popular magazine Forbes talked with the creators of the latest radio electronic weapons. As the head of the manufacturing company reported, previously the best solution against drones was considered to be radio electronic warfare (EW), but now radio electronic suppression is at best partially effective. According to him, many soldiers in Ukraine carry shotguns to protect themselves from FPV drones, but even the best shooters will have a hard time defending themselves against the simultaneous attack of more than fifty UAVs. The ExDECS system was created just for such cases. ExDECS is reportedly able to destroy both individual drones and large swarms of drones. These weapons have some similarities to laser devices, however, the laser focuses its energy on a small point, while the microwave weapon can emit a wide field of energy that disables all electronics inside the drones. The manufacturer calls economic efficiency the main advantage of ExDECS. One shot costs just five US cents (about UAH 2). As noted in the publication, the previous model of the Epirus energy weapon was -tiny- compared to a similar device of competitors. Thanks to compact solid-state electronics, the ExDECS system has been made even smaller. This is important because Marines need a lightweight rig that can be towed behind standard vehicles for maximum mobility. -The solid-state, software-controlled, long-pulse high-power microwave setup we're doing at Epirus has demonstrated effectiveness against a spectrum of electronic threats, including targets beyond drones. In theory, anything that has an electron pulse would be vulnerable to the Epirus HPM,- states Andy Lowery. As part of the contract, Epirus will deliver a ready-made ExDECS HPM system to the Marine Corps Combat Operations Laboratory by the end of 2024. Microwave weapon of Leonidas.

Consequences of the attack on Kyiv: depressurization of a gas pipe and victims	notifies the head of the KMVA Serhii Popko. The air alert was announced twice during the night in Kyiv and lasted more than 4 hours in total. Drones attacked the capital from different directions, but the air defense forces detected and neutralized the enemy drones in time. As a result of falling debris, damage was recorded in the Solomyanskyi and Sviatoshynskyi districts. In the Solomyansk district, a gas pipe depressurized near a 9-story residential building, which led to the occupation of a store and three parked cars. The fire was extinguished. Five people were injured, one of them was hospitalized with a serious leg injury. In Sviatoshyn district, debris broke windows in a three-story administrative building, but there were no casualties.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/naslidky-ataky-po-kyyevu-rozgermetyzacziya-gazovoyi-truby-ta-postrazhdali/	2024-10-28T22:02:10-07:00
Hunting for mopeds: what foreign weapons are used to destroy the enemy - Shaheds -	-the Russians managed to increase the so-called Shahed assembly production.- Because the enemy, apart from the hull itself, cannot produce anything, not even engines. The rest of the parts are bought on world markets. Indeed, cold weather and winter are ahead. the Rashists are driven by their maniacal philosophy and really believe that our power system should be destroyed. Their targets are not only critical infrastructure facilities of TPPs and HPPs. Moreover, in my opinion, the Rashists want to destroy the distribution devices of nuclear power plants and transmission substations, which are critical for the safe operation of nuclear energy in Ukraine. Ukrainian air defense systems demonstrate simply impressive performance indicators in shooting down Russian Kh-101, Kh-555, Kalibr and other missiles. The churn rate varies up to about 95 percent. Therefore, the enemy resorted to the mass use of Shaheds and wants to exhaust our air defense system. Although, in my opinion, this is not quite the correct assessment on their part. Now -Shakhed-, first of all, are shot down not by anti-aircraft missiles of various classes, but by appropriate weapons, for example, barrel artillery. Australian Slinger anti-drone combat modules are effective means of defeating enemy Shaheds. The complex is based on the 30-mm M230LF cannon and the 7.62-mm MAG58 machine gun and is installed on a regular pickup truck. The system is equipped with thermal imaging and night sights. The range of detection of aerial targets by the optical-electronic system is 12 km using the day channel, and 13.7 km using the night channel. Another effective answer to the question of how to cheaply shoot down the Russian Shaheds. Our defenders are armed with the British short-range MSI-DS Terrahawk Paladin system. Consists of a remote-controlled Mk44 Busmaster II 30mm gun, equipped with a dual-feed system that allows the use of two different types of ammunition, including programmed detonation. The Terrahawk is capable of destroying targets at a range of up to 2 km. The complex's radar allows for 360-degree surveillance of targets. Recently, the enemy began to use cheap decoy drones during attacks on Ukraine. These drones fly without a warhead. This is done in order to identify the positions of the Ukrainian air defense and, once again, exhaust our air defense assets. the Russians for some reason believe that we will spend expensive anti-aircraft missiles on them, such as the Patriot air defense missile, costing up to 3 million dollars. The Defense Forces of Ukraine have learned how to shoot down Shaheds even from helicopters. Conventional Kalashnikov machine guns, other large-caliber machine guns of foreign models and small arms are used. Means of radar and visual calculation of aerial enemy objects appeared. And most importantly, they learned, in combat work, so to speak, to set the aiming point correctly. Plus, let's not forget about the Stinger portable anti-aircraft missile complex. The Americans resumed their production. There are cases when 50 out of 50 -Shaheeds- are lost. That is, the destruction rate is 90-98%. Consequently, their effectiveness turned out to be shockingly low. But what does the adversary think? Even if one missile of a certain class hit the target or even if one -Shaheed- reached its goal, then, according to the Rashists, the terror must continue. In my opinion, this (Russian air attacks on critical infrastructure facilities and residential buildings of Ukraine - ed.) will be permanent. The production of air weapons will not stop, and Russia's big missile-drone attack on us is only a matter of time.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/polyuvannya-na-mopedy-yakoyu-inozemnoyu-zbroyeyu-znyshhuyut-vorozhi-shahedy/	2024-10-28T21:57:18-07:00
A million people, Soviet equipment and nuclear weapons: what makes up the North Korean army	Meanwhile, Russia has ratified a de facto military alliance with North Korea. In this regard, it becomes quite logical to ask the question: how many troops and what kind of weapons does the North Korean Juche regime have? The Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of the DPRK and Chairman of the Central Military Commission is President Kim Jong Un, who heads the five branches of the Korean People's Army (KPA): Ground Forces, Navy, Air Force and Air Defense Forces, Strategic Missile Forces, and Special Operations Forces . Despite the fact that North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world, its military spending is slightly less than a quarter of its GDP, which ranks first in the world in terms of military spending. In 2019, it was estimated at about $3.6 billion per year. The Korean People's Army is the world's fourth largest conventional force, with about 5% of the population serving. This is about 1.3 million military personnel and another 600,000 reserve soldiers. KPA ground forces are deployed in three echelons: — Forward operational echelon: 4 infantry corps. — Second operational echelon: 2 mechanized corps, 1 armored corps, 1 artillery corps. — Strategic reserve: 2 mechanized corps, 1 artillery corps. As the DPRK's military policy prioritizes military spending over economic development, this has increased the KNA's role in everyday life, including greater involvement in social and economic decision-making. Servicemen spend most of their military service participating in various spheres of the country's socio-economic life. Men must serve in the army for 10 years and women for 8 years. Despite the fact that the main parts of the army are infantry, it has about 4,000 armored personnel carriers. The army has a significant number of well-equipped mechanized units. These mobile forces have armored personnel carriers of Soviet, Chinese and domestic production. North Korea has about 3,500 medium and light tanks, including about 2,000 T-54/55 main battle tanks and about 175 Chinese Type 59 tanks (an upgraded version of the T-54). Since the late 1970s, North Korea has produced approximately 600 T-62 tanks, the main battle tank of the Soviet Army in the 1960s. North Korea has also supplied light tanks, including the locally produced M-1985, the Soviet R-76, and Chinese variants of the Type 62 and 63. North Korea continues to rely on a large number of artillery systems to support ground operations. The North Korean Air Force's potential vulnerability contributes to its reliance on field artillery as its primary means of warfare. Thus, Pyongyang has deployed about 8,400 artillery pieces and more than 2,000 rocket launchers. North Korea has at least 3,000 towed and 5,400 self-propelled guns and howitzers. A photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency on March 7, 2017 shows the launch of four ballistic missiles by the Korean People's Army during a military exercise at an undisclosed location in North Korea. North Korea says its nuclear arsenal and ballistic missiles are necessary to counter threats from on the part of the United States and its allies who fought against North Korea during the Korean War of 1950-1953. Pyongyang also often touts the weapon as an item of national prestige and a proof of the country's power. According to the American Arms Control Association, North Korea has the ability to deliver nuclear weapons using a variety of land-based missile systems, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with a range capable of hitting the continental United States. But critics, including in Washington and Seoul, say the weapons destabilize the situation, pose a threat to North Korea's neighbors and divert resources from the country's poor citizens. State media have shown photos of various types of warheads, but North Korea has never disclosed the number of weapons it possesses, and analysts and foreign intelligence agencies have only rough estimates. A July report by the Federation of American Scientists concluded that the country may have produced enough fissile material to build up to 90 nuclear warheads, but that about 50 are likely to have been assembled. Lee Sang-kyu, a nuclear engineering expert at South Korea's Korea Institute for Defense Analysis, said , that North Korea is estimated to have 80-90 nuclear warheads made of uranium and plutonium, and that number is expected to increase to 166 by 2030. North Korea has facilities scattered throughout the country that support its nuclear program, including mines where raw uranium is collected, enrichment facilities and nuclear reactors to convert uranium and plutonium into bomb fuel, as well as weapons assembly plants. The North Korean Air Force is the second-largest branch of the Korean People's Army, with more than 100,000 servicemen. In 2022, the name was changed to the Korean People's Army Air and Anti-Aircraft Forces (KPAAF). Historically, the North Korean Air Force had a fairly large fleet of various equipment. With the support of China and the Soviet Union, the KPAAF was one of the first to introduce jet aircraft into its combat fleet. North Korea also sent forces overseas during the Vietnam War. After the end of the Cold War, the KPAAF was left with aircraft and combat equipment that were decades old. With ongoing sanctions over the past decades, North Korea has been unable to purchase newer aircraft. In addition, the sanctions affected the existing supply of aircraft, including spare parts, maintenance and even aviation fuel. Several different reports indicating the current state of affairs in the KPAAF indicate that it has an active fleet of between 500 and 900 combat aircraft. They still operate the outdated MiG-17, MiG-19, MiG-21 and MiG-23 fighters, but use the more modern and quite powerful MiG-29 fighters. Analysts have also long speculated whether Korea is fielding the MiG-25, but there is no evidence yet as to whether they are fielding the MiG-25. The KPAF's most numerous fighter is the MiG-21, which is effectively obsolete. North Korea's special operations forces, one of the largest in the world, are organized into 22 brigades and 7 separate battalions. These forces have five main tasks: conducting reconnaissance, conducting combat operations alongside conventional operations, creating a second front behind the enemy's rear, countering the South's special operations in the rear areas of North Korea, and maintaining internal security. The Ministry of People's Armed Forces has two main commands that oversee special operations units, the Intelligence Bureau and the Light Infantry Training Bureau. North Korea classifies its special operations units as reconnaissance, light infantry and snipers. Command-sized units conduct reconnaissance to gather intelligence or information about targets. Light infantry operations are combat operations conducted by units up to the size of a company or battalion against military, political, or economic objectives. Sniper operations are basically the same as light infantry, except that they are carried out in groups. The North Korean Air Force supports special operations missions through aerial infiltration and resupply operations. The North Korean Navy provides amphibious operations and resupply. The main ship for amphibious operations is the landing craft NAMPO. Small submarines and semi-submersible landing craft also support most missions. North Korea's special operations forces conduct operations at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Basically, strategic operations support national or departmental objectives, operational operations support corps objectives, and tactical operations support division and brigade maneuvers. North Korea's 60,000-strong navy is primarily a coastal defense force. Most of the naval vessels are small patrol vessels that cannot operate more than 50 nautical miles from the coast, but are capable of guarding North Korea's territorial waters. North Korea's naval forces are geographically divided into East and West Coast fleets, which do not exchange ships. The country has neither aircraft carriers nor destroyers. The Navy's most powerful force is 39 patrol boats with guided missiles. The Navy also has 12 Soviet SOJU-class patrol boats. Other ships, such as the Soviet guided missile patrol boat KOMAR and its North Korean derivative SOHUNG, are smaller in size. North Korea's attack submarine inventory includes 4 Soviet WHISKEY-class submarines, 4 Chinese ROMEO-class submarines, and 16 North Korean ROMEO-class submarines. Therefore, the full involvement of North Korea in the war as one of the main suppliers for Russia may not have a decisive impact, but it still remains dangerous and provides an additional resource for the Russian army. Although the indiscriminate and imprecise weapons typically relied upon by less technically advanced armies are not highly accurate, they are still destructive and dangerous.

Assault of the Russians, a drone with a thermobar and combat cats: a day at the position of the 79th...	The paratroopers have been holding back the enemy's advance in the East for more than two years and preventing the Russians from advancing in the Kurakhiv direction. We fly into the broken village and quickly pass several turns. You can't linger — the enemy is just a few kilometers away in a nearby settlement. There is constant shelling and circling enemy drones. Currently, only our soldiers and their war cats remain in this village. Correspondents of ArmiyaInform spent the day with the Taurian paratroopers and saw with their own eyes how they repelled the Russian assault. Three cats — the first ones you meet at the entrance to the dark basement. Under the wall are their food bowls and the weapons of our fighters. There are nine cats in total. — They reach out to people, nobody lives around here anymore, — say the guys. In the basement there is a control and observation point (KSP) of a company of one of the battalions. Here, near the huge monitor, there is round-the-clock duty, the situation around our positions is monitored from the stream in online mode, and the battle is managed in cooperation with other units in the event of enemy assaults. — U enemy tactics are not uniform. For example, one or two armored groups enter from one direction, and from the other — -motorcycle troops- on motorcycles, buggies, -loaves-, — explains paratrooper -Doc-, who is watching the situation on the monitor. This is a common suicidal tactic of the Russians, because even if these -motorcyclists- reach our positions, they are immediately destroyed. -Dok- is from Volnovakha, has considerable combat experience, and served in the 79th brigade even before the beginning of the large-scale invasion. He says that after the loss of Ugledar, the situation in their direction became more complicated. — They are trying to trap us, — he summarizes briefly. — The funniest thing has started recently, — a platoon leader with the call sign -Vinny- joins the conversation. He comes from the Lviv region and has been in the brigade for over a year. He wanted to join the Armed Forces when he was not yet 25 years old, which is why he was rejected by the TCC: — But I pushed them, — he recalls with a smile. The enemy tries to attack at different times of the day, regardless of the weather, and often even without the support of their own drones. — They probe us as much as we probe them. They can leave three units of equipment for each of our battalions, carry out combat reconnaissance, check where there are mine barriers, how the ATGM works. And they retreat, and after two or three days they chase a large column, — explains the officer. -Vinny- recalls the battles in Novomykhailivka, where our the paratroopers were opposed by the 155th brigade of the Russian marines, which during the large-scale invasion rozstrilyanyh-pobratymiv/->committed numerous war crimes: — They then had the task of storming the center of Novomykhailivka. Then they went on rotation. If compared to them, children are now fighting against us. Literally immediately after these words, the duty officer notices the movement of enemy vehicles on the monitor: -They are coming!- On the stream we see three units of armored vehicles, which rush through the open area along the landing. The enemy is covered by smoke screens to make it harder for UAV operators to track them. In a few minutes, three more -boxes- appear. All units are included in the work — drones track targets, commanders adjust and transmit instructions to artillery, report the situation to the soldiers in the front positions. We hear the -outputs- of our guns, again and again. In a few seconds, on the screen we see a hit on an infantry fighting vehicle, before that another enemy -beha- is blown up by a mine. One still manages to break through close to our positions and land the infantry. Almost immediately after that, the BMP is destroyed, in about half an hour it was possible to find the mech driver — he is seriously wounded and is trying to hide in the ruins. Our drones end his suffering with a well-timed reset. -The bastards are hiding in the house, let's hit them with a thermal bar-, — we hear the drone operators talking, who are preparing to defeat the enemy. Two more Russians reach the position of our paratroopers in a row, -Dok- immediately reports this to the -point-: several automatic rounds — and 3-4 grenades destroy the invaders. Further, the sweep takes place, and the enemy assault is repulsed, the paratroopers held their positions. In total, up to 15 occupiers were eliminated and several units of armored vehicles were knocked out. At KSP, everyone exhales from the tension, smokes a cigarette and talks about the 18-year-old Javelin operator, who during several assaults destroyed a dozen and a half units of equipment. In one of the battles, he managed to destroy three tanks. Today, he also has damaged equipment. Doc recalls that at the beginning of the large-scale invasion, there was a constant flow of volunteers to the brigade. — Motivating people now requires a comprehensive approach. Both rotations and recovery time, increased payouts for attack aircraft are at zero. And certain social guarantees for soldiers already after the end of their service, so that they have some certainty in their future, — he ponders. -Vinny- tells , who has already twice completed officer courses — for platoon commander and company commander. — We can guarantee a quick growth spurt. There are opportunities for sergeants — three-month officer courses, — says a serviceman. Guys immediately favorably respond to the recent span>decision to allow military units to mobilize people directly, bypassing TCC and SP. They only regret that this did not happen earlier. — Although in reality not all TCCs are as bad as they are reported to be. I would also like to have longer recovery times. People have been in positions for one and a half to two years. They get tired, they burn out, but they have to keep working because there's just no one to replace them, — emphasizes -Vinny.- The officer explains the simple math: the more personnel arrive, the more there is a reserve, so people have the opportunity to rest more between combat missions. — For example, there are 10 people in positions, 10 are resting and another 10 are in reserve. Then I can guarantee vacations for everyone, people are interchangeable, — adds the platoon commander. We are talking separately about the training of new recruits in training centers. Recently, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces General Oleksandr Syrskyi stated the need to increase the period of basic military training and improve training programs. Paratroopers emphasize the need to review and update the training plans for the mobilized in order to they met the requirements of modern warfare as much as possible. After all, combat brigades simply do not have time to train or retrain new arrivals. At the same time, everyone notes positive changes in the training of the sergeant corps. In this unit, sergeants are mainly paratroopers with extensive combat experience who can perfectly train new arrivals. — Here is one of our sergeants, who traveled from our battalion to teach people at the training center. Now he can safely be left on duty at the KSP, — says -Vinny-. Of course, the topic of mobilization and its coverage in mass media and social networks. -And outside the window&#8230; almost Desna,- — hums -Winnie,- laughs, and asks if I've seen the meme that emerged after the TCC and the police checked the documents of visitors to the -Ocean Elsa- concert in Kyiv. — Why swim across the Tisza? Come here, change people for me, and you will also earn in a year. I have a fighter who has five children, he is 50 years old, he voluntarily mobilized, he did not hide from them. He recently received an injury, but he is already writing to me to talk to the commander and while I have at least taken him on paper work, he wants to help the boys, - says the officer. Military personnel believe that the mass media should talk more about the need for mobilization, about the need to change people who are fighting at the front for the third year. — If there are more of us, we we will be able to fight back faster and return home faster. In the same way, if there are more of us, we will be able to go home from time to time, — the paratroopers say, adding that they are sorry to read on social networks about war fatigue among civilians. span> — We have a boy who was crushed in Marinka, he was injured for a day. After the injury, he still decided to stay with us. Yes, now he no longer participates in assaults, but deals with documents. Another boy was drafted — his religion forbids him to pick up a weapon, and he is an Haitian. But they found him a job, he works at the rear point. There are many positions in the army, except for stormtroopers, people are needed everywhere, — they tell in the unit. Currently, the 79th brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is actively conducting a recruiting campaign, volunteers are recruited every month sign contracts for military service. Everyone can choose a suitable specialty and defend the Motherland. And the fighting cats will be released here.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/shturm-rosiyan-dron-z-termobarom-i-bojovi-koty-den-na-pozycziyi-79-brygady-dshv-zsu-yaka-trymaye-kurahivskyj-napryamok/	2024-10-28T21:29:22-07:00
The Russian Federation is spreading a fake about renaming a street in Kyiv in honor of the NATO Secr...	This -news- uses as confirmation the fake -order- on renaming No. 267, supposedly issued by the Kyiv Regional Military Administration. The first thing that catches your eye is &#8211; the decision to rename a street in Kyiv was apparently made by the Kyiv regional government. This is not possible, because the capital of Ukraine is a separate administrative-territorial unit and is in no way subordinate to the regional government. Also, the authors of the fake -document- made grammatical errors that are already traditional for this kind of forgery, which are not characteristic of speakers of the Ukrainian language. For example, fakers use the phrase -help withholding-. If you translate it into Russian, you will get -help content-. Instead, the -document- meant -receiving help-, which in Ukrainian would be written as -receiving help-. In addition, Kyivans know that the Kyiv City Council at the beginning of 2024 had already renamed part of Heroiv Sevastopol Street to honor of Ukrainian surgeon Oleksandr Shalimov. The local authorities did not make any other decisions regarding this street. Decolonization of toponymy is one of the most painful processes for enemies inside Ukraine. After all, Russia uses its own imperial heritage to preserve, restore and strengthen the imperial influence on our country. The common names of streets and settlements, monuments, and the same traditions are for her an argument in favor of the thesis that underlies the current aggression: -Ukrainians are one people with Russians.- If there is one people, then the Ukrainian state is a mistake, or an unnecessary and harmful invention, either by the Austrian General Staff, Lenin, or NATO. That is why propagandists from time to time try to at least somehow suppress this process.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/29/rf-poshyryuye-fejk-pro-perejmenuvannya-vulyczi-kyyeva-na-chest-genseka-nato/	2024-10-28T21:17:42-07:00

This process affected many areas, including the IT sector of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which includes the Center for Geospatial Data and the Center for Scaling Technological Solutions. The importance of IT solutions in today's high-tech warfare is undeniable, so there has been an improvement in the organizational and staffing structure of the Center for Scaling Technology Solutions.

The Center for Scaling Technology Solutions has been given time to reform until the end of the year. At the same time, the Armed Forces continue to actively and effectively support technological innovations and the IT sector, and accusations about the destruction of the IT sphere in the Ukrainian army are false.

Let's see everyone - individual and collective destruction of enemy attack aircraft by drops	The video of combat work appeared on October 28 on the brigade's channel. The occupiers were destroyed with mortars in the trenches, on the way to the positions, in the open area and among the bushes. -Our fighters without regret or remorse do what every Ukrainian likes so much - they destroy the occupiers in packs. Horde people, as if blind, go to their death, and we, as hospitable people, meet them and give explosive emotions. The work on waste disposal on our land continues,- the team commented on the video. &nbsp; As reported by ArmyInform, aerial reconnaissance units of the -Lyut- brigade helped to destroy two Russian high-powered 2S7 -Pion- self-propelled guns at once. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/28/pobachymo-kozhnogo-indyvidualne-ta-kolektyvne-znyshhennya-skydamy-vorozhyh-shturmovykiv/	2024-10-28T07:09:00-07:00

The government has approved a plan to combat corruption in the MSEK system: what will change	About this informed the Ministry of Health. The MSEK system consists of institutions of the central and regional level. The Ministry of Health forms only the Central MSEK, which performs organizational and methodical functions. The regional vertical includes 328 MSEK, including 25 regional bureaus and more than 300 central-city and interdistrict commissions. The activities of MSEK regional bureaus are managed by a manager who is appointed and dismissed by the founder — the regional council. The government adopted amendments to the Regulation on medical and social expertise, which allow the Ministry of Health to impose the rights and obligations of the Central MSEK on an enterprise, institution or organization that belongs to the sphere of management of the Ministry of Health and has a license to carry out economic activities in the field of medical practice. This allows you to optimize the process at the central level as quickly as possible. According to the decision of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, the performance of the functions of the Central MSEC, in particular, regarding the consideration of appeals and the verification of the validity of decisions made by the regional level MSEC, has been completely transferred to the Ukrainian State Research Institute of Medical and Social Disability Problems of the Ministry of Health in the city of Dnipro. Here, during 2024, the Ministry of Health created the necessary material and technical base, which should significantly simplify the process of passing an examination for people. The reform plan also provides: The algorithm for appealing decisions of the MSEC has not changed at the moment. If your case was sent for appeal to the Central MSEC, it will be forwarded to the Ukrainian State Research Institute of Medical and Social Disability Problems of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine in the city of Dnipro. You will be contacted regarding the review and further actions, the order of consideration will be preserved. As reported by ArmyInform, recently a meeting of the NSDC took place regarding numerous facts of violations of the CSEC and false disabilities for officials. There are numerous facts of unjustified disabilities among customs officials, prosecutors, tax officials, in the Pension Fund system, and in local administrations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/28/uryad-zatverdyv-plan-shhodo-protydiyi-korupcziyi-v-systemi-msek-shho-zminytsya/	2024-10-28T06:53:00-07:00
The wave of public dissatisfaction with fortifications was extinguished: the materials are still use...	With the experience of how, in the winter and early spring of 2024, the communicators of the -Tavria- OSU managed to cover the construction of fortifications in the East in such a way as to calm society and at the same time not harm the security of the military, in an interview ArmyInform shared the spokesman Captain Dmytro Lykhovii of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: — In the Tavria air defense system, we organized active coverage of the construction of fortifications in our area of ​​responsibility, near Avdiivka. It was shown that construction is provided by engineering units, relevant companies of mechanized brigades, emergency services, regional administrations, etc. They showed new defense lines, concrete freshly built dugouts, trenches, trenches with overlaps, built according to the requirements of the infantry, which take into account the modern challenges of combat and the operational environment. Photos and videos were taken, I recorded a lot of stand-ups from the trenches and bunkers, and we made all these files freely available to all willing TV viewers. Those materials are used to this day, if there is a need to illustrate one or another thematic plot. Thanks to the fact that we showed and explained all this, the wave of -popular discontent- about the fortifications was then extinguished. After all, fortifications were actually built, in large numbers, and the fortifications are not bad. I believe that this was an exemplary case of responding to a crisis call that arose in the information field in February-March. Again, effective -communication of solved problems-. Once again, I thank the excellent team from the public relations department of the -Tavria- OSU, whose area of ​​responsibility included the Avdiyiv direction. More about the work of the military spokesperson and what should be the main message of military communicators to Ukrainian society, read in the interview of Captain Dmytro Lyhovij in ArmiyaInform.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/28/hvylyu-narodnogo-nevdovolennya-shhodo-fortyfikaczij-vdalosya-prygasyty-materialamy-korystuyutsya-do-sogodni/	2024-10-28T06:41:11-07:00

There are many examples of how they behaved, shooting and torturing our prisoners, destroying them. There is nothing surprising about that, he said.

In this way, they try to motivate their soldiers so that they do not surrender. They create such a picture that it is the -Ukrobander- troops who do not take prisoners, torture and destroy them. Therefore, they also give such orders to their own, so that they do not take us captive, - explained the spokesman. Psychologically processed by propaganda scarecrows, Russian soldiers are wild with fear and obey the criminal orders of their commanders, committing war crimes.

This is what he announced at a special briefing in Brussels. -Today I can confirm that North Korean troops have been sent to Russia and North Korean army units are deployed in the Kursk region,- Mark Rutte said. Mark Rutte said that this morning the delegation of South Korea informed NATO, as well as Japan, Australia and New Zealand, that their services are aware of the presence of the North Korean military in Russia and their involvement in the war against Ukraine. -This is a significant escalation in the ongoing involvement of the DPRK in Russia's illegal war. This is another violation of the UN Security Council Resolution. And this is a dangerous expansion of the war. NATO calls on Russia and the DPRK to immediately stop these actions,- Mark Rutte said. The Secretary General of NATO emphasized that the deepening of military cooperation between Russia and the DPRK is a threat to both Pacific and Euro-Atlantic security. -This undermines peace on the Korean Peninsula and fuels Russia's war against Ukraine.

Mark Rutte added that in response, Putin provided North Korea with military technology to circumvent international sanctions. -But the involvement of the North Korean military in Kurshchyna is a sign of Putin's growing desperation.

Unfortunately, if tens of thousands were stolen, we returned less than a thousand,- the President said. As Volodymyr Zelenskyi said, a coalition of states has been created to facilitate the return of children to their families. Now there are four dozen countries in the coalition, and it is very important that large countries join it. -Unfortunately, very few countries have been able to return our children. As I told you, this is a small number compared to the number of children who were abducted. If 20,000 Ukrainian children are deported, each leader must take responsibility and return 1,000 children.

Bomber Zmiiny, survived a missile hit and a collision with a stork, got into the cinema - the story ...	About the pilot told on October 28 t.v.o. head of the communications department of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Yuriy Ignat. Viktor is one of those who bombed the enemy on Zmiino. Then the Ukrainian bombers filigreely placed five hundred kilogram bombs directly -in the apple-, leaving no chance for the enemy. One of these sorties could be the last for Victor and his brother. -We had to eject. They flew in a group of planes, worked well with high-explosive aerial bombs... U-turn, and to the operational airfield. They shout to us from the ground: -Rockets, they are working for you...-. We did everything we could to save the car, until the last, as they say, we tried to escape from them. But the chances melted away. Closer to the coast - they felt a blow, but continued to pull the board to land. After crossing the coastline in Odesa, we completely lost control. There is only one way out - a catapult! The Su-24 is designed in such a way that after firing the lantern, the navigator's catapult pyro cartridge is activated first, and the pilot's after one and a half seconds. And, believe me, sometimes those one and a half seconds are worth life... That time my commander survived, is serving, but was unable to return to flying work. Any catapulting is a trauma for the body, to a lesser or greater extent, it's a matter of luck. After rehabilitation, I returned to combat work again,- Viktor said. Its commander, Colonel Yevhen Bulatsyk, said that a feature film is currently being shot abroad, the main episode of which is the combat work of the pilots to liberate Zmiiny Island. And Viktor sometimes has to fly on two-seater L-39 training and combat aircraft. This can be a task of maintaining flying skills, i.e. recovery after a break, or other special tasks where the use of this type of aircraft will be sufficient. Viktor flew out with his brother on one of these missions. Looking ahead, I will say that this case is unique in the history of aviation and probably has no analogues in world practice! The task was completed. Returning to the base, the pilots got into a rather unpleasant situation - the cockpit of the plane was rammed by... a stork. The cabin light was thrown away, but only the first catapult worked. Viktor's seat remained in place... He instantly took control of the plane, got out of the dangerous pique and continued the flight without a cockpit light and, as it turned out later... without his brother, he did not survive... The flying profession is not only romantic, but also dangerous, every detail is important. The main thing is not to lose concentration at a critical moment. In this difficult situation, the experienced pilot-navigator showed steel endurance and landed the plane at the nearest airfield. It is difficult not only in heaven, but also on earth. The dawn in Starokostyantynov for the third full-scale year already usually takes place to the accompaniment of a siren... The war made the city quite a well-known district center.

- We are signing up to work on the enemy Storm Shadow - Ukrainian Su-24M pilot	On October 28, Vol. Acting head of the communications department of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Yuriy Ignat. Su-24M pilot Victor leisurely enjoyed his coffee with his cigarette. He says he does it traditionally, before he gets on the plane. Now the aviators are focused on the use of Western high-precision weapons. There are serious strategic tasks at hand. It would seem that everything is simple. Pilots must clearly go to the launch line of Storm Shadow/Scalp cruise missiles, press the launch button, sit down at one of the operational airfields and ... wait for objective control - confirmation of the destruction of the enemy object. Everything is simple only at first glance. In fact, these are complex operations that involve a large number of specialists from various fields. Strike planning, missile programming, reconnaissance - everything requires the most accurate mathematical calculations, otherwise - there will be no result. And Storm Shadow or Scalp should hit the target! And full stop. We don't have many of those missiles. -We sign up in line to let in the -winged ones-. And why are you surprised, it is. Everyone wants to complete this honorable mission. There are crews, there are planes, but Western missiles are not enough... The guys are very motivated and purposeful, that's why it's the turn! When it is necessary to go to combat, we do not have questions: -Why should I...- We are told: -Can I...-, Viktor said. In the first months of the war, there were no Western weapons yet, so the pilots struck with short-range air missiles and free-falling air bombs. At the beginning of the war, our pilots did not have any -red lines-, they broke through the enemy's anti-aircraft defense and in one sortie sent to hell hundreds of occupiers, tens of units of armored vehicles, which pearled on Kyiv in columns. Yes, it was a one-way ticket for many, but the bombers made an incredible contribution to the victory. Needless to say, in the first weeks of the full-scale operation, the pilots successfully flew near Bryansk more than once, destroyed the enemy's offensive pace on its territory, and destroyed logistics. In many directions, these were bold, daring operations of the Air Force aviation, in which Victor also took part. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukrainian missiles destroyed key command points of the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/28/my-zapysuyemos-v-chergu-shhob-vidpraczyuvaty-po-vorogu-storm-shadow-pilot-ukrayinskogo-su-24m/	2024-10-28T01:04:23-07:00

From the sky to the ground: air-to-ground missiles were used in a special anti-tank vehicle	How inform experts of the defense portal Army Recognition, Wolfram is an anti-tank complex that combines a special purpose vehicle Supacat HMT 6×6, equipped with a Brimstone missile launch module, ArmyInform reports. The main idea of ​​Wolfram is to install a launch platform with eight Brimstone missiles on an HMT vehicle, which will provide a mobile strike capability against ground targets. The Brimstone missile, which was originally an air-to-surface warhead used by ground attack aircraft, was adapted for surface-to-surface missions, in particular, to counter enemy armor. About the similar use of these winged fired by the Defense Forces of Ukraine in ground operations, our editorial office has already repeatedly told in her materials. However, it is worth recalling that the Brimstone warhead is an air-to-surface and surface-to-surface missile developed by the United Kingdom, designed primarily for precision strikes on ground targets. It has been involved in several military conflicts and has been used by such armed forces as the Royal Air Force of Great Britain, the Royal Air Force of Saudi Arabia, the German Luftwaffe, and more recently the ZSU. Brimstone is a compact missile weighing about 50 kg and 1.8 m long. Its design includes a tandem HEAT warhead weighing 6.3 kg, specially designed to penetrate armored targets. This missile is powered by a solid-propellant rocket engine and has a supersonic speed of about Mach 1.3, or about 450 meters per second. One of its key features is its sophisticated guidance system, which integrates an active 94GHz millimeter-band radar and an inertial navigation system (INS) that provides impressive accuracy with an error of less than one meter. Later versions, such as the dual-mode sensor variant and the Brimstone 2 and 3, also include laser guidance capability, increasing the missile's versatility in various combat environments. The land-based version of the Brimstone missile uses fire-and-forget technology, allowing operators launch the missile and rely on its autonomous guidance system to locate and destroy the target without further intervention. This advanced capability is made possible by the missile's dual-mode homing system, which combines millimeter-range radar and laser guidance. Once launched, the missile uses its radar to target targets even if they are moving, ensuring high accuracy and minimizing risk to the operator. The fire-and-forget feature increases battlefield effectiveness by allowing multiple missiles to be launched simultaneously or in rapid succession, increasing the chance of success against enemy armored vehicles and other targets. In turn, the autoplatform for this ground-based anti-tank system is provided SC Group is a British multifaceted engineering company , which is a world leader in the creation of modular structures, including the HMT 600 vehicle, which can use different modules depending on the tasks. Installation of the missile module is possible on 4x4 and 6x6 platform variants. The Wolfram project became the first specialized ground-based anti-tank complex with these missiles, which were created for strike and multi-purpose aircraft. The Wolfram anti-tank system using the ground version of the Brimstone air-to-surface missile.

What it's like to be a military spokesman: Captain Lykhovi on mobilization, civilian media and the m...	Also, the spokesman of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Captain Dmytro Lykhoviy, spoke about mobilization, security of operations, coverage of the construction of fortifications and the peculiarities of the perception of the official spokesperson's posts on a private Facebook account specially for ArmyInform. —Say a few words about your work as a spokesperson for the -Tavria- OUV - when did you accept and hand over the position in the South of Ukraine? — I was the spokesperson for the -Tavria- OUV in the summer and autumn of this year. Before that, in the winter, I was the head of the public relations department and at the same time the spokesperson of the previous OSUV -Tavria-, which covered, in particular, a part of the Donetsk region - the Avdiyiv direction. That is, this year it was my second rotation at Tavria. We are talking about slightly different operational areas. At the same time, I am the spokesperson of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It should be noted that both in the OUV/OSUV and in the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the spokesperson is not a position, but a function. Many journalists do not take this into account. In fact, I have a position in the Main Directorate of Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in the department of interaction with the media. I also have responsibilities that consist in communication on behalf of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This is what is called the -spokesman of the General Staff-. In Kyiv, we alternate with captain Andrii Kovalev. In addition, servicemen of the Main Directorate of Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine can be sent to strengthen communication directions in the OSUV or OUV, which are temporary bodies of military management. So this year, I had two business trips to fulfill certain functional duties at the Tavria Higher Secondary School, rather than moving to a new position. During such a business trip, the spokesperson reports to the commander of the OSU or the OUV, but he also maintains contact and coordinates his actions with the Main Directorate of Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. — So the spokesman for OSUV or OUV is a certain role, the performance of certain duties, or, as you put it, a function. What are the responsibilities of a spokesperson? — These are responsibilities related to communication with media representatives, providing interviews, comments, clarifications in oral and written form, inclusion in TV and radio broadcasts, preparation of texts, summaries for distribution in social networks, etc. A spokesman has a wide range of responsibilities. It should be closer to the media, to journalists, to the audience, intermediaries with which journalists, websites or TV channels are. The spokesperson should be open to constant contact and communication with a wide range of people. When someone becomes a spokesperson, they automatically become a public figure with a heavy workload. This work is intense, difficult, but for me it is very interesting. Actually, this is what I joined the Armed Forces for the second time. - You are a journalist with many years of experience. How did this affect the fulfillment of the duties of a military spokesman? - I have been working in the media since the end of 1991, when I became a correspondent for the newspaper -Ukraine Moloda-. For a long time he worked as the head of the political department, deputy editor-in-chief. The newspaper was very popular in its time and had a large circulation. In 2014, after the beginning of anti-terrorist operation, I first mobilized to the ranks of the 1st tank brigade. According to my VOS (military accounting specialty), obtained at the military department at KNU, I was the deputy battery commander for personnel work. Back then it was called -zampolit-. After demobilization, he founded the online publication -Newspaper-, which writes about the army and war. Its motto: -News of warring Ukraine.- I was convinced that if there was a war going on in the country, then this should be the main topic. I could no longer work in another direction. That is, the specifics of military journalism have been with me since 2015. When the large-scale invasion began, I was also working in the news. The topic of war, for obvious reasons, began to be in much greater demand among readers. The monthly attendance of Novynarna reached 10 million. It helped a lot that all the previous years I was in close contact with many press officers, brigades, servicemen and veterans. After all, -Novynarnia- specialized in coverage of ATO/OOS and everything related to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and earned a good reputation. When I mobilized for the second time in 2023, I chose the path of a communicator, came to serve in the Main Department of Public Relations of the Armed Forces. This was my environment. That is, relatively speaking, I remained on the same information platform, I just moved from one side of the table to the other. — That is, you both came and at the same time remained in the same field in which you have been working professionally for more than three decades. Does it help? - Here I work with many of the same journalists, the same military, in fact the same units that I have been working with since 2015. But no longer as a civilian journalist, but as a military journalist and communicator. At the same time, in my work in the Armed Forces, I profess the principle that Ukrainian civilian journalists are our allies, colleagues and partners. I think it is a huge advantage when I have contacts and approaches to many journalists interested in our topic since I worked side by side with them. I believe that I am doing the same thing with them in the same war, but as a representative of the Armed Forces. In those periods when I was seconded to OSUV and OUV -Tavria-, this cooperation became as contact as possible. I could perform my work much better and in larger volumes, because I know journalists well, their problems, their requests, strengths and weaknesses, the specifics of publications, etc. —Has anything fundamentally changed in the coverage of the war in the media since the beginning of the large-scale invasion? It's not the amount of news and public attention to the topic that matters - it's too much to compare the scale before and after, everything is obvious. I have in mind the requests of society and journalists for information about the war and the work of the media in general. - As a civilian journalist in the recent past, I understand what the media want. I understand that they are always eager to learn more. At the same time, it is equally obvious that those journalists who have been working on the military topic for a long time are aware of the logic of certain limitations in connection with the challenges facing the military. It is easy to work with such experienced colleagues. They have an understanding of how and why all this is being done, and who is fighting and how, and how it should be covered so that everyone remains alive. It is clear that both the amount of information and the scale of the war after February 2022 have increased many times. Now, in the third year of repelling the large-scale invasion of Russia, we must help maintain the interest of the Western media, our media, and our society in general in the events at the front, in the issues of the army. Actually, to engage in objective reporting about what is happening in the war and in the army. —You mentioned Western media working in the national media spaces of their countries and at the international level. With the main messages about them, everything seems to be clear - Ukraine is waging a just war against a brutal aggressor who has not only committed an act of aggression, but has committed numerous war crimes. As an aggressor state, the Russian Federation despises international law and tries to undermine the fundamental principles of the world order. Therefore, Great Britain, the USA, Canada, Australia, the states of the European Union and other countries should continue to effectively support Ukraine in this war - this is correct both from a moral and ethical point of view, and from a purely pragmatic point of view. And what should be the main message to Ukrainian society, what should be addressed to it? - A citizen of Ukraine should be aware that he has not only rights, but also responsibilities. That military duty is prescribed in the Constitution. That assistance to the Defense Forces and mobilization is a matter of the survival of the Ukrainian state, Ukrainian society, and the Ukrainian nation as such. The task of military communicators, in my opinion, is very serious here. This is both direct information and cooperation with our media, which are actually mediators between the army and society. Of course, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have many channels in various social networks, they have millions of subscribers. But still, without cooperation with Ukrainian journalists, we will not be able to communicate with our society better, more qualitatively, more efficiently. So to speak, influence the basic settings. Honest communication - and above all communication about solved problems - can improve the situation with mobilization, and therefore improve the situation in the Armed Forces and at the front in general. In the opposite case, there is a collapse of specific aspects on the battle line - when there are simply not enough personnel, in particular, because the information vacuum has been filled by fakes and manipulations. That is why I say that cooperation with civilian journalists is so important for us. - Let's return to your work as a spokesperson at the Tavria State Educational Institution - how did the interaction with civilian media take place in practice? - During my business trip to the Tavria Educational Institution in February-March 2024, first events with the withdrawal of our troops from Avdiyivka and the subsequent Russian offensive. The question of fortifications also arose. There was a lot of active crisis communication, both reactive and proactive. In addition, during the same period, there were changes to the Order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine No. 73 -On the organization of interaction between the Armed Forces of Ukraine, other components of the defense forces and representatives of the media during the legal regime of martial law-. I believe that the changes that were made to this order in particular and the efforts of our communication department in cooperation with professional public organizations, brought to the press services in the troops and to civilian journalists, were progressive. They greatly facilitated and simplified the work of journalists in war zones. Our team of the public relations department of -Tavria- OSUV was one of the first to start implementing these innovations for the media in practice. The result was, for example, a report by Anna Kalyuzhnaya from Robotyn: the -red zone- can -open- under certain conditions. I will also emphasize that the spokesperson's quality communication is based on the possession of a large amount of up-to-date information regarding the operational situation in the area of ​​responsibility of the OSU/OUU. To do this, it is necessary to constantly work daily with information sources of military structures, social networks, open sources, press services of brigades in the operational zone, keep statistics, receive information from intelligence, from colleagues from other components of the defense forces, etc. That is, as a spokesperson, you can only answer the questions and requests of journalists when you are deep in the topic, have information, statistics and analytics, and at the same time know how to weigh and dose all this. After all, when you monitor yourself every day, write something for yourself, keep tables in Excel. After all, if we talk only about -cotton- in general terms, no one has been interested in it for a long time. Such communication does not satisfy either the journalists or the audience and society. - You said that journalists always want more - more information, more photos and videos, more interesting characters and speakers, more comments and explanations. However, this is not always possible, and, I will make no secret, sometimes some of the military directly say that it is easier to ban and not let anyone anywhere, than to run the risk of leaking important information through publications in the media. How to find a balance here between the interests of journalists and society's right to information and security requirements and the non-disclosure of important details, the data of which could contribute to the enemy? How did you manage to do this? — Of course, there is such a thing as operational security, and the officers concerned are careful to ensure that no information that could be useful to the enemy is made public. Their position is clear: if the enemy, for example, learns the thickness of the armored door in a new bunker on a certain section of the front, he can prepare accordingly to overcome these fortifications. Therefore, in the opinion of the security of operations, it is better not to show any fortifications that we have at all. And nothing to show at all (smiles). On the other hand, if we don’t show the fortifications, don’t talk about them, then the society will start to get nervous, because they will think that the defense line has not been built, there are no fortifications at all or they are of poor quality. People will think that the armed forces are retreating only because they are not properly fortified. To prevent this from happening, military communicators need to show the construction of the same fortifications in a way that does not harm the security of the military and operations, on the one hand, and to provide the public with objective, reassuring information, on the other. That's why in the -Tavria- OSUV we organized an active coverage of the construction of fortifications in our area of ​​responsibility, near Avdiivka. It was shown that construction is provided by engineering units, relevant companies of mechanized brigades, emergency services, regional administrations, etc. They showed new defense lines, concrete freshly built dugouts, trenches, trenches with overlaps, built according to the requirements of the infantry, which take into account the modern challenges of combat and the operational environment. Photos and videos were taken, I recorded a lot of stand-ups from the trenches and bunkers, and we put all these files freely available to all willing TV viewers. Those materials are used to this day, if there is a need to illustrate one or another thematic plot. Thanks to the fact that we showed and explained all this, the wave of -popular discontent- about the fortifications was then extinguished. After all, fortifications were actually built, in large numbers, and the fortifications are not bad. I believe that this was an exemplary case of responding to a crisis call that arose in the information field in February-March. Again, effective -communication of solved problems-. Once again, I thank the excellent team from the public relations department of the -Tavria- OSU, whose area of ​​responsibility included the Avdiyiv direction. —Now you have returned from a business trip and are acting as the spokesman for the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Is it just a matter of scaling between OUV and ZSU or are there other more important differences? - There is a significant difference in features. After all, the spokesman of the operational group works with all the components in his operational area and daily communicates the necessary operational data within his own communication framework. Only sometimes, when the situation requires it (in particular, if there is a significant change in the situation), the spokesman coordinates his message with the command of the OUV. At least it was like that for me. The spokesman of the General Staff has a much wider range of topics. But there are clear limitations here. After all, one spokesman is unable to accumulate all the information about the actions of all the components of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in all directions. This would require both the appropriate level of access and communication approvals. Unfortunately, there is no magic drawer in which you can find answers to any urgent media inquiries about the activities of all the Armed Forces in one minute. And the spokesman of the General Staff cannot provide fast communication at the same level as the spokesman of the General Staff. However, we are trying to improve the work and ensure more active communication of the spokespersons of the General Staff. Consideration is also given to being on TV and providing direct comments to media inquiries today. I will give an example. Recently, there has been a lively media interest in the reform in the IT sector of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The information on this matter was critical and somewhat distorted. The media, including, asked for a comment from the General Staff of the Armed Forces. We promptly prepared a response the same day. - What exactly was it about? - The question related to the alleged -collapse- of the IT structure of the Armed Forces. And the fact is that in the spring of 2024, the Main Inspection of the Ministry of Defense conducted an audit of the functional purpose of military organizational structural units and military management bodies. Among other things, there was talk of the need to somewhat reduce the number of staff positions. This process affected many directions, including the IT sector of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which includes the Center for Geospatial Data and the Center for Scaling Technological Solutions. The importance of IT solutions in today's high-tech warfare is undeniable, so there has been an improvement in the organizational and staffing structure of the Center for Scaling Technology Solutions. Such optimization involves more rational use of human resources, concentration on important areas, and improvement of the efficiency of specialists who remain in their positions. The Central Committee was given time to reform until the end of the year. At the same time, the Armed Forces continue to actively and effectively support technological innovations and the IT sector, and accusations about the destruction of the IT sphere in the Ukrainian army are false. - As can be seen from the examples you mentioned - both about the fortifications in the East and about the reform of the military administration - the role of the spokesperson is very responsible. Is there a situation where every word you say or written is perceived as an official position? After all, any word said in public space can be seen as an official comment. There was a fun case. In the summer, as an individual, as a sports lover (and a former curator of the sports department in the newspaper) commented on Facebook a speech at the Turkish Sagittarius Olympiad - an athlete in glasses, without headphones, a former police officer who fired, holding his hand in his pocket. Then he became a world meme - they say, look at what a cool police in Turkey, that here is an ordinary police officer on a relaxed shot of titled professionals! And then I wrote a comment that he is actually a professional athlete who has been firing for decades, he already has dozens of medals from the World and Europe Championships, that all the pneumatic gun shooters hold his hand in his pocket, after all, many shooters in Berushi's ears. And in this Turk. Then this comment dispersed on the Internet, from my private post made publications on many sites with headings: -The spokesman of the Tavriya- put -in the place of Turkish Sagittarius.- Therefore, I am on Facebook now careful (smiles) . In the continuation of the interview with the Armyinform with the spokesman of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by Captain Dmitry Likhovy, read soon about the Krynki, the left bank of the Dnieper in Kherson region, Gulyaypilsky, Zaporizhia, Orikhiv directions and robots, as well as about mobilization and distinction between chemical substances.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/28/yak-cze-buty-vijskovym-rechnykom-kapitan-lyhovij-pro-mobilizacziyu-czyvilni-media-ta-memnogo-tureczkogo-strilczya-olimpijczya/	2024-10-27T21:44:09-07:00
Another scandal about filtering in the Armed Forces: which indicates a fake	Such nonsense could come to mind only to a stubborn Russian propagandist who had read the Kremlin's manual and Gundyaev's prayers. Even without analyzing the content, this -document- is a fake for a number of other reasons. First, the text contains a number of linguistic errors, incorrect wording and is overly emotional. This indicates that the -letter- was written by a person who does not speak the state language and does not work with official documents. Secondly, the code of EDRPOU (Unified State Register of Enterprises and Organizations of Ukraine) in the header of the document and on the seal are different. This is a serious inconsistency - in such an official document, the codes must match. Thirdly, given the document's other shortcomings, the presence of the QR code and electronic signature information may be an attempt to make it look official. What seems strange about the design of the -document- is that the -letter- is addressed to two divisions of the TCC of the JV at different levels: the Odesa Regional Territorial Center of Recruitment and Social Support and the Khadzhibey Territorial Center of Recruitment and Social Support of the City of Odesa. At the same time, the names and surnames of the managers are not indicated, which is atypical for official documents. Note -App. No- is also not filled in, which is a violation. It usually means -instance number- and indicates which instance is the original or the copy. In conclusion, we would like to emphasize that such -throw-ins- are aimed at inciting conflicts on linguistic grounds and undermining unity among Ukrainian military. Fact checkers state that fake reports about the alleged discrediting of the Russian-speaking population in Ukraine and about the so-called -increasing conflict- between Ukrainian and Russian-speaking citizens of Ukraine have become more frequent recently.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/28/chergova-ahineya-pro-filtracziyu-v-zsu-shho-vkazuye-na-fejk/	2024-10-27T21:23:58-07:00
New support packages for Ukraine and thanks to the combat brigades: address of the President	This was announced by the head of state on October 27 in his evening address. The President also thanked several combat brigades for this week. -25th Separate Airborne, 79th Assault, 35th Separate Marine Brigade, 65th Separate Mechanized, 425th Separate Assault Battalion and 27th Separate Artillery Brigade. Well done, warriors!- he noted. In addition, the head of state listened to the reports of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine General Oleksandr Syrskyi regarding the front and the Kursk operation, as well as the Minister of Defense Rustem Umerov regarding contracts for the domestic production of weapons. -Today we are preparing to work with partners for the week. We have created a new format of cooperation — Ukraine plus the countries of Northern Europe. And within the framework of this format, we are constantly increasing our interaction. Defense, political, economic. And the basis of all this is our valuable interaction,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He is grateful to every country in this format: Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland. The President of Ukraine expects all partners to support the Victory Plan. In his opinion, the key priority is the support of Ukrainian positions in the most difficult directions, soldiers, domestic production of weapons, in particular, drones. Earlier, President called the highest priority of drones, which can bring down -shahedis-. As reported by ArmyInform, more than 1,100 guided air bombs, -prezydent/->over 560 attack drones and about 20 missiles of various types were used by the occupiers against Ukraine this week.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/novi-pakety-pidtrymky-ukrayiny-ta-podyaka-bojovym-brygadam-zvernennya-prezydenta/	2024-10-27T11:58:55-07:00
Canadian Roshel armored car vs. Russian FPV drone: the story of border guards	They told about him in the video. According to the border guards, the Ukrainians gave her the gentle nickname -Roshelka-. It is used to bring soldiers to and from positions, to evacuate the wounded. -We were beaten near Vovchansk. FPVishka hit. The glass survived. It didn't fly away. It was broken, the road was not visible, but it was possible to drive,- recalled the fighter under the pseudonym -Sensei-. Armored body is just one of its charms. Defenders of Ukraine assured that -Roshelka- will pass without problems where ordinary pickup trucks can get into a difficult situation. -And it is managed by ordinary guys who, before mobilization, were either forwarding drivers or computer science teachers. Because mastering it, despite its large dimensions and 8-ton weight, is not so difficult,- the border guards noted. Earlier, ArmyInform showed how border guards of the -Hart- brigade destroyedan enemy howitzer gun D-20 in the Vovchansk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/kanadskyj-broneavtomobil-roshel-proty-rosijskogo-fpv-drona-istoriya-prykordonnykiv/	2024-10-27T11:26:06-07:00

Uterine drones near Selidov: the enemy broke through to the city thanks to a significant advantage i...	At the same time, the Russians practically did not use armored vehicles, instead they resorted to innovations in the use of drones, using drones. The defense forces are making maximum efforts to prevent the enemy from advancing further. The spokesperson of the 15th Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine -Kara- Dag- Vitaly Mylovydov: — The situation in Selidovo remains very difficult and very difficult. For almost a week now, the enemy has continued active assaults, deploying large reserves, partially transferring units from the northern part of the Pokrovsky Front and carrying out, starting and continuing attacks not from two, but from three flanks, that is, the northern outskirts were approached from the northern, eastern and southern outskirts. He used all the bridgeheads that he tried to prepare during September and advanced along the settlement of Selidove, i.e. further north and south. Since the beginning of the week, on Monday, having conducted a preliminary massive artillery training, for about twenty hours, the maximum number of assault units, personnel, due to a large accumulation of manpower, has been trying to capture the city of Selidove. In part, he managed to get to the eastern and southern outskirts, in part to gain a foothold due to a huge number of personnel. But the Defense Forces, 15 Brigade, adjacent units are doing their best to check the enemy's advance. In recent days, the enemy has focused more attention and is using forces partly with the use of equipment, light equipment, trying in the direction of the settlement of Vishneve, which is located further south, with an attempt to create conditions for the encirclement of the city and the displacement of our units directly from Selidowo, cutting off the logistical routes and the supply of our units . Previously, the enemy had very massively used artillery and means of air damage, namely anti-aircraft missiles. The enemy attacked point by point, calculating the positions. Partially struck, destroying some of the western outskirts of the city of Selidove to make it impossible to defend and consolidate our units on those outskirts. I also want to note that the enemy uses a lot of force, but did not use armored vehicles, and due to the movement of infantry groups, taking into account the peculiarities of the geographical area, that is, forest strips that almost come close to the outskirts of the city and reach the first 50 by 70 meters there houses Even the leaves, unfortunately, did not cover these movements in our favor, therefore, at the expense of a significant number, it was possible to infiltrate the territory of the city with an attempt to further entrench. Artillery is now less actively used, but, nevertheless, the positions of our units and adjacent ones are subject to constant and regular attacks by both aviation means of destruction and artillery. Also, it was on this route that we probably first encountered such a combination of a drone that had an FPV drone attached. That is, the zone of its damage was expanded due to the depth of advancement of the main reconnaissance UAV, which corrected and, when calculating the movement of the equipment, dropped the FPV drone directly in the area of ​​damage to the targets. Thus, getting caught in those areas where you least expect damage, catching our equipment or the movement of forces. This bothered me and that's why EW devices were already used at entrances even where, theoretically, it was not planned to use it and counter FPV drones. Selidove is a more or less large settlement, and therefore it can be used as a bridgehead for quartering, or accommodation, or pulling up some resources. Therefore, in any case, the loss of any settlement that retains any logistical routes or capabilities will pose a problem. Geographically, Selidove is in the lowlands, but still it is a fairly large settlement, and further on we see that they are trying to push the Pokrovsky Front very hard, they are not stopping and are pulling up fresh reserves. All measures are being taken and every effort is being made to prevent the enemy from advancing further. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Selidovoy district, the Russian occupiers take pity on their own soldiers and literally step on the corpses of their henchmen.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/drony-matky-pid-selydovym-vorog-prorvavsya-do-mista-zavdyaky-znachnij-perevazi-v-zhyvij-syli/	2024-10-27T10:41:19-07:00
The occupiers are taking North Korean mercenaries to the front in trucks with civilian license plate...	This is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The driver who was in the trailer of reinforcements from North Korea did not have a combat warrant. In another radio intercept obtained by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the staff members of the 810th separate brigade of marines of the Russian occupation army, to which the North Korean assistance from KamAZ was intended, are trying to find out whether they have a stopped truck on the balance sheet and why the driver does not have the proper papers. The GUR of the IOU emphasized that there will be a fair retribution for every war crime committed against Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine intercepted the conversations of servicemen of the 810th separate brigade of marines of the 18th army of the Southern Military District (of the Russian Federation), which is participating in hostilities in the Kursk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/okupanty-vezut-na-front-pivnichnokorejskyh-najmancziv-vantazhivkamy-z-czyvilnymy-nomeramy/	2024-10-27T10:28:59-07:00

They walk over corpses: in the East, the Russians put 600 of their own soldiers behind a village fro...	About the tactics of the Russian occupiers in the East, the ruthlessness of the Russian invaders towards local civilians and their own soldiers, and the situation in the Selidovoy district on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon told Vyacheslav, commander of the company of the -Shershni Dovbush- strike unmanned aerial systems of the 68th separate hunting brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush. — We held positions on the outskirts of Selidovoy for a long time, and our friendly units of the brigade also stood. They held out for a long time, but constant assaults, a constant meat grinder, constant attacks of manpower and equipment&#8230; How many are being destroyed in this direction - the numbers are colossal - and the assaults are in fact never ending, he said. The military described the ruthless attitude of the enemy command towards its own soldiers. — I have very little understanding of how this can happen, when the army can afford to put 600 men in a week in our small direction, when they stormed a village with a length of one street in a kilometer. There, the whole road was covered with the dead bodies of Russian soldiers. I thought they should have retreated, regrouped. But, apparently, they have such reserves that they constantly attack and the attack does not decrease. Therefore, they still have some success, the commander of the drones reported. The defender explained how this happens. — Someone somewhere will fix the -300-m-, one or two, and they will come. And this is what happened to Selidov. They held advanced positions, somewhere they broke through, everyone started pushing into that gap, started to pass, Vyacheslav said. The soldier compared the attitude of Ukrainians to their brothers and the occupiers to their henchmen. - We don't even have that, you see, if there is movement in our country and someone there is injured or something else, then an evacuation is carried out, we stop such actions, and they don't pay attention, said the soldier. the Russians continue to advance, regardless of their own soldiers - neither dead nor even wounded. — If a -brother- falls, they continue moving anyway, regardless of whether he is the -300th- or the -200th-, whether they can help him, provide assistance - no one cares about that, Vyacheslav explained. He described one situation recorded by Ukrainian drones. — It was even worse: once we hit enemy infantry with a drone. Two units were moving, we -triggered- one. He fell, taking his weapon. And the second one continued to move, he did not provide any help to his -brother-, he continued to move. Then this wounded man took a machine gun and started shooting at his comrade, who ran away from him. That is, their interaction is like this, said the commander of -Shershniv Dovbusha-. Earlier, he recalled the following behavior of the occupiers: - The enemy does not understand during the offensive. It even happens that [they shoot] at their own people, not only at civilians, but they also open fire at their own people, when they land infantry with vehicles. Let's say that we have already repeatedly observed the situation that even when turning around, the armored personnel carrier tries to go quickly so that we do not hit it with drones or artillery. And he even simply chokes [his own] infantry with his own equipment and turns back. He does not always return successfully - very rarely, - said the Ukrainian military officer. In view of this, he is not surprised that the occupiers also shoot civilians - not valuing their own lives, they do not value the lives of others even more. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that The Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine for Rights person reacted to the information spreading in social networks about the alleged shooting of two women by the occupiers in the city of Selidove, an investigation has been launched into the facts of the killing of civilians by the occupiers of Selydovogo. Meanwhile Ukrainian fighters in Selidovo saved two civilians from Russian shelling.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/idut-po-trupah-na-shodi-rosiyany-poklaly-za-tyzhden-600-vlasnyh-soldativ-za-selo-z-odniyeyi-vulyczi/	2024-10-27T09:41:45-07:00
The takeoff was successful, the landing is doubtful: modified FPV drones are hunting Russian reconna...	They published a video of combat work on their channel. The war with the Russian occupiers continues not only on the ground, but also in the sky. -46 OAeMBr cuts the enemy's wings. Enemy planes do not even come close to Ukrainian positions, because they know: there was a takeoff, landing is unlikely. But drones, especially reconnaissance drones, are still a real nuisance to our fellow citizens,- the report says. According to the paratroopers, reconnaissance UAVs are mostly invisible from the ground to the naked eye, they direct and adjust the fire of artillery and MLRS, point the way to Iskanders and KABs. The 46th OAeMBr said that recently, with the joint efforts of the air defense and RUBpAK units, freelance calculations (crews) were created to detect and destroy small aerial targets - UAVs of the operational-tactical level in the defense zone of the 46th OAeMBr. It is about the use of modified FPV drones to intercept Russian reconnaissance drones such as Zala, Supercam, etc. -So soon the free and impunity flights of the enemy's -wings- and -eyes- will be put to an end. Or at least the ability of the occupiers to conduct aerial reconnaissance is significantly limited,- the paratroopers said. Earlier, ArmyInform showed how during the day the occupiers tanky-ta-avtivky-rosiyan/->six times resorted to assaults in the zone of responsibility of the 46th separate air mobile brigade of the Russian Air Force in the Kurakhiv direction, but the Ukrainian defenders repelled the enemy attacks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/zlit-buv-posadka-navryad-nashi-modyfikovani-fpv-drony-polyuyut-na-rozviduvalni-bpla-rf/	2024-10-27T09:26:30-07:00

The Ombudsman reacted to the alleged shooting of two women by the occupiers	Dmytro Lubinets wrote about this in his Telegram channel. According to him, if the facts of the crime are proven, this is not only a violation of human rights, it is a gross violation of the laws and customs of war, the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. -The alleged shooting of two women by the occupiers in Selidove is a war crime! And the culprits must be brought to justice! He immediately sent letters to international organizations: the UN and the ICRC. I am waiting for a reaction. Russia commits crimes every day in Ukraine!- he assured. Dmytro Lubinets emphasized that the aggressor must be stopped, and the criminals must be punished now. Let us remind you that the released video shows how representatives of the aggressor state's troops probably shot a civilian car with an automatic weapon.

For two days he fought with a bullet near his spine, and the first aid was provided by a captured pa...	The story about the fighter was published on October 27 on the brigade's page. The fighter entered the army recently, waiting for the country to call. -The HR department received a summons at work. I've been thinking about mobilizing since the first days of the full-scale invasion, but there have been one reason to put it off and another. And then the summons came and I didn't argue anymore. Then passed the BZVP. I don't regret for a moment that I ended up here. It's very cool, I met many interesting people,- said Mazai. In the brigade, he mastered the specialty of a sniper. He says that he has been interested in weapons since childhood. -Before the war, I worked as a forester for five years. He kept various accounts, planted a forest, managed some people. The same as now: he walked around the forest with a weapon, shooting various pests. So, the work has not changed,- the fighter joked. At the beginning of the Kursk operation, Mazai and his partner were in reserve. A little later, they received the command to move forward. -I gathered my thoughts, we were brought to a combat position, everything was wonderful. At first it looked like chaos to me, then I began to notice order. I listened carefully to what they told me, because I really want to live. And they told me: you will live if you obey. I did not retreat from that memorandum, not even for a second,- Mazai shared his memories. During the advance through enemy territory, the sniper detected the first opponents by ear. This gave the advantage of several important seconds to prepare for contact. -My first fight started with a beautiful journey through the dreamlands. We went into landing, there were Russians from several sides. Two groups of boys were walking in front, and we had to cover their rear. We went into the forest, met them, and they told us that the Russians were walking behind us. They sat down and began to wait. I overheard the conversation. There was very dense vegetation everywhere, a kind of mini-jungle. And then I saw a red bandage. At that moment, he was confused and not at the same time. He started shooting, shot one in the shoulder. Then he noticed that people can run very fast. When he started to shoot, the boys felt elation and started to pour there too. Words are difficult to convey those emotions. Then I changed my position, saw how the Russians were moving. The guys found a trophy machine gun somewhere. It was impressive, to say the least. Even during the movement, he -took off his hat- from one enemy soldier. I hope he caught a bad cold from that,- the fighter joked. On the same day, Mazai received his first wound. -At first I thought it was not difficult. Then I hurried a little, got up and the enemy bullet passed between the kidney and the liver, stopped near the spine. At first, it was not felt. But when I tried to shoot two more times, my ribs hurt a lot. My first question then was whether you can smoke in battle. I never had a panic attack. I didn't think that everything was bad, that I was dying. I had very good support from my comrade in arms. For the next two days I continued to perform my combat duties. We took a prisoner even then. In the evening, our enemies left their wounded. Their paramedic was supposed to go after him and stay with him until the evacuees arrived. But the nurse came to visit us. He really wanted to live, and instantly gave up. That orderly even helped me a little,- said Mazai. For a fighter, experience on the battlefield has shown that the most difficult part of a sniper's job is the need to walk a lot. And also, it is important to work not only with weapons, but also with the head. -I thought it would be difficult to shoot people. But when it came down to it, it turned out to be the easiest. Not such a terrible enemy as it is portrayed. It was probably quite easy for me to stay in the positions. The first time in the positions I was worried, but everything went smoothly. If you obey the commanders, remember what you were taught, everything will be fine. Taking the initiative into one's own hands is fatal. And if there is a comrade nearby who can help, give advice, then it is most useful,- the fighter noted. After a few months in the ranks of the 80th brigade, the young paratrooper is motivated most by his family and the desire to liberate the country from the invaders. -Actually, I have been very ideological since childhood. My great-grandfather fought for Ukraine. Father also wants to join the army, but he cannot do it, because he does not have one hand. He supports me morally, he can always find the right words,- said Mazai. Currently, he continues to recover from his injuries and is waiting to return to his duties. -First of all, I would like my brothers who are currently in Kurshchyna to take all instructions and advice seriously. Don't ignore what they tell you. Constantly learn, analyze your actions, what you did right and what you didn't. It is also important to carry a lot of water, because you won't last long without it,- said the fighter. As reported by ArmyInform, the anti-aircraft missile unit of the 80th Airborne Assault Brigade of the Airborne Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces shot down in the sky in the Kursk Oblast of the Russian Federation the latest Russian reconnaissance and strike unmanned aerial vehicle -Orion-. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/dva-dni-voyuvav-z-kuleyu-bilya-hrebta-a-pershu-dopomogu-nadav-polonenyj-sanitar-snajper-mazaj-pro-boyi-na-kurshhyni/	2024-10-27T06:47:25-07:00

Civilians are being hunted in transport: in the South, the enemy is terrorizing local residents	Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — At the moment, the situation in our country is quite difficult, although we do not have as many assaults as there are in some other areas. However, in the same Vremiivsk direction, 22 assaults are quite a large number. It was the day before yesterday or the day before yesterday, and yesterday there was a constant amount of assault going on there, he said. In Kherson region, Russian invaders are trying to move closer to the regional center to terrorize the city. — As for the Kherson direction, there, too, the enemy carries out about 5-7 to 10 assaults every day, trying to take control of the island part of the Dnieper and advance closer to Kherson. The enemy is constantly launching missile strikes, airstrikes and drone strikes on Kherson, the spokesman said. When shelling populated areas, the Russians hit civilian objects and local residents not only randomly, but also purposefully target the civilian population. — In particular, over the past day we had almost 350 strikes by kamikaze drones. These are strikes not only on civilian infrastructure, the enemy is conducting a real hunt on civilian road transport, on public transport, the civilian population is suffering, the officer said. The situation in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast is the same. -In addition, the enemy is constantly shelling the Dnipropetrovsk region, in particular, shelling the Nikopol community and the Marganets community, which are located on the right bank of the former Kakhovsky reservoir,- the military officer said. The spokesman explained the actions of the Russian occupiers as a desire to terrorize Ukraine in various ways with the aim of making the lives of Ukrainians unbearable. — The situation in the South is quite complicated, the residents of Ukraine are constantly suffering from enemy attacks, because the enemy sees here as a direction from where he can at any moment increase the influence of fire, increase terror against Ukraine, Vladyslav Voloshyn said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that komentar/->UU -Tavria- provided an official comment on The Economist's information about the alleged plans of the Russian invaders for Zaporizhzhia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/polyuyut-na-czyvilnyh-u-transporti-pa-pivdni-vorog-teroryzuye-misczevyh-meshkancziv/	2024-10-27T06:03:14-07:00

It is not known for what reasons the invader switched to locomotion with 4 limbs at once, but he stubbornly, although not quickly, climbed the forest strip. The quadrober was spotted by our aerial scouts, who hit the Russian with an FPV drone. This is how the miraculous life path of a Russian, and not only, broke off. As reported by ArmyInform, interesting behavior of the Russian attack aircraft was recorded by the fighters of the -Shershni Dovbush- attack drone company of the 68th hunting brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/novi-viyannya-na-donechchyni-znyshhyly-rosijskogo-shturmovyka-kvadrobera/	2024-10-27T05:43:50-07:00
To hit over the Hydropark — the drones of Holdonoyar won the pilot competition in Kyiv	The video of the competition was released on October 27 on the unit's channel. During the competition, pilots had to hit a balloon attached to a Mavic quadcopter. -This is a very difficult exercise, because the ball does not move along a straight path - it is constantly lobbed in all directions. And you need to be a real ace to impress her. It took 5 minutes to perform the exercise, but Lyolik managed it in 14 (!) seconds — just a phenomenal result,- the unit commented on the video with the exercise. The competitions themselves were held in the Hydropark in Kyiv. Congratulations to the winner and all participants.

The Economist's information about the plans of the Russian invaders for Zaporizhzhia on the air of the national telethon -Edyni Novyni- commented by the spokesperson of the OUV -Tavria- Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn. — According to our intelligence, no offensive groups have been identified in the South. That is, if the enemy has any ambitious plans and The Economist has its data, its insiders among the Russian General Staff, then they can say anything. I am stating what our intelligence can see and what it has found out: that is, there are no offensive groups there, he said. However, in general, the intentions and plans of the enemy are clear - the Russians seek to advance further with the aim of improving their tactical position and creating the threat of shelling large population centers, including with the aim of terror against local civilians. — But, of course, it is logical that the adversary will try to reshape the configuration of the battle line for its own benefit, to bring forces and means closer to such large cities, to such large population centers as Zaporizhzhia, in order to inflict damage by certain means from there, and not only our Defense Forces of Ukraine, and to carry out terror, which the enemy is doing, against the local [civilian — ed.] population, striking Zaporizhzhia with guided aerial bombs, the spokesman emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the enemy's success in the area of the front in the Levadny region is of a limited nature, the dominant heights around the field state are controlled by the Defense Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/zaporizhzhya-the-economist-ta-mozhlyvi-plany-okupantiv-v-ouv-tavriya-nadaly-oficzijnyj-komentar/	2024-10-27T05:11:32-07:00

The Levadny district is controlled by the Armed Forces: the enemy's success is limited	Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . -On that section of the battle line after Ugledar, the enemy increased certain efforts, regrouped and carried out massive assault actions, as a result of which he had partial success, that is, he wedged into our defense to the depth of approximately a platoon's strong point,- he said. However, the Defense Forces are currently taking measures to stabilize the situation and restore lost positions. — As for Levadny itself, I would not be in a hurry to call it a settlement, because it is a simple field state, which was located in a certain lowland, and therefore it is somewhat difficult to defend it, to conduct defensive actions, let's say. Currently, all command heights in this area of ​​the combat clash are under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and a defensive operation to restore the position is ongoing, the spokesperson assured. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that, resorting to air terror tactics, the occupiers turned Orikhiv into a ruin, and also informed that the enemy does not abandon the intention to take control of the islands in the Dnieper river and a real river war is going on there.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/rajon-levadnogo-kontrolyuyut-zsu-uspih-voroga-maye-obmezhenyj-harakter/	2024-10-27T04:14:47-07:00

Today, we honor language not as a set of letters or grammatical rules, but as the heart of the nation that each of us has. Without language, there is no memory, no identity, no future.

Ironing with KABs and advancing with the cheapest resource: the Armed Forces revealed the goal of th...	In detail about the repulse of the enemy assault, the situation on the left bank of the Oskil River, the threat of guided aerial bombs and the cheapest resource of the occupiers on the air of the -Espresso- TV channel told captain Yury Fedorenko, commander of the battalion of unmanned attack aircraft complexes -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket captain Ivan Sirk. - This was not some unexpected attack. The enemy is now very active in the Kupyan district. A decision was made on the forced resettlement of Ukrainian citizens from the Kupyan Oblast, because there is an immediate threat to their lives and health. Why does this happen? The enemy still has the ability to use aviation in a highly intensive manner, guided air bombs attack the left bank of the Kupyan region from morning to night and fly into Kupyansk itself, so it was necessary to take these measures to preserve life and health, he said. The task of the occupiers, with the help of Yury Fedorenko, remains unchanged. -The enemy's task remains the same - to reach the left bank of the Oskil River, gain a secure foothold and expand to Kupyansk-Vuzlovoi in order to fully take control of the left-bank Kupyan region,- explained the soldier. In an effort to achieve their goal, the Russian occupiers regularly carry out offensive actions in the Kupyan direction. — As a result, the enemy has been very actively conducting shock and assault operations for more than two and a half months. Two weeks ago, there was a massive assault with the involvement of armored vehicles - 50 units were used by the enemy and the Defense Forces destroyed almost all of them on the battlefield. Then the -Achilles- battalion destroyed 20 units, another 20 were shot down and then burned by the Defense Forces, the officer recalled. The new enemy assault was also considerable, although much smaller than this previous one. — This time the enemy deployed 17 units of armored vehicles at the moment along with assault infantry. As a result, 15 units were destroyed and an additional 2 were hit. The -Achilles- battalion destroyed 8 BMPs that day, as well as 2 tanks and, of course, assault infantry, the military said. The commander of the drones reminded that at the moment the main and cheapest resource in the Russian army is manpower. — Where the enemy cannot succeed through the use of his armored vehicles, he tries to succeed through the use of manpower. For the enemy, it continues to be the cheapest resource at the moment, Yuriy Fedorenko explained. The defense forces of Ukraine are giving a decent rebuff to the Russian invaders. - In one way or another, the enemy can start fresh replenishment and keep the level of hostilities at the -high intensity- mark. Today, too, fierce, complex battles continue. At the moment, we managed to eliminate 6 occupiers and wound another 14. There was also additional training on equipment - not only armored, but also highly mobile. This is what the enemy uses for operational movement, in particular, and to the front line of the battle - two-wheeled motorcycles, buggies, said the military officer. He assured that despite all the efforts of the enemy and the difficulty of the battles in the Kupyan direction, the Defense Forces manage to restrain the enemy. — Now very difficult battles are going on in Kupyansk, very difficult. But the Defense Forces stopped the advance of the enemy. Despite the insane losses he suffers on the battlefield, he is unable to complete the task set before him. They were not able to gain a full foothold on the left bank of the Oskil River, so the battle continues, the officer said. Yuriy Fedorenko told how it was possible to restrain the advance of the invaders. — Did the enemy manage to fully entrench, dig in and hold this territory? No. Currently, systematic work is being carried out, in certain shades there is a living force of the enemy that is migrating, trying to find shelter. Unmanned systems work in it, artillery works in it. Unfortunately, the enemy managed to sneak into the settlement. But has it managed to gain a foothold? No! said the soldier. The captain predicted that the opponent would not be successful in the near future. — The fighting continues now and I am convinced that the enemy will not succeed in the short term in fully reliably occupying the bridgehead and begin expanding their zone of influence along the left bank of the Kupyanska in the Oskil River, said Yuriy Fedorenko. The military explained that it is necessary for the Defense Forces to confront the enemy even more intensively. -Therefore, it is about the fact that in order to achieve a positive result, the defense forces need a little more equipment and means, because the activity of the enemy remains highly active, although it would be correct to use another word,- said the commander of the -Achilles- battalion. Earlier, ArmyInform explained, will the mud with the onset of natural autumn stop the offensive actions of the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/prasuyut-kabamy-ta-prosuvayutsya-najdeshevshym-resursom-u-zsu-rozkryly-metu-okupantiv-na-kupyanshhyni/	2024-10-27T01:53:18-07:00

The video of the lesions was released on October 27. -Gerbers- cost less than -shahedis-, so the enemy often launches them without a combat unit, as a decoy to distract our air defense. Shooting down -Gerbers- with the help of FPV drones is a sign that soon our pilots can start shooting down -Shahedis- in the same way. FPV drones are cheaper than missiles or projectiles for air defense systems, and their use will prevent Russian plans to deplete Ukrainian air defense.

There, as a result of the impact, the granary was damaged, and a fire broke out on the territory of the farm. According to the police, the occupiers hit the settlement with a guided aerial bomb. No casualties. Also, according to law enforcement officers, servicemen of the army of the Russian Federation beat the villages of the Boriv community of the Izyum district with KABs. In Borova, as a result of shelling, two houses were partially destroyed, three private households and farm buildings were damaged. As a result of an enemy air strike, a private house was partially destroyed in the village of Zagryzove of the Borivska hromad of the Izyum district. According to the police, the enemy hit the open area in the field between the villages of Rohan and Svitanok of the Rohan community of the Kharkiv district with an anti-aircraft missile system. No casualties. Also, the Main Directorate of the National Police of Ukraine in the Kharkiv region reported about the artillery shelling Kup Yanska. Two private houses, a fence, a car, and farm buildings were damaged in the city. And in the village of Kruglyakivka of the Kuriliv community in the Kupyan region, a civilian woman was injured as a result of shelling from weapons of an unknown type. In total in the Kupyansk direction the enemy tried 13 times to dislodge our units from the occupied positions near Kindrashyvka, Synkivka, Petropavlivka, Kruglyakivka, Zagryzovy, Vyshnevoy, Berestovoy and Pershotravnevyo. Two attacks are still ongoing. In the Kharkiv direction there were seven skirmishes with the Russian invaders. All attacks in the regions of Vovchansk and Staritsa were repelled by Ukrainian soldiers. As a result of intensifying evacuation measures, 116 people (among them 6 children) were evacuated from the Kupyanskyi and Borivskyi directions during the day. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Russian army fired again in Kharkiv Oblast: one person was killed .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/zrk-s-300-rszv-i-kabamy-byly-okupanty-po-harkivshhyni-zagynula-lyudyna-ye-poraneni/	2024-10-27T00:24:57-07:00
Mud tanks, crossroads and Russian assaults: will the mud stop the offensive actions of the occupiers	This was discussed on the Espresso TV channel by the commander of the Achilles unmanned aerial systems battalion of the 92nd separate Captain Yury Fedorenko of the assault brigade named after Ivan Sirko of the Koshovo Otaman. -The intersection will not significantly affect the course of hostilities, since assault operations are carried out by infantry units, and infantry moves in almost any weather,- he said. The military officer explained that under insurmountable weather conditions, the enemy, of course, suspends offensive operations. However, it immediately restores them after the weather improves. — It is clear that when it rains heavily, the enemy also stops at that moment. But as soon as the rain stops, his infantry goes forward, and for them the crossroads does not present significant obstacles, explained the officer. The change in weather conditions will also affect the logistics of the occupiers, making conditions somewhat worse, but this effect will not be critical. - As for logistics, the intensity of supply, of course, it will decrease somewhat, but the enemy will not lose the ability to conduct shock-assault actions, - said Yuriy Fedorenko. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the East, the Russian command of the occupying army more often throws not only infantry into the assaults, but also armored vehicles, which it tried to save before that and explained, why Russians voluntarily die by the thousands in -meat- assaults.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/tanky-brudu-rozdorizhzhya-ta-rosijski-shturmy-chy-zupynyt-bagnyuka-nastupalni-diyi-okupantiv/	2024-10-27T00:11:04-07:00

The video of the killed and captured Kadyriv soldiers was released on October 27 on the channel of the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Kadyrivtsev, known for their exploits in the field of cinematography, filmed a video showing how strong and brave they are before the battle. -However, all their self-confidence was blown away on the battlefield, and they died one by one - the paratroopers destroyed them all. However, among the Russians there were two intelligent people who value their lives more than their dictator. Yes, they surrendered and remained alive. They were immediately provided with medical assistance,- the brigade reported. Kadyrivets, as the elite of the Russian army, are replaced by the Russians in the first place, in contrast to simple -vanoks-. As reported by ArmyInform, scouts of the 95th Polish Assault Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces destroyed a group of the 155th marine brigade of the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Federation, which was supposed to mine the paths of advancement of Ukrainian units.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/ahmad-salo-garmatne-na-kurshhyni-chastkovo-znyshhyly-a-chastkovo-polonyly-kadyrivskyh-tiktokeriv/	2024-10-26T23:55:58-07:00
The defense forces repelled 174 enemy attacks per day — the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukr...	Operational information as of at 08:00 on October 27 was published by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The situation at the front remains difficult. The enemy, using their advantage in manpower and equipment, is relentlessly attacking our positions. Ukrainian defenders steadfastly restrained the onslaught of the occupiers and inflicted significant losses on the enemy. The aggressor carried out airstrikes, in particular, in the areas of the settlements of Khrapivshchyna, Yablunivka, Myropyllya, Basivka, Hoptivka, Kozacha Lopan, Odradne, Pischane, Hlushkivka, Berestov, Zagryzove, Terny, Chasiv Yar, Toretsk, Kostiantynivka, Mirnograd, Uspenivka, Mali Shcherbaki, Mala Tokmachka , Lviv. Over the past day, aviation, missile forces and artillery of the Defense Forces hit two enemy command and observation posts, six areas of concentration of personnel, weapons and military equipment, one air defense vehicle and two enemy guns. In the Kharkiv direction, the enemy stormed our positions seven times near the settlements of Vovchansk and Staritsa. In the Kupyan direction, 14 attacks by invaders took place during the day. The defense forces repelled enemy assaults near Kindrashyvka, Synkivka, Petropavlivka, Kruglyakivka, Zagryzovy, Vyshnevoy, Berestovoy, and Pershotravnevyo. The enemy actively used bombing and attack aircraft for strikes on the direction. In the Lyman direction, the aggressor attacked 18 times. He tried to penetrate our defenses near Kindrashyvka, Synkivka, Petropavlivka, Kruglyakivka, Zagryzovy, Vyshnevoy, Berestovoy and Pershotravnevy. On the Siverskyi direction, Ukrainian defenders repelled two assaults by Russian invaders near Bilogorivka. In the direction of Toretsk, the enemy, with the support of aviation, launched nine attacks in the direction of Toretsk and Shcherbinivka. In the Pokrovsky direction, our defenders stopped 41 assault and offensive actions of the aggressor in the areas of the settlements of Vozdvizhenka, Myrolyubivka, Promin, Lysivka, Krutyy Yar, Krasnyy Yar, Mykolaivka and Selidove. The greatest concentration of enemy attacks was near Selidovoy. In the Kurakhiv direction, the Defense Forces repelled 43 attacks. The occupiers most actively tried to advance near Antonivka and Katerynivka. In addition, the enemy attacked in the direction of Novoselidivka, Gostroy, Dalnyi, Kostyantynivka, Elizavetivka. In the Vremivsk direction, the enemy carried out five assaults on our positions in the Bogoyavlenka and Novoukrainka districts. In the Orichiv direction, the Russian invaders once stormed the positions of our soldiers in vain. Five times in vain, the invading troops tried to dislodge units of the Defense Forces from their positions in the Dnieper direction. The operation is ongoing in the Kursk region. Russian aviation continues to bomb its villages and cities. Over the past day, Russian planes have carried out 30 airstrikes with 45 anti-aircraft missiles on their own territory. No signs of the formation of enemy offensive groups were detected in the Volyn and Poliske directions. On the border with the Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the enemy from the territory of the Russian Federation is actively using artillery and aviation in the areas of Ukrainian settlements. Our soldiers inflict significant losses in manpower and equipment on the occupying forces and actively undermine the offensive potential of the enemy in the rear. In general, the Russian invaders lost 1,440 people last day. Ukrainian soldiers also destroyed 4 tanks, 23 armored combat vehicles, 39 artillery systems, 73 operational-tactical UAVs, 100 vehicles and a unit of special equipment. As reported by ArmyInform, more than 1,400 soldiers and almost 40 guns voroga-genshtab-zsu/->made up the losses of the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/syly-oborony-vidbyly-174-vorozhi-ataky-za-dobu-genshtab-zsu/	2024-10-26T23:28:22-07:00
Enemy equipment is on fire (more than 20 units) - a reflection of a large Russian assault near Ugled...	The video of the battle was published on the channel of the Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi. Aerial reconnaissance of the 3rd mechanized battalion detected the accumulation and advancement of the enemy column in time. The enemy used a total of several dozen pieces of equipment: tanks with trawls, armored personnel carriers and BMPs with infantry. -Thanks to the prompt response, the joint efforts of our units: 3 mechanized battalions, 1 special purpose company, as well as operators of the 194th pontoon-bridge brigade of the State Special Transport Service managed to hit about 20 pieces of equipment. The number of liquidated infantry is difficult to count,- the brigade commented on the video. Several interesting moments of the battle can be noted. So at 0:17 you can see how the occupiers opened the landing compartment to meet our drone. Russian armored vehicles were encased as much as possible in the additional armor of grill screens, but this did not prevent the drones of the Bulava nf -Chimera- units from successfully hitting a large number of enemy combat vehicles. During the offensive test, the Russians tried to move exclusively along the tracks from the tracks of the cars that had passed earlier. The reason for this caution, most likely, is the large minefields created by the Defense Forces in this direction. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 2nd mechanized battalion of the Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky destroyed an assault group of Russians that tried to approach our positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/goryt-palaye-tehnika-vorozha-ponad-20-odynycz-vidbyttya-velykogo-rosijskogo-shturmu-bilya-vugledaru/	2024-10-26T23:21:17-07:00

Maly and Minion cleaned up the positions they had recaptured from the Russians. The minion threw a grenade into the Russian dugout and ran across its roof. The ammunition ignited from the explosion. Suddenly, they heard a shout from the dugout: -Yours!-. However, the Russian occupier with the call sign -Georgian- turned out to be -his-. He almost burned, was slightly wounded and begged not to be killed. Later it turned out that he had been hiding in this dugout for more than a month - it was deadly dangerous to go back, as well as forward. The Georgian survived the FPV strike and hid from our troops, who managed to enter these positions earlier. In particular, Little and Minion were able to take trophies from there: weapons, walkie-talkies and a helmet with the inscription -Georgian-. But her owner managed to remain unnoticed at that time, and he met with the Ukrainian soldiers much later. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the 93rd mechanized brigade -Cold Ravine- were able to track down and hit the Russian Lancet kamikaze drone, which was flying to strike at our equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/ponad-misyacz-hovavsya-u-blindazhi-boyavsya-i-svoyih-i-nashyh-rosijskyj-polonenyj-z-pozyvnym-gruzyn-perezhyv-pozhezhu-ta-udar-fpv/	2024-10-26T22:31:10-07:00

All attacks in the Vovchansk and Staritsa districts were repulsed by Ukrainian soldiers. In the Kupyansk direction, the enemy tried 13 times to dislodge our units from their occupied positions near Kindrashyvka, Synkivka, Petropavlivka, Kruglyakivka, Zagryzovy, Vyshnevoy, Berestovoy, and Pershotravnevyo. Two attacks are still ongoing. 18 times the enemy attacked in the Lymansky direction, tried to advance in the direction of the settlements of Grekivka, Makiivka, Terny, Torske, Zarichne, Serebryanka and Hryhorivka. One skirmish continues near Serebryanka. In the Siverskyi direction, the occupiers attacked twice in the area of ​​Bilogorivka, without success. The enemy tried nine times to penetrate our defenses in the Toretsk direction. Since the beginning of the day, the occupiers in the areas of Shcherbynivka and Toretsk settlements have been repulsed four times by our defenders. Five attacks are still ongoing. The enemy is intensively attacking the Ukrainian defenders in the Pokrovsky direction. Here, during the day, the aggressor carried out 40 assault and offensive actions. The Russian occupiers are most active in the areas of Vozdvizhenka, Myrolyubivka, Promenya, Lysivka, Krutoy Yar, Krasnoy Yar, Mykolaivka, and Selidovoy. In total, Ukrainian defenders have already repelled 36 attacks in the direction, four more clashes are ongoing. The situation is difficult, but controlled by the Defense Forces. Our soldiers are making efforts to prevent the enemy from advancing deep into Ukrainian territory. According to the currently available information, the losses of the aggressor in this direction amounted to about 300 people killed and wounded. Five vehicles, one motorcycle and one buggy were destroyed. In addition, eight cars, three mortars and one motorcycle were damaged. At this time of the day, there are 40 combat clashes in the Kurakhiv direction. The invaders remain highly active, trying to advance in the areas of the settlements of Izmailivka, Stepanivka, Novodmytrivka, Novoselidivka, Gostre, Dalnye, Antonivka, Kostiantynivka, Elizavetivka, Katerynivka. Units of the Defense Forces repelled 33 enemy attacks, seven attacks are still ongoing. In the Vremivsk direction, our soldiers stopped one assault of the occupiers in the Bogoyavlenka area. In the Orihiv direction, our defenders repulsed one futile enemy attack during the day near Novodanilivka. In the Dnieper direction, our soldiers repelled the attacks of the Russian invaders on the positions of the Ukrainian army five times. Defense forces of Ukraine continue the operation in the Kursk region. The aviation of the Russian Federation continues to strike with guided aerial bombs on the territory of Russia. Currently, 21 air strikes using 34 anti-aircraft missiles are known. There were no significant changes in the situation in other directions. Today, the soldiers of the 65th Mechanized Brigade, 124th Territorial Defense Brigade, 25th Sicheslav Airborne Brigade, 42nd Mechanized Brigade, and 425th Assault Battalion, who professionally and decisively destroy the Russian invaders, should be celebrated.

The Kursk operation: will it be able to change the course of the war. Expert opinion	-It turned out that their all-powerful intelligence could not see such a large-scale operation. And this is a large-scale corps-level operation. No less. Why corps level? Because the forces and means that are concentrated there, up to 50 thousand people, this is exactly what a corps is. Second moment. It turns out that a non-nuclear country can launch a conventional military strike against a nuclear country and a nuclear apocalypse does not occur. True, this is not the only case in history. Argentina also struck a nuclear country in 1982 during the Falklands War. Here it is necessary to emphasize very correctly that this is not the only precedent. What tasks in the interests of Ukraine continues to be performed by the Kursk operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine? The operation in Kurshchyna focuses on itself a part of Russian reserves, which the Kremlin cannot use to strengthen its offensive in Ukraine. Indeed, the Russians have attracted a considerable amount of forces and resources there, primarily from the Pokrovsky direction. As we can see, as a result, their offensive stalled there. Second, the exchange fund is replenished with Russian prisoners of war, and this is also no less important. Putin is no longer the -security guarantor- of Russia. The Ukrainian offensive undermines the image of the Russian dictator. I think the Kursk region is important in the future as a possible exchange fund for territories. Why not? It's quite a working tool. Conditionally, we are changing the Kursk bridgehead to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Waiting for precipitation is literally several weeks, a month. The weather will make it impossible for the enemy's heavy equipment to pass. And then it will be time for a counter-battery. The defense forces of Ukraine will suppress and destroy the artillery of the Russian invaders. In this aspect, we are head and shoulders above the Rashists. In recent months alone, more than 18,000 different enemy artillery systems have been destroyed (damaged). We have simply unique American counter-battery systems AN/TPQ- 36, 48, 50. The German COBRA radar system, which at a distance of up to 100 km is capable of detecting and classifying up to 40 units of artillery systems in two minutes. This accuracy is a very important component. This is exactly the phenomenon of this war: we outplay the Russians in quality, not quantity in the counter-battery fight. Of course, time will tell how it will be in reality. In my personal opinion, we should strengthen our (military-diplomatic - ed.) positions for the summer of 2025. The next cycle of dry weather could see a fundamental upheaval in this war. It is important that it is in our favor.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/kurska-operacziya-chy-zmozhe-zminyty-hid-vijny-dumka-eksperta/	2024-10-26T22:00:56-07:00
The war of drones in the Black Sea and the failure of special operations of the Russian Federation: ...	However, the use of mine weapons in the Russian-Ukrainian war will enter a new page in the history of mine warfare at sea. After all, mine weapons have never before been used as a means of modern robotic warfare. This happened for the first time and it was done by Ukrainians. About the specifics of mine warfare in the Black Sea, the loss of Russian control over the sea area, the destruction of enemy ships, the strengthening of the anti-mine capabilities of our Navy, ArmiyaInform told a candidate of military sciences, captain of the 1st rank in retired Stepan Yakymyak: -Mine weapons during the repulse of a large-scale invasion of Russian troops into Ukraine became a cementing element of the anti-landing defense of the sea coast of Ukraine in the Black Sea. On the eve of the invasion, the Russians increased the landing capabilities of the Black Sea Fleet with six more large landing ships from the Northern and Baltic Fleets. The enemy had a firm intention to capture Odesa and Mykolayiv Oblast, the loss of which could lead to the enemy's capture of Ukraine from the south. However, defensive anti-landing sea mine barriers were created in advance and officially declared by Ukraine to be prohibited for navigation seven coastal areas became a barrier for groups of enemy forces. Thus, having complete superiority in the air and at sea in the first days, the enemy clearly understood that he could not overcome this obstacle , because for this it was necessary to destroy coastal artillery and spend considerable time searching for and destroying sea mines. However, as it turned out, this was only the beginning of this new mine warfare at sea. The next stage of mine warfare was the use of rf drifting sea mines on the surface. The enemy did this purposefully to stop international shipping, compromise Ukraine in the eyes of its partners, and exert psychological pressure on the crews of civilian ships. In violation of the norms of International Maritime Law, in particular the Hague Convention of 1907, the Muscovite military leadership created a threat to shipping uncontrolled use of mine weapons. Acting according to the techniques of information struggle, the enemy in the person of the captain of the port of Sochi, who is an official representative of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, on March 18, 2022, distributed an -interesting- letter under the number 348/0162. It states that there is a mine threat in the southwestern and northwestern parts of the Black Sea due to the fact that, as a result of the storms, about -420 UM and YRM mines- installed by the -Ukrainian Navy on the approaches to the ports of Odesa, Ochakiv, Chornomorsk, Pivdenny-. But this message turned out to be more than just misinformation. Drifting mines do appear throughout the water area of ​​the southwestern part of the Black Sea, and more precisely in the maritime space of coastal states: March 26, 2022 - in the Turkish Bosphorus, March 28 - off the coast of Turkey and Romania, April 6 - off the coast of Turkey, 31 July and December 10, 2022, August 13, 2023 – in Romanian waters. It was no longer an information war, but a real threat to the lives of the crew members of ships flying the flags of various countries that carried out non-military transportation in the Black Sea and the waters of non-belligerent states. However, the Russian Federation did not succeed in compromising Ukraine in the eyes of its partners. True information was provided, which dispelled the myths of misinformation. Already on March 29, 2022 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine distributed a statement regarding the illegal activities of the Russian Federation in the Black Sea. On the other hand, the international community faced the problem of ensuring the safety of shipping and bringing the Russian Federation to criminal legal responsibility for crimes at sea. On the part of the Russian Federation, it was a real, well thought out, but ineffectively conducted special operation with the use of mine weapons. The next and again unprecedented step of the Russian Federation in violating the norms of international law was the mining of the areas near the mouth of the Danube River and the Snake Island. That is, on the shipping lanes of the -grain corridor- created by Ukraine after the refusal of the Russian Federation to implement the agreement on the Black Sea Grain Initiative. This corridor was also used as a humanitarian one for the withdrawal of foreign ships that were blocked in Ukrainian ports as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Without the possibility of attracting surface ships and submarines to lay mines in these areas, in early autumn 2023 2018, the Muscovites attempted to drop mine-explosive devices by bomber aircraft from what seemed to them to be a safe border at the time. That is, the planes carried out mortars without entering the damage zone of air defense equipment deployed on the Ukrainian coast. From the very beginning, the insidious plan of the enemy was almost immediately discovered by the Ukrainian military sailors. Understanding the enemy's intentions, they observed the laying of mines by the enemy's aircraft and destroyed the mines in the sea. Finally, on December 5, 2023, the enemy's actions to mine the areas of the -grain corridor- by aircraft were stopped. Air defense forces shot down an enemy Su-24 aircraft that was trying to drop mines. The enemy realized that it had become dangerous here and refused to continue this operation. The successful defense of the -grain corridor- by the Defense Forces of Ukraine during the first four months created the conditions for the export by sea of ​​seven million tons cargo. From August 8 to the beginning of December 2023, 200 ships left the ports of Odessa and 226 entered. The mine countermeasures of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine played an important role in this. ships under the flags of foreign states. Only from September to December 2023, 5 ships under the flags of Togo, Turkey, Liberia and Panama were blown up by mines. For example, the bulk carrier Vyssos under the flag of Panama, which was heading to one of the Danube ports to load grain, was blown up by a mine in Ukrainian waters. The ship lost speed and control, a fire broke out on the upper deck. Two sailors were injured. Unfortunately, the list of bombings of civilian ships under the flags of foreign states that did not participate in the war in the Black Sea is not exhaustive. There were other cases and, in the end, the war continues... However, the purpose of the enemy's actions was not achieved. The export of grain and other cargo from Ukrainian ports through the -grain corridor- successfully continued. In October 2023, as a result of a covert operation to lay sea mines by the forces of the Armed Forces Navy of Ukraine and SBU with the use of unmanned sea systems during the external raid of Sevastopol, four Russian warships were hit. In the course of this unique operation, modernized sea unmanned vehicles of the type Sea Baby was exposed to at least 15 sea mines, each weighing about 180 kg. Preparation lasted at least one and a half months, in particular, during this time, the maneuvering routes of Russian warships on the external raid of Sevastopol were monitored. The entrance to the internal raid of Sevastopol (to the Sevastopol bay) was at that time tightly protected by the enemy with booms and other barriers, which made it difficult for unmanned vehicles to penetrate the ships in the bay. As you know, the laying of mines lasted several weeks, in total the devices traveled more than 3,000 miles to their staging areas and back. During one of the outings at sea, the unmanned device was discovered by three Raptor-class patrol boats. That is why it struck a grenade launcher (our unmanned aircraft is equipped with a grenade launcher &#8211; ed.) at Russian boats, as a result of which one of the enemy boats was damaged. However, the enemy failed to detect the placement of mines exposed mine barriers and after that the events on the external raid of Sevastopol became more and more interesting and fun every day. Yes, on October 11 2023, the patrol ship -Derzhavin- was blown up while moving to the Sevastopol base (the starboard side was probably damaged); Two days later the same ship blew up again while trying to move to another base for repairs. On the same day, a tugboat that was going to help -Derzhavin- was also blown up by a mine. And a few days later, in the same area during mine countermeasures, one of the two newest project 12770 mine countermeasure ships in the Russian Navy was blown up. Preliminary analysis of the events and consequences of this operation testified that marine robotic systems significantly change the nature of actions at sea. It is possible that only the insufficient amount of explosive substance in the exposed sea mines did not allow to achieve the maximum result and ensure the complete destruction of the ships. However, and this is the most important, what effect did this operation have on the nature of the enemy's actions in the war at sea? Some time after this operation, it can be argued that it became one of the main factors in the loss of Russian control over the approach areas to the main naval base. And also the withdrawal of the main forces from it, including ships with the Kalibr missile complex and amphibious assault ships, to the bases in the eastern part of the Black Sea.- . After all, the available forces are not sufficient. Currently, the Ukrainian fleet has limited capabilities to deal with mine hazards at sea. After the loss of a significant number of warships under the conditions of Russia's occupation of Crimea, including a number of anti-mine ships, the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine had only the project 1258 raid minesweeper -Genichesk- in its composition. But in June 2022, it became known about his death under enemy strikes. Thanks to the measures taken and the provision of military-technical assistance by partners, the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine currently carries out mine action primarily to ensure the defense of forces at base points and protection of civil shipping. It is about ensuring the functioning of the -grain corridor-, preventing the detonation of civilian ships by mines in ports and during sea crossings. Are these forces sufficient? Certainly not. After all, the spectrum of anti-mine tasks is very wide. Currently, only the main tasks are partially performed. Currently, one of the most important sources of development of anti-mine capabilities is the Coalition of maritime capabilities, which was created on December 11, 2023 at the initiative of Great Britain together with Norway. Several other states joined the Coalition. The surface forces of the fleet already include two anti-mine ships - minesweepers of the Sandown type with the names -Chernigiv- and -Cherkasy-. They were transferred to Ukraine in 2023 by Great Britain in accordance with the agreement of January 2022. However, due to the effect of the Montreux Convention, they cannot be sent to the Black Sea at the moment, so they are in Great Britain and are involved in joint exercises. In addition, two more anti-mine ships - mine hunters from the Netherlands are expected to be transferred to the Ukrainian fleet (approximately in 2025). It is likely that these will be ships of the Alkmaar type. The main anti-mine armament of these ships is a hydroacoustic minesweeping station and underwater vehicles of the PAP104 type. Considering the capabilities of the anti-mine forces, it should be noted that the mine anti-complexes Seafox Atlas and Remus 100 include modern underwater vehicles that have high search capabilities. At the same time, it is known that the Ukrainian Navy can also use some other complexes to search for mines, in particular, German-made sonar stations of the Cerberus Mod 2 type, purchased in 2019.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/vijna-droniv-v-chornomu-mori-ta-proval-speczoperaczij-rf-shho-vpershe-zrobleno-same-ukrayinczyamy/	2024-10-26T21:44:14-07:00
The one that is loaded with missiles: Turkey is building its first air defense destroyer	How claimed on the official website of ASFAT (Askeri Fabrika ve Tersane İşletme AŞ, Administration of Military Factories and Shipyards), a subsidiary of the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of Turkey, the first domestic destroyer of the TF-2000 series, which was developed by the Project Bureau of the Military Command naval forces and the construction of which was decided to start at the meeting of the Defense Industry Executive Committee (SSİK), will be laid at the Istanbul Shipyard under the leadership of the main contractor ASFAT, ArmiyaInform reports. Actually speaking, the need for such vessels was announced by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan two years ago. -Turkey intends to strengthen the power of its navy&# 8230; With the help of the TF-2000 destroyer with an air defense system, the construction of which will begin at the Istanbul shipyard, we will gradually provide air defense of our country from the sea - emphasized Turkish leader. How notes the Turkish portal MarineDeal, the TF-2000 HSHM will have the basic functional capability of using the sea as a shield to detect guided missiles short/medium/long-range missiles and ballistic missiles at low/medium/high altitudes and destroy them before they approach the mainland (except for ballistic missiles). The functionality of the future watercraft should include the ability to air defense (HSH), anti-submarine (DSH) and surface (S/S) long-range warfare. At the same time, it will receive the means and capabilities to effectively perform the tasks of non-combat operations, such as peacekeeping, evacuation of non-combatants, countering manifestations of international terrorism, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and maritime control operations. Tactical requirements - the technical characteristics of the destroyer of the TF-2000 series are put forward as follows: &#8211; a maximum speed of at least 28 knots, a range of at least 5,000 nautical miles at a speed of 18 knots and an average duration of operation of 5,000 hours per year; &#8211; unlimited operational capability in sea conditions up to 5 points (on a nine-point sea roughness scale), which is defined by international standards as -Significant roughness-; &#8211; the ability to carry out operations for at least 45 days without integrating logistics (except for refueling); &#8211; the ability to work autonomously for 180 days without entering home bases; &#8211; service life of at least 40 years; &#8211; availability of system programs to reduce the radar cross section (RCA), underwater acoustic, magnetic and infrared (I/R) signatures; &#8211; must be designed according to the main design features, such as the durable structure of the hull structure within the framework of high survivability. The destroyer TF-2000 HSH, which will have an overall length of 149 m, a beam of 21.3 m, a draft of 5.75 m and a displacement of 8,300 tons, will be equipped with a main propulsion plant in the CODOG configuration consisting of two LM2500 gas turbines and two diesel engines. TF-2000 will use various missiles developed in Turkey. Air defense missiles will consist of HİSAR-D (medium range), SAPAN B1/B2 (actual performance not released, possibly medium range), SİPER Block 1D and SİPER Block 2D (100+ km and 150+ km). At the same time, missiles of the -surface-to-surface- class - ATMACA anti-ship missile and GEZGİN long-range cruise missiles will be placed with a vertical (mine) launch option. An effective long-range anti-aircraft defense system created under with the help of a multi-purpose radar with a phased array (ÇAFRAD). The destroyer will be equipped with an Airborne Long Range Radar (UMR) that can produce aerial images from a minimum range of 200 miles and work with an integrated IFF system that allows for three-dimensional surveillance of enemy aircraft and the detection of modern G/Ms. The ship will have an integrated hydroacoustic system (Sonar Suit) for anti-aircraft defense purposes, an anti-torpedo protection system and a torpedo system against underwater targets. The TF-2000 HSHM ship will be able to land 2 medium cargo transport helicopters with a maximum take-off weight of less than 15 tons and 2 shipborne unmanned aerial vehicles (GIAVs) with fixed or rotary wings for reconnaissance/attack missions. For this, a fixed platform and a hangar, an arsenal of spare weapons and the possibility of fuel supply will be available. It will have level 1 certification, which allows working in meteorological conditions by instruments day and night. As the main material of the hull and superstructures, it is planned to use high-strength shipbuilding steel of domestic production. Aluminum material will be used in the superstructures of the deck superstructures to reduce weight as much as the strength requirements will allow. It is stated that the ship will have living space and a service area for at least 200 people. It is especially emphasized that during the construction of the first destroyer of the TF-2000 HSHM series, a high level of localization will be achieved: thanks to the planning of the level of localization, that is, the confirmation of the production of elements of the future ship on the territory of Turkey. In this particular project, at 85% in the elements of its design and armament, the ship should demonstrate the growing capabilities of the Republic of Turkey in the defense industry.

Fake stories about the deportation of Ukrainians from EU countries: why is it an enemy?	How to experts of the StopFake project explained, in fact, this incident was not about evasion of mobilization, but about deportation due to violation of Polish laws, but rather suspicions of assisting illegal migration. Official sources do not confirm allegations of mobilization reasons for deportation.

Previously, they actively distributed a fake letter on behalf of the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine (in 2020-2024) Dmytro Kuleba. In it, he allegedly asked Poland to deport -all men to be sent to the front- from the country. Agitprop also falsely wrote that Ukrainian diplomats sent similar letters to Latvia and Lithuania. But to date, no EU government has introduced a policy of returning Ukrainian citizens through mobilization. European Commissioner for Internal Affairs Ylva Johansson said that the deportation of Ukrainians of conscription age contradicts the Directive on temporary protection, which regulates the status of refugees in the EU.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/27/fejkovkydy-pro-deportacziyu-ukrayincziv-iz-krayin-yes-navishho-cze-vorogu/	2024-10-26T21:15:49-07:00

Three key steps to peace: Ukraine and Lithuania discussed the withdrawal of Russian troops	Rustem Umyerov reported this in his social networks. Within the framework of the conference, three key steps were discussed under the sixth point of the -Peace Formula-, which are based on Article 51 of the UN Charter, which guarantees the right to self-defense: Rustem Umyerov also reminded the partners about the second point of the -Victory Plan- of President Volodymyr Zelenskyi, which provides for a list of weapons to strengthen the Ukrainian army. According to the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, the -Victory Plan- is the basis for diplomatic efforts, but the success of diplomacy requires strength on the battlefield. He emphasized that without the withdrawal of Russian troops, there can be no long-term peace. The conference was productive, Rustem Umyerov expressed special thanks to the Minister of Defense of Lithuania Laurinas Kaschyunas for the co-organization of the event. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense offered Sweden and Finland support the Ukrainian defense industry following the example of the -Danish model-, i.e. through direct financing of producers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/26/try-klyuchovi-kroky-do-myru-ukrayina-ta-lytva-obgovoryly-vyvedennya-rosijskyh-vijsk/	2024-10-25T22:16:49-07:00

Hit 11 targets on the first shift: how a skiff truck driver became an FPV pilot	The fighter himself says with a modest smile that in his peaceful life he rode around Europe behind the wheel of a truck, and never imagined himself a pilot. Yes, he picked up a soldering iron already in the army. He planned to do programming, but he didn't have time to study seriously - a large-scale invasion began. After joining the Armed Forces, the boy was a driver who rotates positions, and was a -zampotech-, the commander of an anti-tank platoon. Even at the beginning of 2023, he was critical of FPV, because it seemed something incomprehensible, but already in the fall he stopped enemy attacks as a drone operator. — We had a commander who gave a push. I was assigned the task of selecting and training pilots from the anti-tank platoon. At first, I dealt with purely organizational issues: the training schedule on the simulator, I looked at who has the talent and who does not want to do it. Then we bought our first -tiny whoop- (tiny whoop - a small FPV drone. - Ed.) - training drones, - recalls Skif. At first, all training took place in the unit. After 30 hours in the simulator, the fighters were allowed to practice on small drones in the hangar, where an obstacle course was set up. Then the pilot trained in the field already on working UAVs. Only after 20 successful drops on an improvised target was he admitted to combat duty. — Not all stages went smoothly. You know that feeling, as if you are running, and someone pulls you back by your T-shirt. And at some point he lets go. The dialogue with the new commander was decisive for us. A question of approximately the following content was sounded: what is necessary for it to fly? And we said in one voice: -do not disturb.- In response: -understood, accepted.- And we started going to study with experienced pilots and engineers in other units, to learn from experience, - says the guy. The next stage was solving the issue of supplying drones, components, and explosives. And that was a turning point. Comrade -Scyph- from a peaceful life was engaged in volunteering and helped to close the requests of the unit. - I called him, I said that it is not possible to kill p..v something as a humanitarian, we have a more interesting topic - FPV. He started ordering us drones. I got to know the engineer who assembled them, they started working together. I took on the search for components and financing. We were in constant communication about the nuances: how it should be done for effective application. They found a middle ground — and for the drone to fly with a load, and for the funds to be raised, -Skif- recalls. Actually, this was the birth of the -Wild Hornets- project, which developed from a collection of -from what God will send- before the release of unified series. Now a party with the same components does not require a lot of effort from the settings. The -Queen of the Hornets- was born out of this communication. And the unit, after the tactics of accurate airdrops in conditions of shortage of means, got the opportunity to effectively repulse assaults with dozens of FPV-kamikazes. The moment came when -Skif- switched from organizational work to practice. He remembered his first combat duty forever. — Of course, I worried and checked several times to make sure everything was working. On September 26, we entered, the next day an experienced pilot left, and on the 28th at 4 a.m. mass artillery training began. They followed her. He was in the air almost continuously until 4 p.m. Used more than 25 drones. 11 lesions. Two tanks and two BMPs were burned, the rest were seriously damaged. The equipment that managed to leave the battlefield fled without a landing party, which simply flew apart from the armor under the blows of drones. The enemy was stopped 5-7 km from our positions, - says the soldier. you have to be ready, as if tomorrow in any case p..ts-. - From 11 in the evening until 2 in the morning I could personally check each drone, that it is armed, that there is a video. A minimum of 15 drones, which I am completely confident is the best calming. I well understand the value of time when you are messing around and tanks are shooting at your brothers. We trained with a calculation so that from the moment of decision making to the direct take-off there was no more than a minute. In a clear interaction and sequence. In order to avoid the situation when the drone is turned on, the charge is raised, and the pilot is sitting in the trench, and he has no picture, says the military man. He calls the sense of responsibility and the ability to make decisions quickly on the spot essential components of effective work . — There is my sector. When I see that the enemy roll begins, I do not wait for coordination. I'm already in the air. Here you already feel the seconds. 30 seconds — and the tank drove by. If you are the first to intercept the movement and take off, then you will be in time before he starts working on ours with direct fire. The guys in the trenches don't call the headquarters with questions: -can I go with an RPG, because we have a tank advantage here?-. We are talking about the fact that the enemy has a numerical advantage and fights according to the anthill principle we have to invent the same insecticide, the technological advantages that will allow quality to stop quantity. And save human lives. -Skif- dreams of drones with machine guns and grenade launchers surrounding enemy groups breaking through to our positions. - During my work as a driver, I saw those who leave the battle, who are carried away. He took out the wounded. In my experience, the picture of active combat operations from the stream is superimposed, and in my head there is always the question of how to make part of the tasks of stormtroopers in close combat performed by drones. People get exhausted, and exhausted people make mistakes. It is very difficult to keep fighting. And by the time help arrives, it may no longer be relevant. Or simply not reach. You know what I mean. And it's time. And here it's a matter of minutes. I remember that the sound of FPV in itself exerts considerable psychological pressure. -Scyth- with a smile tells how he tested it on himself when he was still studying. - If you are caught by the FPV pilot's camera and you have no cover where he can't fly, your chances are almost zero. I understand this clearly as a pilot. Others, I think, just feel instinctively. And this is a very strong fear. When we were studying, I asked my partner to fly on me. He said, I will run, and you fly almost to the end. And when he was 10–m away from me, I was filled with fear - apparently he forgot that he had to leave the trajectory, although I knew - he was flying empty. span> He felt this fear already when he became a pilot, when he had to leave on the M113 for the wounded in the gray zone. Couldn't get rid of the unpleasant feeling, as if you see yourself from above as a target. Therefore, the fighter considers the psychological factor, multiplied by the drone's ability to fire for at least three minutes, to be a significant factor in putting pressure on enemy infantry. software configuration of drones. He makes sure that the drones behave stably and do not overheat. He makes overflights himself. We laugh that dreams come true in a strange way - the division is, of course, not an IT company, but probably the best option where -to be right now, while having the opportunity to perform creative tasks.- — After I am being flown by a pilot who will work with them to immediately deal with the issues that arise. Brings, says, there is such and such a problem, I solve it on the spot. And he is already taking the equipment in which he is completely confident, says -Skyf-. Already having awards (order -For Courage- III degree and -Golden Cross-. - Ed.) and a list of confirmed injuries. He says that one question was pressing morally: no matter how cool you are in the military environment, for the system you are a line in the papers, and at any moment your experience and skills can be disregarded, handing over a conditional shovel. — In no way do I devalue the work of an anti-tanker or a driver, I did it myself. But let's talk about efficiency. With the help of these means, we have been preventing the enemy from advancing in our area for a long time. I think this should be taken into account. When you interview for an IT company, the determining factor is not your diplomas, but how you cope with a technical task. If you are able to solve problems, you are needed. If you can only speak and show a folder with papers, it is not about competence. Efficiency is when there is a real result. The unit began to receive batches of drones from the state a little more than six months ago. -Scyth- believes that it is better that certain latest developments become known only when they appear on the battlefield, in the form of an unpleasant surprise, but the realities are different. — Of course, it is better when something from is already in working form and in working volumes. But there is a nuance. Censorship in this area is understandable and necessary when it comes to the development of government defense agencies. And when the necessary means are made by developers who survive at the expense of donations, it will not work like that. In general, part of our work resembles a reality show. The best series means more money for funds for the next series. When I hear criticism that the enemy sees and zooms in, I remind you that every video is followed by a call to your own - do it, zoom in - says Skift. The fighter has feelings for the drones assembled -in the kitchen- complex -Skif- advises those who want to help, to contact a specific division, with engineers and ask how best. The ideal option is to purchase something ready and tested, with which they already work. The manufacturer must test the drone under the load and action of a serious REB, civilians rarely have this opportunity. — When people decide to organize a drone from a school or club, they should understand that it will mostly be a talisman, not a weapon. I hung it on the wall and look at it with gratitude, like a picture. In order for me to put the pilots in position for combat use of the drone, there must be professional soldering, it must be configured and tested. My heart bleeds when I receive 28 drones that someone has assembled, spent money on, but are essentially spare parts. the development of people with combat experience. - Maybe it's naive, but it seems to me that the one who repelled more than one assault, who took more than one drone in his hands, which turns over at you on takeoff, and the charge is raised , will have a high level of responsibility. Part of the work of engineers is still related to self-made BC or intervention in staff, and this applies to all such units. — There is a question of constant improvement: we still have a lot of things to solve, roughly speaking, screed, chewing gum, scotch tape and glue. The current form of initiation fees is a temporary solution. It must be finished. And not taking out a check every time to think that your life depends on how responsible the person who made it is. Finally, let's talk about fatigue, supports and motivation. Painful points and vision of the future. — There are difficult experiences. A certain disappointment related to how it was in the first days of the invasion and what processes are currently taking place in society. In the army next to me, I see people who stick to principles, brotherhood, when the unit has the opportunity to work and develop. But we know and have observed different stories. There are fewer of us, and those who come now often have a problem with motivation. How to solve it? Much is determined by our dependence on the close connection of the human level and the level of technology. Drones can be configured on site, and the people who are responsible for making decisions cannot be asked. If one is driven by false and dangerous narratives and is not held accountable for the consequences of one's actions while in high office, it undermines the overall ability to resist the enemy. Speaking of our direction, there must be people in leadership positions in this field , in which the eyes will burn, which are understood in the technical part. In particular, I was lucky with this. I know what it's like when they speak the same language to you, and a conversation solves a problem that used to take weeks. It adds motivation. What else adds motivation? When there is support, when there is no pressure on you. You cannot be constantly pinned down from two sides, when on one side is the enemy, and on the other - your own. In the army, they often want everything here and at once. When we were still studying and some things were not perfect, excessive pressure sometimes became the reason why some refused to train. We have not yet revealed our full potential, the direction will develop. And it will enter all spheres of life. Perhaps, if we imagine the end of the war optimistically, I will work with these technologies, there will be an expansion of production and exports, - says the fighter and, pausing, he looks into my eyes with that deep look familiar to all of us, as if ashamed of his directness, and adds: - But maybe first I want to live on a deserted island. Too much painful and difficult accumulated inside. While saying goodbye to -Scythia-, I thought about the fact that for a state that strives to endure and survive, it is important to make sure that its brave and sincere defenders see here not only a difficult the battle path behind, but also the future, where there is a place for development, self-improvement and creativity.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/26/na-pershomu-cherguvanni-vrazyv-11-czilej-yak-vodij-fury-skif-stav-pilotom-fpv/	2024-10-25T21:09:22-07:00

The BRICS summit: what Moscow wanted to -extract-	As of autumn 2024, BRICS members, in addition to the founding countries, also include Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. Several other developing countries have expressed interest in joining this coalition. On October 22-24, the 16th BRICS summit was held in the Russian city of Kazan. About how this event will affect the situation in the world, what Moscow wanted to -push- and whether it succeeded, Oleksandr Chupak, an expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Studies-, tells: -According to the Kremlin's statements, more than 20 heads of state attended the BRICS summit +, which took place in Kazan, Russia. This was the main goal of Vladimir Putin: to show that his -empire- is not isolated from the world, but on the contrary enjoys the support of great powers that form an alternative to the American-centric order. However, BRICS in general has never set itself the goal of confronting the West. As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently said, -BRICS is not anti-Western; it is simply different from the West.- Putin's attempts to pit the summit against his enemies are resonating, perhaps only with his Chinese and Iranian partners. The rest, led by India and Brazil, see their priority as balancing between global centers of influence for maximum economic benefit. Several issues were put on the agenda of the current summit, in the resolution of which Moscow is directly interested: on October 23, the final declaration of the BRICS summit was made public, which did not meet the Kremlin's expectations. In particular, with regard to Ukraine, the participants only recalled the national positions of their countries and testified to their commitment to the goals and principles of the UN Charter, as well as to peaceful settlement and diplomacy. Putin apparently failed to impose his neo-imperialist views on the BRICS member states and secure their unanimous support in the aggression against Ukraine. Therefore, Moscow's hopes that BRICS would become a tool for dividing the international community have once again not come true. Oleksandr Chupak explains: -Despite Moscow's desire to strengthen its military and political positions, BRICS continues to be a club of economic interests. India, South Africa, Brazil and others will not go to a direct confrontation with the US, because it will result in significant losses for them. However, Washington should react much more actively to the economic support of the aggressor, for example, from India, which in two years became one of the two largest sales markets for Russian oil. The visit of the President of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping, who apparently has nothing against deepening relations between the Russians and the DPRK, is worthy of attention. It is worth saying that this is only his third trip abroad after the lifting of coronavirus restrictions; two of them were in Russia, and one more in the USA. If Xi goes somewhere, it's only when it's really important.- The biggest surprise was the visit to the summit of UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who, as is known, refused to go to the Global Peace Summit organized by Ukraine and Switzerland in June. There is a version that Guterres came to Kazan not to Putin, but to Xi. After all, over the decade, the United States has greatly lost its position in the UN, and China has bought up all available positions there. Guterres is considered a pro-China general secretary who, under the guise of -globalization-, trivially promotes the Chinese agenda. That is why he has such rhetoric and such actions. But it is sad that by these actions he is improving the status of Putin in the international arena&#8230; -Putin has achieved his goal by showing that he is not isolated and is not afraid of a long struggle against the West. The BRICS summit should become another lesson of missed opportunities for our partners: they do not work enough with countries that could be realistically kept in their sphere of influence. Europe, the USA and others can offer Brazilians, Indians and companies much more than economically backward Russia or the same China. However, the BRICS summit perfectly fits into the general trend of indecision and weakness of the Western world,- Oleksandr Chupak believes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/26/samit-briks-shho-hotila-protyagnuty-moskva/	2024-10-25T21:03:24-07:00
What is the feature of the 199th training center of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine:...	ArmyInform was told by the head of the Airborne Assault Troops 199 Training Center of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Lt. Col. Oleksiy Gerasimchuk. -One of the key areas of work of our Training Center is basic combined military training for the mobilized. We train scouts, mechanic drivers, snipers, gunners, machine gunners, combat medics, etc. This is professional training. In the center, we conduct combined training of sergeants — department commanders, in particular, at different levels from units and units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We are preparing the non-commissioned staff to replace the positions of the officer staff. We train the mobilized for real combat operations: we polish the skills of defenders in owning personal weapons, in fire training, we teach tactics and tactics in defense and attack, assault operations, the order of movement on the battlefield, work in a combat group (department), local orientation, etc. Anything that will help save lives in war. Instructors work with the mobilized from the morning until the very evening. The terms of training for professional training in different specialties are different. It all depends on the specifics of the profession to be mastered or the type of weapon mastery. In the training programs, we take into account the experience of conducting military operations, the tactics of the enemy, the use of the latest types of weapons and military equipment of both domestic and foreign production. No less important is the psychological preparation of the mobilized. And it's not just passing an obstacle course - we add a run-in with a tank. A person must be morally prepared for war and better adapted. Military personnel should not feel the transition between, in fact, training and combat operations. This is our goal. I will not reveal the secret that with well-trained soldiers it is much easier and faster to carry out combat coordination of a platoon, company, battalion, brigade than with untrained ones. Look, there are no fixed things in preparation, just like there are no fixed things in combat. We must be guided by the principle: a trained soldier is a saved life on the front line. Therefore, we are analyzing combat actions both from our side and the actions of the Russian Army. We learn from the enemy's mistakes, so to speak. We are looking for countermeasures at every step of the enemy. Of course, the exchange of experience with foreign partners is important. Our instructor-teaching staff has extensive combat experience. In addition, instructors regularly go to the front for combat missions. There they see what's new in the battle, what trends are currently relevant. Plus, they were trained abroad: in Germany, France, Lithuania, Spain and other countries, so they know the -motherland- very well. The constant exchange of experience with the commanders of units of various branches, parts and units of the DSHV helps. The combat experience gained in battles with the enemy and its introduction into the educational process as soon as possible is our main task today. Flexibility is important. The golden mean, unfortunately, is difficult to find. The combat is very dynamic and fast-paced. It is necessary to adapt everything to modern realities. So practice and practice again. Training programs should help our paratroopers on the battlefield not only to survive, but also to successfully destroy the enemy with all types of weapons. The advantage in the battle lies in those who quickly used technological weapons and adapted their strategy to it. This is a key moment in the Russian-Ukrainian war. The course of hostilities and their results depend on this direction. The main thing is the ability to do as much damage as possible to the invaders, destroy the enemy, disable his equipment and weapons, while saving the lives of our paratroopers. In this context, drones have become an integral part of the modern military arsenal. At us, almost every lesson takes place with the use of FPV drones, drones of various types. In addition, we actively use electronic resources. As it happens on the battlefield: if the enemy jams one frequency, we switch to another. This is, so to speak, a kind of technology race. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, Ukraine has received dozens of types of various weapons and military equipment from the Allies. No army of the world in history has ever had such a -zoo- of the most diverse equipment and weapons. Students master both small arms (machine guns, machine guns and grenade launchers of various models), and more complex weapons systems (anti-tank missile systems of various types, etc.). For example, paratroopers train to destroy the enemy with American heavy-caliber Browning M2 machine guns. This machine gun is effective against infantry, unarmored and lightly armored vehicles, fortifications, and helicopters at low altitudes. Regarding armored vehicles. Gunners and driver mechanics are trained on combat vehicles such as Stryker, Marder, etc. The DSHV units are armed with the British Challenger 2 tank. It has excellent maneuverability, maneuverability, firepower and ease of control. But this tank must first be thoroughly mastered, its technical characteristics should be studied. Next, in practice, check its maneuverability, maneuverability and combat capabilities to destroy targets. This all requires scrupulous preparation. A person who comes here for the first time from civilian life cannot help but make mistakes, so we repeat it several times to remember all the details. We polish actions to automaticity. There are many fears in society about mobilization. One of the reasons is the lack of proper training before sending the unit to the front. This myth needs to be dispelled. Preparation is underway, and it is of high quality. Of course, we would like to increase the number of study hours in different subjects, because better training requires time and even more practical training. As far as I know, according to the decision of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, it is already planned to increase the duration of basic general military training from one to one and a half months. Therefore, in the end, I will turn to those who are still thinking or hesitating: you should not wait for the enemy to come with -Russian peace- to your home and kill you. Learn and be prepared for resistance. It is necessary to finally knock out the occupiers from our territory&#8230;&#8221;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/26/u-chomu-fishka-199-navchalnogo-czentru-dshv-zsu-armiyainform-diznalas-yak-i-chogo-navchayut-mobilizovanyh/	2024-10-25T20:51:23-07:00
Can work without operators: a new drone with artificial intelligence was presented in the USA	The goal of the new Bolt-M drone, presented by the American company Anduril, is to reduce the demands on operators and provide more information than traditional first-person attack drones. As the company notes, Bolt-M can work without the need for specially trained operators. One of the main features of Bolt-M is its standalone software, which runs on the Anduril platformLattice. The operator can draw a bounding box on the battlefield display, set a few specifications and send the drone on its way. Thanks to artificial intelligence, Bolt-M is able to independently track moving objects and deliver precise strikes. -Once the target is identified in Lattice, the operator can specify the position that the Bolt-M should maintain, instructing the system to track the target out of visual or acoustic detection range, even if the target is moving and closing in.- When it's time to strike, the operator can determine the grip angle to ensure the most effective strike, while on-board vision and navigation algorithms support guidance even if connection with the operator is lost,- the developers say. The Bolt-M also performs reconnaissance tasks that are not available to cheaper strike drones. Anduril chief strategist Chris Brose explained that this drone helps the operator better understand the situation on the battlefield, recognize targets and, if necessary, issue commands for surveillance or damage. Brouse added that the Bolt-M is capable of detecting new variants of older weapons. Bolt-M complies with the Pentagon's principles that robotic systems should involve humans in making lethal decisions. Brouse noted that their efforts are based on the experience of the campaign in Ukraine, including feedback from Ukrainians facing Russian electronic warfare. The drone can fly according to the given GPS coordinates. However, in areas where GPS is suppressed, operators can take control and continue to control the drones, maintaining control over the target and executing previously set commands, even if communication is lost. The US Department of Defense supports ethical principles for artificial intelligence that emphasize the importance of human judgment and responsibility in the development and use of AI-based weapons. Last year, the Pentagon tried to clarify what actions are allowed, leaving the possibility to adjust the rules if circumstances change. A key lesson from the Ukrainian experience is that conditions on the battlefield can change rapidly, and different countries may have different policies regarding autonomous weapons. This underlines the need for more powerful autonomous systems as attacks on human-drone communications become increasingly effective. Anduril's Brose expects that US policy will change, and the company wants to be ready for the Pentagon's new requirements.

They want to pass off wishful thinking: the Russians -in their own way- count Ukrainian losses	The table being circulated is unreliable, and several signs indicate this. First, there is no original source. The screenshot with the table, which is spreading on the Internet, contains the name of a Russian propaganda Telegram channel, but even there the source is not mentioned, only it is indicated - -according to Western estimates.- The error table itself states in English that this data is an estimate based on -numerous sources of information-. -troops losses-, -airplanes- instead of -aircrafts-, -missed in action- instead of -missing in action-, etc. The third feature is the data itself. They are clearly made up, like the entire table. Even if we do not take into account the human losses, the data on the losses of military equipment do not stand up to any criticism. For example, the table mentions -650 aircraft lost since February 2022-. On the eve of Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine, the air fleet did not have even close to such a number of aircraft. Another example is -18,700 tanks and armored vehicles lost-. These figures are also very far from the real ones. Russian propaganda constantly raises the issue of losses during the war, and due to the fact that the real data is not revealed, the Kremlin speculates on this topic and regularly throws out fakes. Such -throwbacks- are primarily aimed at demoralizing Ukrainians and the Ukrainian army.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/26/hochut-vydaty-bazhane-za-dijsne-rosiyany-po-svoyemu-rahuyut-ukrayinski-vtraty/	2024-10-25T20:17:26-07:00

To organize sabotage, the special services of the Russian Federation remotely engaged local unemployed people who were looking for -easy- earnings in Telegram channels. However, instead of Russian funds, the perpetrators can receive life imprisonment with confiscation of property. Two residents of Fastov, aged 25 and 29, who set fire to the local office of Ukrposhta and facilities of Ukrzaliznytsia were detained in Kyiv region. The perpetrators filmed the fire on a mobile phone camera for -reporting- to the Russian curator, and then tried in vain to escape from the crime scene. In Vinnytsia, a couple was arrested -on hot pursuit- who burned two relay cabinets of signal installations that regulate traffic on important sections of Ukrzaliznytsia. The extras are two recidivists from the city of Gnivan: a 28-year-old woman who had a criminal record for forging documents, and her 29-year-old friend who previously served a sentence for theft. A 27-year-old local resident was detained in Sumy, who set fire to two relay cabinets of a railway connection and was preparing further sabotage in the regional center. All detainees were notified of suspicion under Part 2 of Art. 113 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (sabotage committed under martial law). As reported by ArmyInform, the Security Service and the National Police detained 7 people who burned military cars and facilities of Ukrzaliznytsia in Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk and Cherkasy regions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/do-zaliznyczi-dodalasya-poshta-speczsluzhby-rf-onovyly-spysok-czilej-dlya-pidpalyuvachiv/	2024-10-25T11:59:27-07:00

An ex-policeman received 15 years of well-deserved rest for a new career on the side of the Russian ...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. Prosecutors proved that an active police officer voluntarily cooperated with the enemy during the occupation of the Chkalov settlement territorial community in Chuguyiv Oblast. From the first days of March 2022, he started working in a pseudo-law enforcement agency. For this, the occupiers gave him a firearm and a car marked with the letter -Z-. The traitor tried to -form- the collective, agitating his former colleagues to cooperate with the enemy. In addition, the person involved showed the Russian military places for the best tactical and strategic location of enemy artillery and other equipment on the territory of the district in order to prevent the offensive of the Ukrainian military. He even took turns with the Russian military and L/DPR militants at checkpoints, and on his days off he brought food, water and cigarettes to the occupiers. In July 2022, the person involved was appointed -head of the criminal investigation department- in the pseudo-law enforcement agency of the occupiers in the village of Shevchenkove, Kupyan district. The -chief- supervised the activities of the department, detained local residents and interrogated them personally. And he continued to work at checkpoints in the same way. The guilty verdict was handed down by the Kyiv District Court of Poltava. The term for an appeal continues. The traitor was dismissed from the ranks of the National Police of Ukraine. Since the convicted person is still hiding from Ukrainian justice on the territory of the Russian Federation, the term of his sentence will begin to be calculated from the moment of his actual detention. As long as he avoids serving the sentence imposed by the court, the statute of limitations is suspended. Earlier ArmyInform reported that 19 members of the network that tried to disrupt the mobilization were detained.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/15-rokiv-zasluzhenogo-vidpochynku-otrymav-eks-policzejskyj-za-novu-karyeru-na-storoni-rf/	2024-10-25T10:49:49-07:00
The first villages - in Kyiv, 7 people received sentences for evading mobilization	About this reported on October 25 by the Main Directorate of the National Police in Kyiv. According to him, a resident of the Solomyan district was sentenced to 4 years in prison, and a resident of the capital's Oboloni will spend the next five years behind bars. In general, since the beginning of the year, investigators have completed the pre-trial investigation and sent indictments to the court in 26 criminal proceedings, which were investigated for the fact of evasion of the draft and registration for the military. 51 persons were notified of the suspicion. In most cases, pre-trial investigation in criminal proceedings under Art. 336, 337 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine is initiated upon notification of the Territorial Centers of Recruitment and Social Support. We would like to remind you that the current legislation stipulates liability in the form of deprivation of liberty for a period of three to five years for those conscripts who evade conscription for military service during mobilization and military registration. In addition, the violator is not removed from the military register and is subject to conscription in the future.

Moscow's partnership with the Houthis increases destabilization in the Red Sea region	Relevant information published by the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. According to the researchers, Moscow's partnership with the Yemeni Houthis may allow this radical movement to intensify its destabilizing activities in the Red Sea region. Especially if modern Russian-made long-range weapons fall into their hands. Russia is known for its ability to use crises around the world to its own advantage. From the first days of the civil war in Yemen, the Kremlin tried to demonstrate neutrality. However, the deterioration of Russia's relations with the West after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine prompted it to seek new friends to implement its anti-American plans. Iran became such an ally. At the same time, the Yemeni Houthis, a proxy of Tehran, began to be considered by Moscow as potential partners of the global anti-Western coalition. Researchers suggest that relations between Moscow and Canada can be used by the Russian Federation as a bargaining chip against Saudi Arabia. Riyadh seeks cooperation with the United States, which the Kremlin does not like very much. Russia is also trying to contrast its -friendship- with the Houthis with the possibility of the US and the West granting permission to Ukraine to use long-range weapons for strikes deep into the Russian Federation. In case of such permission, the aggressor country threatens to transfer similar weapons to potential opponents of the countries of the -free world-, in particular the -Hushi-. The Kremlin's partnership with a radical Shiite organization classified as a terrorist group by the UN Security Council is not unusual. Russia is very flexible in its definition of terrorism: it has excluded the Taliban from its own list of terrorist organizations and has maintained close ties with radical paramilitary groups around the world since Soviet times. Therefore, a shared vision of a future where the US will have less influence provides the Russians and the Houthis with sufficient basis for cooperation, even with the use of terrorist tools. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, that the shadow fleet of the Russian Federation met its biggest enemy — insurance.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/partnerstvo-moskvy-z-husytamy-posylyuye-destabilizacziyu-v-regioni-chervonogo-morya/	2024-10-25T10:40:57-07:00

FSB in the service of the UOC (MP) undercover: from prayer to information sabotage	The Security Service of Ukraine informs about this. According to the case materials, the cleric coordinated three accomplices - the so-called -polyexperts- who, while in Kyiv, massively spread Kremlin narratives. In their materials, they justified the Russian Federation's war against Ukraine and incited inter-religious hatred in our country. We will remind that in March 2024, SBU employees detained all four persons involved. Currently, the indictments against the detainees have been sent to the court. Perpetrators face life imprisonment with confiscation of property. As the investigation established, the defendants were part of one of the largest FSB intelligence networks, which has been operating in Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale war. Thanks to the prompt response of the SBU, the enemy cell was neutralized at the beginning of its subversive activities against Ukraine. A special pre-trial investigation is ongoing with regard to more than 10 members of the Russian intelligence agency, as they are hiding abroad. It was established that the accused cleric personally oversaw the distribution of anti-Ukrainian content through controlled channels in Telegram and YouTube, Facebook pages and official websites of various dioceses of the UOC (MP). Immediately after the publication of the ordered materials, they were instantly -picked up- by the central TV channels and Internet publications of the Russian Federation, which spread fakes about our state. In this way, the Rashists hoped to discredit Ukraine in the international arena, especially in front of our Western partners.

-Failure crept in unnoticed-: the shadow fleet of the Russian Federation met its greatest enemy - in...	About this informs the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. In response, Great Britain plans to increase inspections of tankers with questionable insurance. In particular, they will be required to provide details of their insurance status when crossing the English Channel. The main insurance options for Russian tankers according to the research: Western insurers: before the start of the Russian-Ukrainian war, most cargoes of Russian oil tankers were insured by Western companies that are part of the -International Group of Protection Clubs and indemnity- (-International Group of Protection & Indemnity Clubs-). Insurers from the G7 countries are able to conclude insurance contracts only if there is written confirmation that Russian oil is purchased at a maximum price of $60. US per barrel; Russian insurers:after the introduction of sanctions, the number of appeals to Russian insurers by the owners of Russian -shadow fleet- vessels has increased. The main Russian companies: spat -ingosstrakh-, insurance group -alfastrakhovanie-, JSC -sogaz-. The financial guarantee for these companies is provided by the state reinsurer JSC -Российская национальная перестраховочная компания- (rnpc), which is under international sanctions; new entrants: insurance companies from Cameroon and Kyrgyzstan provided insurance coverage for at least two tankers from the -shadow fleet- each. As a result, the rejection of Western insurers and the transition to companies with a low reputation increases the risk of payment delays or non-payments in the event of accidents, oil spills, etc. This increases economic and environmental threats to European countries. At the same time, problems in the field of insurance as a result of international sanctions indicate that Russia's use of the -shadow fleet- is becoming more and more complicated. We remind you, Russian generals will be responsible for the strikes that could have caused the catastrophe in Kharkiv.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/nyeudacha-padkralas-nyezamyetna-tinovyj-flot-rf-zustriv-svogo-najbilshogo-voroga-strahuvannya/	2024-10-25T04:21:43-07:00

- The country is huge - did not stand up: why did the Russian Federation add Korean sauce to the war...	Oleksandr Musienko, head of the Center for Military Legal Research, told about this in an exclusive comment to ArmyInform. -Putin's invitations to the North Korean military show that the so-called policy of -get up a huge country- with the rise of a mass volunteer movement in Russia, voluntary mobilization of Russian society with the aim of attracting a sufficient number of soldiers to the front is not working. We see different stages of manpower recruitment in Russia. The first is the ongoing mobilization. It has a hidden character - summonses are sent out, but then the mobilized are forced to either sign a contract until the end of the so-called -svo- under duress, or buy them with payments, constantly increasing the amounts. Thus, such a category as the so-called voluntary contractors appears in Russia, but there are still not enough of them. Secondly, Russia constantly raises payments and increases the number of monetary rewards specifically for contract workers. This indicates that they have quite serious problems, because why pay more if you already have the necessary amount. Moreover, this is definitely not characteristic of the Putin regime in relation to its own population - to pay something, to take care of someone there. On the contrary, we see that Putin is angry at his own population, because they strike at their own settlements in the Kursk region, even knowing that civilians are hiding there. Possible victims among their own civilians do not stop them. There are also prisoners and, finally, mercenaries from different countries. It is obvious that Russia is faced with a lack of manpower, it is obvious that it does not have enough capabilities and resources to meet its own operational needs, to support -meat assaults- directly on the front. Therefore, Putin asks Kim Jong Un to provide appropriate assistance. This indicates that the Kremlin does not yet dare to announce any significant mobilization measures in Russia, because it is afraid that this will affect the socio-political situation and shake the existing stability of the regime. In view of this, Putin is engaging external forces. This testifies to his insecurity and the weakness of his position. At the same time, this also indicates that the enemy does not have enough strength to implement the plans he has conceived, because the Ukrainian armed forces are destroying a significant amount of the manpower of the aggressor. Another positive consequence of reports that the Russians are inviting troops from the DPRK to fight against Ukraine is the Russian Federation's loss of subjectivity on the international stage. Putin, who visited North Korea for the first time since 2000, is forced to ask for help, actually begging Kim Jong-un in the DPRK, first for shells, ammunition, and now manpower, looks humiliated. russia asks for help in north korea! Even 10 years ago, no one could even think about it either in Russia itself or anywhere in the world. And today these are realities - Russia is losing its subjectivity and signing on to its own inability to defeat Ukraine on its own. This is seen by external players who look at Russia and understand that Putin is weakening. At the same time, it strengthens North Korea, because the DPRK extracts from Russia the technology necessary for the production of weapons. Such as, for example, the modernization of nuclear submarines and others. Of course, in any case, the DPRK military is a force. It, like any troops, forces and means of the enemy on the front, can pose a threat. While training in Russia, the North Korean military can create certain problems in certain areas and may even have some minor tactical successes. So this is an additional challenge for us. This is the understanding that there will be more enemy manpower to be destroyed. However, as previous experience shows, the Russian Federation has no chance of defeating Ukraine thanks to North Korean soldiers. Russia was no longer helped by mercenaries from other countries. Strategically, North Korean and Iranian weapons did not help to turn the tide of the war. Therefore, the North Korean soldiers will not help her either.- Earlier, ArmiyaInform reported that the Russians are trying to intimidate Ukrainians and the world with North Korean soldiers , the Kharkiv OTU assessed the quality of ammunition from the DPRK, the head of the GUR told where Russia will send the first batch of North Korean infantry, and North Korean soldiers tried to escape from Bryansk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/strana-ogromnaya-ne-vstala-navishho-rf-dodala-korejskyj-sous-u-vijnu-z-ukrayinoyu/	2024-10-24T20:58:48-07:00
-The idea of ​​running arose after pulling a 16-ton airplane on a prosthesis-. Roman Kashpur and his...	Every year, more and more running enthusiasts from all over the world join this event, but for the Ukrainian community, this year's event is symbolic. Participant in the marathon distance race (42 km 195 m) was Roman Kashpur, an active serviceman of the 808th separate Dniester support brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who in 2019, during a combat mission as part of the 74th separate reconnaissance battalion in the settlement of Olenivka in Donetsk region, as a result of receiving a mine-explosive wound, he lost part of his leg. Roman told ArmiyaInform about how he managed to go through all the difficulties of rehabilitation after a serious injury, and did not leave either military service or his love for sports. —Mr. Roman, please tell me how, after being seriously wounded, you got into the service of the 808th separate Dniester brigade of the Support Forces? — The wife, on a volunteer basis, helped units in Odesa, in particular, and the personnel of the 808th th brigade. Having joined the project to establish a rehabilitation center for veterans right on the shores of the Black Sea, we began to actively spread the topic of rehabilitation of wounded soldiers or veterans through sports activity, which is quite widespread and, in particular, is gaining popularity not only in Ukraine. At the same time, when it became a question for me whether to continue military service in combination with sports, the brigade commander supported me and accepted me into the service. In the unit, I deal with foster care and rehabilitation issues. My sports activity, despite the severe injury, my achievements and achievements play a certain motivational role for all wounded people, they see that life after injuries does not end. In my opinion, it is a good idea to have a patronage service in the unit that works with the wounded, promotes their rehabilitation, and, of course, there should be people there who understand this. As a person who has been in prosthetics for the fifth year, but is actively training, I know everything there is to know in the world of prosthetics and I give my positive or negative assessment to one or another prosthetist regarding the functional capabilities of existing prostheses. - Before serving in the 808th Separate Support Brigade, you had already served in another military unit. Please tell us under what circumstances you were injured? — Yes, he started his service in 2016 as part of the Right Sector Volunteer Ukrainian Corps. In 2017, he signed a contract with the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the 74th separate reconnaissance battalion, where, in particular, he was wounded while performing one of the combat missions. After being released, he started playing sports with a prosthesis. When a large-scale war began, he evacuated his family from Kharkiv to Vinnytsia to his parents and returned. Voluntarily started the fight against the occupiers from 2022 in the -Kraken- unit of the GUR MOU, the 95th Airborne Assault Brigade, the 92nd Mechanized Brigade, the 53rd Mechanized Brigade. It was then that the idea of ​​participating in marathons was formed - and it was so strong that it did not leave my head. But at the same time, there was an understanding - either I stay in the army and do sports, which, in my opinion, is the best motivator for rehabilitation, or I leave. It so happened that the commander of the 808th Brigade of Support Forces Oleg Mazurok took me from the summer of 2023 to complete my service. - Tell me, please, how long have you been running and what is the marathon you already have? - The idea of ​​running came after I pulled a 16-ton airplane on my prosthesis in 2021. That's when I set a Ukrainian record by pulling an airplane for a distance of 6 meters 40 centimeters in 44 seconds - then I believed in myself and realized that I could motivate the seriously injured, and the emphasis should be on the fact that the absence of a limb should not deprive one of incentive and movement, motivation to full life Sport has been a stimulus and motivation for me all my life, especially after my injury. Therefore, in fact, the next challenge, in 2021, was the idea of ​​running a marathon. With the beginning of a large-scale invasion, due to the fact that he took an active part in hostilities, this idea was somewhat stretched in time. But I returned to it later - and in 2023, in January, I started training. Actually, since January 2023, I have been running marathons for the second year. During this period, I managed to run five marathons from the World Marathon Majors series: London, New York, Chicago, Berlin and Tokyo. I still have a marathon in Boston. I planned to run one marathon in Ukraine, but it has not happened yet, preparing for world marathons takes a lot of time, strength and energy, because I have already completed six abroad. Therefore, it will be a little later in Ukraine. —You said that you are part of the Patronage Service of the 808th Brigade. Tell us what you do. - Our service was created to care for wounded fighters, prisoners, missing, dead and their families. At the moment, the staff of this unit is being worked out in part and the recruitment of personnel is ongoing. My direction will be directly related to the rehabilitation of wounded soldiers, because in such a situation, I know how to act in this direction like a fish in water. I believe that the best is yet to come, both for me and for the military, who will need my help and guidance. When the brigade commander is interested, it will be done. I'm just a self-motivated person who has mastered a particular direction and I intend to help others. - Returning to the question of sports, tell us what are the peculiarities of running in the marathon distance? Any techniques? What does preparation for a marathon consist of? - We are not talking now about a marathon on a prosthesis, but in principle about a marathon as a sports competition, you need to understand that it is a long-term process that requires many hours of training and a regime. It is selected for each athlete individually. So it's more math at first. You have a desire to run a marathon, the coach must know what distance, what physical indicators of a person at the beginning of training, what endurance, that is, such basic things, with which he will have to work in the future. Next, the first months of training are scheduled, the distances can be about 15-20 kilometers, we run routes. If the coach sees progress, the indicators improve, then the goal is adjusted, say 30 kilometers in total per week, which we overcome in 5-6 days. If we talk about the marathon on a prosthesis, then, of course, this is a phenomenon that is not widespread in Ukraine, it needs to be studied and spread, and this is still a difficult issue. It is difficult for an ordinary person to run 42 kilometers, and for runners with a prosthesis, you need to understand the quality of the prosthesis, the level of professionalism of the prosthetist - a specialist who makes prosthetics. Because, let's say, 80 percent of a marathon runner's success with a prosthesis is due to the technique of prosthetics. The stump receiver is important here, because the prosthesis itself is made by a machine that does not make mistakes and will do everything exactly, but the stump receiver, which is inserted into the stump, is already the work of a person. The comfort of a runner on a prosthesis depends on how well it is made. - In the last month, you have completed two of the most prestigious marathons, I think they are part of the World Marathon Majors? - Yes. There is one more marathon left before the implementation of the World Marathon Majors, which includes six marathons: London, Boston, New York, Chicago, Berlin and Tokyo. This is the Boston Marathon and I plan to run it next year. I have to qualify for this. I really hope I can do it. - What is your best result? - My personal best is 42 km in three hours and 55 minutes. And the Berlin Marathon, which was held at the end of September, and which was preceded by six months of preparation. After the first London Marathon on April 23, 2023, I became the first veteran in Ukraine to overcome such a distance with a prosthesis. The marathon was difficult to get through and it was very difficult after it. First, there was a psychological misunderstanding of what it is and how it should happen. As for my physical condition, the next day I couldn't lift my body out of bed for about the first 10 minutes after I woke up. And my -living- leg did not want to walk on its own. It was necessary to break oneself to take the first step, because the muscles were spasmed and it cost a lot of effort. After the Berlin Marathon, I just woke up. Of course, there was pain in the muscles, that's natural. But he woke up, put his foot down and drove on. In two weeks, the marathon in Chicago has already been run. So, 84,000 meters were covered in two weeks - there was everything: drive and adrenaline, pain and fatigue, and struggle&#8230; - Roman, what motivates you? - Actually, there are many, many reasons for motivation, it cannot be explained in one sentence. First of all, of course, these are my children, family and all those for whom I live and continue to fight. These are the brothers who died and those who are alive and choose our independence. The latter play a significant role, because they find an opportunity directly from the front line (thanks to good people for -starlinks-) to support information through voice messages and SMS messages. The main thing is the idea that the guys do not give up on the front lines, show indomitability, risking life and health. So, being somewhere here, in a peaceful city or even across the border, I just have to dig the ground and make my way forward, because we are the Armed Forces. It comes naturally to me. I swore to protect and defend my country, and it doesn't matter if it's on the front or in sports. This is the same struggle for the prestige of the country. - You have a very strong track record and service in the Special Forces as well. How was your injury there? - When I arrived at the Kraken, only my commander knew that I was missing a leg. Outwardly, everyone is the same - in pants, therefore, on the legs. The top management found out about a month and a half later. This was already after the assault, where you have to lead a unit with you - on a prosthesis or not - it doesn't matter. When we flew on March 25 to storm Olkhovka, it was the first successful assault after Kharkov, when the -Moscolot- was driven away, there I moved on a par with everyone. And when the tank fired at the target, destroyed houses, I ran so that you couldn't tell whether I was wearing a prosthesis or not. - Did you play professional sports before the service? - I have been in sports all my life, as long as I can remember. Back in his school years, he ran the 100-meter race for the honor of the school. Then I went to the football section, I was a midfielder. Anyone who understands football knows that defenders are the horses that run forward after the ball. And even after the injury, he began to take sports more seriously, started with CrossFit, participated in veteran competitions. Later, he tried himself as a strongman when he was pulling a plane. And came to the marathon. Actually, I stopped at the marathon now. - How much mileage do you run per week when preparing for marathons? - Before the Berlin Marathon, it was between 54 and 58 kilometers per week. Just to run a marathon at a good pace, you need to run that distance in four days, that's good. But for the goal I am pursuing, this is very little, because I need to cover 70-80 kilometers in a week at best. But it's not so much about my physical condition, I'm physically and mentally ready for it. The main issue with the prosthesis: you need to have time for recovery, sometimes you simply don't have time to recover due to wear and tear and so on. That is, these technical issues require research and analysis. Which is exactly what I'm doing when I research my condition. During the Berlin Marathon, I really felt such a combination and harmony that I completely forgot that I had a prosthesis. I thought I had a living leg, healthy, and everything was fine, I was in one piece. This is how it should work, then there will be no problems, and there will be a good physical indicator. And here is a great merit of the prosthetist - because you can be strong-minded, have the desire to run, but because of a bad prosthesis, after 10 kilometers from your kilt, there will be minced meat. This is very important. - Do you have a foreign-made prosthesis? - Prosthesis and components from the Icelandic company -Ossur-, which is one of the leading high-tech prostheses on the market, but the assembly, manufacture of the stump-receiving sleeve (the stump is inserted there) and the prosthetics themselves — this is already the work of Ukrainian specialists. - How are you perceived abroad? - Sports diplomacy against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine has its own positive solutions. We want to draw attention to Ukraine, to show the world who we are, that we are not the barbarians that the -Rashka- made of us all these years. I printed a large trident on the back of my t-shirt, in which I ran, and signed it: Ukraine. And ahead were already the insignia of the combat unit, the insignia of the Support Forces Command and the organization that I represent. We are carriers of Ukrainian identity abroad. It's nice to hear -Glory to Ukraine- in different countries with different accents, and I always answer -Glory to the Heroes-, understanding that the civilized part of humanity is aware of the meaning of the slogan -Glory to Ukraine- and our emblem, our symbols - they already know it quite well. This inspires, stimulates, motivates, because Ukraine is not only known as a country on the world map. People like me, we are all part of the information war, it is a fire that needs to be constantly maintained, constantly thrown in, so that we are heard. Sport is perhaps the best way to demonstrate to the world that we are not just strong, but invincible. —Are Russians allowed to participate in such sporting events? Do they also participate in marathons? How does the world perceive them? - I heard the Katsap language, there were especially many -Russians- in Berlin, but it is important to note that the civilized sports world is closed to veteran occupiers. -Muscovites- are not invited to places where a purely veteran -dvizhuhha- gathers. It is very important to realize that there will never be veterans of the aggressor country abroad, and even more so in sports. The information campaign of the Ukrainian diaspora in Japan turned out to be quite powerful. Two veterans from Ukraine came to us for the marathon in Tokyo, and both are amputees. It was March, on the eve of Putin's election, when the Russian propaganda machine carried out information operations outside the borders of the countries of the former USSR regarding Crimea, spreading manipulative theses that it was never Ukrainian, that the war began in 2022, because Russia came to liberate our territories. When the world media presented us - two veterans from Ukraine who came to the marathon, who were injured long before the -wide scale-. Many thanks to our diaspora in Japan, they organized an interview with us, invited representatives of the world's top media and nullified the propaganda allegations. There was already a -mismatch-. . We talked about when and how the war started, how long it has been going on, that Russia took the Ukrainian Crimea, that the referendums were held under the influence of armed aggression and under the muzzle of a machine gun. With our arrival in Japan, our participation in the marathon, we quite powerfully undermined the information strategy of the Russians, the media switched exclusively to Ukraine, to veterans. This must be done, done on a permanent basis, regularly. When I run a marathon across the border, the price for the 42 km covered is my health, while Russia poisons the world with propaganda narratives, on which it spends billions of rubles so that the world hears their false truth. There should be a lot of information about us, we should develop, wage our struggle on all fronts by all possible means. Now I call on the wounded not to give up, draw attention to themselves, fight and show everyone around and the world that look, I am a man with a prosthesis, I have difficulties, but at the same time I have no limitations, I have unlimited opportunities for realization their life goals.

Guided air bombs JSOW from the United States: what kind of weapon is this and how will it help the D...	An ArmiyaInform correspondent asked Andriy Kharuk, a well-known arms researcher, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny, about this. - Andrii Ivanovich, what general information about this weapon? – The abbreviation JSOW stands for Joint Standoff Weapon, which can be translated as -long-range joint weapon-. -Community- at the same time means that this bomb was intended for arming aircraft of both the Air Force and the US Navy and Marine Corps. It is interesting that this ammunition has the -missile- designation in the nomenclature of the US Armed Forces - AGM -154, not -bomb- (as, for example, opornomu-punkti-u-kurskij-oblasti-kadry-vid-povitryanyh-syl/-> GBU-39/В, also known as SDB, which are already used by the Ukrainian Air Force ) - although most JSOW variants do not have their own engine. - Traditionally, you share with our readers interesting stories about the creation of weapons that Western partners transfer to Ukraine. And what can be said about JSOW in this regard? - The creation of JSOW began in 1986 at the initiative of the US Navy, which needed a replacement for laser-guided munitions - guided aerial bombs of the family Paveway and guided missiles AGM-65E Maverick. The new weapon was to be used according to the -shoot-and-forget- principle, that is, it did not require target illumination or external control of the cartridge during flight. This determined the composition of the guidance system - inertial-satellite (INS/GPS). The design of the KAB was carried out by Texas Instruments (now Raytheon) in 1992. The US Air Force, which was implementing its own program to create a similar ammunition, decided not to hesitate and join the naval program. In light of the reduction in military spending after the end of the Cold War, it looked like a completely rational decision. The first drops of AGM-154A bombs took place in 1994. In 1997, the bomb was adopted by the aviation of the US Navy, and in two years their mass production began. in caliber 1000 pounds - nominally 454 kg, but its mass is slightly greater (483 kg for AGM-154A and 497 kg for AGM-154C). It is equipped with a deployable wing with a fairly large span and plumage, and the flight range when dropped from a high altitude can reach 130 km. - As far as is known, this weapon has several modifications, and you partially mentioned it above. What are their design features? – The AGM-154A variant is a cluster, it is equipped with 145 BLU-97/B submunitions of combined action (cumulative-fragmentation-incendiary). Each such bomb weighs 1.54 kg. The AGM-154B variant, equipped with self-guided anti-tank ammunition, was developed for the needs of the US Air Force, but it was never adopted. The AGM-variant The 154C has a monoblock warhead of the penetrating type, designed to hit well-protected targets. The JSOW-ER variant with a turbojet engine and a flight range of up to 560 km was also tested, but it was not mass-produced. – In addition to the United States Army, the US defense-industrial complex periodically offers its special products to partner countries. And what is the situation with JSOW exports? – In addition to the United States, JSOW guided bombs were delivered to more than a dozen countries: Greece, Turkey, Poland, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, etc. – And how many bombs Can Ukraine potentially get JSOW? - Unfortunately, not so much - considering only US arsenals, not new production. The US Air Force stopped purchasing these munitions already in the 2005 fiscal year, having received 523 bombs. They were purchased for the Navy until 2015 - a total of 1,994 bombs. This gives a total of 2,517 bombs, of which four hundred were used in combat. That is, the maximum number of JSOW in the arsenals of the US Armed Forces can be about two thousand. Obviously, we will be given a few dozen such bombs to begin with, and in the future - maybe several hundred. - How will our aircraft be able to use JSOW? &#8211; The carriers will obviously be F-16s - they do not need to be adapted. The main targets for AGM-154A damage will be planar weakly protected objects. Among these, the Americans, first of all, call air defense positions. I would also add the destruction of military equipment parks, warehouses with ammunition and fuel, etc. AGM-154S will primarily hit command posts enemy, but also road/railway bridges and other infrastructure objects.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/kerovani-aviabomby-jsow-vid-ssha-shho-cze-za-zbroya-i-yak-vona-dopomozhe-sylam-oborony-ukrayiny/	2024-10-24T20:31:05-07:00
the Russians are falsifying the data of the Institute for the Study of War (ISW): what fake statisti...	As -proof- of this, the propagandists add an infographic showing data on the share of -foreign mercenaries- who allegedly received a disability, broken down by country. The initial date chronologically coincides with the beginning of the Armed Forces operation in the Kursk region. After all, under the infographic, fakers write that the source of this data is the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), an American think tank that specializes in researching modern armed conflicts, in particular, Russian aggression against Ukraine. StopFake contacted the ISW think tank , to find out whether he published data on the number of injured foreigners fighting for Ukraine. Evan Moore, ISW's deputy director of international relations, said in response to a StopFake inquiry that the statistics shared online were not prepared by ISW and do not reflect its assessments and views. All ISW materials are available on official resources. Russian propaganda regularly spreads misinformation about so-called foreign mercenaries in the ranks of the Armed Forces. Russian propagandists are trying to spoil Ukraine's relations with partner countries and discredit the military units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in which volunteers — citizens of other countries — serve.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/25/rosiyany-pidroblyayut-dani-instytutu-vyvchennya-vijny-isw-yaka-fejkova-statystyka-gulyaye-v-informprostori/	2024-10-24T20:11:24-07:00
-Radio telegraphed- the enemy: a radio telegrapher and a Telegram blogger were detained in Kharkiv O...	This was reported by the Prosecutor General's Office. In July 2024, the NSU radio telegrapher voluntarily established a permanent connection with a representative of the FSB of the Russian Federation in the messenger. During personal correspondence, the woman repeatedly conveyed information about the deployment of units of the Ukrainian troops, which are directly involved in repelling Russian armed aggression in Kharkiv Oblast and adjacent territories. The second suspect is an unemployed resident of the village. Kivsharivka of the Kupyan district, who administered a pro-Russian Telegram channel about the -situation- in the Kupyan region. On the Internet resource, he systematically presented the locations of the Ukrainian military and equipment. The -blogger- called on the channel's readers to join in disseminating information about the bases and movements of the Defense Forces in the Kupyan direction. In fact, this information was necessary for the enemy to make a breakthrough and occupy the settlements of the Kupyan district. Law enforcement officers detained the suspects, they were remanded in custody without bail. Both persons were informed of the suspicion of unauthorized dissemination of information about the movement, movement or location of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Russian special services are trying to recruit even ten-year-old children in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/radiotelegrafuvaly-vorogu-na-harkivshhyni-zatrymaly-radiotelegrafistku-ta-telegram-blogera/	2024-10-24T11:57:03-07:00

Golf-kobzon — occupiers on golf carts were thinned out by the cassette and polished by drones	The video of the battle in the Pokrovsky direction was released on October 24 on the brigade's channel. An assault group of invaders on golf carts flew at speed to land. A mortar immediately flew at the golf cart, the infantry hurried and ran forward, just under the cluster ammunition of the artillery of the 59th mechanized brigade. The rest of the infantry raced to land, where they were eventually killed by FPV drones. The golf carts were finished off with a grenade launcher and a mortar. -The occupiers constantly attempt assaults: with and without equipment. The drones catch and eliminate Russians after landing every day. The infantry is on the edge of possibilities,- the brigade commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 4th mechanized battalion of the Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky struck at night a group of 5 invaders moving towards our positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/golf-kobzon-okupantiv-na-golf-karah-proridyla-kasetka-i-vidshlifuvaly-drony/	2024-10-24T11:17:13-07:00

Mass bankruptcies: a new trend in Russian industry	This is reported by Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. According to forecasts, the policy of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation will lead to stagflation and stop the export of high-tech products already in 2025. Today, the high interest rate of the Russian regulator is even reducing the profits of defense enterprises. This will lead to the cessation of the export of aircraft, air defense equipment, ships and other high-tech products of -growth-, and as a result - to a wave of bankruptcies of industrial companies. The high rate is also the reason for disruption of the terms of delivery of military products. Since the summer of 2023, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation has raised the interest rate seven times and brought it to 19% per annum. Another increase is expected on October 25 - up to 21%. Among the reasons for the rate increase, Russian economists cite trillion dollar infusions into the defense industry of the Russian Federation, which provoke inflation. On the other hand, the official statistics of the Russian Federation claim that there are no problems in the Russian industry: the volume of production in the country increased by 4.5% in January-August 2024, and the government in the draft budget for 2025 predicts an increase in production by another 2%.

The EU is preparing a new intelligence structure to counter threats from Russia	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The document will contain a proposal -to gradually create a full-fledged intelligence agency of the EU.- We will remind that at the beginning of 2024, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, instructed S. Nijnisto to provide recommendations on increasing the readiness of the European Union to face possible crises. The report will include possible measures to counter the aggressive policy of the Kremlin and Russia (in particular, countering artificially created migration crises), the potential consequences of conflicts in the Middle East, and China's rapid growth. In fact, S. Niinisto recommends expanding the powers and activities of the already existing EU Intelligence and Situation Center (EU INTCEN), including intelligence gathering with the help of EU diplomatic missions and conducting counterintelligence operations. The main aim is to avoid duplication of work by national intelligence services and to help counter espionage targeting EU institutions. It is argued that because the EU does not have its own intelligence service, officials analyze publicly available data and intelligence received from member states, limiting Brussels' ability to detect and respond to potential threats. Earlier ArmyInform reported that a group from Holosiivsk RTCC -helped- more than a thousand evaders. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/yes-gotuye-novu-rozviduvalnu-strukturu-dlya-protydiyi-zagrozam-z-boku-rosiyi/	2024-10-24T06:28:18-07:00

You can no longer cover yourself with a leaf: how autumn will change the situation on the battlefiel...	How autumn will change the situation on the battlefield on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon the representative of the communications service told with the public of the 13th operational brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine -Charter- Volodymyr Degtyarev. — It has been a long time since we have had massive offensives with the use of equipment. We managed to successfully repulse all previous attacks. Out of 5-6 tanks that could move towards us, one could return to the enemy, even if defeated. Therefore, it is likely that either he is running out of equipment and is not taking risks, or he is doing some kind of accumulation process, he said. The Guardsman suggested that the enemy may be preparing for a change in conditions on the battlefield in view of the onset of natural autumn with frequent rains, cold weather and falling leaves. — We understand that now the weather is changing, a cold weather is coming. Now the situation is when the situation on the battlefield will change very much from the overview to the fact that the leaves will fall - it will become more visible and more difficult to defend. The conditions of stay in the landings will become more difficult, Volodymyr Degtyarev explained. However, it is extremely difficult for the occupiers to prepare for a change in the situation on the battlefield due to the onset of autumn. -It's not easy to prepare, get equipment and bring in some equipment in conditions where the air is well filtered and controlled, in particular by us and other units,- said the representative of -Charter-. According to him, the occupiers are in significantly worse conditions than the fighters of the Defense Forces. — We see that their moral and psychological state, at least those prisoners we take, is extremely low. We understand that they are certainly in worse conditions, because even in the most remote positions we regularly deliver to our fighters, using, for example, night drones, provisions and ammunition. It is much more difficult for the enemy, they do not have such means. Therefore, they have to survive in these crevices for weeks with minimal supplies, the guard said. He thanked everyone who supports the Defense Forces of Ukraine in general and the -Charter- brigade in particular for their constant help, thanks to which the defenders of Ukraine will meet autumn and winter properly equipped with everything they need. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Forces defense told how the priorities of Russian contractors on the front are changing.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/lystochkom-vzhe-ne-prykrytysya-yak-osin-zminyt-obstanovku-na-poli-boyu/	2024-10-24T01:52:28-07:00

Therefore, it was a gradual work, in which artillery, mortars, assault units, and our attack bombers were involved. It was a well-planned joint operation, the soldier explained.

Prime Minister of Ukraine: Russia's economic growth calls into question the effectiveness of sanctio...	He announced this during a speech at the ministerial round table of the World Bank. He noted that in July, Russia rose in the rating to the level of countries with a high income (High Income Country), which puts it on the same level as the most developed countries in the world. Recently, the World Bank raised its economic growth forecasts for Russia for 2024 and 2025. Denys Shmyhal emphasized that this testifies to the imperfection of the sanctions system, as Russia continues to use Western technologies to produce missiles that kill Ukrainians. The prime minister called for decisive action to reduce Russia's ability to wage an aggressive war. In particular, he advocated strengthening sanctions on Russia's financial sector, oil and gas exports, and technology sales.

Jerk training: The Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation is intensively preparing to flee	This was announced on the broadcast of the -Edyny Novy- marathon by the captain of the third rank and spokesman of the Navy of the Armed Forces, Dmytro Pletenchuk. Dmytro Pletenchuk recalls that the ships of the occupiers unexpectedly went out to sea several times from the base in Novorossiysk, which raised the question of what it was and why it was happening so en masse. The explanation of these maneuvers is quite simple. -They train like this because, I understand, they have fears that they can be hit directly at the base point. But we all saw that they went there just as en masse and returned quite quickly, because in principle they cannot find other bases in the Azov-Black Sea region,- the spokesman said. As reported by ArmyInform , the Navy commented on the presence of the Alrosa submarine in the Black Sea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/trenuvannya-ryvka-chornomorskyj-flot-posyleno-gotuyetsya-tikaty/	2024-10-23T23:57:18-07:00

About missing persons, non-payment of -combatants- and polygraph for colleagues. Interview with the ...	ArmyInform asked the head of the Office, Colonel Volodymyr Laguta, what questions are most often asked by army personnel and their family members. — Mr. Volodymyr, you reported that in the first four months of work, your Department processed 965 appeals and requests. In particular, with regard to non-payment of financial support and one-time benefits, issues of dismissal from military service. What are the reasons for such appeals by the military? When exactly does the moment of violation of the rights of a military man come? - The reasons can be various, but it is absolutely necessary to find out the prerequisites that contributed to this. I will give an example. The soldier was wounded in the Zaporozhye direction, he was concussed, he went to the hospital himself. In a day or two, his combatant begins to figure out where the person has disappeared to. Submitted it to the SZCH (arbitrary omission of a part - Ed.). Military allowances were stopped. He turned to us for help. My colleagues found out all the circumstances, went to the military unit, in particular, to the commander, and helped to solve this issue. In practice, sometimes everything can be fixed even by phone. Communication is important. We cooperate with the public sector. We have a crisis center at the Ministry of Defense. A very powerful team, which, in particular, monitors all social networks, any information in different directions. If they see any violation of (military rights.- Ed.), then they redirect these stories to us. We prepare both weekly and daily reports, so we can see the emergence of mass requests from the military of a certain unit. In this case, we communicate with the unit to quickly respond to similar problems and quickly restore the violated rights of servicemen, as well as to prevent such violations in the future. At one time, there was another serious problem - commanders did not accept reports. For its solution, with the participation of the -Princip- NGO, a normative legal act was prepared, which regulates the procedure for submission and their consideration. In particular, it was proposed to digitize the submission of reports. A technical task was formed for the developers of the -Army+- application, and a corresponding order was developed. So now we have e-reports, and specific deadlines for their review in written and electronic form have also been defined. No less important area of ​​our work is consideration of appeals and complaints from family members of military personnel, including when military personnel do not communicate. Sometimes they call the commanders, want to know the fate of their loved ones, but they do not answer them. In such a case, the officers of the CUZPV send appropriate requests to the military units and establish communication with the relevant officials. Many people have died or are missing. Important in this case is the creation of the Escort Service in the Armed Forces, the role of which, in particular, is aimed at communicating with the relatives of servicemen. — You recently mentioned that you are working to change the way you date the death of people who were considered missing. Please tell us in more detail. - These are changes to the decrees that regulate the payment of a lump sum benefit in the event of death. For example, a serviceman went missing four years ago. Subsequently, the Defense Forces cleared a certain area and found the remains, transferred them to a medical facility, conducted a DNA analysis and confirmed that these remains belong to the said serviceman. Currently, the date of death is recorded from the moment a person is considered missing. Following the proposed changes, the date of death will be recorded from the moment of DNA confirmation. A person can receive the right to a one-time cash payment within three years. If more than three years have passed from the moment of death to the moment of realization of the right to one-time assistance, the family can renew the right to payment only through the court. The changes proposed by the Office are currently under consideration by the CMU. — The main reasons for the violation of rights — illegal actions of officials and commanders. How can this situation be equalized and is it possible at all? - The army has increased several times, new people have arrived. They need to be trained, and we are also working on this. We launch appropriate courses, provide clarifications, give recommendations, etc. — Are you going to introduce a kind of informational and legal hygiene in the troops? — More legal. There are actually a lot of problems, they have been accumulating for years. — Another reason for appeals, according to you, is non-payment of the combat 100,000. Why does such a problem arise at all, in your opinion, and how do you influence it? - One of the last stories is mentioned. We were contacted by a serviceman who was injured and is being treated at a medical facility. According to the law, all payments, including combat pay, are retained, in particular, during treatment. He already has a court decision, which the military unit is not enforcing. We have started processing his complaint. It turns out that the commander was on a combat mission, and his subordinates did not inform him about this situation. We provided recommendations on how to get out of this situation, so the issue was resolved. — You reported that two investigations were also carried out, and in some cases there were indications of crimes that were reported to the appropriate authorities. Can you tell me more? Are there open criminal proceedings? - Do you have access to the state secret? — None. — Then I cannot comment in detail on this issue, sorry. Yes, there were indeed two investigations, the facts were confirmed and, on the instructions of the minister, the materials were transferred to the relevant authorities. — Another area of ​​your work— observance of gender equality, as well as problems related to discrimination based on gender. Why do you think this question arises in the tenth year of the war? You reported that official inspections or official investigations can also be conducted in this direction. — In my opinion, the issue of non-compliance with gender equality is precisely related to the increase in the number of military personnel and the silencing of the problem, as well as reluctance to respond to such violations both on the part of the injured person and on the part of direct management. In order to prevent this, the officers of our Office take an active part in the work on the development of the Instructions for the provision and consideration of reports on violations related to gender discrimination, offenses against sexual freedom and sexual integrity, as well as their registration in the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the Armed Forces Forces of Ukraine and the State Special Service of Transport, intelligence agencies of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and their subordinate units, institutions and centers. — How was the management team formed? Who are these people? — People learned about management from various sources: heard from acquaintances, saw vacancies on LobbyX, etc. When someone sent a resume, the organizational core of our newly formed Office was already looking at that person. The date of the interview was determined. Some even called from the battlefield via video link. One of the candidates called almost from surrounded Ugledar - and we interviewed him. We also have a principled position: all our people pass a polygraph. I personally passed the test too. This is done so that I can speak honestly with my subordinates. By the way, one of the important factors is included in the polygraph test - regarding the interaction of the candidate with the foreign special services of the Russian Federation and the Russian Federation. As for the officers themselves, they are mostly people with a legal education, some have experience in law enforcement, advocacy, almost all of them have combat experience. — Do you currently have vacant positions in the Department? — Yes, there are vacant positions in the Department. There are also candidates who have already passed all background checks, interviews and polygraphs, and we are currently preparing relocation plans. But there are certain points here: our potential candidates are smart lawyers in military units, and not all commanders want to let good specialists go(smiles- Ed.). Therefore, we help to find a replacement so that the military unit is not weakened in personnel.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/pro-znyklyh-bezvisty-nevyplatu-bojovyh-ta-poligraf-dlya-koleg-intervyu-z-kerivnykom-czentralnogo-upravlinnya-zahystu-prav-vijskovosluzhbovcziv-mou/	2024-10-23T21:21:39-07:00

What is the urgency of the Victory Plan right now and what is most important in it for explains the military expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studios of Strategic Studies- Olexandr Chupak: -Currently, Ukraine is going through perhaps the most difficult period of the war after the first weeks of the large-scale invasion of Russia. The occupier is intensifying offensive actions in most directions, directly involving the DPRK in the war, finding ways to circumvent sanctions, etc. At the same time, our allies, led by the USA, show a complete unwillingness to respond adequately to the increased threat. In such a situation, Ukraine needed a strong move that would attract the attention of world leaders and return us to the center of geopolitical discussions on the eve of the American elections (to be held on November 5). Kyiv had to demonstrate to the politicians and citizens of allied countries why they are transferring their funds to Ukraine and under what conditions the assistance will no longer be needed. Among the five presented points, the second one is the most important, because it should immediately increase the defense capability of Ukraine and guarantee us an advantage on the battlefield. It is about assistance in -staffing reserve brigades for the Armed Forces, strengthening air defense, jointly with partners shooting down Russian drones and missiles, investments in Ukrainian defense production, lifting restrictions on the use of long-range weapons, providing relevant long-range capabilities and satellite data and intelligence information in real time -. In this list, only -joint shooting down of Russian drones and missiles- should be considered a distant prospect. Other items can be implemented in a short period of time or even instantly, for example, -removing restrictions on the use of long-range weapons.- If the Biden administration today allows us to strike deep into Russian territory with ATACMS missiles, tomorrow we will see many reports of destroyed warehouses with -Shaheeds- and ballistic systems that are terrorizing our cities. In general, the Victory Plan is a concise statement of what Ukrainians have been talking about since the beginning of 2022 or even earlier. Ukraine's entry into NATO was enshrined in our Constitution in 2019. Ukraine has been asking for the provision of lethal weapons since the beginning of the war in 2014, and only in 2018 did President Trump sign a decree on the transfer of Javelin complexes to us. Even before the start of the large-scale invasion, the Ukrainians emphasized that our economic and human potential cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of Russia, because it will instantly be directed against the eastern flank of NATO. Interesting are the points about the deployment of non-nuclear strategic deterrence forces on the territory of Ukraine and the replacement by Ukrainian units of certain military contingents of the US armed forces stationed in Europe. Obviously, they can be implemented only under the conditions of Ukraine's accession to NATO and a general change in the approach of the Alliance countries to the Russian-Ukrainian war. Now is such a good time, given the indecision of Washington, Brussels and others. However, the Victory Plan may receive a serious boost in the event of changes in the United States after the election.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/chym-vyklykana-terminovist-planu-peremogy-i-shho-v-nomu-najvazhlyvishe-dlya-vijskovyh-dumka-eksperta/	2024-10-23T21:09:44-07:00
F-16 in Byzantine style: what Ukraine can learn from the - cunning - Greeks	In the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine considered and commented on the possibility of receiving F-16 from this country and for some time this issue was on the agenda. After long negotiations, Ukraine signed a> in October 2024 with this country the Agreement on cooperation in the field of security. All this is about the Hellenic Democracy, which in Ukraine is traditionally called the Hellenic Republic or, for short, Greece. The modern Greek state has ancient cultural, political, military and diplomatic traditions that reach the depths of the history of the Hellenic polis of Antiquity and the Byzantine Empire and its fragments from the Middle Ages. The Hellenic heritage is one of the fundamental foundations of modern Europe. The historical legacy largely determines the place and role of Greece in modern politics, reliably ensuring its rightful place in the world community. However, the Hellenic Republic is not only revered for its ancient history and culture - its significance is also determined by its recent and current achievements and position in the political arena. In the military sphere, Greece can be proud not only of victories in the glorious battles of Antiquity and the Middle Ages, or of worthy participation in the First and Second World Wars closer to modern times. Even more important is the military power of the Greek state at the current stage, which has been convincingly demonstrated over the past decades not only during military exercises, but also during actual combat operations. Along with the ground forces and the navy, Greece has a powerful Air Force, whose air fleet includes both time-tested classic combat vehicles and the latest models of military equipment and weapons. Among the military aircraft of the Air Force of the Army of the Hellenic Republic, one of the leading places for a long time belonged to the F-16 Fighting Falcon fighters, which, among other things, participated in a combat confrontation with a real enemy in the air. The experience of the Greek Air Force in the operation and combat use of the F-16 is undeniable. In the course of the Aegean dispute with Turkey in the 1990s and 2000s, they participated not only in regular airspace patrols over the Aegean Sea, but also in repeated simulated and real combat clashes with Turkish military aircraft. The intensive use of the F-16 allowed Greek pilots and service personnel to deeply study these combat vehicles and gain invaluable experience in their operation and maintenance in combat conditions. According to the Security Cooperation Agreement between Ukraine and the Hellenic Republic, Greece will provide additional resources to accelerate the training of Ukrainian military pilots and technical personnel for F-16 aircraft. Both parties have a deep interest in such a partnership. Ukraine is receiving specialists and additional resources, and is also taking a step towards the possible acquisition, in one way or another, of Greek F-16 aircraft. Greece, on the other hand, creates additional conditions in order to transfer F-16 to Ukraine in the most profitable way for itself. The Greeks' diplomatic tradition goes even deeper than their truly thorough knowledge of the F-16, with Greek politicians repeatedly using it to bolster their country's Air Force as well. One of the clear examples is the creation of the preconditions for the Hellenic Republic to be able to purchase F-16 Fighting Falcons for its fleet from the United States of America in the mid-1980s. At that time, the US government hesitated for a long time whether to sell F-16s to Greece, because it created tension in relations with Turkey. To open a window of opportunity, in 1985 the Greeks entered into an agreement to purchase 40 Dassault Mirage 2000s from France. After that, it became much easier for the administration of US President Ronald Reagan to open a contract for the purchase of 40 F-16 Fighting Falcons to Greece. Therefore, in the person of Greece, Ukraine has not only a good friend and a reliable partner, but also an experienced teacher of the diplomatic game, because the annals remark -the Greeks are cunning even to this day- has not lost its relevance to this day. By all accounts, at least in terms of getting additional F-16s, the apprentice should prove worthy of his mentor.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/f-16-po-vizantijsky-chomu-ukrayina-mozhe-navchytysya-u-hytromudryh-elliniv/	2024-10-23T20:48:51-07:00
Vyshyvanka, Mazepinka and flag for the film festival in Venice: the story of the most colorful artil...	He already has more than seven years of combat experience behind him - he started as a mechanic-driver of an ACS, and now he has already received the rank of officer and helps manage the battery. In a conversation with ArmyInform correspondents, -Lebyd- talked about his military service and what it's like to be the most colorful soldier in the brigade. — I come from a small village in the Lviv region, near the border with Poland. Always liked to wear embroidered shirts, was interested in history. At the beginning of the great war, when we were still in Volyn, a suit was sent to me from home. I also joked that my grandfather was buried and removed from it. And he walked like that, at first everyone was very surprised, - remembers -Lebyd-. On top, he wore a jacket, a bulletproof vest, and so he went on every trip. None of the commanders were against it, on the contrary, they even asked to take a picture. — Later I found people who make historical clothes, they made me a cap for free. Already here in the East, the locals were surprised, some looked askance, others smiled. And the -Swan- also has a flag of Ukraine, which visited the famous Venice festival. In 2022, journalists who were supposed to go to Italy came to the unit. They asked the soldiers for a flag, they signed it and eventually displayed it in Venice as a sign of support for Ukraine. Military service for the -Swan- began back in 2016. During the ATO/OS, he served in the 24th Separate Mechanized Brigade named after King Danylo as a mechanic-driver of the 2C1 -Gvozdika- self-propelled artillery installation. During the ATO/OS, his unit performed tasks near Soledar, fought on the Svitlodar arc. Later there were Maryinka, Toretsk. The officer remembers that then the war was completely different compared to today's realities. - Then there was not as much work as now. We calmly left, worked out and rolled back. Then you didn't worry about drones, they worked right in the field. It was much easier. Now we are working only when we are dug in. However, stationary work has its advantages: you do not need time for travel, guidance. Nowadays, it takes 3 minutes from handing over a target to firing a shot, he explains. In 2020, -Swan- retired from the army, although he admits that he missed the service for a long time. The Great War caught him in Germany, where he was working as a truck driver at the time. —In two days I was already returning home and on the third day I was in the unit (in the 24th brigade — Ed.). When I was discharged from the army, I immediately said: there is no need to look for me, I will come myself. However, at that time there were a lot of volunteers and the staff of the brigade was already formed, so I was offered to join another one, - he recalls. After that, the units received equipment, spent some time on the training ground, then were on border guard duty in Volyn, and reconciliation took place in parallel. In April 2022, -Lebid- and its crew of -Gvozdika- ACS went to Mykolaiv Oblast, where at that time the Russians were advancing with the intention of occupying the south of Ukraine. we can't stand it And as a result, we lasted until October until we reached the seashore. Then we were sent to Bakhmut. Everything was flying there from all sides, it was very difficult for the artillery to work there, they stayed there for about two months. For more than a year, the -Swan- has been fighting with artillerymen in the Lymansky direction: - Now our main task is to deter the enemy. We only see some assault actions, 3-4 minutes and we fire the first shot. The division has aerial reconnaissance, which gives us targets to hit. He says that sometimes 40 shells were fired from one gun in a day, they tried to shoot as much as possible at every opportunity. But in two years, the nature of hostilities has changed a lot and become more complicated due to drones. - As soon as we left, the enemy -birds- already saw us and began to -arrive-. It was necessary to move to a distance where their artillery could no longer reach. At first, we were constantly on the move, sleeping for 2-3 hours straight in the cars. &nbsp; Recently, the Russians have increased the number of assaults, including with armored vehicles, in the Lyman region. -The enemy is trying to capture as much as possible before the winter,- thinks -Swan-. After receiving the rank of officer, he had much more non-combat work. — I am responsible for the condition of equipment, not only combat units, but also -loaves-, pickup trucks. Everything that drives and shoots. There has been more work with documents, now I'm definitely in the UPA, a paper army, - laughs -Lebyd-. /span> — In 2022, there was no need to look for anyone, everyone went by themselves. Now there are fewer of them, for some reason everyone is waiting until the last, but if you are mobilized, then it will be impossible to choose a brigade or a position in the TCC, - adds the artilleryman. combat experience, not just textbooks. -For a gun to fire one shot, many people need to be involved, in fact it is a whole operation,- the officer explains. ArmyInform reminds you of the opportunity to use aggregator of vacancies in ZSU on our website. In addition, a government resolution has entered into force that allows military units -bez-tczk/->mobilize reservists and conscripts who voluntarily wish to serve during mobilization.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/vyshyvanka-mazepynka-i-prapor-dlya-kinofestyvalyu-u-venecziyi-istoriya-najkolorytnishogo-artylerysta-zsu-u-stepah-donechchyny/	2024-10-23T20:37:32-07:00
What is the Humvee's successor capable of: a silent armored car was presented in the USA	The basis for the car was the Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD ZR2 SUV, as well as a 2.8-liter Duramax turbodiesel engine from GM with a 12-module battery, and drive motors for the front and rear axles. The battery capacity is 300 kilowatt-hours and the fuel tank holds 56 liters. Thanks to electric traction, the machine can operate with low thermal and acoustic load. And this, in turn, allows you to imperceptibly enter and leave the battlefield. The on-board network provides power for sensors and systems that consume a lot of energy. General Motors took into account previous mistakes, so the new car has rollover protection, which was a significant problem with the Humvee. The prototype also has other active and passive safety features, including anti-lock braking system, electronic stability control system, four- and five-point seat belts, as well as 360° cameras. Advantages include lower maintenance requirements due to a reduction in the number of parts and subsystems in the overall propulsion system. The prototype provides for the possibility of installing additional armor on it. -If you look at Ukraine, at the fighting going on right now, one of the risks is that if you're found, you can be killed,- said Pete Johnson, GM Defense's vice president of integrated vehicle business development. The Ukrainian military evacuates the wounded from the front lines in civilian vehicles because they operate more quietly than military vehicles, he added. The company learned about it from those in the war zone. According to Pete Johnson, the technology of the new GM car ensures silent movement. The car is capable of powering the systems without the engine running while idling. The driver can switch between -silent mode- and normal engine operation with the push of a switch. The presence of a battery reduces the need for external batteries, as the military can use the vehicle as a power source. Pete Johnson also added that the company has integrated instant torque technology, which allows efficient and maneuverable off-road driving. He noted that such a design reduces the burden on the supply system and logistics, as hybrid electric vehicles use fewer parts and less fuel and other batteries on the battlefield. GM Defense demonstrated the machine at the annual conference of the Association of the US Army in Washington. The prototype includes a Kongsberg remote weapon station, a Lockheed Martin Javelin anti-tank missile launcher and a Drone Buster to counter threats from unmanned aerial systems in the rear, as well as a tethered Hoverfly drone for reconnaissance. The machine can be transported by C-130 and C-17 aircraft, and can also be loaded by a CH-47 Chinook or MH-53 King Stallion cargo rotorcraft.

-Prayers from mobilization-, or How propaganda tries to discredit OCU	The other day, Ukrinform journalists exposed another fake spread by the Russian mass media and enemy Telegram channels. This is a video of an unidentified person holding a piece of paper with what appears to be a -mobilization prayer.- The video states that such a -prayer- costs 10 hryvnias. The footage is clearly a fake production. The ornament used to decorate the piece of paper in the video can be found on Russian stock Internet resources. It is called -Russian pattern-. Propagandists replaced the symbol of the Russian Orthodox Church with domes on it with the cross of the OCU. In addition, in the text of the prayer, all the letters -z- are written in Latin -z- - one of the symbols of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Latin -z- is not used in the fonts not only in the printed products of the OCU, but even in the Old Slavonic ones, which are used to print prayers in the RPC and its branches in Ukraine UPC (MP). It is also impossible to determine the location where the video of the propagandists was shot. After all, apart from a hand holding a card with a -prayer- and a church altar with candles, which can stand in any Orthodox church in the world, there is nothing else in the frame. Russian propaganda tries to show that the OCU allegedly uses religious doctrines for financial enrichment, thereby trying to sow distrust in the local Ukrainian church. By creating such fakes, Russian propagandists are also trying to demoralize Ukrainian society, undermining trust in religious and national institutions, particularly in wartime, in order to disrupt the mobilization process.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/24/molytvy-vid-mobilizacziyi-abo-yak-rospropaganda-namagayetsya-dyskredytuvaty-pczu/	2024-10-23T20:13:44-07:00

In addition, among the representatives was Maksym Butkevich, a Ukrainian human rights defender and soldier whom we recently managed to free from Russian captivity. Among the topics discussed by the participants during the meeting are the Victory Plan and the need for unification. The President offered to join the development of our internal action plan. -Our victory requires exactly the kind of unity that existed in the first days of the full-scale Russian invasion. We count on unity in the promotion of the partners' decision to invite Ukraine to NATO. Thank you for your help in developing the Maritime Strategy. It is important to work out the format of the technological Stavka — a good proposal. Together, we must restore justice for Ukraine, bring a reliable peace closer, and talk with our partners about everything that can make Ukraine stronger. Thank you to each and every one of you for your ideas and suggestions and willingness to work together,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized.

An application for the codification of a new type of weapon can be submitted online	About this informs the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. -Our soldiers at the front need more modern weapons and equipment. To do this, we create the most favorable conditions for OVT manufacturers. The procedure for codification of OVT samples was shortened to 10 days. Many organizational processes were optimized. The -Iron Range- project was launched. This is an opportunity for manufacturers of military equipment to test their products for free at a military training ground at various stages of production. Now a new option has been implemented - the opportunity for gunsmiths to submit an application for the codification of an OVT sample online. In the process of its processing, manufacturers will automatically receive information about the completion of the stages of codification of their OVT sample,- said the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Ivan Havryliuk. How to use the service of submitting an application online On the official website https://www.mil.gov.ua/, in the -CURRENT- section, the banner -ARSENAL- Window for OVT manufacturers- is placed. By going to the page, OBT producers can use the active link Window for OBT producers (mod.gov.ua). Access to the service occurs through authorization using id.gov.ua. Data entered by the developer is securely protected. -For convenience, we have placed sample documents that must be filled out by OVT developers. They are grouped according to some of the most popular nomenclature of OVT: EW means, BpAK, ammunition for BpAK, ground robotic complexes. The manufacturer must leave his contact details, e-mail. The developer will receive a notification about changes in the status of the application to the specified address. Each producer of OVT will receive the contact details of an MOU specialist who supports the application,- explained the head of the Main Directorate for Life Cycle Support of Weapons and Military Equipment, Colonel Volodymyr Rochniak. Documents required for submitting an application for codification: Previously ArmyInform reported that the ratio of shots fired at the Armed Forces and the occupiers has improved. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/zayavku-na-kodyfikacziyu-novogo-zrazka-ozbroyennya-mozhna-podaty-onlajn/	2024-10-23T11:31:15-07:00

The majority of stateless persons in Estonia are the Russian-speaking population, which remained stateless after the restoration of independence in 1991. According to the draft law, the right to vote in local elections will be preserved only for citizens of Estonia and citizens of those countries with which an international agreement ratified by the parliament has been concluded. Four out of six parliamentary factions supported the initiative. The bill received 28 signatures (a total of 101 deputies in the parliament), passed the first reading and will be discussed at an open meeting of the Constitutional Commission. The legislative initiative concerns primarily Russian citizens who have the status of a resident of Estonia and can participate in local elections. It is relevant against the background of poll results, which show that a significant part of Russian citizens (38%) and stateless persons (52%) do not condemn the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Mariupol schoolchildren are forced to write letters to military assassins.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/v-estoniyi-planuyut-pozbavyty-rosiyan-rezydentiv-krayiny-prava-golosu-na-vyborah/	2024-10-23T11:19:00-07:00

About how the Russian command manages to achieve this, the representative of the communications service told on the air of the Espresso TV channel of public relations of the 13th operational brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine -Charter- Volodymyr Degtyarev. — The average Russian serviceman on the frontline is very limited in his rights and means of communication. They do not have any information about what is happening in Belgorod region. All phones and means of communication are taken from them, he said. In view of this, it is almost impossible to somehow influence the morale and psychological state of enemy soldiers by informing them about the situation in Russia. In addition, the vast majority of soldiers in the Russian army have an extremely low level of critical thinking. - Any of our actions on the territory of a neighboring state in order to reduce their defense capability is certainly very important. However, it is difficult to say that this affects the moral and psychological state of our opponent. After all, the level of critical thinking in them is very low, and there are practically no methods of obtaining information in them, - the military explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that soldata-na-harkivshhyni/->the shelf life of a Russian soldier on the front line in the north of Kharkiv Oblast ranges from a few days to a few weeks at most.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/jolopy-u-vakuumi-u-sylah-oborony-poyasnyly-shho-zabezpechuye-polityko-ideologichnu-stijkist-rosijskyh-soldativ/	2024-10-23T11:11:19-07:00

A representative of the public relations service of the 13th brigade told about this on the air of the Espresso TV channel operational assignment of the National Guard of Ukraine -Charter- Volodymyr Degtyarev. — Of course, their first motivation is to sign a contract. It's money and parole or parole, release from their term, he said. However, the priorities of newly appointed Russian servicemen change quite quickly. - However, further, at the moment when they get closer to the battle line, their main motivation is to survive. At the same time, they are more afraid of their own commanders and -blockade troops- than of Ukrainians, the military officer said. This can be learned from the interrogations of Russian prisoners of war. — We can see this by the fact that they surrender to captivity when they could hypothetically leave. But they are told that there is no way back, said Volodymyr Degtyarev.

A representative of the public relations service of the 13th brigade told about this on the air of the Espresso TV channel operational assignment of the National Guard of Ukraine -Charter- Volodymyr Degtyarev. — The Russians are the same, only new. The service life of the average Russian at the front can now be measured in weeks, if not days, on average, because it is their main consumable, he said. The military noted that this is about regular replenishment of enemy units already present in the Kharkiv direction with new soldiers, and not about transferring new units or formations here. — Units and stickers on the map remain the same, that is, we know exactly which regiment, which division, which corps is opposite us. However, from interceptions, from interrogations of prisoners, we see that this is their main expendable personnel. It is constantly changing, constantly supplemented with some other infusions, the spokesman explained. These are usually newly recruited contract workers, often including ex-prisoners. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the occupiers are already recruiting ten-year-old children.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/dvoh-troh-tyzhniv-ne-bude-u-sylah-oborony-oczinyly-termin-prydatnosti-rosijskogo-soldata-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-10-23T09:31:28-07:00

In the area of ​​responsibility of the 57th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade — in the city of Vovchansk and its surroundings — fighting with the occupiers continues. Despite the complete destruction of the city, the enemy did not manage to achieve tactical success. They are trying to change the situation in their favor with fiber-optic drones, which cannot suppress Ukrainian EW means. However, it does not give special advantages to the enemy, Archie is sure. -The aircraft simply turns into a conventional anti-tank guided missile with wire guidance. It prevents it from successfully maneuvering like ordinary drones. We have to understand: the wire is not infinite, it weighs something, and it can catch on many obstacles that are present in the city. This is the kind of technology that they use in anti-tank guided missiles, and we know it, so we also understand how to fight it...- - notes the officer of the 57th Brigade named after Kostya Gordienko, Yak reported ArmyInform, soldiers of the 57th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade were honored at the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the name of Kostya Gordienko, the chieftain of the basket. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/i-drit-ne-neskinchennyj-i-mozhe-zachepytys-rosijske-vundervaffe-ne-lyakaye-zahysnykiv-vovchanska/	2024-10-23T09:01:25-07:00
BRICS leaders spoke out against Russia's plans to transform the union into an anti-American coalitio...	About this informs the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. In particular, the absence of Brazilian President L. da Silva overruled Putin's plans to hold a tripartite meeting between Russia, China and Brazil in order to demonstrate the economic power of the union. This year, less than 20 leaders, mostly from African countries, came to Russia. A significant number refused to go for various reasons. The President of Brazil L. da Silva, for example, was -injured-, the President of Cuba M. Díaz-Canel - due to blackouts in the country, the President of Serbia A. Vučić - due to the planned meeting with the President of Poland and a visit to the USA. There is also no representation of Saudi Arabia at the highest level in Kazan. In 2023, the BRICS summit in South Africa brought together more than 30 leaders (heads of government, vice presidents, presidents). With this in mind, Russia deliberately opened the summit on a separate day from the main sessions, in order to organize negotiations with the leaders of each country separately on the first day and impose the decisions and visions it wants. At the same time, during negotiations with Putin, the leader of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping, said that China -chose the right way of forming relations between countries, based on the principles of non-alignment, non-confrontation and non-targeting against third parties-. The head of the Indian government N. Modi emphasized that the Russian-Ukrainian war -must be resolved by peaceful means- and New Delhi supports -the earliest possible establishment of peace and stability.- One of the main tasks of the Russian Federation based on the results of the summit - the approval of an alternative system of international settlements - will also not be carried out. India, the UAE, Brazil and South Africa actually opposed the transformation of BRICS into an anti-American coalition. It is also telling that on the website of the summit, Russian organizers advise participants to take cash (dollars or euros) with them, as Visa and Mastercard cards issued outside of the Russian Federation do not work due to sanctions. In fact, the Kremlin demonstrated the failure of the Russian payment system -mir-. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that The President announced the key strategy of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/lidery-briks-vystupyly-proty-planiv-rf-iz-peretvorennya-obyednannya-na-antyamerykansku-koalicziyu/	2024-10-23T08:54:44-07:00
The Defense Forces told the story of -David- and his combat path as a self-propelled gun combatant	The defender's story was made public by the -East- Operational Command. However, his determination did not weaken: he decided to get a military education, and before choosing between a tank driver and an artilleryman, he chose artillery. After graduating from the military college, Serhii, with the rank of lieutenant, began serving in the mechanized brigade as a platoon commander and senior battery officer. His first serious test came during the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which he met in the Donetsk region. Serhiy celebrated his birthday on February 23, 2022, and the very next day the war began. Anxiety, panic, everyone is running around the location, this is exactly the picture Serhiy saw when he woke up in the morning, at first he even thought that this was another training, to which their commander was prone. But very soon everything became clear — it was a real invasion. During the war, Sergey gained invaluable combat experience and understood why he was here. The war showed him that his homeland is not just a territory, it is something much deeper. Although it was difficult at first, he adapted over time, both to training and to combat conditions. Serhiy especially emphasizes that all the knowledge he gained at the military college was of great help to him. One of the biggest problems for him remains Soviet cars, on which he has to work. He dreams of new, modernized equipment. For Serhiy, the most important thing before each combat mission is to adjust his personnel. He always explains to the fighters what the task is before them, what is expected of them, and how they can succeed. Morally prepared and confident soldiers are the key to successful mission performance. Having entered the 43rd separate mechanized brigade, Serhiy was initially worried, because a large part of his personnel at that time were rookies without combat experience. However, his fears were quickly dispelled - people turned out to be motivated and quickly learned everything necessary. Their progress impressed the commander, and they are already effectively carrying out the assigned combat tasks. Serhii always emphasizes the importance of quick execution of orders, because every minute can cost a life. As a commander, he is responsible for his subordinates, so he carefully monitors that they are not exposed to unnecessary risks. If he sees a threat to the crew, he immediately reports it to higher management. Despite the difficulties of the war, Serhiy tries to be as close as possible to his soldiers. He always supports them, makes jokes and helps to maintain their fighting spirit in difficult conditions. Serhiy remains devoted to his work, his people and his Motherland, convinced that joint efforts will lead to victory, and after the war, their friendship and brotherhood in combat will become a solid foundation for further life. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Armed Forces of Ukraine demonstrated a spectacular destruction of enemy anti-tankers in Donetsk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/syly-oborony-rozpovily-istoriyu-davida-ta-jogo-bojovyj-shlyah-na-posadi-kombata-sau/	2024-10-23T08:41:30-07:00

The head of the region also helped to -staff- the staff of teachers by seconding teachers from the North Caucasus. By the way, in the ranking of the quality of education in Russia, Dagestan took the penultimate place. Local teachers managed to overtake only Ingushetia in terms of their level of work. Now Dagestan specialists are going to Ukraine with their -priceless- experience. The worst situation with teachers is observed in the temporarily occupied territories of eastern Ukraine. The occupiers introduced a program of financial support for Russian teachers who are ready to move to Ukraine. They promise generous bonuses and benefits. The occupiers are actively bringing teachers from Russia to the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine not only because of the lack of personnel. This initiative aims to change the educational process by introducing Russian ideological narratives and censoring Ukrainian culture and history. As a result, children are exposed to systematic propaganda, which can significantly affect their worldview and identity.

Знижка на комуналку для УБД: як військовому зекономити взимку	АрміяInform нагадує, на які саме послуги можна оформити знижку та як це зробити. Згідно із Законом України -Про статус ветеранів війни, гарантії їх соціального статусу- учасники бойових дій мають право на пільги на оплату житлово-комунальних послуг: Площа житла, на яку надається знижка, під час розрахунків плати за опалення становить 21 кв. м опалювальної площі на кожну особу, яка постійно проживає у житловому приміщенні та додатково 10,5 кв. м на сім’ю. Однак знижка не надається автоматично з отриманням статусу. Її потрібно оформити. Наразі оформлення відбувається через Пенсійний фонд України. Які документи потрібно підготувати — зробити сканкопії: Коли підготували необхідні документи, далі потрібно подати дві заяви до Пенсійного фонду: Подати документи можна особисто у ПФУ або надіслати їх поштою. Також пільгу можуть оформити члени родини за довіреністю. Зокрема, чоловік або дружина. Довіреність не обов’язково має бути нотаріально завірена. Посвідчити її може командир військової частини. Але подати документи можна й дистанційно через Інтернет. Для чинних військовослужбовців такий варіант як раз може бути в пригоді, адже під час служби не так легко особисто відвідувати різні державні установи. Відпустки не настільки великі, аби витрачати на це час. Наразі запроваджено експериментальний проєкт, який має спростити учасникам бойових дій та ветеранам війни отримання пільг на оплату житлово-комунальних послуг. Раніше пільговикам потрібно було подавати декілька заяв. Нині ж подається одна заява. І вона спрощена. Сенс у тому, що значна кількість даних тепер збирається автоматично через електронну інформаційну взаємодію між державними реєстрами. Результат розгляду заяви можна відстежувати у розділі -Мої звернення- — -статус звернення-. Наразі пільга на оплату житлово-комунальних послуг надається у грошовій формі. За замовчуванням Пенсійний фонд може відкрити рахунок в Ощадбанку і повідомити про це пільговика. А пільговик має підписати договір банківського рахунку. Якщо хочете, аби гроші були переказані на рахунок в іншому банку, то потрібно звернутися із заявою до територіального органу Пенсійного фонду. Для оформлення потрібно надати свій рахунок, куди нараховуватимуться гроші. Зазвичай на оформлення та нарахування йде певний час. Але згодом гроші надходять. Загалом пільга передбачає такий процес — ви оплачуєте повні суми за житлово-комунальні послуги, які зазначені у платіжках. Але на картку вам надходять кошти у вигляді компенсації. Слід пам’ятати, що якщо ви не будете платити за комуналку, то нарахування пільги може припинитися.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/znyzhka-na-komunalku-dlya-ubd-yak-vijskovomu-zekonomyty-vzymku/	2024-10-22T21:01:59-07:00
Mice are breaking through the front: in the trenches, the intensity of actions of the DRG of rodents...	The onset of natural autumn with cooling and frequent prolonged rains changes the behavior of animals in the ecosystem. Some species start looking for shelter - a dry, warm place with easily available food. One of these animals are mouse-like rodents, of which two dozen species are known only in Ukraine, known under the generalized popular (household) name -mice-. During the war, in addition to the usual houses, economic and industrial buildings, these rodents also have access to dugouts, firing and observation positions, trenches and other shelters built by the fighters. Ihor Zahorodniuk - zoologist, terriologist, leading researcher of the National Science and Natural History Museum of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine - told ArmiyaInform about mice and people in the trenches. This year it is not an invasion, and even less a plague, but a normal seasonal migration. The term -plague- should not be used now, because plagues or invasions are those situations when the population grows to such a number that animals eat their entire feed base, begin to migrate and appear everywhere in unusual places for them. This is what happens with locusts in the South, especially in Asia or in Africa, they are real plagues. In Ukraine, there were mouse plagues in cities during the Holodomor of 1932-1933. Professor Mykola Gavrylenko from Poltava recalled that when he left home for work, he would involuntarily crush two to three dozen mice with his feet every day. We do not have such phenomena now. But last year's spike in numbers, for example, came close to that. At the time, it was caused by a combination of several factors - failed crops and warm winters, which contributed to the massive reproduction of rodents. When the mice came for the second reproduction cycle, there was no such food in the ecosystems, and the military operations made it impossible to cultivate the fields. Then, in search of food, mice went en masse to people and what is called mouse plague or mouse invasion happened. It should be taken into account that there are factors of migration. Not all animals climb up to people, there are some that are very attached to their natural habitats and biotopes, they do not migrate anywhere. And there are those that migrate very easily. Very often these are animals that move away from people seasonally. For example, house mice. They can form a field population, which with the onset of cold weather returns to the warmth. After all, for such species, a person himself creates a certain attractiveness, that is, attractive conditions for staying. Among those attractions is, first and foremost, that the places where people live and stay are places that radiate heat and contain food. Animals sense infrared rays and ultraviolet radiation well and quickly find out that there is a lot of easily accessible food near people. So the combination of food base and heat are the main factors that attract rodents with no previous experience, because they were born in the fields. Animals will climb up to people more actively, the more a person attracts them. If you arrange a clean trench, build chances in which there will be no unnecessary economic activity, then you will not find mice there either. When, for example, a person lays out various boxes, cases of shells or rockets, throws away leftover food, leaves some other garbage, including clothes, packaging materials, etc., mice will definitely appear there. Because, in addition to heat and food, household garbage will provide mice with a third factor of attraction — the presence of safe shelters and hiding places. It is not for nothing that there is a saying that mice start in old dirty things. It should also be noted that mice also eat food that people leave for cats or dogs. This is often forgotten by everyone except mice, who are happy to feed on food left for four-legged burrowing pets. The fourth important factor for rodents is easy access to water. Along with a crowd of people, there will definitely be some spilled water - a puddle or a puddle, some container in which rainwater has accumulated, or even simple splashes and moisture from a hand sink. A combination of all four of these factors—warmth, food, shelter, and water—we're bound to see wherever people are. This is quite natural, because humans as mammals themselves need these same things and, creating them, also provide them to other mammals, first of all such small rodents as mice. The first danger from mice to people is a chronic feeling of anxiety and stress, because the constant mouse smell, climbing on your face while you sleep, getting into your shoes (when you jump in and need to put on your shoes quickly!) - all this leads to chronic stress. And it can obviously reduce the combat effectiveness of specific fighters and even entire units. The second danger is biodamage. Rodents love to gnaw on something, this is even reflected in their name. Clothes, wires, equipment cases - anything that has an edge that you can grind your teeth under, especially if it's not iron, but some kind of plastic - they will do. Because their teeth are constantly growing, they need to be sharpened, especially when the rodents are -hooked- on the soft -free- food available near people. There is a very well-known story about German tankmen from the 4th Panzer Army of the Wehrmacht, actually from the 13th Panzer Division, who first hid the tanks in straw, and in two weeks, when the command to advance came, they could not get them, because the mice had gnawed the wires and pipes. They started only 30 machines out of about 100. The offensive failed. That's why biodamage is a terrible thing in war: mice can gobble up anything - communications, guidance, medical supplies, etc. Rodents can damage anything that is suitable or available for gnawing. The third extremely important problem is zoonoses, that is, infectious diseases of humans, the source of which are infected animals. To put it simply, these are infections that normally run among wild animals, but can spread to humans. People, as a rule, cannot infect each other with this. The causative agent is usually excreted with feces or, even more often, with urine. For example, leptospirosis, which affects the kidneys, is excreted in the urine. It most often enters the human body through the mouth, with contaminated water or contaminated food. No less dangerous is tularemia, which has more ways of spreading, including through the respiratory system. The share of diseased mice in places where zoonoses are spread is usually 3–5%, but it can reach 30–40%, and even 90% in foci of infection. But even if the percentage of infected mice is low, it may well be enough to infect a person. A dangerous signal is also the discovery of dead mice that have recently been killed by zoonosis. This means that the infection was very strong, and it remains in all areas that were once visited and marked by their urine marks or mouse droppings. You should be very attentive to the symptoms, because it is extremely difficult to treat these diseases, and if you start to the extreme stage, then in many cases it is impossible at all. So a simple rule of thumb is to be safe than sorry. The first way to deal with mice is the -Chinese method-, that is, relatively speaking, you should sit on the shore and wait for the corpse of your enemy to swim past you. That is, you should wait for winter - and the mice will disappear by themselves. They will be eaten by predators, they will freeze, they will starve, or they will migrate somewhere else. But this is dangerous, because while you wait and intend to survive, mice are active and can harm or even infect you. The second option is to provide so-called -mouseproofing-. To fix it, you should eliminate any attractions for mice and create insurmountable obstacles for rodents to get what they want - water, food, shelter, warmth. You cannot remove all rodents from the ecosystem, but it is quite possible to prevent mice from coming into contact with dishes, food, and hygiene products. All food products must be in sealed, mouse-proof packaging. There are a lot of possibilities for this - any hermetic boxes, containers, containers will do. Of course, by masking fortification shelters from the outside with branches, leaves, grass, turf, moss, etc., the soldiers themselves create hiding places for mice as well. But inside the dugout, it is possible to observe cleanliness and not to clutter it. If mouseproofing is a method of passive control, then cats and cats should be placed in the first place among active means of mouse control. They not only exterminate, but also deter and discipline rodents with their very presence. In second place after -cat remedies- comes mouse poison and finally, traps. These can be traps that kill the mouse or catch it alive, after which the rodent can be released outside the shelter or eliminated. Ordinary mousetraps are well known to everyone, so it is worth paying attention to very simple, but at the same time extremely effective homemade traps. First of all, these are the hunting pits, analogues of the -wolf hole-, but smaller, for mice, and the -mouse cylinder-. They work according to a similar principle. A -mouse hole- is a two-liter PET bottle with a cut bottom, dug into the ground with the neck downwards flush with the soil cut. -Mouse cylinder- is a pipe or tube, open on both sides, placed on the ground, inside which you should put a bunch of dry grass. In the -mouse hole- or -mouse cylinder- you should put a bait - something smelly. A piece of bread, or even a foam roll or a wick soaked in sunflower oil, will do. Attracted by the smell, mice will gather in such traps in large numbers. The plastic bottle with mice should then be covered with something on top and removed from the ground, and the -mouse cylinder- should be similarly closed on both sides and taken out of the room or trench. What can be done after that with mice is too much to explain. However, resorting to sadism is unacceptable. There are also velcro traps, which are generally effective, but this is also a somewhat sadistic method. Therefore, as a zoologist, I will not advertise it, but I will understand if soldiers in wartime resort to it as well. Finally, there are also various electronic means, but I am extremely skeptical about them. Most colleagues claim that they are not very efficient, to put it mildly. In addition, they require power and can potentially harm the operation of other military equipment or weapons, or even help the enemy identify the positions of Ukrainian defenders. There is a special section about mice at war and how to fight them - Biota of war and foreign species (theriological component)- on the website of the Ukrainian Theriological Society, that is, the scientific society of Ukrainian zoologists who study mammals. This section contains tips and information from dozens of our interviews, videos and other must-know materials. Some people are just curious to know about it, some want to navigate the situation, but for others it can be vital, literally a matter of life and death. Everyone who lives in the field, and during war, it is primarily the military, should remember the risks of any contact with rodents and take care of their own health and hygiene, preventing the risk of infection and creating the desired minimum comfort .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/myshi-proryvayut-front-v-okopah-zrosla-intensyvnist-dij-drg-gryzuniv/	2024-10-22T20:53:20-07:00
-A forester drove a car from Finland, who -has a tooth- on a Russian-: how does mobile dentistry wor...	Recently, the 46th Separate Airmobile Brigade of the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has an additional option of medical care - a mobile dental office. Since July, doctors have already received 179 patients. ArmiyaInform correspondents saw with their own eyes how military dentists work. — We provide almost a full range of assistance to servicemen, except for cases that already require extremely complex surgical intervention, says doctor Oleksandr. He is a maxillofacial surgeon by profession. Before the appearance of the dental office, he worked at the stabilization station of the brigade. For the third year, he has been serving under a contract in the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The idea of ​​mobile dentistry in the brigade was implemented in cooperation with Finnish volunteers. They helped purchase and convert the car. — The car was brought to us by a guy from Finland, he works as a forester. When I asked why he was helping, he answered: I have a -tooth- for Russians, my great-grandfather died during the Russo-Finnish war, Oleksandr recalls. According to him, so far all consumables are provided by volunteers, doctors also work with Ukrainian materials, in particular, they use domestic photopolymers and anesthetics. — I have a dynasty of dentists, I had a certain supply of tools. Furniture, equipment - from Finland. The Finns are ready to take more, the doctor adds. Recently, an X-ray was added to the equipment, it is done right there on the spot - four seconds, and the picture is revealed. At the time of our arrival, a military serviceman came to the doctors with a complaint of toothache. He says that this is not the first time he has turned to mobile dentistry in the brigade. — At first, I did not trust a little, the guys are young, I doubted whether they had enough experience. But now I'm sure: they're doing great, he says. If necessary, the mobile office can also work stationary, the car is connected to the sewage system, there is heating for the winter period. -We are ready to help our brothers at any time,- the doctors add.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/z-finlyandiyi-prygnav-mashynu-lisnyk-kotryj-maye-zub-na-rosiyan-yak-praczyuye-mobilna-stomatologiya-na-fronti/	2024-10-22T20:40:39-07:00
The electronic eye of Ukrainian air defense systems: what is known about the radar integrated in NAS...	About how productively these complexes defend the Ukrainian sky, ArmyInform repeatedly told in her materials. Therefore, it is quite natural to take a closer look at the -electronic eyes- of this air defense system, which are the AN/MPQ-64 F1 Sentinel radar. But first, let us remind you that NASAMS is a medium-range anti-aircraft missile complex developed by the Norwegian company Kongsberg and the American Raytheon. Its acronym stands for Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System, i.e. -Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System-. This air defense system is designed to attack air targets at low and medium altitudes in any weather conditions. Sentinel (Ukrainian: -Sentinel-, -Defender- or -Guardian-) is a short-range 3D radar that is used to identify threats and quickly alert air defense forces. The radar system operates in the X-band of radio frequencies (8–12 GHz) and uses the Doppler effect — the change in frequency and wavelength as the source moves relative to the device. The maximum range is up to 120 km, but effective operation is limited to 75 km. One of the key features of the AN/MPQ-64 F1 radar is its ability to simultaneously track more than 60 targets while maintaining the ability to constantly search for new threats. This guarantees excellent situational awareness, which is especially important in difficult combat conditions. Three-dimensional tracking is provided by narrow beam technology, which provides operators with the detailed data necessary to make operational decisions. This radar not only detects targets, but can also classify them, which increases the effectiveness of air defense systems. The antenna provides phase-frequency electronic scanning, forming a three-dimensional picture of large surveillance. It is mounted on a fast-rotating platform (30 revolutions per minute) for fast 360-degree scanning. The towed platform allows the antenna to be away from the main unit and work autonomously, maintaining communications. communication with the fire control center over a broadband fiber optic line or SINCGARS, a military-style single-channel ground radio system used by the US Army. Developers have made the radar highly resistant to electronic warfare and anti-radar missiles. Sentinel interacts with the architectures of several air and missile defense systems, including the Increment I anti-missile, artillery, and mortar (C-RAM) system to protect friendly aircraft when firing at complex targets. It should be noted that with In 2022, these radars began to be integrated with the Patriot air defense system, which is known to belong to long-range anti-aircraft systems. Integration takes place with the help of the new American combat control system IBCS (Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System). It is the -brain- of the complex air defense system. IBCS processes data received from various sources, including satellites and reconnaissance aircraft, and on the basis of this, further decisions on opening fire are made. The radar is powered by a built-in diesel generator with a frequency of 400 Hz. The transmission line to the weapons system consists of a broadband fiber optic cable. This data can also be transmitted to the radar data network. Weighing in at 1,800 kg, the AN/MPQ-64 F1 is easily transported using various platforms such as all-terrain vehicles, helicopters or mounted on rooftops for extended range. span> The mobility of the radar makes it ideal for use in difficult combat conditions that require a quick reaction. The design allows the system to be deployed in less than 15 minutes, which reduces the time required to start work and ensures operational efficiency in combat conditions. AN/MPQ-64 Radar.

Lying Drama: Propaganda spreads staged videos about International Legion soldiers	So, Russian resources shared a video about a tragic story that allegedly happened in Poland. In the video, it is said that a Polish soldier from the International Legion allegedly killed his wife and her -Ukrainian lover-, then set fire to his own apartment and committed suicide. In addition, the Russians spread a fake that the body of a soldier from the International Legion was returned to Colombia without internal organs. In the fabricated story, the mother of this soldier allegedly claims that she asked for an explanation from the leadership of the International Legion and was told that her son's organs were transplanted to wounded comrades. Both videos are productions that have no connection with reality. Information about these incidents could not be found on any of the foreign resources. Obviously, this -news- is completely fabricated. With such intrusions, Russian propagandists are trying to spoil Ukraine's relations with partner countries, worsen the attitude towards Ukrainian refugees abroad, and cultivate a negative image of our country in the world. And the main thing is to discredit the military units of the Armed Forces, in which volunteers - citizens of other countries - serve.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/23/brehlyva-dramaturgiya-rospropaganda-poshyryuye-postanovochni-video-pro-vijskovyh-internaczionalnogo-legionu/	2024-10-22T20:14:31-07:00
Destruction in portions - Azovs destroy assault groups of Russians in New York	The video of the battles was released on October 22 on the brigade's channel. The occupiers use armored personnel carriers to throw their stormtroopers into the city, where they try to attack. But the people of Azov destroy them in abandoned houses and on the paths of the private sector. -The suburbs of New York are a place where there is no place for calm and busy days. Here, every hour, the enemy -throws- the Defense Forces with equipment and people, tries to break through the defense line or go to the rear. -In recent weeks, the fighters of -Azov- managed to level and stabilize the front line, thereby stopping the pace of the enemy's advance,- the brigade commented on the video.

For bezREB, Ukraine is looking for ways to combat Russian electronic warfare	This was reported by the Deputy Prime Minister for Innovation, Development of Education, Science and of Technologies, Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov. Enemy EW is one of the main challenges on the front. Because of it, drones lose their signal and do not complete their tasks, fighters do not receive important orders, and missiles go off course. The front needs effective solutions in the direction of countering WEB. To find them, Brave1 organized a -REB vs FPV- Demo Day. The event brought together 45 teams with the best developments in the field of drones and countermeasures against radio-electronic warfare. The teams tested their developments under the influence of powerful EW systems in the field. The work was evaluated by representatives of the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine and feedback was given. The military's focus has been on fiber-optic FPV kamikazes, repeater copters, and drones, which are carriers of lighter strike drones. The military and developers must work as one ecosystem to maximize the effectiveness of front-line technologies. Brave1's Demo Day helps manufacturers realistically assess the battlefield and adapt designs to the challenges of war. As reported by ArmyInform, Brave1 already more than 2,800 defense developments, most of which appeared after 2022. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/22/dlya-bezrebya-v-ukrayini-shukayut-sposoby-borotby-z-rosijskym-reb/	2024-10-22T11:09:36-07:00

-Heroes- in stacks - dead Russian soldiers are carried like firewood	The video with stacks of coffins was published by the Perm independent channel -36.6-. The Russian authorities do not want to pay for even such an economical way of transporting the dead, so they force the widows of the -heroes of the SVO- to pay for the delivery of the bodies. Wives of war participants, who are in the -Hammer- volunteer battalion, complained about this. On the other hand, this very method of transportation seems quite fair for creatures who went to kill in a foreign country for money, but did not think that they could kill them.

The -death line- in Kursk was moved: the Russians were forced to appoint a new sentence of the opera...	About the above deadline the Russian military-political leadership has now determined and how realistic it is on the air of the national marathon -Edyni Novyni- said the spokesman of OTU -Siversk- Vadym Mysnyk. — From the first days of the operation, the Russians have been trying to displace our forces. But we see that their deadlines were first counted in days, then weeks, and finally months. Now they immediately moved the deadline to the end of winter, he said. All the loud statements of the enemy's propaganda once again turned out to be empty chatter. — They already see that they will not succeed in anything. The daring counterattacks announced by their propaganda, when they have already surrounded Suja and everything else, all this does not work. Our Defense Forces carry out combat tasks, fight back and destroy the enemy as much as possible, the military officer emphasized. He noted that the enemy had transferred significant forces to the Kursk direction, intended for conducting assault operations, but had not achieved any notable successes. — We are watching the enemy overturn. These are amphibious units and marine units. It is these units that are to carry out assault operations. There is also a lot of armored military equipment. However, we are already thinning it out very well here, he said. The spokesman predicts that, due to worsening weather conditions, the activity of the enemy's offensive actions will decrease. -Weather conditions are being signaled and the activity of offensive actions should decrease, so they immediately move another deadline to the end of winter,- explained Vadym Mysnyk. However, the Defense Forces do not believe any of the enemy's claims, as they may be part of an information operation. — In particular, we do not pay attention to such statements, because they can also be false messages, so that we relax a little in some sense. We have intelligence, we see who is fighting against us, what forces the enemy is throwing. Therefore, we are carrying out appropriate countermeasures in order to continue the Kursk operation, hold these territories, strike the enemy and destroy him, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, worked with units operating in Sumy and Kurshchyna and presented awards, including more than 60 state awards, to servicemen of the Airborne Assault Troops brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for their participation in combat operations in the Kursk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/22/liniyu-smerti-na-kurshhyni-posunuly-rosiyan-zmusyly-pryznachyty-novyj-rechenecz-operacziyi/	2024-10-22T10:37:09-07:00

According to the results of comprehensive measures in Kyiv and Vinnytsia region, the organizers of the riots were detained. Among them is a lawyer and an official of the VLK, as well as a fraudster who posed as a Ukrainian volunteer. For money, dealers helped evaders to avoid the draft due to forged documents, and the cost of their services was from 6 to 10 thousand US dollars. The amount depended on the urgency and type of -scheme-. In this way, he -guaranteed- evaders to avoid mobilization and unimpeded travel abroad under the guise of a business trip. In order to conduct -negotiations- with potential conscripts, the figure presented himself as a military man, although he had nothing to do with the Defense Forces. After receiving the money, he planned to -disappear- without fulfilling his promises in order to continue looking for new clients. The SBU caught the perpetrator -red handed- in a cafe in the capital, where he was given money for fake enrollment in the welfare ranks.

Government officials - in the Ministry of Digital, in the digital team of the Ministry of Defense - have someone to ensure appropriate changes,- the Head of State emphasized. The problem is not only that officials make themselves disabled through connections, but also that people who have received a real disability - in particular, in combat - often cannot get the appropriate status and fair benefits. The government has little time to fix this. -There should also be personal responsibility and personnel decisions due to this situation in the central authorities - along the vertical control over MSEK.

What to expect from the military of North Korea: the expert talked about the consequences for Ukrain...	It became known that Russia plans to involve more than 10,000 soldiers. How will the involvement of the North Korean military in the Russian army change the situation at the front? What are the consequences for Ukraine? Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmyInform about this: -Does North Korea have enough forces and means to help the Russian Federation? Yes, it has. Gotta give them their due. A small nation of 25 million, it has a powerful and numerous army. More than one million hundred thousand, this is a regular army and at least three million mobilization resources. Since 1953, when the Korean War took place and the 50th parallel was drawn, North Korea has managed to put a huge amount of artillery weapons and ammunition in its warehouses. Up to one and a half million munitions were delivered to our territory from North Korea to meet the needs of the troops. These are barrel artillery (122 1,152 mm) and mortars, primarily of 82 mm caliber. North Korea managed to continue the Iskander missile program even better than the Russians themselves. They created the KN-23 missile. In fact, the KN-23 is a North Korean copy of the Russian Iskander, which is why it is sometimes called the Kimskander. There are confirmed facts that these missiles have already been used against us. It is known that they were used in Kharkiv, Selidovo in Donetsk region, wreckage with North Korean markings was found near Kyiv. So, de facto, they are already engaged in a war against us. From the point of view of geopolitics, the participation of North Korean units in the war against Ukraine is a major historical event. After all, the global axis of evil is emerging, which includes Russia, North Korea, Iran, Syria, and partly China. Plus, even Cameroon may soon join here. Recently, a low-profile African president like Paul Biya attended Putin's reception. The president of Cameroon, a de facto dictator who has been in power in that country since 1982. Putin groups this global axis of evil around himself. That is, there is a struggle between tyranny and democracy. In fact, a military-political alliance was concluded between North Korea and the Russian Federation. The relevant documents have been submitted for ratification in the State Duma of the Russian Federation. And such a step is the final nail in the modern international security system. Putin destroys it and shows that he will not count with anyone. In order for there to be something tangible at the front, it is necessary to create a fully mechanized brigade of North Koreans in the composition of the Russian Federation. This is up to 5 thousand people. They need to be equipped with armored vehicles, more than 100 units, artillery, communications and so on. And the most important thing is the compatibility of troops. North Korean language is very difficult to learn. I can't imagine how they will be able to interact with the Russians at the level of platoon and company commanders. And without interaction on the battlefield, such a unit is definitely doomed to death, no matter how well armed and trained it is. It is quite possible that DPRK units can be involved, for example, in Kurshchyna as engineering teams to prepare lines of fortifications, mine territories, build caponiers and other engineering structures. These tasks do not require operational interaction. Accordingly, the Russians can release their engineering units, turn them into infantry and send them, for example, to reinforce their troops in Donetsk. Another possible use of North Korean units. They can replace, for example, Russian brigades that perform tasks on the border with the regions of Ukraine. I emphasize that in order for the North Korean troops to really make a difference in the Russian-Ukrainian war, a full-fledged corps must be sent. This is up to 40 thousand personnel. I very much doubt that will happen. Why? Because North Korea started war tensions with South Korea. Railways and highways have been blown up, and it looks like somewhere there is going to explode. I can't imagine how Kim Jong-un can disperse even his large army on our military bridgehead and on a potential South Korean one. The most important conclusion: Putin raised the stakes again. What should be the answer? The answer is very clear and simple. We need weapons and more weapons.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/22/chogo-chekaty-vid-vijskovyh-pivnichnoyi-koreyi-ekspert-rozpoviv-pro-naslidky-dlya-ukrayiny/	2024-10-21T21:00:10-07:00
Two kilometers under artillery fire and drops from drones. Lieutenant Sokolyuk told why he received ...	ArmyInform tells more about the soldier. Dmytro has no service experience, he has a military department at the Precarpathian National University named after him. V. Stefanyka. Graduated from it in 2016. Private entrepreneur, ski, snowboard and motorcycle instructor. -He worked part-time as a watchman, and because of that, he got his call sign - -Watchman- - because the TCC was mobilized from the watchhouse,- he says, laughing. Joined the army in August 2023. Assigned to the position of platoon leader. But sometimes he says, he also had to perform the duties of a company commander. From the end of 2023, his infantry company performed combat missions in the Zaporizhzhia region. One of his combat episodes is the events in Zaporozhye. -We were assigned to the 82nd brigade and given the most difficult defense area for us all the time. We had to walk approximately 2 kilometers under constant artillery fire and drone attacks with drops and FPV, at the end we were waiting for enemy trenches, turned by loopholes in our direction, which had to be shot through before going west, occupy them and dig in as deep as possible - so that in the event of enemy attacks, we did less damage. -Birds- constantly flew above us and watched so that no one approached us unnoticed. The shelling was almost continuous, but we dug in well and, apart from some light contusions, they did not affect us in any way. After that, we were replaced by guys from another company, and we safely left our positions under fire after 2 days of travel,- he recalls this episode. Later, in the application for the state award, the military command described these events as follows: -In the course of conducting defensive operations, he repeatedly personally went to firing positions, leading groups of servicemen, led personnel during combat missions and ensured the implementation of assigned tasks. Thus, the group led by him successfully completed the combat task of occupying positions at the front edge of the defense, thereby establishing fire control over the specified sector and preventing the enemy from occupying new lines.- We ask you to recall the brightest moment from this foray. The officer says the following: -On the way, we hid in a hole that was surrounded by tank mines. And drops from drones between them began. But we left our backpacks near another hole and because of that it was bombed more,- says the officer, laughing. Colleagues say that the military man is proactive in battle, skillfully and coolly makes important decisions. -In my opinion, the most important thing for a commander during the execution of tasks is not to panic, because it can have a very negative impact on decision-making, because of which you can lose the most valuable thing - the lives of your comrades,- states the officer. They were also asked about the lack of personnel in the army, about -Busification- in the rear cities and what the officer would like to say to people who have not yet joined the Defense Forces for various reasons. Dmytro Sokolyuk answers this as follows: -The question is very controversial. In my opinion, unmotivated -dodgers- often become a burden for fellow students. It is better to have fewer people in the unit, but only those who can be relied on.''

-No one will be put on it just like that-: we show the -secret- Valuk armored personnel carriers in ...	Correspondents of Army TV -found- these vehicles in the 44th separate mechanized brigade, whose fighters spoke in more detail about their armored personnel carriers, their weapons, training, war fears and motivation to defend their home. The boys are happy to meet us at their dugout, and before taking us to the caponira with the -beater-, we are traditionally treated to coffee. In the East, the first cold weather is about to begin - the fighters say that it got a little cold that night. Together with us to the place where Valuk is hiding, through the already soft ground, which will soon turn into a swamp, the dog Balbes went. Even he lives here in a booth covered with a camouflage net so as not to reveal his position to enemy drones. The vehicles of the 44th OMBr are carefully camouflaged, now they are on combat duty, the crew is ready to go on a mission at any moment. And while the guys have a little time, they will tell us what kind of armored personnel carrier it is and how it is used. Almost a quarter of a century ago, Slovenia produced these vehicles for its Armed Forces thanks to a license agreement with the Austrian manufacturer of light wheeled armored vehicles Pandur. They were named in honor of the prince of the ancient Slovenian state of Karantania. The guys say that they now have a -commander's- car on duty. Here, in contrast to the base model, there are not six landing places, but four. Such an armored personnel carrier is also distinguished by the fact that it has a separate hole in the armor for the commander to view. Three more seats in all models are provided for the crew. But if necessary, the landing party can also be carried on armor. It is interesting that in almost all photos on the Internet, cars have special -huts- for mechanical drives. But the guys said that they only protect from rain and are intended purely for transportation. Therefore, they removed them from their car. &nbsp; In general, these 12-ton light armored vehicles are also purely transport, sanitary and even mortar. But the soldiers of the 44th OMBr Valuk are equipped with a grenade launcher. The manufacturer claims that it has a range of 600 km. But Oleksiy, the driver-mechanic, tells us that on a dirt road, a full tank is enough for 300 km, and the tank holds 270 liters of -diesel-. -In terms of speed, it gains a hundred on asphalt, and it drives on a country road, that's if it's dry,- says the fighter and admits that the car, although not new, is clearly made of high quality. Before engaging Valuk in combat operations, the Ukrainian and Slovenian military conducted thorough training of equipment and personnel. First, training in combat work in Ukraine, and then all the subtleties, technical points and fixing already in Germany. Oleksiy remembers the time spent abroad very fondly. Slovenian instructors taught our boys at the German training ground. They practiced taking tank ditches, overcoming minefields, transporting infantry. The gunner-operator of the armored personnel carrier with the call sign -Password- does not recall particularly funny situations during the training, because there was a lot of work. Instead, he says that our guys used to get stuck in the hatches, because there is not much space for the crew in these cars. Oleksiy remembered how the Slovenes saw off the Ukrainians after the exercises with tears in their eyes: -They treated us kind of well. I liked both the training itself and their attitude towards us. It can be seen that it was not a command instruction, it was human.- Mehvod adds that the Slovenian military perfectly understood everything and supported, one might even say, took care in order to have time to teach everything and transfer the equipment while there is such an opportunity. In general, guys positively evaluate the construction of this -beater-. Nothing difficult in maintenance and use, especially after intensive training, is not seen. Of the additional -chips-, Mekhvod mentions interior heating and -Webasto-. He starts Valuk with us and says that he will not let his car out of the hood without blowing it. We must note that the APC itself is not silent. If we talk about weather conditions, then there is no need to talk about any exceptional passability. As for any wheeled vehicle. It is difficult in the mud, more or less drives on sand and snow, says Oleksiy and adds that this APC has a Scania engine, an American gearbox, an automatic fire extinguishing system and a radiation/chemical protection system. -Everything is done reliably, you can feel it,- he says. Mentions that there are means to work at night, but notes that technologically this is not what is currently relevant on the battlefield. The gunner -Parol- already tells us about the open turret: -You stand up to your waist in it. The turret itself is barely below my chest. Looks like a lot, actually, that's the big minus of it.- -That is, imagine, you drive a kilometer and a half to the goal and you look half of it. We have a drone war, it's very dangerous.- When it comes to the use of these -beaters-, we joke with the guys that Valuk is an armored -taxi-. Gunner -Parol- fixes it right away: a lightly armored -taxi- with a grenade launcher and a solid bottom that can protect against anti-personnel mines. Yes, in addition to the main armor, which is designed to hit 7.62 mm caliber, there are also Kevlar plates inside. Separately, there is an external hinged ceramic protection, but our fighters did not see it. The frontal armor is designed to hit 12.7 mm caliber. A gunner-operator, who used to serve in a machine gun platoon, sets up, loads and tells us about his German 40 mm automatic grenade launcher, an analogue of the Mk 19. He says that the range of the grenade launcher, so that it works on target, is one and a half kilometers. -Anyone will not be allowed to work on such equipment,- explains Parol, who joined the army long before the large-scale invasion and fought in the 72nd OMBr. He was in the infantry, then he was wounded and ended up in the 44th OMBr. Killing power is 105 squares, and it covers 15 squares with shrapnel. m; against infantry, against lightly armored vehicles, the tool is very good, effective, -Password- states. But still, he believes that the Valuk is best suited as a delivery or evacuation of infantry. His brother Oleksiy agrees with him, adding that due to the risk of falling under the FPV pack, it is difficult to use this -beater- for its direct purpose. -He maneuvers very well, the speed is there. You can fly in quickly, the rear ramp has been lowered, the infantry is already in place, what is needed. He does a very good job at this,- summarizes Parol. The guys say that they are released on vacation according to the law. But still, 30 days a year is not that much. They advise you to join the Armed Forces, taking into account your skills, because simply wanting to take up a position is not enough. When asked what he remembers most about the war, -Password- answers: -It's primarily the people, not the combat stories. Most of all, I will remember my brothers, the team, the boys, the people present here. Here, someone always saves someone, we help each other.- And yes, if we talk about combat operations, he admits that it is often scary. -But it's natural, and you have to learn to control your fear,- says the gunner and adds that a well-coordinated team, brothers in whom you are confident, helps especially in this. -I'm only interested in one thing - that everyone is alive, healthy and doing their job,- the fighter explains. When asked what he would say to civilians who are still hesitating whether to join the army, Parol answers that he should go help. -It's just necessary. There is such a word -must-. And that's it. Scary, yes. There is nothing good here. We have to, because it will be worse. Worse for everyone. They will just come home to you, he reasoned emotionally. -Something must be done, because we will be destroyed as a people.- It's hard not to agree with what Password says.

The US conducted the first successful tests of missile reloading and ship rearmament at sea	The US Navy is moving closer to re-arming its surface combatant ships at sea because of the ongoing missile threat to military and commercial shipping, writes U.S. Naval Institute. -Without the ability to re-arm at sea, our servicemen must return to port, sometimes thousands of miles away, as they sometimes have to do in the Red Sea. After we launch the missiles, we will have to return to other ports to re-arm. The ability to rearm at sea will be critical to any future conflict in the Pacific and elsewhere,- US Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said. The Minister was personally present at the tests and observed the Transportable At-Sea Reloading Method (TRAM) during the resupply operation of the MK-41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) when both ships were underway. The TRAM concept is not new. In the 1990s, engineers at the Naval Surface Warfare Center developed a prototype idea for replenishing VLS stores on warships. But after the Gulf War, the prototype was never fully developed, and the system remained in storage as the anticipated need for such sea-based refueling capabilities diminished. In 2022, Del Toro revived the idea. Early experiments involved reloading two destroyers using a crane and a support vessel in San Diego Bay in October 2022. Despite the fact that TRAM is a 30-year-old idea, according to Rear Admiral Peter Small, the technology is certainly helping and has allowed for the demonstration of control and precision in mission execution. -This will really affect our next steps as we move towards scaling this capability and deploying it on both cruisers and destroyers,- Small said. Currently, experts are studying the collected data to scale the project to all possible types of weapons on American surface combat ships. Research is also underway to integrate TRAM on other US Navy vessels.

A ticket to a sanatorium or TV: propaganda lies about -inviting- pensioners to join the army	How found out fact-checkers of Ukrinform, the leaflet distributed on the network is a fake created by propagandists. At most, the photo of a man in American military uniform, which was used for a fake, can be found on stock image sites. The Russians like to use the image of this particular man in a uniform for various advertisements. For example, it appears in publications about military stocks in the Russian Federation. It is not the first time that the occupiers have speculated on the topic of pensioners. Earlier, propagandists launched a fake that allegedly -employees of the TCC and SP pay pensioners to turn in evasion.- Such -news- are outright lies and delusions aimed at discrediting the Ukrainian military. In this way, the Russian special services seek to weaken Ukraine's defense capabilities. Such fakes are created to confirm the opinion that nobody in Ukraine wants to defend their country, and war seems to benefit only the ruling elite. Russia also promotes the narrative that Ukraine no longer has the human resources to fight the aggressor with lies about service in the retired army.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/22/putivka-do-sanatoriyu-abo-televizor-rospropaganda-breshe-pro-zaproshennya-pensioneriv-do-vijska/	2024-10-21T20:19:33-07:00

About this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- spoken the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Lt. Col. Yevgeny Romanov. — In our area of ​​responsibility, I have not seen an increase in airstrikes with the use of air defense systems. Yes, they are used, but they are not very accurate weapons, he said. The spokesman reported that the Russian aggressors are constantly experimenting and trying to improve anti-aircraft missiles, and explained what this is all about. — They are experimenting with the application and modernization of these tools. This technology is not perfect, but they are forced to do it because they can no longer get so close to the launch points of these KABs, the officer explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that last day, the Russian military chaotically hit Kharkov with KABs to terrorize local residents and collected photo and video evidence of these war crimes of the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/21/modernizuyut-kaby-shho-zmushuye-okupantiv-do-tehnichnyh-novaczij-na-harkivskomu-napryamku/	2024-10-21T11:57:55-07:00

We need the determination of our partners, especially against the background of information about North Korea's new role in supporting Russia,- the President said. In his opinion, Putin is afraid of peace and that is why he is looking for ways to increase aggression and now bring North Korea to the front. -This is a clear signal to the whole world who only wants war. And in such a situation, I am grateful to every leader and every state that is now increasing its support for Ukraine. Those who supported the first inaugural peace summit are also helping us prepare for the second summit. To prepare it in such a way that it becomes truly effective,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He reminded that more than a hundred countries and international organizations were with Ukraine at the first peace summit. All the principles of peace restoration that Ukraine proposed are completely based on the UN Charter and key international documents. -Then, in June, when 100 participants gathered to support peace for Ukraine and the full effectiveness of the UN Charter. Indeed, they felt that all states were equal at the table. There was real respect for the norms of international law. And this is exactly what the second peace summit should be,- said the President.

The Kursk operation was discussed separately. We hold our positions there,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy assured. He thanked each soldier for their bravery. -We must remember that the Kursk operation provides a strategic goal: the war must return to the territory from which it came.

What are the enemy's technical innovations and how can they be countered on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- he told spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Lt. Col. Yevhenii Romanov. — Technologies in war are developing very rapidly, so certain technical solutions are based on other technical solutions for countermeasures. Therefore, the enemy, in the conditions of using various countermeasures, decided that wire technologies would help him, he said. However, the military officer noted, such innovations also have certain limitations. -But they impose certain restrictions, that is, the unmanned aerial vehicle turns into a conventional anti-tank guided missile with wire guidance, which imposes certain restrictions on the tactics of its use,- the officer noted. At the same time, it is not only about the range of use of the aerial drone, but also about the ability of the UAV to maneuver among obstacles and the dependence on control over the fiber optic thread. — The wire is not infinite, it weighs something and it can get caught or on some obstacles, obstacles. This is the kind of technology used in anti-tank missiles, the spokesman explained. He noted that there are already ways to counter such drones, including adaptation to the new conditions of standard anti-aircraft defense schemes.

Masters of Hide and Seek: The Black Sea Fleet is almost impossible to find	About this told spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk According to him, the Russians currently cannot actually use their fleet as intended. Their choices are limited to either hiding in ports or participating in combined missile attacks. Returning to Crimea is not even considered now. -And in fact, if they were guided, first of all, by military expediency, they would probably have already left the Azov-Black Sea region. This would be in the tradition of the Russian Imperial Navy, they have done it many times. And during the Second World War and in the middle of the 19th century,- noted Dmytro Pletenchuk. In fact, the Russians can no longer use their fleet for their intended purpose. -Yes, they can go to sea and join a combined attack and launch some number of 'Calibres'. In the last attack, they did just that — they launched 28 units. 100% of these missiles were destroyed. Therefore, the effectiveness of the presence of the Black Sea Fleet in the Azov-Black Sea region is in great question. And we know the answer to this question, which the Russians still cannot accept,- stated the spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Earlier ArmyInform told that Russian ships froze in the Mediterranean Sea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/21/majstry-gry-v-hovanky-znajty-chornomorskyj-flot-majzhe-nemozhlyvo/	2024-10-21T08:03:09-07:00

According to the available information, the losses of the aggressor in this direction amounted to 490 people killed and wounded, of which 257 were irreversible. One tank, nine armored personnel carriers, four cars, two BMPs and three buggies were destroyed. In addition, two tanks, three armored personnel carriers, four cars, two enemy guns and one motorcycle were damaged. It is the hottest now in the Kurakhiv direction, at this time of the day there are 53 combat clashes. The invaders remain highly active, trying to advance in the areas of the settlements of Hirnyk, Novodmytrivka, Kurakhivka, Kostyantynivka, Maksimilianivka, Antonivka, Kurakhove, Vodyane. Defense Forces units have repulsed 51 enemy attacks, two of which are still ongoing. 11 skirmishes took place in the Vremivsk direction. Seven enemy assaults were stopped in the Bogoyavlenka district, one near Novoukrainka. There are three more fights to go. The situation is controlled by the Defense Forces of Ukraine. Also, the enemy actively used aviation in the area of ​​Novodarivka, Bogoyavlenka and Velika Novosilka. In the Orichivsk direction three unsuccessful enemy attacks were repulsed by our defenders during the day in the Robotyny region. In the Dnieper direction our soldiers six times repelled the attacks of the Russian invaders on the positions of the Ukrainian army. Defense forces of Ukraine continue the operation in the Kursk region. Enemy aviation continues to strike with guided aerial bombs on the territory of Russia. At the moment, 21 air strikes are known with the use of 43 anti-aircraft missiles. There were no significant changes in the situation in other directions. In the department, the soldiers of the 128th Separate Mountain Assault Transcarpathian Brigade were noted brigades, which in extremely difficult conditions, hold back the attacks of the enemy's superior forces, causing him irreparable losses. As reported by ArmyInform, tankers of the 58th motorized infantry brigade named after Hetman Ivan Vyhovsky under enemy fire, they were able to reach the Russian position and shoot it at close range.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/21/aviaudary-drony-kamikadze-ta-tysyachi-obstriliv-sytuacziya-na-fronti-zalyshayetsya-skladnoyu/	2024-10-20T21:16:47-07:00
-Chinese-, -Grandfather-, -Chaplain- and -Doctor-: how the -four musketeers- stormed the house at In...	During Russia's modern aggressive war against Ukraine, it is difficult in Cuba, because aerial bombardment, massive artillery fire, as well as air and, to a lesser extent, ground drones make their corrections. It is possible to prepare for battle under such circumstances only under the conditions of multi-stage training, which involves a combination of various components and modules, the combination and composition of which will allow the fighter to choose the correct tactics of action in a specific tactical situation. An ArmyInform correspondent tells about one of these -tactical modules- from instructors of NATO countries during the BZVP as part of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. During training, we are not given callsigns - it would be too difficult for instructors, especially foreign ones, to remember familiar Ukrainian words and relate them to a specific cadet. So we have numbers - 24 or 26, 32 or 36. We call each other by our names, but we have already managed to come up with -call names-: -Chaplain-, -Chinese-, -Grandfather- and -Doctor-. It's more of a want than a necessity during training, but the girls decided and insisted that everyone in the department must have a call sign. I really don't like my call sign or the call signs of my comrades, because they are clearly not original: -Chaplains-, -Chinese-, -Grandfathers- and -Doctors- in the ZSU are already plentiful. Therefore, I consider callsigns -educational- and just as temporary as numbers. During classes, we often practice exercises with just such a four, changing places in it from the first to the fourth. It helps a lot, because we learned to understand each other in half a word and even in moments. However, there is also the flip side of the coin - when we, on our own initiative or on the orders of the instructors, individually or in pairs, move to another four, the developed coordination disappears. However, the ability to interact with all the soldiers of the unit and platoon, so we are -shuffled- from time to time. We do not object and often resort to -internal rotation- ourselves, even without the orders of the instructors. However, when it comes to the -testing and demonstration- performance of the exercise, we try to gather exactly -our- four. And this time, when we go to -test- with -foreign- instructors. They are strangers only conditionally, because they train one of the other platoons on a regular basis. However, neither they nor we know them as well as the instructors who train us all the time. The replacement of teachers is resorted to from time to time for various reasons - to give colleagues a break, to organize classes with the best specialist, or, as is the case now, to accept the test without prejudice to the cadets. -Our- instructors, after several weeks of continuous classes, not only perceive us as close people, but also sometimes show this attitude. So, in order to prevent any kind of leniency, we are sent to -spouses- as a test. However, it is thanks to working with -foreign- instructors that we are able to assemble our usual four. Not knowing our -inner kitchen- in detail, trainers from the neighboring platoon do not pay attention to it. More than anything, if we were to pass the test to our instructors, they would make us shuffle. However, for now, we are relishing the opportunity to get together as a foursome. We let others go ahead of us, because we decided to be the last to go to the test. We remind each other of the actions during the storming and clearing of the house. Previously, we had already worked out all the modules as separate elements and assembled them several times. So now it's obviously going to be a comprehensive exercise taking into account all the actions we know. Finally, it's our turn and we head down the street in the direction of the house. We know how to approach a building, what factors to consider and how to control dangerous sectors. We know how to climb the stairs, open the door, go inside and climb the stairs again. We know how to move between floors and rooms, how to detect mine traps and avoid them, how to notice the presence of the enemy and react to it. We now apply all our knowledge comprehensively and act as one team. Eyes, trunks and bodies move as if in a dance that is understandable only to those who know why and why each of us performs this or that action in this way and not otherwise. During practice outside and inside the house, we change places several times, when the first becomes the second, third or last, and the fourth, on the contrary, takes the place of the first. When we switch places, the fuses click quietly and harmoniously. Actions with automatic weapons resemble fencing techniques - lunges are sharp or smooth, fast or slow, visible or hidden. Movements are honed to automatism - we act first, and then we realize why we acted the way we did. Only later will I realize that I felt like a musketeer and belatedly give myself the commands -En guarde- and -Allez!-. It will happen after the command to stop sounds and the instructors invite us to step-by-step review of our actions. At some point, I open fire into a dark doorway a split second earlier than a counter-shot from a notional enemy. The sounds of the two shots almost merge into one and I pile on another 5 or 7 shots until the enemy stops firing back. What made me shoot first can be found out only later during the -after-action review- - -flight analysis-. Instructors invite to him and ask in detail why we acted in this way and not in another way. They approvingly listen to their fellow citizens - who, how and why opened the door, entered the room first, threw a grenade. Everything is done right - from the moment of driving down the street to the command -Halte!-. At some point I have to answer why I shot into the dark hole and at first I don't know what to say. -The movement of air ahead, the hint of a dark silhouette and the click of an enemy weapon's safety,- I finally articulate. -Is that enough to open fire?- the instructor asks. I have to admit that I didn't, because I didn't identify the enemy with sufficient certainty and could have shot at best into the void and at worst into a civilian, maybe even a child. -But it turned out to be the enemy and I even outran the enemy in the first shot!- - I try to justify myself, but it does not help. My mistake is too obvious, and because of it, I am doubly sorry. Now it remains only to wait for the verdict of the instructors. We are offered to evaluate our actions on our own, and I honestly admit that I messed everything up, but my brothers did not make any mistakes. -It's good that you focused on the mistake, but evaluate the actions as a whole,- insist the instructors. We hesitate to say that we generally followed the instructions and, with the exception of my actions, made no other critical errors. In our opinion, on the whole, we coped with the task. -This is too modest an estimate,- says the instructor. — Today you are the last in this competition out of three platoons. We have seen the work of more than one and a half hundred cadets. The four of you have done the best job of all.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/21/kytayecz-did-kapelan-i-doczent-yak-chotyry-mushketery-shturmuvaly-budynok-na-interflex-u-brytaniyi/	2024-10-20T20:43:43-07:00
Simply -the most powerful in the world-: the British Air Force is testing a new radar	As informs defense portal Zona Militar, the first Typhoon from the United Kingdom Air Force is already equipped with the appropriate system and is ready for practical tests in the air, ArmiyaInform reports. The advanced ECRS Mk 2 radar with an advanced Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) system and a unique positioning mechanism will allow the Typhoon to realize its full potential, it said. The ECRS Mk2 active phased array radar promises to be a game-changer for the Royal Air Force's Eurofighter Typhoon and will provide the Typhoon with a host of new capabilities that will allow the aircraft to better complement Britain's F-35B stealth fighters. -ECRS (European Common Radar System) Mk 2 is developed by Leonardo UK and integrated into Typhoon by BAE Systems, which now boasts that the new ECRS Mk 2 radar is -the world's most powerful combat airborne radar-, - write the authors of the portal The Drive. According to the stated capabilities, the ECRS Mk2 device combines all 3 traditional functions of an AFAR (Active Phased Array) radar, such as search and guidance, electronic warfare tasks, as well as secure high-speed communication and data transmission tasks. The Eurofighter Typhoon with ECRS Mk2 will now be able to detect and disrupt enemy radar use with a powerful electronic suppression attack while remaining out of range of the enemy countermeasures threat. The ECRS Mk 2 has an auto-tilt, a pivot mount which means the antenna can be rotated face-to-face at much greater angles to the centreline. This provides a much wider field of view with a significant increase in angular (azimuth) coverage. Compared to traditional mechanical scanning technology, the AFAR of the ECRS Mk2 radar can detect and track a target at a much greater distance, faster and with a greater degree of accuracy. This also applies to smaller threats, including those with a limited radar signature or flying at very low altitudes, which are much harder for older radars to detect. The long range of the ECRS Mk2 means that AESA radars are a significant advantage when using air-to-air missiles beyond visual range, the report said. The UK Ministry of Defense has invested £2.35 billion ($2.83 billion) in this modernization project, which aims not only to improve existing capabilities, but also to integrate advanced features such as broadband electronic attack and advanced jamming capabilities. These innovations will allow Royal Air Force pilots to hit targets at long distances while remaining protected from enemy air defenses. The ECRS Mk2 is designed to give pilots enhanced situational awareness and an unprecedented tactical advantage by detecting and prioritizing threats while automatically coordinating countermeasures, including decoys such as Brite Cloud. As such, this radar is a key element of the UK's defense strategy, confirming its desire to maintain technological leadership in the area of ​​air defense. With the new radar, the Typhoon will benefit from a unique ability to suppress enemy air defenses (SEAD), enabling it to operate in complex and congested electromagnetic environments. In addition, the radar will greatly enhance the aircraft's air-to-air and air-to-surface capabilities, thus expanding its operational range. The ECRS Mk2 also serves as a technological bridge to the Tempest project. The technologies and skills developed for the ECRS Mk2 radar are transferred to the ongoing development of Leonardo and BAE Systems as members of Team Tempest. This will reduce Tempest development costs and time while improving overall system performance. Some detailed characteristics of this radar are not given, referring to the secrecy of this project. However, it is known that the United Kingdom plans to install ECRS Mk 2 radars on new Tranche 4 Eurofighter Typhoon models, as well as 40 of its Tranche 3 Typhoon combat aircraft. In addition, Britain plans to offer these radars for export, including on Saudi Arabia's Typhoon fighter. ECRS Mk2 radar for Eurofighter Typhoon fighters.

Why does propaganda disperse a fake about the refusal to provide medical assistance - to the petitio...	This time he dispels the lie that allegedly men who have not updated their data in the TCC and SP are denied medical care. However, since October 1, a rule came into force in Ukraine, according to which primary medical care institutions stopped paying for the treatment of patients if they did not specify their phone numbers and registration numbers of tax payers' registration cards. And they are not going to treat -evaders- at the expense of the hospital itself, on the conviction of fakers. After sharing this information, StopFake decided to check whether in Ukraine they are really refusing to provide medical assistance to those who have not updated their data in the TCC. As expected, this information is not true. In order to receive medical assistance in Ukraine, it is not required to update data in the territorial centers of recruitment and social support. This time, the enemy is manipulating the information that, as of October 1, the norm really came into force in Ukraine, according to which hospitals partially stopped payments for patients. This is provided for by Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 1394 -On some issues of implementation of the program of state guarantees of medical care of the population in 2024-. But if you look at the document, you will find that it does not refer to the update of data in the TCC. Hospitals were required to verify patients 18 years of age or older who have declarations of choice of primary care physician. And if their data (contact phone number and TIN) are not included in the declaration, doctors will no longer receive funds for helping such patients. Kremlin propaganda once again invented a lie about the TCC and SP for another attempt to discredit the mobilization campaign in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/21/navishho-rospropaganda-rozganyaye-fejk-pro-vidmovu-nadannya-meddopomogy-uhylyantam/	2024-10-20T20:21:19-07:00

A significant part of the -martyrs- are shot down by Ukrainian soldiers, however, according to the President, this is not enough. Volodymyr Zelenskyi called for increasing international pressure on Russia and destroying the infrastructure for the production and storage of these drones. In addition, the President emphasized a new threat — Russia's criminal alliance with North Korea. He expressed his gratitude to the leaders of the states who speak frankly about the supply of weapons from the DPRK to Russia and the possible consequences of this cooperation. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyi, North Korean military personnel are already in Russia, which actually makes the DPRK a participant in the war against Ukraine. The President also announced support from partners under the Victory Plan. The head of state thanked France, Lithuania, Scandinavian countries and other EU allies for the assistance provided, and also noted -good signals- from the United States. Ukraine agreed on new packages of defense and energy support. At the same time, Volodymyr Zelenskyy drew attention to internal problems, in particular corruption in medical and social expert commissions (MSEK). He condemned the facts of falsification of disabilities by some prosecutors and called on the Security Service of Ukraine, the Security Intelligence Service, and the Prosecutor General's Office to act quickly and harshly. The President instructed to consider this issue at a meeting of the National Security Council. As reported by ArmyInform, in a week Russian terrorists used more than 20 missiles of various types, about 800 guided aerial bombs and more than 500 attack drones of various types against Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/20/prezydent-vijna-prodovzhytsya-yakshho-ne-zupynyty-soyuz-rosiyi-ta-pivnichnoyi-koreyi/	2024-10-20T13:20:48-07:00

About this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon the spokeswoman of the OTU -Luhansk- told Major Anastasia Bobovnikova. — It works well in the city. In Chasovoy Yar and Toretsk, cases were recorded when the enemy disguised himself in civilian clothes and tried to infiltrate our rear under the guise of civilians, she said. However, such cases were isolated and the Ukrainian military quickly dealt with them. The enemy's actions are also affected by the change of season and the onset of natural autumn with long rains and thick fogs. — [Weather] changes have already begun, fogs have begun, which are very thick in the Donetsk region. This affects the change of tactics, because in the fog it is very easy to carry out assault actions, to be invisible. The fog helps both us and the enemy to carry out assault actions and contributes to the actions of the DRG, - explained Anastasia Bobovnikova. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the urban development of Toretsk and other cities in the East, Russian soldiers change into civilian clothes, thus occupiers treacherously resort to a ruse with the aim of conducting hostilities without identifying themselves, or throwing the DRG behind units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/20/v-tumani-vijny-okupanty-perevdyagayutsya-v-czyvilne-yak-pogoda-vplyvaye-na-bojovi-diyi-na-shodi/	2024-10-20T09:29:30-07:00

Motorcycle suicide bombers - the Russians resort to suicidal tactics in the Kurakhiv direction	On October 20, a representative of the press service of the 79th Airborne Assault Command spoke about the situation in the Kurakhiv region on October 20. Orest Drymalovsky of the Taurian Brigade. -The threat remains. The command of the 79th separate amphibious assault brigade of the Taurian brigade sees and is aware of this threat. Accordingly, we react according to the situation. The enemy is conducting active assault operations in the defense lane of the 79th. The day before, he attacked with armored vehicles. Our paratroopers are already repelling these assaults. Three armored vehicles with landing forces were destroyed, 17 occupants were eliminated. Also, yesterday the Russians attacked on motorcycles and our paratroopers destroyed seven of these crazy racers. The assault once again suffocated and did not achieve what the Russian command expected. This is the merit of our entire brigade, coordinated work from the command to the paratroopers in the trenches on the front line,- said Orest Drymalovskyi. He separately focused on the enemy's use of motorcycles during attacks. -The motorcycle tactic is such a suicidal, you know, tactic where the Russians try to avoid meeting our strike drone operators, try to get close to our forward edge, engage in a firefight. Fortunately, our paratroopers manage to detect all these advances of enemy motorcycles in time, destroy them even far away on approaches, either with drones or with small arms,- ​​noted Orest Drymalovskyi. According to him, the enemy is also very intensively shelling the positions of our paratroopers with artillery of all calibers, and airstrikes, especially in recent weeks. -Recently, we worked at the command and observation post of one of our line companies, and had the opportunity to observe firsthand how active Russian aviation works. In half a day, the enemy carried out airstrikes 9 times. This is about two dozen aerial bombs and this is, in fact, preparation for the next assault. The enemy is actively conducting artillery training and conducting airstrikes in order to carry out a massive mechanized attack again the next day,- said Orest Drymalovskyi. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 79th brigade captured burning Russian tanker who was running along the landing. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/20/motosmertnyky-rosiyany-na-kurahivskomu-napryamku-vdayutsya-do-suyiczydalnoyi-taktyky/	2024-10-20T08:18:44-07:00

Deadly surprise - the battalion - destroyed - by Russian propaganda showed who really dies	The video appeared on October 20 on the brigade channel. Inspired by the promises of their propagandists, that our battalion had already been destroyed by powerful airstrikes, the invaders unexpectedly encountered powerful resistance.

Online recruiting and contract signing in a few clicks: current and future features of Reserve+	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on October 20. in other words, staffing the Armed Forces and other Defense Forces is a priority task. That is why the MOU has launched an online recruiting option directly in the Reserve+ mobile application. -We have collected the largest number of vacancies that exist in the country today, that is 4,000 vacancies, and thanks to this tool, a citizen will be able to choose the most relevant position in the Armed Forces of Ukraine,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko. This is done so that all the skills and knowledge that citizens have acquired in civilian life can be used to the greatest advantage in defeating the enemy. According to her, voluntary recruitment is the focus of the work of the Ministry of Defense, because it is the most acceptable and effective way of interaction between the state and conscripts. Kateryna Chernogorenko noted that online recruiting in Reserve+ will develop. -Already now you can choose the most relevant position, direction, even brigade. You can get acquainted with the history of the brigade, you can get information about the brigade commander, because it is very important to understand in which unit you serve,- she said. Therefore, Ms. Chernogorenko emphasized that providing the opportunity to receive the entire volume of information through a single entry point -directly in the pocket of our citizen- without going to the TCC and to separate sites is a significant advantage of the Rezerv+ application. -We want to develop this functionality and enable our users to sign a contract directly in the application in a few clicks. This will be the next iteration of online recruitment, which we will launch in the near future, in order to fully digitize the cycle of entry of our citizens as volunteers to the ranks of the Armed Forces,- the Deputy Minister emphasized.

Devil's Dozen -Otkaznikov-: How Russians Eliminate Mass Refusals and Desertions	About this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon the spokeswoman of the OTU -Luhansk- told Major Anastasia Bobovnikova. — They have a low moral and psychological state, there are frequent cases of desertion or simply refusing to complete tasks. At the same time, cases of desertion are not one or two people, but dozens of people. For example, recently there was a case when, according to our intelligence, about 13 Russians refused to complete the task, she said. The spokeswoman also reported that Russian soldiers, who had time to understand that if they continue to participate in hostilities, only death or severe mutilation awaits them, they are happy to surrender. Surrender was the only way for Russian soldiers to survive and preserve their health. However, the awareness of this simple fact comes to the occupiers only when they manage to take part in at least one first battle and see actual combat. It is the scale of losses among the henchmen and the attitude of the Russian command towards them as expendable materials that amazes those enemy soldiers who survived. Therefore, they resort to desertion, refuse to perform tasks or surrender to captivity. The tactic of leveling these phenomena at the enemy is simple - throw in newly recruited soldiers who do not yet have an idea of ​​the real state of affairs at the front. — We are not talking about a large number of personnel, that is, the Russians are not raising new brigades, divisions or regiments. However, every day they put new personnel in advanced positions, thus replenishing the losses, said Anastasia Bobovnikova. ArmyInform previously reported that chasovym-yarom/->in the East, the occupiers are fighting with museum exhibits: the Russians threw something -new- into the battle at Chasovym Yarom.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/20/chortova-dyuzhyna-otkaznikov-yak-rosiyany-nivelyuyut-masovi-vidmovy-vid-vykonannya-zavdan-ta-dezertyrstvo/	2024-10-20T03:59:18-07:00

As reported by ArmyInform, the fighters of the UA_REG TEAM unit of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces showed how they stormed the enemy using ground robotic complex.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/20/pryroda-na-kurshhyni-ochystylasya-vid-2-dalekobijnyh-gaubycz-voroga/	2024-10-20T03:47:42-07:00
The first Ukrainian pilot who used the F-16 against Russian missiles: who was the officer -Munfish-	This is talking in their social networks. Today, October 20, Oleksiy Mes would have celebrated his 31st birthday. But on August 26, 2024, while repelling one of the most powerful missile and drone attacks, Oleksiy died. -Moonfish pilot Oleksiy Mes will forever remain the first for us. The first Ukrainian F-16 pilot. The first to land an F-16 in Ukraine. The first to shoot down an F-air target,- the Air Force said. His wife Yuliya notes that everyone knew him as -Munfish- - the world-famous Ukrainian pilot who was the first to retrain the F-16 and use the American fighter jet against Russian missiles. -I knew him as a gentle and humble Lyosh- An imperfect, stubborn and always busy, but loving, attentive man&#8230; Lyosha, who has traveled more or less halfway around the world on official matters: Norway, Dubai, America, Denmark &#8230; and with whom I never managed to go to the sea as a threesome for a short family vacation,- said the woman. According to his wife, he really did not want to be public. Valued freedom and privacy, cared about her and her daughter's safety. Already on the first day of the large-scale invasion, Oleksiy flew from airfield to airfield, had to face significantly superior enemy forces. -Did he tell anything? From time to time I received messages - -I'm working.- Everything is normal.- Occasionally - chatted, without details, just to hear the voice. Lyosha never said that it was difficult or scary for them. And it was terrible,- Yulia recalled. She said that between combat tours, he was constantly on the phone with someone, discussing planes, missiles, opportunities. -He was the first to land an F-16 in Ukraine. And then he was the first to make a combat sortie, the first to shoot down an air target on the F-ts,- said his wife. The day before August 25, he came home very late. Wrote to Julia: -Go or spend the night at the service? Because at six o'clock in the morning you have to be there, and that's on the condition that the Shaheds don't leave.- The woman and her daughter saw him from the balcony. He also texted someone's phone number. The wife recalled that she had written a message: -How much is it possible? Let's go home!-. Alexei raised his head and smiled. -We went for a walk in the park, drank coffee&#8230; Before going to bed, Oleksiy washed his daughter's hair, dried it, put her to bed&#8230; These are actually very thrilling moments&#8230; And then the bell rang, the first -shahedis- entered. Nothing out of the ordinary. Got together. Rushed to work,- Yulia shared. At around 7am he texted her one last time. I didn't read the answer because I went to work. At 11 o'clock dad Oleksiy called: -Lyosha can't get in touch-. My wife tried to dial - she did not answer. According to her, then began the most terrible period of their entire lives. -I would very much like that, after many years, gray-haired grandfather Oleksiy Serhiyevich Mes would tell in the lessons of patriotic education how our pilots won victory in the sky of Ukraine. So that we can help each other in the apiary, as grandfather Lyoshin dreamed. So that the family would go to the sea dozens of times- Julia sighed. As reported by ArmyInform, by order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to Lieutenant Colonel Oleksiy Mesy awarded the military rank of colonel posthumously. Mykola Oleschuk notified , that the causes of the plane crash in which the pilot of the F-16 plane, Colonel Oleksiy Mes, died, will be established. American partners have already been involved in the investigation. Previously, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported the loss of an F-16 aircraft that was repelling a Russian missile attack.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/20/pershyj-ukrayinskyj-pilot-yakyj-zastosuvav-f-16-proty-rosijskyh-raket-yakym-buv-oficzer-munfish/	2024-10-20T03:23:51-07:00
They arrived, disembarked, died — a fire sweep of the landing with Russian attack aircraft	The video of combat work appeared on the brigade channel. After a break to regroup the troops, the occupiers again began to storm Ukrainian positions, including large columns of armored vehicles. In order to protect the equipment (the occupiers do not protect their people), the Russians used it only to transport the infantry, after which the BMPs rolled back to the rear. And our drones and gunners began to work on the enemy's infantry, carefully and persistently destroying one Russian after another. -The trenches, which were successfully cleared, glowed like a Christmas tree. Some poor fellows couldn't resist and ended the battle early — they shot themselves. Others proudly waited for the expected finale,- the team commented on the video.

The enemy uses helicopters to protect the remnants of their fleet	He told about this on the air of -Edyny Novyv- on October 20. According to him, the air situation in the South remains dynamic, but in general without much change. The enemy uses anti-drone helicopters to protect the -remains of its fleet- from possible attacks. -They also patrol and defend the so-called Crimean bridge. That is, the aviation is involved as much as possible,- noted Dmytro Pletenchuk. He said that the troops of the Russian Federation use very different models. -Here you can see the entire existing aircraft fleet, from propeller-driven, rather slow aircraft to front-line bombers and fighters. That is, they use everything they have,- the Navy spokesman explained. As reported by ArmyInform, the Kerch bridge remains almost the most protected object of the Russians. It is more valuable to the occupiers than any other structures both in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine and in the Russian Federation itself, therefore they throw maximum resources and efforts.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/20/vorog-zastosovuye-gelikoptery-shhob-zahystyty-reshtky-svogo-flotu/	2024-10-20T02:52:56-07:00

In particular, I will tell about a very interesting trophy in the area of ​​Chasovoy Yar, where four M-46 guns were destroyed. This is a Soviet towed gun, which began to be produced as early as 1948. This indicates that the Russians are removing everything from the warehouses, even such old equipment, she said. At the same time, the occupiers also use newer weapons in the East. Enemy aviation is a serious problem for defenders of Ukraine. — Aviation has become a means of terror throughout Ukraine, in particular, in the East. Here, CABs are, unfortunately, already a common phenomenon. About 10 airstrikes are carried out by the enemy every day in the area of ​​responsibility of the Luhansk military air base, the spokeswoman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Toretsk direction, the enemy is using outdated armored vehicles - ancient -bekhs- and -motorcycles- are going into battle.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/20/muzejnymy-eksponatamy-voyuyut-okupanty-na-shodi-deshho-novenke-kynuly-u-bij-pid-chasovym-yarom/	2024-10-20T02:43:40-07:00
the Russians shot down several Ukrainian drones with their largest explosives factory	This was reported by ArmyTV on October 20, citing its own sources. The Sverdlovsk plant in the city of Dzerzhynsk, Nizhny Novgorod region of the Russian Federation is a component of the Russian military industry and is under the sanctions of the EU and the USA, as the plant's products are used to wage war in Ukraine. In this place, the enemy produces explosives, aviation and artillery shells, aerial bombs, including anti-aircraft missiles, combat units of cumulative anti-tank guided missiles, warheads for anti-aircraft missile systems. The distance from the Ukrainian border to the target was 900 km.

The Navy commented on the presence of the Alros submarine in the Black Sea	He told about this on the air of -Edyny Novyv- on October 20. According to him, this unit is constantly there and performs the main task of guarding the Novorossiysk base point. -This boat is the only one of its kind in the Black Sea Fleet, it is a previous project before the -Warsaw women- in 636,- Dmytro Pletenchuk explained. He noted that, in general, the situation in the Black Sea remains unchanged. -What is important is that there are no Russian warships in the Sea of ​​Azov. The only reason for this, of course, is the fear of being destroyed there,- noted Dmytro Pletenchuk. We will remind that the B-871 -alrosa- is a Russian diesel-electric submarine of the 877V -halibut- project, which is part of the 4th separate submarine brigade of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Navy. Until 2013, for a long time it was the only operational submarine of the Russian Navy in the Black Sea.

There is no advance of the enemy in Toretsk: the occupiers manage to be restrained also in the area ...	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. — The situation remains difficult in the area of ​​responsibility of OTU -Luhansk-. Aviation was operating in the Seversky direction yesterday. There were 3 skirmishes in the Kramatorsk direction. There were 4 skirmishes in the Toretsk direction, aviation also worked, she said, the officer noted that the enemy's tactics in the Kramatorsk and Toretsk directions remain unchanged - assault actions by small infantry groups. - It is not possible to talk about a radical change in tactics, because the enemy uses the tactics of small assault groups, especially in the Kramatorsk and Toretsk directions. This tactic proved to be effective, because they do not spare manpower and simply throw assault groups around the clock, endlessly and for quite some time now, trying to break through our defenses, the military said. However, despite all the efforts of the Russian occupiers, the Defense Forces manage to effectively restrain the enemy. — In Toretsk itself, despite the fact that the situation there is very difficult, the city is almost destroyed, we are holding back the enemy. The enemy has not been able to advance into Toretsk for a long time, the spokeswoman said. — If we talk about the Kramatorsk direction, in particular the Chasovoy Yar area, there they also use tactics similar to those they use in the Toretsk direction.

They took up the old: Britain and Singapore are establishing the production of 120-mm self-propelled...	For information of the official portal of Babcock International Group PLC, the start of production of 120 mm self-propelled mortar systems is a historic step for of the defense-industrial complex of the United Kingdom, which has not produced weapons of this caliber since the last century, concentrating exclusively on 81-mm mortars, reports ArmyInform. The basic requirement for the creation of production facilities for the assembly of 120-mm mortar systems directly on of the British Isles is related to the program to increase the firepower of the new combat battalions of the country's army on the battlefield. The GDAMS system is planned to be produced in the Devonport area of ​​the city of Plymouth, in southwestern England. And the assembly of new weapons was entrusted to the specialists of the Perfect Bore Manufacturing company, which works in various sectors, including oil and gas, automotive, nuclear, aerospace and, of course, defense, and has the most modern machine park and the corresponding equipment. 120-mm GDAMS (an acronym for Advanced Ground Deployment Mortar System) can be operated by a crew of two and boasts a rapid deployment and stacking time of just 15 seconds, providing unmatched mobility and agility in high-tempo operations. Its articulated mortar system is vehicle-independent, allowing the weapon to be mounted on a variety of platforms, including vehicles already in service with the British Army, such as the Jackal, Coyote and Foxhound. GDAMS is compatible with a wide range of standard smoothbore guns. munitions, including high-explosive, illumination, infrared (IR), illumination mines and smoke shells. It also has the accuracy and extended range capabilities of reaching targets up to 9km away, and supports manual, electronic and smart fuzes, making it a versatile choice for a variety of combat mission profiles. What directly to the intricacies of managing mortar systems, the 120-mm GDAMS are additionally equipped with advanced fire control and aiming devices, which increases accuracy and efficiency, as well as shortens the time to engage targets. A patented diffuser minimizes noise levels, improving stealth and ensuring crew safety. The system's fully digitized communication circuit speeds up operations and reduces the risk of human error when entering coordinates, allowing for faster deployment and more accurate setup. Tom Newman, Sector Chief Executive of Babcock&#8217;s Land, highlighted the importance of GDAMS, saying: -Babcock's 120mm GDAMS can help support the modernization of the British Army by increasing firepower and improving availability and combat capabilities critical equipment.- For his part, Brigadier General (retd) Jin Kiat Chua, head of international business at ST Engineering, described GDAMS as -an outstanding tactical fire control solution that pushes capacity to the limit and increases firepower -. The representative of the Singaporean manufacturer emphasized the role of partnership in the development of a sovereign solution that is in line with the UK Industrial Strategy. An interesting feature of this project is the fact that when assembling the GDAMS mortar systems in Singapore the ST Engineering company preferred to install the weapons complex on the base of commercial pickups of the 4x4 formula. At the same time, the barrel of the mortar was placed almost horizontally in the trunk of an ordinary car during transportation, and the cartridges were fixed in containers on both sides of the trunk or in its front part. The weapon is loaded manually and can fire 16 mines in 3 minutes: then the barrel must be cooled. This, however, according to the Singaporean developers, is not a problem, because the fire calculation needs to be redeployed to avoid any possible counter-battery fire. Therefore, in less than a minute, a vehicle equipped with GDAMS quickly leaves the pre-deployment area and will be ready to repeat its fire actions from another position. It should be noted that the GDAMS system can also be equipped with an 81 mm medium caliber barrel. In the 120 mm configuration, the GDAMS weighs 700 kg. After deployment on the ground, it can be used in the ±90° fire sector, and the elevation angle is from 45° to 80°. In its turn, the British version of the self-propelled mortar is planned to be mounted on the Supacat HMT 6&#215 highly mobile platform. ;6, which, according to local experts, offers unparalleled versatility on the battlefield. And the deployment of production facilities in Devonport also opens up future export opportunities, strengthening defense cooperation with allied countries, while developing the UK's defense industry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/20/vzyalysya-za-stare-brytaniya-z-singapurom-nalagodzhuyut-vyrobnycztvo-120-mm-samohidnyh-minometnyh-system/	2024-10-19T21:07:01-07:00
About the bachelor squads, special status for the Irish and the women's movement -shame-: the experi...	Before the First World War, the British army did not know mass conscription: there were always enough people willing to serve the monarchy in the country. So at the beginning of the war, in 1914 and 1915, the military command managed to recruit the planned number of military personnel thanks to volunteers. The plan was even more than fulfilled: thanks to the patriotism that swept the country at the beginning of the war, half a million young people applied instead of the required 100 thousand. But the longer the war lasted, the fewer there were willing to fight, and -m The -jaw-cutter- on the continent demanded more and more manpower. During the First World War, military aircraft, chemical weapons, tanks, anti-aircraft machine guns and many other deadly -innovations- were used for the first time, so people died in this war many times more than in the good old days. In January 1916, the country introduced mandatory military service for the first time in its history. The Military Service Act was passed, according to which all unmarried men between the ages of 18 and 41 were initially subject to conscription (later, married men were also included, and the age was raised to 51). I, representatives of professions necessary in the rear, breadwinners of families and, for the first time in world history, Conscientious objectors - a person who could not serve in the army or hold a weapon in his hands due to moral or religious principles. Such people had to prove their convictions to the local military tribunal. But it is known that the members of the tribunals, appointed by the command and interested in increasing the number of soldiers, often refused those who tried to become an -evader-. - Eighteen. - So, you are old enough and have enough conscience not to shy away from serving your country. Following-. If someone still managed to get a special status, he was sent to other army jobs not directly related to combat operations. It is interesting that all Irishmen were also exempted from military service in 1916. After all, that spring, Ireland was engulfed in riots known as the Easter Rising, which in a few years turned into the War of Independence. The metropolis prudently decided not to put weapons in the hands of those who can turn them against them. The general mobilization caused an ambiguous reaction in society. Thus, in April 1916, 200,000 opponents of mobilization gathered on Trafalgar Square in London. On the other hand, many people warmly supported her. For example, the participants of the suffragette movement, who fought against discrimination against women in the legal field, political and economic life. Young women workers at military enterprises (so-called munitionettes) replaced men not only at industrial machines, but also in pubs . They became one of the brightest signs of that time. Women's patriotic organizations became an important element in state propaganda campaigns. They shamed men who did not want to join the army. Women's movements invented a special symbol of the -white feather- as a sign of cowardice, which was handed out on the streets to men of military age who were dressed in civilian clothes. And vice versa - they supported those who were drafted, encouraged with parcels and letters. In March 1917, women activists formed the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC), which united all separate women's organizations that helped the military. There were five broad categories of employment in the WAAC: service staff, cooks, driver mechanics, clerks and gravesiders. The history of the corps became the story of women's struggle for equal rights with men. In November 1918, about 90,000 women served in the WAAC and similar services in the Navy and Air Force. There is still debate in British society about the motivations that led young women to join the ranks of the WAAC during the First World War. Mobilization continued until 1920. A total of 5 million British servicemen went through the First World War, of which about 2.5 million were conscripted. Great Britain lost 886,000 servicemen of all branches of the military. This war is still the bloodiest in the history of the country. For the second time in Great Britain, conscription was introduced in May 1939 - a few months before the start of the Second World War, when it became clear what was going on. At first only young people aged 20 to 22 were drafted. Already in May 1939, they began a six-month military training. Conscripts were not enrolled in the regular army, the number of which before the war was less than 400,000 (including the reserve) and which was professional and supplemented by volunteers, but in the -militia- or -militia- (Militia). Unlike the professional military, these forces received not only uniforms, but also civilian clothes. In September, when Hitler attacked Poland and Great Britain declared war on him, the rules changed: the National Service Act was introduced, under which all men aged 18 to 41 were subject to conscription. By December 1939, one and a half million people out of 47 million inhabitants of the United Kingdom (excluding colonies) were mobilized into the armed forces. Of them, 1.1 million went to the British Army, the rest were sent to the Navy and Air Force. Becoming a soldier, despite expectations, was not easy. First, the recruit had to undergo a medical examination. Not only the unfit, but also those who were allergic to foods that were regularly supplied to the army for the soldiers' food, were not taken into service. Residents of Northern Ireland were also not accepted - due to the same fears as during the First World War. In addition, those who were fundamentally against the war were not accepted into the armed forces, as before. However, they had to prove their beliefs in court. But even if the court confirmed that the conscript really could not take up arms, he could still be recruited to perform non-combat duties. And the duties were different: it was good if pacifists were taken to the kitchen, to the orderlies or storekeepers. And they could easily send them to sappers - demining work was no less dangerous than participating in battles, but it was not considered combat. Students and workers of -critical infrastructure- were also exempted from military service. These included railway workers, policemen, telegraph operators, priests, lighthouse keepers and bakers. Some workers were fired only after reaching a certain age. For example, accountants over the age of 30 were not subject to conscription. In 1942, the mobilization boundaries were expanded again: men aged 18 to 51, unmarried women aged 20 to 30, and those who did not have children under the age of 15. Since 1943, conscripts were sent not only to the army, but also to compulsory work in coal mines. This practice continued even after the war - until 1948. The miners were nicknamed the Bevin boys - in honor of Ernest Bevin, Minister of Labor in Churchill's coalition government. The people did not like them very much: they said that they -sit in the mines while the boys fight.- The mobilized coal miners did not receive awards for their service, and Her Majesty's Government only recognized their contribution to the victory over Nazism in 1995. From 1939 to 1945, 3.5 million men and women served in the British Army. According to V. Churchill, the armed forces of Great Britain during the Second World War lost 303,240 people killed and missing, and together with the dominions, India and colonies — 412,240. The civilian population lost 67,100 people, and the fishing and merchant fleet lost — 30,000. National military service continued for another 18 years after the end of the war. British soldiers served, in particular, in the occupied sectors of Germany and Japan. In those years, all men between the ages of 18 and 30 carried out compulsory military service. Again, there was a list of non-conscriptions - from representatives of -critical- professions to Irish and British of colonial origin. The service was 18 months and included six weeks of training. Soldiers received a very modest salary - until 1960 it amounted to almost two pounds a week, although the average weekly salary in those years was more than 15 pounds. military The last conscripts were demobilized in 1963, and the British armed forces once again became fully professional, which they remain today. army is constantly shrinking. To remedy the situation, the previous Prime Minister of Great Britain, Rishi Sunak, intended to bring back conscription for young people in the country from September this year, but he lost the election in the summer, so nothing changed. However, as recently as June 16, 2022, the British Chief of Staff, General Patrick Sanders, told British soldiers that they were the generation that had to prepare -to fight in Europe again.- He warned that in the event of a war with Russia, the British would face a new mobilization.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/20/pro-zagony-holostyakiv-speczstatus-dlya-irlandcziv-ta-zhinochyj-ruh-soromu-dosvid-mobilizacziyi-velykoyi-brytaniyi/	2024-10-19T20:55:01-07:00
- In war, everyone is afraid: both the soldier and the general-: how psychologists of the 46th briga...	— The training of a serviceman is carried out in three stages. With it, a run-in with a tank is carried out, overcoming a psychological obstacle course. In addition, there are psychologists who provide theory, for example, how to deal with such phenomena as stupor, fear, stress, that is, those mental phenomena that a military serviceman will 100% encounter during combat missions. - How does a person who, relatively speaking, walked the peaceful streets of the city yesterday, passed the BZVP, and today she is already at the front, manages to cope with such stresses? - There are concepts of combat stress, stupor and just fear. People are afraid, that's understandable. When everything around is thundering, exploding, especially when it comes under shelling, fire or bombing for the first time. The same people do not exist, in principle. We are all different, and everyone has their own psychological threshold. In some it is on average, in others &#8211; at a low or high level. Conventionally, the civilian population that comes to us for training can be divided into several categories. The most important thing is that the brain of a serviceman during training in training centers perceives everything as unreal. You will not fool our brain in any way. We just give, first, the theory, I repeat, and explain what he will 100% face and how to deal with it. — How to deal with it? — Banal , just for example. We tell the serviceman that when he arrives at the concentration area of ​​his future unit, that day or evening or night will come when he will be brought into position. You'll feel butterflies in your stomach, you'll hear your heart beat, etc. when you're being hit by artillery, maybe FPV drones. When you feel this way, remember that it is completely normal. All people are afraid - and that's normal. The soldier is afraid, the colonel is afraid, the general is afraid. Any sane, adequate person is scared when an FPV drone is flying at them or artillery is hitting them. There is nothing like that in this. We explain it and tell you how to deal with it. How can I stop hearing my heartbeat, which is deafening? You should do the correct breathing for 4 counts, for example, this is when you are turned on. When you will stand in position for the first day, when you will not sleep for 3-4 days or you will sleep no more than 2-3 hours, as it usually happens, the perception of reality will be completely different. We also talk about it. This is a specific course conducted by our trained psychologists. This, as they say, is preparation in the early days. The next stage is combat situations. There cannot be, for example, four infantrymen at any position. As a rule, these are two experienced, two new recruits. Those who are experienced are usually one of them a sergeant who knows these techniques, who is trained, who also has some combat experience. And also by word and deed it can prompt, can neutralize a certain threat in the form of, for example, a stupor, which also sometimes happens to military personnel. - How exactly do you get out of a stupor? - This individual approach, best of all you need to know the person. If it's a person you're seeing for the first time, the first thing you should do is take away the weapon, if possible. If it is not possible, do not touch it. That is, act according to the situation. There is an option that it is possible to take away weapons and it is necessary, there is a situation and an option when this cannot be done categorically. - In your experience, what affects people the most? FPV, anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, approaching the enemy when throwing a grenade, shooting, departure of equipment? From your practice, according to the feedback of fighters, what is the scariest thing? — The scariest thing is FPV drones. It is difficult to hide from him. If the artillery works, you understand where the projectile falls, you understand that you need to take two steps forward, back, left-right. If it's an FPV, no matter where you take that step, it follows you. That's all. This is the biggest danger. How to fight with them? REB. And fire. — How quickly, on average, does a person adapt to combat conditions? — Also in different ways. There are people born for war. This is such a conditional category. They are about 10% of the total number of fighters who come to us. But they are. These are those who immediately show leadership qualities. This is the sergeant category, which we select in the future for sending to officer courses. In general, the infantry is a symbiosis of youth and experience. It is very good when an experienced sergeant is 35+ and he has 3-4 subordinates who are directly in the trenches with him, aged 20-25. It must be taken into account that fighting is physically difficult. To the point, for example, evacuation, to entering the trench, there can be a distance of up to 10 kilometers, when it is necessary to overcome it in full equipment with weapons, with water, with ammunition, with dry rations. And it's not just to pass and rest, but you come, overcome this distance and immediately begin to perform a combat mission. So, when you're completely exhausted, and it can be 30, and 40, and 50, and 60 days in a row, when you're there, you're doing a task, and you still have to go that distance back. There are situations when a wounded serviceman, who cannot reach the evacuation points on his own, has to be carried and returned the same long kilometers. The best option for recovery after completing tasks is to change the combat environment to home — After leaving combat positions, how exactly can a person be returned from a combat state to a more or less peaceful, well, relatively peaceful course? What do you do in this case, what are the difficulties, what should you pay attention to? — After completing combat missions, you should remember that there are no identical people. The first day we do not touch them at all. If possible, the second day too. We start working somewhere from the third day. When a person is already banal, if it is a cold season, he will warm up, drink tea and get some sleep. Until a person does this and does not get enough sleep, the psychologist's work is simply inappropriate and impractical. There is a category of people who do not need psychological help. When you offer it to him, he himself says, please, I don't need it, I'm fine, I just want to sleep, give me this opportunity. We do not impose ourselves in any way. There is a category of people who, on the contrary, do not mind, but are somehow ashamed to tell the commander that he needs the help of psychologists. So we clearly identify such a category, it is immediately visible by certain signs. And we start working. You can tell by the person. Looking nowhere from exhaustion. A certain retardation, the psyche works in the wrong mode. It is visible. But it is clear that it will recover. It happens that people try to get out of stress by drinking alcohol. There are such cases, unfortunately, they are not isolated. To be honest, it really helps a certain category of people. In fact, it does not solve problems, but it has a temporary effect. - Is the dry law preserved in combat, or is it still allowed to drink alcohol? - Let's start with the fact that a fighter simply won't take this bottle of vodka. It is illogical because it is weight. It is better to take water. In combat, the law is dry, and they know it. The first reason for the dry law is that any medic knows and tells them about it during training sessions: if a person gets injured while in a state of alcohol intoxication, it is very difficult for him to stop the bleeding. Therefore, this is their life, and this is what they remember. It's better, if you really want to, then complete the task, come back, and that's another matter. You can be granted a release, you can leave the concentration area with permission for a certain time and rent an apartment, just be alone or your wife will come to you, what are the problems? We handle it, it's not a problem. We always meet. And the wives also come. And this also has a positive effect. The best option for the recovery of a serviceman after completing tasks is to stay with his family or go home, change the combat environment to a home environment. many divorces, conflicts in families after the war. Is it true or are these isolated cases? If so, what kind of help is appropriate here? - This is absolutely true, I see no point in hiding it. People who go through the war, they change. They will never be the same again. When you and a friend drink tea or coffee in the morning, and by lunchtime he is gone, then such a thing cannot pass without a trace. And the family, the family, for example, the wife, and she just doesn't know it.... - Do you work with family members? - This is not one of our responsibilities, because we work primarily with military personnel, that is, those who perform combat tasks. If possible, we try to do it point by point. But we simply do not have the physical capacity to help the entire civilian population. This should be done at the national level. A comprehensive approach is needed here.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/20/na-vijni-boyatsya-vsi-i-soldat-i-general-yak-psyhology-46-brygady-dshv-gotuyut-novobrancziv-do-vijny/	2024-10-19T20:43:54-07:00

It could not be placed in the Kursk region. Previously, the Russians spread disinformation that they managed to destroy 70% of the equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which was involved in the Kursk operation, and that 74% of Ukrainians oppose the actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Kurshchyna. These fakes are supposed to convince everyone around that the Kursk operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine does not make sense and supposedly entails huge losses for Ukraine in both personnel and equipment. But in fact, from the very beginning, the actions of the Ukrainian army on Russian territory have been successful, the military is fulfilling all the tasks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/20/vorog-znov-poshyryuye-brehnyu-pro-kurshhynu-svoyu-spalenu-tehniku-vydayut-za-ukrayinsku/	2024-10-19T20:21:51-07:00

Ukraine is counting on France's support for the Victory Plan	About this informs the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. Diplomats focused their negotiations on allies' support for the Victory Plan and the Peace Formula of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi, countering Russia's attempts to escalate the war by enlisting the support of the DPRK, intensifying Ukrainian-French defense cooperation, and supporting Ukraine's energy stability ahead of winter. Andriy Sybiga expressed his gratitude to France for its comprehensive support since the beginning of the full-scale Russian aggression and noted that thanks to the dialogue between the leaders Volodymyr Zelensky and Emmanuel Macron, our countries managed to build special, partnership relations. The minister emphasized that Ukraine highly values ​​France's support on the way to the EU and NATO. The head of the Foreign Ministry emphasized the need to further strengthen Ukrainian-French defense cooperation and implement joint defense projects. -Currently, the basis for extensive cooperation with France in the defense industry has already been laid. This applies, in particular, to the localization and joint production of the most necessary weapons in Ukraine, as well as the transfer of a number of French innovative technologies,- the minister noted. In this context, Andriy Sybiga thanked the French side for implementing the decision to form a Ukrainian brigade in France and expressed hope that this initiative would become an example for other partners of Ukraine. The minister noted that Ukraine is counting on France's support for the Victory Plan and emphasized that the implementation of the initiative will be the best response of the Allies to Russia's escalation of the war, in particular plans to involve North Korean troops. The head of the Ukrainian foreign policy department emphasized the leadership role of France in the implementation of the Peace Formula and thanked for the successful organization of a thematic conference on the topic -Nuclear safety- in Paris this week. He added that Ukraine and France are fruitfully working on preparations for the second Global Peace Summit.

Presenting the exhibition to his French colleague, Andrii Sybiga emphasized that friendly relations between Ukraine and France have deep historical roots. Earlier ArmyInform reported that Ukraine and Italy plan to deepen cooperation in the field of the defense-industrial complex.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/19/ukrayina-rozrahovuye-na-pidtrymku-francziyeyu-planu-peremogy/	2024-10-19T09:51:44-07:00
Cold calculation and no emotions in battle is the story of Guardsman Andriy Prysiazhniuk	History made public by the National Guard of Ukraine. After a full-scale invasion, his village was occupied, but he found a way to get to the Dnipro. Almost immediately, Andriy voluntarily joined the ranks of the 31st brigade of the NGU and took the position of an armored car driver. After intensive training, the guardsman went on his first rotation to Velika Novosilka, where he received the call sign DJ. The main task was to transport soldiers to positions, deliver ammunition, provisions, weapons and evacuate damaged equipment. At that period of hostilities, the main threat to an armored car was the -Grady-, which had to be constantly bypassed. For the Guardsman, the first rotation was almost uneventful and allowed him to gradually adapt to combat operations. -During that rotation, I thought I was at war, but I hadn't seen a real war yet,- the soldier recalls. DJ's second rotation was also in Velika Novosilka, but it was radically different in the intensity of combat and the active use of FPV drones. Therefore, the tasks of rotating soldiers in positions were very difficult and required considerable effort and training of the driver. Enemy FPVs actively hunted our equipment, trying to cut off the logistics routes, and the roads were cut by trenches from anti-aircraft guns, which could fully accommodate the Cossack armored vehicle. -We then held positions in Urozhany, and it was there that I saw the real war. Everything around was broken, and something was constantly burning,- says Andrii. On one of the tasks, DJ went to pick up guys from positions and was alone in -Cossack-. The fighter moved at night, with the headlights turned off and the instrument panel covered, so that even they did not shine and did not unmask the car. The night lamp helped to see the road. At the entrance to Harvest, the guardsman saw a flash and felt that something had hit the car, because his ears immediately rang. DJ stopped to avoid crashing and assessed the situation and his condition. Realizing that the car was moving and it did not receive significant damage, he continued driving. On the way back, one of the soldiers saw a hole in the roof of the car and a badly burned seat. -At first I thought the guys were picking on me,- DJ recalls. During the inspection of the damage to the -Cossack-, the soldiers discovered a hole in the roof the size of a soccer ball, the metal was turned inside out and the interior was burned. If a person had been there at the time of the impact, the consequences would have been fatal. The next trip to Urozhayne was also difficult for DJ: this time the car was hit by a mortar, and fortunately, the shrapnel did not penetrate the armor and got stuck in the body. The projectile damaged the wheels, but the personnel remained intact. After a short repair, -Cossack- returned to service and continued to perform combat missions. -Special respect is due to the fighters of the repair crews, who in the fields, without the necessary equipment, literally do miracles out of nothing and put our equipment back on its feet,- noted Andriy. Now the DJ is on rotation in the Kharkiv region, where his experience helps a lot. On the very first task, his car received three direct hits from the FPV, but thanks to his cool mind and nerves of steel, the fighter continued to move and did not panic. Again, it was lucky that no one was in the cabin, as the driver and assistant were on their way to pick up BC and groceries. The fighters completed the task and returned unharmed. The Guardsman is going to serve as long as it takes and plans to return to his home school after our Victory! Earlier ArmyInform reported , that the Defense Forces showed footage of maneuver defense exercises.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/19/holodnyj-rozrahunok-i-niyakyh-emoczij-u-boyu-istoriya-gvardijczya-andriya-prysyazhnyuka/	2024-10-19T10:54:41-07:00

Therefore, the occupiers chose a different tactic - they announce the start of restoration, replace several windows or doors and abandon the house, having received funds for the entire order. Several such unfinished works, together with the residents, have been waiting for the completion of the works since the spring. Residents of Lysychansk complain about the arbitrariness of the city's occupation authorities. More than a year has passed since the local Gauleiter was replaced, and in the summer, the curator from the cauldron, but these actions almost did not lead to anything. They could not establish even elementary processes of interaction with the population. Certificates ordered by local authorities for the registration of social benefits and other documents are produced by the occupying authorities for longer than their validity period. Therefore, it is no longer possible to provide them to another structure - it is necessary to issue them again. The queues and dissatisfaction of the citizens are increasing. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the occupiers fired at a store, five-story buildings, private houses in Donetsk region: there are dead and wounded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/19/pokazovi-vidbudovy-provalylysya-shho-vidbuvayetsya-na-tymchasovo-okupovanij-terytoriyi-luganshhyny/	2024-10-19T03:17:04-07:00
Realistic Training: An indigenous development to improve combat skills has been approved for use by ...	About this notifies the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. It is manufactured by one of the domestic enterprises for the practical training of soldiers in conditions as close as possible to real combat. The individual kit consists of a laser emitter, which is attached to the small arms and ammunition, fixing the damage, and a -stress belt- (bracelet). A mounted emitter on a personal weapon simulates firing. It sends laser pulses, which are detected by sensors on the helmet or vest of a hypothetical opponent. The bracelet is worn on the arm for a tactile sensation of hits. When hit, the fighter feels the electrical impulse of the -stress belt-, and his ammunition is illuminated with red light. The use of such sets during tactical training allows instructors to determine the effectiveness of each of the participants in the class according to many parameters: accuracy, movement skills, etc. Accordingly, it is then possible to conduct an analysis of actions and provide recommendations for further improvement of practical skills. We remind you, pilot project basic combined military training has already started in 4 educational centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/19/realistychni-trenuvannya-vitchyznyanu-rozrobku-dlya-pokrashhennya-bojovyh-navychok-dopushheno-do-vykorystannya-sylamy-oborony/	2024-10-19T03:05:29-07:00

Within the framework of the project, mobile groups for the psychological and spiritual rehabilitation of military personnel work in places of rest and rehabilitation of soldiers directly in the combat zone.

The positive influence on the psychological, moral and mental (spiritual) state of servicemen is carried out through the prism of personal direct religious and creative communication: co-creation with a folk master accompanied by authentic singing, the spiritual influence of a military priest will contribute to the psychological rehabilitation and restoration of the defender. Participation in the project of masters of pottery art has a positive effect on a person's psychological state. The elements of such influence are concentration and fine motor skills, as well as singing, the basis of which is breathing and work with the elimination of muscle clamps. -It is worth emphasizing that it is the family atmosphere in which spiritual influence is exerted on a military serviceman that is the factor that should increase the effectiveness of the mental and spiritual rehabilitation of the defenders,- the Khortytsya State Security Service assured.

I am 54 years old, 17 of them in the army. I started my service back in 1988. He graduated from the school of junior commanders and spent four months in Afghanistan as a sergeant. We already went out as part of a limited contingent of Soviet troops. Then there was Stepanakert - it was also quite hot there&#8230; It was different. In 2014, -Grandfather- returned to the army again. ATO began. Due to the specifics of the tasks, the unit was constantly in the center of events. Paratroopers visited everywhere. — Yes, I was at Donetsk airport twice - two rotations. One lasted 27 days, the second lasted 12 days. When we were already leaving, a week later it was blown up. And in the Luhansk region there were, and in Karachun, and in Slovyansk&#8230; My eldest son was with me. I have two sons. Both paratroopers. After demobilization, he engaged in business, worked in Poland. But in 2022, without hesitation, he returned to the paratroopers again. — Started from Poland on February 25. And already on the 26th at 7 in the morning, or rather at 7:15, I was already at the 95 checkpoint. I will immediately turn to our commander, whom I treat with respect, this is Anatoly Kozel, call sign -Kupol-. This is a person with a capital letter, real, with whom it was good to fight side by side. Our direction was 51 kilometers, this is an intersection, how to go to Kyiv, in the Makarova district. During the battles for Kyiv, the paratroopers held the crossroads, and the Russians did not advance - neither to Fastiv, nor to Makariv, nor to Zhytomyr. In April 2022, the formation of the 46th brigade began, and the serviceman joined it. — I, one might say, stood at the origins of creation, I had the honor of serving with all the commanders. When another battalion of ours began to form, I was taken to him by its commander, now he is the Hero of Ukraine, nicknamed -Smoke-, Oleg Volodymyrovych Dmytruk. Now a lieutenant colonel, it was an honor to serve with him. We went to the execution area, it was Kherson Oblast. The paratroopers also fought fierce battles there. There were losses that -Grandfather- constantly mentions. — Yesterday I ate with him, we drank tea, coffee, and today we are going out on an assignment and&#8230; he is gone This is the hardest loss, especially since my eldest son died. This was also in the Kherson region, the area of ​​the settlement of Sukhy Stavok. He was a soldier, he was a soldier in the ATO, and he was a soldier here. I took it as a&#8230; Apparently, it had to be like that. So, he invested his life, part of his life, in our victory. The hardest thing is when you lose relatives, friends, siblings. The son's body could not be found for almost six months. - Why couldn't the bodies be found? As it turned out later, the infantry was coming, not from our assault troops, just infantry. And they collected all the dead. We still hoped that he was in captivity. Requests were submitted to all possible authorities. From the Red Cross and along the SBU line. After all, hope is the last to die, they thought that it was still alive. But, unfortunately, a notification came to the wife who was giving the DNA. And the DNA matched. And it was already at the end of February. He died on August 22, 2023, and was buried on March 4, 2024. In one of the battles, -Grandfather- was hit by a tank shot, survived, but was seriously wounded. After the hospital, he was sent to an educational center for further service. About the cadets, -Grandfather- willingly talks: - The people are different, the people have different hair. Someone perceives better, someone worse, someone more, someone less. Now they do not have such a desire, as it was in our time, as in the early days, when queues were near the TCC, near military units, near checkpoints. Now, unfortunately, this is not the case. But still people go. I did not ask anyone, no one brought anyone here by force, no one broke their hands, as they show on TV. These are bread workers, tractor drivers, programmers, teachers, different strata of the population. Called - came. And it is our business, no matter who comes, to teach. The serviceman says that the instructors try to prepare recruits as much as possible, taking into account all the changes that take place on the battlefield. - There is such a war going on at the moment - something new appears every month. Both weapons and tactics are changing, new different drones. Now the war of drones mostly. And it is necessary to know everything, to understand everything. So, of course, we have to be ready for that. Of course, we have to prepare refills in the same way. So we are working in this direction. According to -Dida-, during the BZVP, instructors try to see the strengths of new recruits in order to choose specialties for them accordingly. — During the BZVP course, department commanders and instructors pay attention to who has what abilities. If he is already, for example, a programmer, then he can already be a UAV operator, a REBov and the like. Those who shoot accurately can be sent to sniper courses. Fighters are evaluated, and as they already finish the BZVP and join us in the unit, we give recommendations on who is capable of what. It also happens that a person comes, under 2 meters tall, a pumped-up athlete, and as soon as a critical situation arises, he simply swims. He does not orient himself, he does not know what to do. And it happens that a boy comes, and you think that he is wearing that machine gun, that helmet and bulletproof vest, but in a critical situation he shows himself in such a way that wow. Now the main thing is to come here, to show desire. And here we will already tell, we will indicate the right way, what a person should do.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/19/try-vijny-dida-z-dshv-istoriya-shtab-serzhanta-yakyj-piv-roku-shukav-tilo-zagyblogo-syna/	2024-10-18T21:31:05-07:00
The first leave after mobilization: when they can be sent home	ArmyInform tells about all possible leave options that are available during martial law and when they can be obtained. First of all, it is necessary to understand what types of leave are available in the Armed Forces. And when such leave can be granted. The main one is annual leave. Every year a serviceman can get up to 30 days of basic leave. It is provided in parts during the calendar year, provided that the main continuous part of it will be not less than 15 calendar days. If compared to civilian life, in the Armed Forces there is no requirement to serve half a year in order to be able to go on vacation. But of course, you are unlikely to be able to mobilize and go on vacation almost immediately. First, more than a month will be spent on basic military training. Then everything will depend on which division you fall into. Most likely, the vacation schedule will already be written there. And, of course, those who have been serving for some time will go first. Usually 1-2 people from a platoon or up to 4 servicemen from a company are released. Therefore, you will have to wait your turn. In small units, for example, security, the picture is a little different. But the schedule is still there. In addition, there are other nuances that must be taken into account. It is legislated that basic leave is granted -under the conditions of simultaneous absence no more than 30 percent of the total number of servicemen of a certain category of the corresponding unit.- So, if the unit is less than 70 percent staffed, there may be no vacations at all for a certain period of time. Although, even in such situations, military units usually try, at least a little at a time, to let people go on vacation. You also need to consider the environment in which the unit is located. After all, the withdrawal of even a small number of servicemen can significantly affect combat capability. That is, there are reasons for refusing to grant leave. But such a refusal must be justified. Lawyers advise making 2 copies of the report. One should bear the number, date and signature of the person who accepted the report. So that later you can appeal the refusal or inaction. But in practice this does not always work. If you believe that you are being unreasonably denied vacation, you can contact the hotline of the Ministry of Defense. But if there is a serious reason to go on vacation, then there is an option of family leave. This is the second type of leave granted during martial law. It can be provided for up to 10 days. At the same time, the payment of cash security is preserved. The military serviceman must indicate in the report what family circumstances or good reasons prompt him to go on such a leave, and also, if possible, provide relevant documents to the report. If this is not done, the leave may be refused. You can read more about how to go on vacation for family reasons read here. There are several other options for receiving leave in the Armed Forces. It is unlikely that they will be immediately available to newcomers to the army. But it is worth reminding about them. This is a relatively new type of leave that appeared after the passage of the mobilization law. On May 21, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved the procedure the granting of such leave. In particular, for which equipment and how many days of additional leave a serviceman can receive in the event of the destruction of enemy equipment. We note that, in general, you can get no more than 15 days of such leave per year. It can be given not only to the person who directly destroyed the equipment, but also to other servicemen who participated in the detection and destruction of enemy equipment. They can receive the same number of days as the serviceman who destroyed the equipment. But it is important to remember that the destruction of equipment must be confirmed! Read more about it in our material. If a serviceman, released from captivity, expressed a desire to continue his service, but needs rest, then at his request, he additional leave is granted with the preservation of cash security for the duration of 90 calendar days without division into parts . Such leave can be revoked only with the consent of the serviceman. Such leave is granted based on the conclusion of the VLK for treatment in connection with an illness or after an injury (contusion, injury or mutilation). The term of such leave is determined by doctors. But the total period of treatment can last not more than 12 months. All this time, the military serviceman keeps the payment of cash support.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/19/persha-vidpustka-pislya-mobilizacziyi-koly-mozhut-vidpustyty-dodomu/	2024-10-18T21:20:34-07:00

Russian invaders carried out two missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine using three missiles, 47 airstrikes, dropping 67 guided aerial bombs. In addition, the occupiers brought in 674 kamikaze drones and fired more than 3,000 shots at the positions of our troops and populated areas. On the Kharkiv direction, the enemy once stormed the positions of our units in the Vovchansk region. In the Kupyan direction, the enemy carried out offensive actions near Golubivka, Sinkivka, Novoosynovo, Stepova Novoselevka, Pischany, Kolisnyvka, Vyshnevo, and Lozova. Ukrainian defenders stopped all 23 enemy attacks. In the Lyman direction Russian invaders stormed the positions of the Defense Forces 14 times near Grekivka, Druzhelyubivka, Terni, Makiivka and Torsky. One skirmish is still ongoing. In the Kramatorsk direction the enemy, supported by aviation, stormed our positions near Chasovoy Yar and Stupochky. The defense forces stopped both attacks of the invaders. Seven skirmishes took place in the Toretsk direction. the Russians stormed the positions of Ukrainian units near Deliivka and Toretsk. All attacks of the aggressor were repelled.

Fifty-one engagements have been completed, with four more still ongoing. In the Vremivsk direction the enemy attacked our units near Novoukrainka and Bogoyavlenka ten times. In the Orikhov direction the occupation forces once stormed the positions of the Defense Forces in the areas of Novodanilivka. Six times the enemy attacked our defenders in the Dnieper direction in vain. Soldiers of the 128th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade, 35th Separate Marine Corps Brigade, 28th Separate Mechanized Brigade named after the Knights of the Winter Campaign, 42nd Separate Mechanized Brigade and 14th Separate Mechanized Brigade named after Prince Roman the Great were honored at the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. , which effectively destroy the enemy, causing him heavy losses in manpower and equipment. We will remind, state on the morning of October 18, the Russian invaders lost 1,530 personnel killed and wounded in one day at the front.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/19/vid-pochatku-doby-vidbulosya-195-bojovyh-zitknen-z-nyh-55-na-kurahivskomu-napryamku/	2024-10-18T21:15:28-07:00
About takmed, updating hospitals and the primary military rank for doctors: an interview with the he...	How was the volume of pre-hospital medical care approved? How are military hospital upgrades going? How do civilian and military healthcare systems interact and what does the Department of Healthcare of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine do for this and what are its plans for the future? Oksana Sukhorukova, head of the Department of Health Protection of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, told about this and other things in an interview with ArmiyaInform. — Ms. Oksana, you have been in your position for almost a year. What did you manage to do during this time? Where were the biggest stumbling blocks in the work? - I believe that the biggest achievement is the formation of a capable team in such a short time. And I am very proud of the people with whom I serve in public service together. These are both civilians and military personnel, particularly those who fought from the first days of the large-scale invasion and then expressed a desire to continue serving in the department. — It's about a team of people. And what about the processes? - The main task of the Department is policy formation in the field of military medicine. Until March of this year, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine formed the policy in the entire field of health care. In February, the Verkhovna Rada adopted the law, at the beginning of March it was signed by the President. This document delegates authority to the Ministry of Defense to formulate pre-hospital health policy during a special period for all security forces and the Defense Forces. That is, we are talking about the fact that the process at the pre-hospital level - until the moment when the military enters the hospital with an illness, with an injury, with an injury, with a contusion - will be according to the same standards. What did we manage to do? If we are talking about tactical medicine, then we have finally approved our scope of pre-medical care. In the tenth year of the war. There is such an order of the Ministry of Defense (number 436) that speaks of four levels of pre-medical care. This is tactical medicine. By the way, we have submitted changes to the BZVP program in the section of the takmed. As for the higher levels of assistance, it should be implemented, for example, in vocational training. That is, we are talking about all types of individual training of military personnel. There was also an order of the Ministry of Defense, which talks about the composition of first-aid kits. We are talking about first-aid kits, and shoulder bags for paramedics, and a car first-aid kit, and a backpack for combat medics. Further, on the basis of these volumes, typical training standards and conditions for training are being developed today, including equipment tables for training centers. That is, the property that should be in educational centers for high-quality training of military personnel is standardized. Today, we continue to improve and standardize knowledge for instructors of the School of Tactical Medicine, which is under the command of the Command of the Medical Forces. All this is done with the aim of improving the quality of training of servicemen in providing pre-medical care. In addition, we are currently working on creating a turnstile testing laboratory in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Samples of turnstiles have already been selected, which should go for research. After all, unfortunately, we know the state of equipment of our research institutes. We are also negotiating with partners to complete the equipment, and we were able to complete a full cycle of these tests. Currently, we already have a simplified procedure for obtaining the primary officer rank for doctors who went to serve without having a military department. I think this problem is familiar to many: when doctors without a military department got into the recruiting centers, received the 100th VOS and went to serve in non-medical positions. But we know that a doctor needs to be trained for 10 years. We cannot afford that our doctors, if they want to serve in medical positions, do not serve where many of them end up. In addition, we have established cooperation with our partners on training courses for doctors. These are both international partners and, for example, Ukrainian partners - the Razom for Ukraine organization. Currently, a separate military accounting specialty is distinguished - -psychologist-, with the establishment of qualification restrictions for candidates for positions. In particular, psychological education should be mandatory. We already have combat trauma protocols approved by the Ministry of Health - there are 12 of them today. Another 19 protocols are currently being developed by experts of the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Health and the Security Service of Ukraine, which is a huge step forward. We have approved volumes of pre-hospital medical care. The document is based on the real experience of Ukrainian doctors at stabilization centers and advanced surgical units. And the medical doctrine of NATO forces 410, which speaks of four levels of assistance, was taken as a framework. The drug formulary was updated for the year 2025 - since then, at most, drugs without proven effectiveness have been deleted. Military servicemen who underwent treatment in Ukraine are equal in rights. It used to be four months. And those who undergo treatment abroad - 12 months with savings. Currently, the duration is 12 months, regardless of where the patient is treated. A reintegration center for servicemen released from captivity has also been identified in the Armed Forces. This is the first center in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We have several projects, for example, with Recovery, which are updating our military hospitals: starting with equipment, for example, boiler rooms and their re-equipment, modernization, renewal - and ending with repairs in several of our hospitals. This is also very good. If we talk about general processes, I would like to single out the implementation of the electronic health care system in military hospitals and military units. Our specialists have finished testing the primary medical record of the wounded in one of the directions in the area of ​​hostilities. And now we will implement a pilot project on the digitalization of medical services of military units in the combat zone. We have launched a system for declaring economic activity from medical practice. The process now takes up to two minutes. The same declaration has worked with the licensing of activities related to the use of narcotic anesthetics and analgesics. After our interview, we will have a coordination meeting with the nuclear regulatory inspectorate regarding the declaration and use of ionizing radiation sources. It is an X-ray that is used in a combat zone, but we do not have a license for this use. — Human resource in the field of health care for the military. Is it enough? Are there enough medical facilities in Ukraine to provide medical services to the military? And overall capabilities? Do we plan to open new ones? - Yes, there is a problem with human resources, they are exacerbated by military actions, and this is understandable. It must be understood that the number of doctors in our country is not growing like this (clicks fingers.- Ed.). We cannot say that we need another 10,000 doctors tomorrow. A doctor has been in training for 10 years. And we need to effectively approach the formation of our system. I'm talking about training, training, management, bringing all resources together. Today it is happening. Our civilian system now takes the majority of servicemen who need treatment. Therefore, we need to find effective ways of interaction between different health care systems. This is the system of the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the SBU, the civilian system, the Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Health. — How do civilian and military healthcare systems interact at this stage? Are you satisfied with the outcome of this interaction? What have you been able to improve in the interaction? What else are you going to do? - The civilian system has opened up for military personnel - and that's a very good thing. Because without the support of the civilian system, military medicine would not survive. If we're talking about what we need to improve, it's the patient pathway and updating approaches to treatment. I have in mind clear patient routes for all military personnel - they must understand what happens to them next. Has he been treated? So, next he has to have rehabilitation - he has to know where it has to take place, how he can get to that rehabilitation, what steps he has to take, what the doctors have to do to get him there. This interaction exists where there are active managers, there it is more or less fixed. In some places, not so much. And it needs to be improved. I would really like to see military medicine be able to use civilian tools like e-referrals, e-prescriptions for service members who have chronic conditions. Why can't a military serviceman, as a citizen of Ukraine, get an electronic prescription from his doctor at a medical company or a medical center and go take blood pressure pills or insulin if he has diabetes? I would very much like to see our hospitals participate in a centralized procurement program, to have a medical information system implemented everywhere, to have integration with the electronic health system so that medical information for the serviceman is stored at all stages of his life, regardless of his status, that is, whether he is a civilian or a military serviceman. Plus, it would allow to reduce the number of papers for the heads of medical services. Many reports could be generated automatically. — Simplified officer rank system for doctors and pharmacists. Previously, it was noticed the dissatisfaction of the mobilized doctors, who, conditionally, had to dig trenches instead of treating people. Has this problem been solved? - He can dig trenches if he wants to. But the point is correct: doctors should treat people. Previously, those mobilized who qualified as doctors, but did not pass the military department, received the initial rank of -soldier- and, after passing the BZVP, received the specialty of -shooter-. Now a mobilized doctor can take officer courses at the Ukrainian Military Medical Academy of the Medical Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and receive the rank of -junior lieutenant of the medical service-, which will allow him to multiply his efficiency in the army and save many lives of other people. Of course, doctors who have already served for a certain time can also take officer courses. As of today, 250 people have received the primary officer rank, 33 are undergoing training. Work is ongoing. — In May, the Government of Ukraine allocated 750 million hryvnias for free dentures. Tell me, how many have already used the service of free dentures at this time? And what is needed to use this service? — At the moment, more than 1,800 people have used it. I consider it our great success that today three of our military hospitals are also participating in this project. These are our dental polyclinic, Kharkiv Hospital, Odesa Hospital, which have signed agreements with the NHSHU. Next, we're going to talk about the unified medical space, and that's great. The service can be used by: military personnel who have not yet received the status of UBD, but continue to perform combat tasks; participants in hostilities who took part in ATO/OOS or in the period of repelling and deterring the armed aggression of the Russian Federation; persons with disabilities as a result of the war, received during direct participation in the ATO / OOS or during the repulsion and containment of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation. To use the service, you need to have a referral from a dentist and contact a medical facility that is on the list of pilot project participants. In the institution, it will be necessary to fill out an application and provide a package of copies of documents with the presentation of their originals. — Regarding the recent order of the MoU 598 on -regulation of the scope of medical care at the pre-hospital stage in the defense forces and security forces-. Please explain in more detail what this order is about, how important it is, and what problems it solves. - This order defines at what stage a service member who is a patient is provided with a service to preserve his life and functionality. There, everything is divided into four levels: role 1, role 2, role 3, role 4. This is the NATO standard, which our military doctors have reached through practice. But until now, all this has not been normalized: before the issuance of this order, it was not clear what amount of assistance is provided for -role one-, I mean stabilization points. In what volume, by what doctors, equipment is the assistance provided? What happens next with the military? Where should he go next? So, we are talking about the organization of medical assistance in the area of ​​hostilities. In fact, this is the first document that describes these processes. It's quite a multi-tiered system. And this first order is the key, as the entrance to this system. Then it will only unfold. - Have the volumes been coordinated with the active military medics, nachmeds and others who are affected by this order? We have a working group of 18 people. These are people from the Command of the Medical Forces, from military hospitals, from the military ranks of nachmeds and doctors practicing in the field. In addition, my colleagues regularly go to the headquarters and advanced surgical units of Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk region, and Kharkiv region and discuss these issues with practicing doctors and chief medics who are in this area of ​​the front. Such field work and consultations will continue. We don't make orders to tick a box. It is important for us to solve the problems that are on the front line. Unfortunately, there are a lot of them. There are those that we can solve, and to do that we need to identify them correctly. So it's worth talking to people who are directly in the area of ​​execution. We constantly go to them, constantly communicate with them. We probably didn't have a month when one of us didn't go there. If the problem is not talked about, then it does not exist. The problem must be talked about, and the military must talk. And that's why it's so important to us that people talk openly. I am motivated by the fact that there is a normal trusting relationship with the military, when people talk about what worries them, what they do not understand, what they would like to change. And it's actually a great experience, especially when you get feedback afterwards. I had such a first meeting at one time in the Donetsk direction. We gathered the nachmeds, and I introduced myself as the director of the Department of Health of the MOU. We sat and talked for several hours. And I always leave my phone number, ask to call me, write. Later, after some time, it was very nice to receive feedback from those people. — How do partner countries help you in your work? — Today, our partners are closing down tactical medicine, they have updated equipment in our hospitals and military units. Germany should supply us with eight mobile hospitals. We are negotiating the further supply of armored vehicles. — What are the plans in the department until the end of 2024? What are you planning to implement, launch? What are you planning for 2025? - We will emphasize training and training of military personnel in providing first aid. There are also training standards that are currently in the works. We are expanding opportunities for training military psychologists, expanding the course. We are currently negotiating with the Ministry of Health to conduct more such courses on the basis of disaster medicine centers - they have very good capabilities. As part of the implementation of the unified medical space, we are working on the implementation of medical information systems in the Armed Forces. We are working on improving reintegration measures. An order is being developed for a modular structure of medical support for Roles 1 and 2. We are conducting research with American colleagues on the problem of multidrug-resistant and nosocomial infections. I think this problem is also known to everyone. Based on the results of this study, it will be necessary to develop an action plan and further implement it. We are working on settling the issue of removing the bodies of the dead. Behind every word is a huge amount of work.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/19/pro-takmed-onovlennya-gospitaliv-ta-pervynne-vijskove-zvannya-dlya-likariv-intervyu-z-ochilnyczeyu-departamentu-ohorony-zdorovya-mou/	2024-10-18T21:09:43-07:00
95 people were returned from Russian captivity, among them defenders -Azovstali-	On October 19, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy informs about this. -Every time Ukraine rescues its people from Russian captivity, we are getting closer to the day when freedom will be returned to all who are in Russian captivity,- he noted. The head of state thanked the team engaged in the search and release of prisoners. -We are doing everything to get all our people who are detained by Russia out. Thanks to the soldiers who replenish the exchange fund and to all the partners who help,- he said. The Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War announced that among those released from captivity today are national guardsmen , military sailors, soldiers of the Armed Forces, border guards and representatives of other units of the Security and Defense Forces. -Among those released are 69 soldiers and sergeants and 26 officers. -Many of our freed boys have serious illnesses and the consequences of serious injuries, as well as severe weight loss due to torture and malnutrition,- the statement said. It is noted that this is the 58th exchange organized by the Coordination Headquarters. As a result of our work, 3,767 people have already been freed from enemy captivity. As reported by ArmyInform, previously among those released of the Russian capture of Ukrainian soldiers, there were 38 National Guardsmen and 28 servicemen of the Armed Forces, including two from the Kraken special unit, two from the International Legion, three from the Special Operations Forces, one from the Territorial Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/19/z-rosijskogo-polonu-povernuly-95-lyudej-sered-nyh-zahysnyky-azovstali/	2024-10-18T20:52:25-07:00
-Bronicles- become multi-purpose: protection with replaceable plates is purchased for French special...	As informs portal of the French Ministry of the Armed Forces, the development of the G3P project is part of CIEC's desire to anticipate the needs of combatants to ensure the quality and effectiveness of their support and personal protection, ArmyInform reports. As state experts of the defense portal Army Recognition, with the rapid development of military technologies and increasingly complex threats, the protection of combatants must constantly adapt without sacrificing maneuverability on the field. To overcome these challenges, the armed forces of various countries are investing in innovative materials that are both lightweight and highly resistant. Among the latest developments, the French Integrated Equipment Support Center (CIEC) introduced the new G3P modular bulletproof vest. According to Opex360, this new personal body armor will soon be equipped with French special forces units. G3P stands out for its modularity and integration of real-time monitoring technologies, providing effective protection and increasing the mobility of fighters. The development of lightweight and durable materials has become a priority for the military. Recent research has focused on solutions such as spider silk, mother-of-pearl and architectural materials that offer much higher levels of resilience than current technologies such as Kevlar. The new G3P body armor aims to provide modular protection adapted to different threats on the battlefield. This allows operators to adjust their protection according to the risk, using lighter ballistic plates for increased mobility or adding Class 4 plates to protect against armor-piercing rounds such as sniper bullets. G3P is made of several types of ceramics, including boron carbide, silicon carbide, and titanium. In addition to these advanced materials, the armor incorporates a plate integrity monitoring system called GMOS-TherMOS developed by CIEC in collaboration with an industrial partner. This system constantly monitors the condition of the plates with the help of integrated sensors, immediately notifying the soldier of damage or exposure to temperatures that could impair their effectiveness. This system offers two main advantages: it allows combatants to independently inspect and replace their plates when necessary, and it eliminates the need for expensive and time-consuming radiographic inspections. The leadership of the French army expects that by 2025, more than 60,000 GMOS-TherMOS chips will be manufactured for such control measurements to equip 15,000 tablets, including for special forces. This new generation of body armor could be a turning point in soldier protection, combining lightness, efficiency and technological innovation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/19/broniky-stayut-bagatoczilovymy-dlya-franczuzkyh-speczpryznachencziv-zakupovuyut-zahyst-zi-zminnymy-plastynamy/	2024-10-18T20:33:36-07:00
It was possible to find out who is behind the wave of fake mines in Ukraine	The National Police has been dealing with this kind of messages for more than a year, and a corresponding algorithm for responding to them has been developed. Letters about landmines are usually received by e-mail from anonymous addresses. The text of the messages also often coincides. Senders use multiple services that allow you to create temporary mailboxes within a single account. These services are popular, in particular, among hackers and various network fraudsters. This time, the letter was signed by a person who identified himself as a representative of the Fire Cells Group, a group that calls for attacks on the Ukrainian military and TCC employees through telegrams, promising rewards from $100 to $1,000 for crimes. Investigators from -Scheme- (Radio Svoboda) established that the sender of the letters lives in occupied Crimea and has a passport of the Russian Federation. The enemy regularly tries to destabilize the situation in our state through fake mining For example, one of these -waves- was in mid-January 2022. The SBU considers these actions to be part of a Russian information and psychological operation aimed at increasing panic among the population and undermining trust in government institutions and the military.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/19/vdalos-zyasuvaty-hto-stoyit-za-hvyleyu-fejkovyh-zaminuvan-v-ukrayini/	2024-10-18T20:24:34-07:00

I don't see any public or legal reaction to these events - there are still no arrest warrants for war criminals,- said Dmytro Lubinets. Ukrainian law enforcement agencies do everything possible to fix such crimes. The ombudsman officially handed over the materials on the facts of the executions to the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation.

In Toretsk, the Defense Forces successfully counterattack, but it is extremely difficult to gain a f...	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — The situation in Toretsk is difficult, it has been so for several weeks, but it remains under control. We manage to contain the enemy despite the Russians pushing, she said. The tactics of enemy assaults remain unchanged. — They use assaults in small groups under the cover of artillery, mortars and drones. They are completely destroying the city without leaving a single house or shelter there, and thus trying to break through our defenses in the city of Toretsk, the spokeswoman said. At the same time, units of the Defense Forces not only repel the enemy and restrain his offensive actions, but also counterattack the Russians, pushing them back from those parts of the city that they managed to enter. This is possible due to the fact that the enemy cannot gain a foothold on the ruins - he does not have any shelters. — We are trying to push the enemy out of those areas where they are supposedly entrenched, because they are trying to occupy areas where there is nothing left. Absolutely nothing, no houses, no shelters. Accordingly, we are trying to drive them out of these already destroyed areas. We manage it very well, they suffer heavy losses and, accordingly, retreat, - said the military woman. However, it is extremely difficult for the fighters of the Defense Forces to gain a foothold in the areas of the city captured from the enemy for the same reason - it is difficult to find and arrange shelter there. - This is extremely difficult, as most of the shelters have been destroyed and there is almost nothing left. You yourself have seen these footage from Toretsk. But this is possible because there is an appropriate set of measures followed by our servicemen and it allows them to fight effectively in the city without resorting to such -meat- assaults as are used by the Russians, the spokeswoman explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that on the Toretsk direction, the enemy is using outdated armored vehicles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/u-toreczku-syly-oborony-uspishno-kontratakuyut-odnak-zakripytysya-na-ruyinah-ukraj-vazhko/	2024-10-18T10:21:50-07:00

Wired UAVs, weather conditions and accumulation of enemy troops: what's new in the north of Kharkiv ...	About this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon told the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU Lt. Col. Yevgeny Romanov. — Compared to what is happening in Donetsk region, the situation here is a little easier, but it remains difficult. Defense forces continue to hold back the onslaught of the Russian occupation forces. Since the beginning of the week, there have been 24 combat clashes in the direction of Staritsa, Vovchansk, he said. Also, since the beginning of the week, the occupiers have carried out more than 1,500 attacks on the positions of the defenders of Ukraine, including almost 150 attacks by kamikaze drones. The onset of natural autumn has already begun to have a certain effect on hostilities. — If we talk about the current week, then the weather makes a little difference. Now it's raining, fog. This complicates the work of both reconnaissance unmanned aerial systems and strike drones, the officer explained. The occupiers are trying to adapt to the weather conditions and take into account countermeasures from the Defense Forces of Ukraine. A noticeable innovation on the part of the enemy was the use of UAVs with wire communication. — They constantly change the technical component. Now there are kamikaze drones that are controlled by an operator with the help of wires. Therefore, countermeasures from EW units do not affect them, this is a protected communication channel. There are already such cases, the military officer said. He also noted that the enemy is constantly improving the means of electronic warfare. At the same time, the occupiers lack armored vehicles. It is few and its application on the battlefield is not often resorted to, mainly resorting to the tactics of assaults by small infantry groups. - Statistics show that among the destroyed equipment of the occupiers, automotive equipment prevails. They use the tactics of small groups, try to find some places where they can enter, using the topography of the area or the difficult weather conditions that have developed in Kharkiv Oblast. They actively use unmanned aerial vehicles, drop ammunition, and also fire at Ukrainian servicemen with the help of kamikaze drones, the spokesman said. The officer also reported that Ukrainian intelligence records a certain accumulation of enemy forces on the other side of the border. — There is a certain accumulation of the enemy on the other side of the state border. -Intelligence is monitoring this, the places of accumulation are being identified, and fire damage is being inflicted on them,- Yevgeny Romanov said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Kharkiv direction, the use of North Korean artillery shells was recorded and the quality of these ammunition was assessed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/drotovi-bpla-pogodni-umovy-ta-nakopychennya-vorozhyh-vijsk-shho-novogo-na-pivnochi-harkivshhyny/	2024-10-18T09:40:18-07:00

Currently, more than 10,000 vacancies in the Defense Forces are available in the recruiting centers of the Ukrainian Army: in ZSU, NSU, DPSU, SBU and other formations and bodies. -We started a joint initiative with the Ministry of Defense and local authorities to attract motivated citizens to the ranks of the Armed Forces. This is not our first experience - we previously recruited for the National Guard and the Border Service through the Rivne Central Military Academy. Now we are expanding this practice, actively looking for potential military personnel for various units,- said Serhiy Podolin, the first deputy head of Rivne OVA. The recruiting center of the Ukrainian army does not issue summonses. At most, you can be recruited into the selected part even after receiving a summons to clarify data. -Local self-government should actively help the state resist Russian aggression. Therefore, we are glad to join this initiative of the Ministry of Defense. This is a new approach, where people can calmly come, get information and consider their choice,- emphasized the acting secretary of the city council. Davyd Didukh, Mayor of Kostopol. To date, more than 21,000 people have applied to the network of recruiting centers of the Ukrainian army. Recruiters control the process of recruiting volunteers to the defense forces, and in case of misunderstandings, the support service resolves them. -This is really a unique opportunity. During the war, the state together with the community gives a choice: to choose where to serve, with whom to serve and in what position. You can go to the Internet, read about the units, and find out about current vacancies in the recruiting center and get in touch with the unit,- said Oleksiy Bezhevets, the authorized representative of the Ministry of Defense on recruiting issues.

Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, explained the reasons on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni-. — They still use this tactic, which, unfortunately, has proven to be effective for them. We are trying to contain the enemy. At the same time, they use little equipment, unlike other areas [in the area of ​​responsibility] of the Luhansk OTU, she said. The officer explained why the enemy had few armored vehicles in the Toretsk direction. - Motorized rifle brigades are standing opposite us, as the Russians themselves stated in their telegram channels. Accordingly, the motorized rifle brigades are not as well equipped with equipment as, for example, the airborne troops of the Russians, the military woman said. Because of this, all the little equipment the enemy uses here is also obsolete. - This is due to the fact that they do not use much equipment, and also to the fact that they use very old equipment, such as MTLB or old combat armored vehicles, the spokeswoman explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Forces defense told about the Russian losses in Toretsk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/drevni-behy-ta-motolygy-chomu-na-toreczkomu-napryamku-vorog-zastosovuye-zastarilu-bronetehniku/	2024-10-18T08:37:28-07:00

What are the results of their use on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon? told the spokesman of the -Kharkiv- OTU, Lt. Col. Evgeny Romanov. — There was information that the Russians had received ammunition from North Korea. But it is quite difficult to determine exactly which ammunition is old Soviet or old Korean [used by the enemy], because these are the standard calibers of Soviet artillery systems - 122 and 152 mm, he said. The officer noted that the quality of ammunition from North Korea is low. — North Korean projectiles, due to long-term storage or the characteristics of a low culture of production, they do not hit the target so well. Therefore, inaccurate shooting is observed, the spokesman explained. ArmyInform previously reported that ->North Korea has become the second country that openly supports Russia in the war, and the head of the GUR told where Russia will send the first batch of North Korean infantry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/pivnichnokorejski-snaryady-ye-v-otu-harkiv-oczinyly-yakist-boyeprypasiv-z-kndr/	2024-10-18T07:31:21-07:00

A Mix of Noobs and Gurus: What the Defense Forces Are Finding About Enemy Captured	This was reported by the spokesman of the National Guard on the live broadcast of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- Ruslan Muzychuk of Ukraine. -We must understand and we see from such cases, when it is possible to capture infantrymen or representatives of other branches of the enemy's forces, that their equipment and general preparation depend on the direction where the battle is taking place,- he said. In areas more important to them, the occupiers use trained and better equipped military. — In areas where the enemy sets himself the task of concentrating his main efforts, highly trained units of marines and game are used, — said the spokesman of NSU. On the other hand, there are also less important areas for the enemy, where the less trained military armies of the Russian Federation are outnumbered. — We also see that there are areas where low-intensity hostilities are taking place. There, the enemy can engage units that are not always sufficiently prepared. These may be, in particular, those who have recently been mobilized, the guard explained. As an example, he cited the case of the capture of ten occupiers during the clearing of a forest massif in the north of the Kharkiv region. — During the task of clearing the north of Kharkiv Oblast, servicemen of the 13th Brigade captured 10 occupiers. These are mostly motorized rifle units. These captives now add to our exchange pool. As for the time of their stay in the military formations of the aggressor country, sometimes it is from three months. This, of course, if we talk about the infantry. But it happens that there are officers, certain commanders who have combat experience and have performed tasks before that in other directions, who lead less trained personnel, Ruslan Muzychuk said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, that the GUR and -Charter- captured several dozen invaders in the north of Kharkiv Oblast - it was a motley contingent of servicemen of the Russian army.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/miks-nubiv-ta-guru-yakyh-vysnovkiv-dijshly-u-sylah-oborony-shhodo-zahoplenyh-u-polon-vorogiv/	2024-10-18T06:57:25-07:00
The ground forces revealed who the universal anti-tank missile fighters are	This is notified by the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ATGMs are an important component of modern warfare, especially for combating armored vehicles, tanks, and other armored targets. These fighters undergo special training for the effective use of missile systems such as -Stugna-P-, -Javelin- or -Corsair-, which are currently actively used on the front lines by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Fagot anti-tank missile complex, which was developed back in the 1960s, also remains in service. -Bagot- requires the fighter to have accurate targeting and an excellent understanding of combat tactics, since the complex uses a semi-automatic targeting system, and the missile flies to the target by wire control. Versatile fighters who have mastered the Bassoon are able to effectively deal with tank threats on the battlefield. Despite the age of the system, the Fagot ATGM continues to be an important element of anti-tank defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, especially in conditions of active hostilities. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that The defense forces told the story of the defense of the South Donbas mine near Ugledar.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/suhoputni-vijska-rozpovily-hto-taki-universalni-bijczi-ptrk/	2024-10-18T06:44:01-07:00

Permanent line of defense and the fight against drones: the Defense Forces spoke about the situation...	The spokesperson of the National Guards of Ukraine Ruslan Muzychuk. — In the south, in the areas where our units are performing tasks, the enemy is conducting combat operations of relatively low intensity. It must be understood that the nature of the terrain there is a steppe area, where a fortified line of defense was well built on both sides. Even recalling last year and the fighting that took place in those areas, we are talking about open terrain, well-fortified, mined approaches to the area and so on, he said. In view of this, the Russian occupiers have currently focused on conducting aerial reconnaissance and preparing for assaults and attacks in certain areas, in particular in the area of ​​islands on the Dnieper. — In some places, the enemy is accumulating certain units, active aerial reconnaissance is being conducted. The enemy is trying to use, first of all now, his units to try to storm and capture certain island areas along the Dnieper. There are also official reports about this in the areas, in particular in the Kherson region, the spokesman said. Defense forces have shown high effectiveness in countering Russian long-range reconnaissance UAVs, and it is in the South that this fight using FPV drones has been particularly intense. — We also see that the activity of reconnaissance drones of the -Orlan- and -Zala- type is traditionally quite high in the southern directions. Countering this, our military personnel, in particular UAV units, destroy and shoot down such drones. This is quite important work, because it does not allow the enemy to find out the location of our forces and means both in the previous edge and in depth in the depth of the defense. Such enemy drones are effectively destroyed with our FPV drones. However, in general, I can note that there are quite a large number of them both in the southern directions and in other areas where active hostilities are currently taking place, Ruslan Muzychuk said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that velykogo-nastupu/->in the South, the occupiers are forming assault groups: the Armed Forces said whether there is a threat of a major offensive.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/stala-liniya-oborony-ta-borotba-z-rozviddronamy-u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-pro-sytuacziyu-na-pivdni/	2024-10-18T06:11:35-07:00

Sold to Russia -for a dose-: SBU detained arsonists in two regions of Ukraine	The Security Service of Ukraine informs about this. The occupiers promised the participants money for the performance of enemy tasks.

The spokesman explained the purpose of the enemy's artillery and air strikes. — The enemy uses them to destroy our fortified positions. These are also strikes on the outskirts of Selidovoy and other settlements in the Pokrovsky and Kurakhiv directions.

About the generation -hutin- and the chances of propaganda to repeat the fate of -Radio thousand hil...	— So, Mr. Roman, we haven't seen each other for a year and a half, a lot has changed in the life of Ukraine, at the front, and in the world. Our current meeting is taking place at the Information Agency, so I would like to know your opinion about the course of information battles during this period. Your view on these transformations. - A lot has changed in a year and a half, but a lot has remained absolutely constant. The main position is that Ukraine was, is and will be. And during the war, I think this is a fundamentally important thing. Especially when you consider that we are fighting one of the largest armies on this planet. There is a nuclear bomb and all sorts of other things. Therefore, it should be recorded. Of course, there are losses, but we have come a long way, and it concerns both the Armed Forces and society in general. As for information wars, there is an opinion, and I also adhere to it, that the modern information society is like that river, it is such an unstoppable flow. And accordingly, we have to participate in this process so that, relatively speaking, it is from our river that people draw information. And to say that something has radically changed, no. the Russians both lied and continue to lie. We explain the main thesis that this is our state, and we will fight and fight for it. And I do not see fundamental changes in these processes. There are, of course, some accents that they make, if we talk about enemies, on certain events, but, in my opinion, everything has become too much here. And the Russians, that is, the Russian monsters, broadcast the thesis that -just a little bit more and they will come to the walls of Kyiv-, and they continue to broadcast, even though the battles are being fought in the Kursk region, for example. And they continue to tell their viewers that everything is fine with them and everything is going -according to Putin's plan-. the war If you compare the issue of Crimea against their mobilization, of course they will say: -We don't need Crimea either. And Suzha, take the fuck away too. Nothing is needed! Stop the war!- - Still, what do you think Ukraine looks like on the field of information confrontation? - Here we need to decide what we are talking about. The base is unchanged. We are a state that is fighting back against an aggressive Russian invasion, everyone is helping us, but not the Russians. And this is probably the main point. No matter what anyone says, first of all, my personal belief is that as soon as someone in our country says that he is tired, it is usually people who are very far from the front. But if under some circumstances they get closer to the front, you see, they also have more energy, because energy is survival. Regardless of any nuances, we continue the fight, mobilization measures are taking place, help is provided to us . And it is not only about three or four types of aircraft that our partners transfer to us. And this is to the point that no one is tired of Ukraine in the West. And this is the base for me. And the Russians, well, they were ugly, and they remain so. These are people who profess such pure Nazism, adapted Moscow Hitlerism. Putin's birthday was recently. And this personality cult, in my opinion, surpassed what existed before that in the former USSR. When every school thinks that it must write something about how they love Putin, how they love this tsar, or rather, the under-tsar, that is complete nonsense. And when they teach the word -hutin- to five-year-old children, the children stand on their knees, and this is seen not only by Ukrainians, but also in the West. In the West, in America, elections. Left or right come to power there. And Russian propagandists pedal these topics. But if we apply a little, speaking in the language of television, a kind of zoom and enlarge this picture that we are looking at, then these conversations of the Russians that there, in that overseas state, they will vote this way or that way, will vote badly and will not help us, they will leave us to our own devices. All these conversations have been coming from them for the last two and a half years. But what is happening all this time: the policy of our allies does not change in matters of principle. If we are talking specifically about information during the war, everything is very simple. If the state continues to fight, it means that the information war is definitely not lost. If we take some polls, then, of course, we have many such -bedside- and -bed-sofa warriors- who, knowingly or not, disperse a verbal blizzard. But still, the people support their state, their army. There is, of course, the category we mentioned, who are tired of living in Ukraine. If someone there says that somewhere in Odessa some fool climbed a monument with a Russian flag, then these are people for whom a psychiatrist is just crying. And there is one more point. And for us here is a very good assistant. As soon as someone has stupid thoughts in their head, the Russian KAB flies to this place. And it immediately enlightens the brain, it seems to me, to everyone. - Since the beginning of the large-scale Russian aggression in Ukraine, access to enemy TV channels and websites has been restricted. Of course, there are technical possibilities to bypass these blocks, but, frankly, I am personally disgusted to see these campaigns based on the motives of -old songs about the main thing-. As for you, according to your profession, you have to review that propagandist delusion in order to debunk it. Are you strong enough for this? — Well, listen, I would still like to treat this as a kind of information doctor, a surgeon with a saw, who deals with amputation. I treat it calmly, only as a job, I don't have any hatred or anything else. Well, in such an aspect that when I look at and hear this delusion, it does not force me to change my cold view of it. That is, the enemy in general must be studied: what they emphasize, how they praise Putin is already being praised for some reason in order to understand what is happening in the Russian information space. Yes, of course, he is totally Nazi, but the trend itself is such that any of their sources, which issue a minimal alternative opinion from the official one, as they wage war against us, they immediately shut up their own. These are just the criteria for the fact that they are not all right there either. And the Russian Federation, it is fighting in full force. And it is clear that these hours of hatred in the zombie box can affect only those people, and there is such a category of people in Ukraine as well, who simply, as I said, nothing can fix them except a psychiatrist and the SBU. By and large, it works on Russian territory exclusively on the principle of permanent exposure of the population. That is, for many years, at least since 2014, there were many TV channels there, and they have remained so. Some faces on the screen may change there, and not always. And they broadcast this Nazi thesis that Russia is -above everyone-, that they can do whatever they want with other people. So I actually really like that, on the one hand, they , talking about how everything is cool with them, they will beat us in a little while, on the other hand, recently, they began to secretly say that -there is no need to relax, the West will always help the Ukrainians, they are still mobilizing there (in Ukraine) there will be a sufficient number of men and women who will defend Ukraine with weapons in their hands.- They are constantly counting our planes, offering to nuke Paris. And fighting at full strength, they still cannot defeat us. That is, we may have certain territorial losses, that is understandable. But fundamentally, Putin has already lost. I recently heard this thesis from them on TV channels that, despite all the losses of our Ukrainian people, Ukraine will remain. Because they came here in order to destroy it. - During the period of work in Moscow, you got to know personally most of the Russian media people, who are now spewing this propaganda scum on the air. Have you noticed any changes in these Putin heralds? - These people will not follow Putin into the trenches. I do not think that we should worry about the fate of the conditional -Oli Skabeeva-, and by this name we mean all the top Russian propagandists. Most of them understand everything perfectly. I would probably only single out Masha Sakharova (the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation — Ed.), among such ardent believers, but she is such a real Putinist. With such, in principle, there is no need to negotiate. Otherwise, everything is very simple. To finally draw parallels with Nazi Germany, we need to win the war. Now it is very far from that. First of all, I'm not sure that most of them, if everything goes the way we've talked about before and we bomb Moscow, I'm not sure that these people in principle will live to see The Hague (International Criminal Court, the first legal a permanent institution whose competence includes the prosecution of persons responsible for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. — Ed.), to court and so on. And we will decide as these questions are raised. But I will emphasize once again: they know perfectly well what they are doing, they know perfectly well what game they are playing. They know perfectly well what happened to those who created the radio station -Radio a thousand hills- (a Rwandan radio station that broadcasted from July 8, 1993 to July 31, 1994 and played a significant role in the genocide in Rwanda. — Ed.). These are the generals of the information forces of the Russian Federation, this is one of such powerful units of the Russian army. Putin never saves money on them, they have a complete limit, and even the latest reports indicate that these budgets are increasing. Therefore, we should not think about what will happen to them, we should think about what will happen to us. Next will be…	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/pro-pokolinnya-hutina-ta-shansy-rospropagandy-povtoryty-dolyu-radio-tysyachi-pagorbiv-intervyu-z-romanom-czymbalyukom/	2024-10-17T21:00:54-07:00
Ukraine's victory plan: when to expect a turning point in the war with Russia. Expert opinion	Military expert Petro Chernyk specially commented on the positions of the Victory Plan for ArmyInform: -The Victory Plan, declared by the President of Ukraine, is nothing more than the framework of our state's activities in the strategy of entering the final phase of this war potentially next year. The overarching message is collective security. We are sending a signal to the whole world that we must fight against evil together. Potentially, this is an entry into NATO, although there is no hope that this will happen very soon. Unfortunately, everything rests on the position of the United States of America. Everything depends on them. Plus, let's not forget that we have antagonists in Europe, let's say people like Hungary. There is a full and adequate awareness on the part of our state-building that our eternal eastern enemy, Russia, understands only force. And the position on strategic non-nuclear deterrence is nothing more than the so-called large missile shield. First of all, these are long-range missiles with a range of 500 to 700 km. We have operational-tactical missile complex -Grim-2-. It is an analogue of the Russian Iskander. It is necessary to increase the launchers of this complex, about 50-60 units. And each installation should have 200-300 missiles in its arsenal. This, indeed, will be a very serious argument. And the most important point is to reach such a power parity that after the end of this phase of the war, the Russians no longer dare to use a military instrument against us. It is necessary to decipher what is called the -Donbas- issue. Indeed, at the moment, without showering Donbas with tens of thousands of bombs, it is almost impossible to repel it with conventional weapons, if the enemy maintains the stability of its defenses. But it must be emphasized: if we have a large combat parity built up, then even such an intermediate defeat of the Russian Federation can lead to a change of regime. That's when, during the regime change in the Kremlin, it is quite possible to return these territories back out of good will on their part. And the most important nuance. Somewhere in society there is an exaggerated expectation that there should be something in this document that spells out, step by step, down to the last millimeter how we will win this war. This does not happen. The document is primarily a cementing of our position, which sounds very simple. We will not give up our (temporarily occupied - ed.) territories. And no matter how long it takes us in the historical sense, sooner or later we will reach the borders of 1991.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/plan-peremogy-ukrayiny-koly-chekaty-perelomu-u-vijni-z-rosiyeyu-dumka-eksperta/	2024-10-17T20:43:49-07:00
On the threshold of the Third World: what is happening in the Asia-Pacific region and how it will af...	Tensions between China and Taiwan arise sporadically over China's claims to Taiwan as a -breakaway province- and Taiwan's desire to maintain its self-governing status. As a reminder, Taiwan (officially the Republic of China) is an island state with limited international recognition. The Republic of China had been on the mainland since 1912, but after losing the civil war to the Communists in 1949, the country's government evacuated to the island. China regularly conducts military exercises around Taiwan, underscoring its readiness to use force for so-called -reunification-. — The United States, although it officially recognizes Beijing, remains a key ally of Taiwan and provides it with defensive weapons. Tensions between the US and China are escalating over Washington's increased support for Taiwan. Over the past few years, China has repeatedly allegedly shown readiness to attack Taiwan, but no direct confrontation has yet taken place. The Chinese constantly resort to intimidation. For example, on October 15, Taiwan reported that it had been surrounded by 153 Chinese warplanes during a large-scale exercise. China's military maneuvers, dubbed -Joint Sword-2024B,- involved fighter jets, drones, warships and coast guards stationed around Taiwan. 90 aircraft entered the air defense identification zone, to which Taiwan responded by deploying its forces and increasing combat readiness. China has traditionally justified the drills as a warning against -separatist actions- or in response to statements by Taiwanese politicians. Tensions around the island remain high. The Chinese clearly observe the situation surrounding the Russian-Ukrainian war in the context of the West's readiness to respond to the actions of the occupier. If the US and its allies continue to act hesitantly, Beijing will believe that the consequences of an attack on Taiwan will be negligible. On October 14, Volodymyr Zelenskyi said that North Korea had actually joined the war against Ukraine. It is not only about the supply of weapons that are used against Ukraine, but also about the transfer of people to the Russian troops. On June 19 this year, Russian leader Vladimir Putin arrived in North Korea for the first time in 24 years. During the visit, an agreement on -comprehensive strategic partnership- was signed. The parties have agreed to provide each other with -military and other- assistance if one of them suffers an -armed attack.- North Korea recently announced a review of its maritime borders, which, of course, now for some reason have to go further south. It then said that South Korean drones allegedly violated airspace and dropped leaflets, and that another such incident would lead to catastrophic consequences. And then they brought their artillery to the demilitarized zone, blew up roads and mobilized 1.4 million citizens in just one week. And Kim Jong-un held a -security and defense meeting- with the entire military chain of command, including the heads of the general staff departments. On the evening of October 14, the head of the Kremlin submitted a project on the ratification of the -comprehensive strategic partnership- agreement to the Russian State Duma for consideration. Meanwhile, the GUR reported that the Russian Federation is already forming a -special Buryat battalion- from citizens of the DPRK. — The tension on the Korean Peninsula has already become a reason for politicians around the world to talk about the beginning of the Third World War. These events are especially interesting in the context of the actual involvement of the DPRK in the Russian-Ukrainian war as a supplier not only of weapons, but also of manpower for Russia. On October 15, North Korea blew up parts of two major highways and railways, the Kyonggi and Tonghae lines, that connected it to South Korea. The move, although symbolic as the roads have not been used for several years, underscores the growing tension between the two countries. The reason for these actions was accusations from Pyongyang that South Korea had allegedly launched drones carrying propaganda materials over the North Korean capital, as well as an official statement rejecting peaceful reunification. The deterioration of relations has been accompanied by mutual threats: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has threatened a nuclear strike in response to any provocations, while South Korea has said there will be severe consequences if nuclear weapons are used. South Korea says this is just a tactic by Pyongyang to create excuses for further provocations. At the same time, Seoul is actively developing its defense system against drones after an incident in 2022, when five North Korean drones entered its airspace and flew over the capital for several hours. The broken roads have been a symbol of rapprochement between the countries, particularly after the 2018 summit, when the leaders of the North and South announced a new era of peace and an end to war. However, North Korea has resumed the presence of heavy weapons in the demilitarized zone, effectively nullifying a 2018 military de-escalation agreement. Although tensions have indeed increased, the likelihood of a direct collision is currently low. It will be especially interesting to watch the events in the event of the election of Donald Trump as the president of the United States. He had a warm relationship with Kim Jong Un, and may even try to arrange his second meeting with him. Pyongyang's rapprochement with Washington is likely to have an impact on the North's participation in the Russian-Ukrainian war. On October 14, Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov arrived in the People's Republic of China on an official visit against the backdrop of bilateral naval exercises in the Northwest Pacific Ocean. This unequivocally indicates the intensification of cooperation between the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China in the field of defense. — For many years, Russia has been, if not a bargaining chip, then at most a junior partner of China in negotiations with the United States. In the context of the Russian-Ukrainian war, Beijing can be considered the main factor in Moscow's nuclear deterrence, because Xi Jinping would not like to destroy the current world order through a nuclear war. On October 13, Joe Biden reiterated the importance of continuing to work on reducing the nuclear threat and his willingness to negotiate with Russia, China and North Korea to reduce the risk of nuclear weapons use. Earlier, on September 25, Vladimir Putin announced the renewal of the country's nuclear doctrine, which now provides for the possibility of using nuclear weapons even in the event of aggression with the use of conventional weapons, if this creates a -critical threat.- Also, the new doctrine allows the use of nuclear weapons in the event of aggression against Belarus. This can be interpreted as an attempt at nuclear blackmail and an attempt by Russia to cause panic among Western politicians. Unfortunately, today we can say that the USA no longer has the authority with which it managed to oppose the USSR during the Reagan era. The Kremlin now pays more attention not to a possible armed response by Washington and NATO, but to the word of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China. Given the recent events, which primarily include the US disaster in Afghanistan and the failure to arm Ukraine, Biden can no longer speak from a position of strength. An example of disrespect for Washington is also the involvement of the DPRK in the Russian-Ukrainian war; -permission- for such actions could only be given by Beijing. An important event in the context of the US-China-Russia negotiations will be the G20 summit, which will be held in Brazil on November 18-19. By that time, the results of the American elections will be known and the meeting will take place in the Rammstein format. It is important for the Americans to start gaining success in the international arena, which will strengthen their position in the negotiation process. And the first such success should be providing Ukraine with all the necessary weapons to stop the Russian offensive.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/na-porozi-tretoyi-svitovoyi-shho-vidbuvayetsya-v-azijsko-tyhookeanskomu-regioni-i-yak-cze-vplyne-na-vijnu-v-ukrayini/	2024-10-17T20:33:00-07:00
Artificial intelligence helps the enemy stamp fakes	Such posts contain appeals to congratulate with the likes, either on a birthday, or on a wedding, or to pray, because now it is difficult in a certain area of ​​the front. There are also similar posts about animals rescued after shelling, children or elderly people, about mothers whose sons are taken to war, etc. Why do Ukrainians mass distribute such content? Because he puts good pressure on emotions. The emotion is the deceptive feeling that by sharing the picture, we will help someone with something. The purpose of such posts is to encourage people to respond. In this way, these images receive thousands of interactions from real users, which contributes to the rapid promotion of the pages on which they are placed. And the enemy gets a platform to promote narratives that are dangerous for Ukraine. After all, it is very beneficial for him if Ukrainians fall into the role of victims. To spread panic. To perceive their own army as victims. After all, victims do not fight. The threat of such posts also lies in the fact that they can be used for fraud, because they often contain malicious links disguised as, for example, a petition that needs to be signed. In addition, fictional, painted soldiers or wounded children level real servicemen or wounded children, and give the enemy a reason to accuse our country of lying. Now the OpenAI company, the developer of ChatGPT, warns that fake political content created by AI tools is spreading online. And it concerns not only the Russian-Ukrainian war, but also the elections in the USA, events surrounding Israel, Taiwan, North and South Korea. In particular, an Iranian propaganda operation with fake English-language news sites purporting to reflect various American political positions was disrupted. Therefore, one should constantly observe information hygiene in the network and in no case be subject to emotional manipulation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/18/shtuchnyj-intelekt-dopomagaye-vorogu-shtampuvaty-fejky/	2024-10-17T20:22:04-07:00

As a result of the special operation in Donetsk region and Odesa, three Russian agents were detained. They turned out to be a resident of Kramatorsk and two Odessans who supported racism. According to the instructions of the FSB, they went around their cities, where they secretly fixed the nodal railway stations involved in the transportation of heavy weapons and ammunition to the front. An additional task for the agent from Donetsk was to identify the positions of the Ukrainian troops who are holding the defense in the Kramatorsk direction. To do this, the woman visited the settlements near the front line and asked local residents for intelligence information during everyday conversations. The agents sent the received information to their Russian curator via messenger in the form of marks on Google maps with a detailed description. SBU employees documented the criminal activities of the persons involved and detained them at their place of residence. During the searches, the agents seized mobile phones that they used to communicate with the Russian curator. Investigators of the Security Service informed the two defendants of suspicion under Part 2 of Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The criminal actions of another person involved are qualified under Part 3 of Art. 114-2 (unauthorized dissemination of information about the movement or placement of the Armed Forces and other military formations formed in accordance with the laws of Ukraine, committed under martial law) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. All three are currently in custody. They face from 12 years in prison to life imprisonment with confiscation of property. The special operation was carried out by SBU employees in Donetsk and Luhansk regions under the procedural guidance of the Donetsk regional prosecutor's office. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/17/namagalysya-rozvidaty-marshruty-zsu-iz-postavok-zbroyi-na-front-sbu-zneshkodyly-rosijsku-agenturu/	2024-10-17T11:58:21-07:00
A working forum - Defense-industrial complex of Ukraine: scenarios of 2025 - was held in Kyiv	About this informs the General Staff of the Armed Forces. The main goal is to increase production and speed up the supply of high-tech weapons to the front. The event was organized by the public union -Technological Forces of Ukraine-, which unites almost four dozen key suppliers of military technology. The participants of the forum analyzed the possible scenarios of the development of the defense industry and shared their vision of the prerequisites and factors that will influence its development. Among the main issues are the simplification of defense procurement procedures to speed up the implementation of high-tech developments, support for Ukrainian manufacturers, and improvement of the regulatory framework for defense industry enterprises. During the forum, representatives of the Armed Forces of Ukraine emphasized the need to create all conditions for strengthening the Ukrainian army with new technological developments. -Today, together with the manufacturers, we discussed the urgent needs and prospects for the development of our defense complex. For the Armed Forces, it is critically important to strengthen the domestic arms manufacturers,- said the deputy head of the Department of Innovative Activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Pavlo Dyachuk. Close cooperation between Ukrainian arms manufacturers and the military is crucial. This allows for more prompt implementation of new solutions to strengthen the Defense Forces and speed up their delivery to the front. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, that EUMAM UA trains service dogs and dog handlers for work in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/17/u-kyyevi-vidbuvsya-robochyj-forum-oboronno-promyslovyj-kompleks-ukrayiny-sczenariyi-2025-roku/	2024-10-17T11:46:39-07:00
EUMAM UA trains service dogs and dog handlers for work in Ukraine	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Mine detection dogs are trained to recognize mines and other explosive objects in the ground. In Ukraine's war zones, where Russian landmines are a constant threat, this capability is invaluable. Ukrainian military personnel from various branches of the military are trained as part of the EUMAM UA mission. In addition, they also train dogs for the Guard Service, Special Operations Forces, Airborne Assault Dogs, and explosive detection dogs. While a mine detection dog has to keep its nose very low to find the smallest particles in the soil layer, a mine detection dog has to detect odors in the air. And the guard dog, in addition to searching for explosives, also performs the task of protecting objects. EUMAM UA training mission of the EU for military assistance to Ukraine is part of the support package for Ukraine in its fight against the aggressor &#8211; Russia In total, 24 European countries are participating in this mission. Its task is to train the Ukrainian military in order to strengthen the country's defense capability and stability. Since the Russian attack on Ukraine in February 2022, Germany has supported Ukraine in its fight against the aggressor. An essential component of the support package is the training of the Ukrainian military in weapons systems, military management, military medical support, and others.

The Armed Forces spoke about the important role of the gun commander in the firing position	The relevant information was published by the Operational Command -East-. The commander must make instant decisions in difficult conditions, coordinate the actions of his team and clearly fulfill the tasks set by the command. Not only the accuracy of shooting depends on it, but also the safety of the personnel, the coherence of the work of the unit and the maximum use of the capabilities of the artillery. The right choice of position, accurate coordinates and timely command are what can change the course of the battle.

They may have a third or fourth prison term. They are promised a pardon if they last even a year. They receive minimal training and are then simply sent with or without guides to our units, he said. The task of such soldiers is simple - to become expendable. - Somewhere they will perform demining, somewhere they will call fire on themselves and this will give the enemy an opportunity to understand where our firing positions are. This is really expendable material, which, unfortunately, the enemy has a lot of, said the soldier. Among the stories of several dozen prisoners, he recalled the story of a -Wagnerian- who managed to fight in Bakhmut, take part in Yevgeny Prigozhin's campaign to Moscow, and then sign a contract with the Russian Ministry of Defense and take part in an attempted Russian offensive in the north of the Kharkiv region. — The most interesting story was probably that of one prisoner who signed a contract with the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation for the second time. The first was a contract with Wagner. He was a participant in Prigozhin's campaign to Moscow, Volodymyr Degtyarev said. However, usually Russian prisoners do not tell much.

The problem is that the enemy is completely wiping out the streets, so much so that there is nothing to hold on to,- said Anastasia Bobovnikova. According to her, small enemy assault groups sometimes break into this territory and the Russians happily report that they are successful in these areas. -Although it is impossible for them or us to gain a foothold there,- the spokeswoman added. Russian troops actively use artillery to bombard the city, also actively use aviation and drop anti-aircraft missiles. Only in the past day, the enemy lost about 100 people killed and wounded in the Toretsk direction. -Imagine the insane losses of the Russians in the war, if they lose about 100 fighters per day in just one direction. The enemy has gathered a significant group of troops, many times more. We know that they are constantly replenishing units,- Anastasia Bobovnikova said.

The head of the planning department of the 13th brigade told about this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon operational assignment -Charter- of the National Guard of Ukraine, Lt. Col. Anton Baev. — These are slightly different positions, they are different from what we saw both in the Luhansk direction and in Liman. Of the relief conditions we have now, these are big relief differences, ravines and gullies, he said. This terrain allowed the enemy to prepare a complex system of positions and shelters for an assault. — Classic systems of trenches, as we are used to seeing the book written, we do not have here. These are single burrows, usually very deep, which also have different shapes inside, the military said. Such holes are not simple direct depressions in the ground, but have depressions that protect against a direct shot or throwing a grenade from the outside. The officer described the Russian shelter system as well-thought-out and meticulously arranged. - There were a lot of them. From what we see when we go to the positions that have been retaken, it is one hole per man, which is usually very deep and can reach four meters deep. They are very difficult to pass and clean. There are a lot of such burrows, they stand opposite each other. They are arranged in overlapping sectors to avoid blind spots. The frequency of such burrows can be a burrow every 5-6 meters, the guardsman said. The military officer also said that it was necessary to knock out the enemy from their positions in thick forest thickets, the line of sight within which was often only 2-3 meters. Under such conditions, intense close combat took place. Earlier, ArmyInform reported on the successful offensive of the Forces defense in the north of Kharkiv region, during which 400 hectares of forest were cleared and destroy almost a regiment of occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/17/vykolupuvaly-z-lysyachyh-nor-sered-lisu-staly-vidomi-detali-nastupalnoyi-operacziyi-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-10-17T08:36:49-07:00

The suspects are charged with embezzlement of property and obstructing the lawful activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations (Part 5 of Article 191, Part 2 of Article 114-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). The investigation established that during martial law, the accused organized the purchase of low-quality body armor with funds allocated from the state budget. In 2022, contracts for the purchase of personal protective equipment were concluded between the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and non-resident companies in violation of the prescribed procedure. Ammunition was purchased at inflated prices with 100% payment. Exhibitors took personal protective equipment without inspection and handed over low-quality products to military warehouses of the Armed Forces. According to the conclusions of the experts, the ammunition does not meet the state and military standards of Ukraine, the technical requirements for the purchase of different types of body armor and cannot adequately protect Ukrainian servicemen. In total, as a result of the illegal actions of the accused, individual units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were not properly equipped with personal protective equipment in the amount of almost UAH 2 billion. The pre-trial investigation was carried out by the SBU under the operational support of the SBU and the SBU.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/17/eksposadovcziv-minoborony-sudytymut-cherez-zakupivlyu-neyakisnoyi-amunicziyi-dlya-vijskovyh/	2024-10-17T08:02:55-07:00

This was reported on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon by the spokesman of the -Siversk- OTU, Vadym Mysnyk. — The humanitarian situation there is very difficult. In those settlements that suffer from Russian shelling, entire streets are already burning, he said. The defense forces, adhering to the norms of international humanitarian law, are trying to provide local civilians with all the basic necessities - water, food, basic necessities, fuel. — The local population is provided with everything necessary in accordance with all norms of international humanitarian law. But it is in the zone of active hostilities that the population suffers, because the enemy follows the same tactics as in Ukraine. They do not make any difference, and in the same way they prey on everything that is available, prey on their own Russian settlements, on their Russians. These settlements are being demolished from the face of the earth, said the soldier. It is not easy to provide local residents with everything they need, because active hostilities continue in the region. — Logistics routes are also under fire, but the Defense Forces deliver the necessary water, food, and medicine. Our military doctors are providing assistance because there are dead and wounded among the civilian population, the spokesman said. Instead, the Russian side is indifferent to its own citizens and ignores the possibility of organizing the coordinated evacuation of local residents to the territory controlled by the Russian military. — From the first days of conducting operations through various international organizations, we gave a signal, appealed for the organization of the evacuation of the local population from the zone of active hostilities in any direction - either towards Russia or towards Ukraine, so that international organizations could join this process. But, unfortunately, the Kremlin does not react to this at all, as if there is no one there. They do not provide either a green corridor or a ceasefire. They don't care about their population, they probably don't consider the locals to be their people, Vadym Mysnyk explained.

Traitor lawyers should be deprived of the right to operate in Ukraine	ArmyInform was informed about this by the Main Department of Military Justice of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Personal sanctions were applied to 19 persons who are entered in the Unified Register of Advocates of Ukraine and have the right to practice advocacy, namely the independent professional activity of a lawyer in the field of defense, representation and provision of other types of legal assistance to the client. We are talking about Ukrainian lawyers who cooperate with the occupation administration and in fact justify Russian aggression against Ukraine. And at the same time, due to the fact that they are in the Unified Register of Lawyers of Ukraine, these lawyers still have the opportunity to represent citizens and legal entities in Ukrainian courts. Now they should be deprived of such an opportunity. -The Main Directorate of Military Justice conducted data collection work on lawyers who violated the oath of a lawyer of Ukraine and contributed to the activities of the occupying state. All information was transferred to the Security Service of Ukraine, which, in its turn, made relevant proposals for consideration by the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine. We thank the President of Ukraine for the introduction of sanctions against traitors in the Ukrainian bar,- noted Deputy Chief of the Main Department of Military Justice, Senior Lieutenant of Justice Ruslan Kvitin. Ruslan Kvitin also expressed his expectation that the National Bar Association of Ukraine will timely fulfill its obligations regarding the cancellation of access to the Unified Register of Lawyers of Ukraine for those lawyers who have been sanctioned, as these sanctions include the cancellation of licenses that give the right to carry out certain types of activities.

The corresponding video was made public by the Airborne Assault Troops of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The commander of the mortar unit with the call sign -Vasylok- says that he first joined the army back in 2016, and that's when he mastered the mortar business. After the end of the first three years of the contract, he decided to return to civilian life. After starting large-scale invasion immediately returned to the ranks of the Armed Forces. Later, -Vasylok- was transferred to the 82nd ODSHBr and immediately went with his comrades to defend our land from the invaders in the Zaporizhzhia direction. -Then we worked quite accurately against the enemy. It is worth understanding that the mortar work is not easy, and you need to have a lot of strength and health to carry mines, mortar and many other things. After the Zaporozhye direction, we were transferred to Vovchanskyi. We also worked well there. Already from there we went to Kurshchyna,- Vasylyok shares. According to him, many people mistakenly believe that the mortars are at a distance of 10-15 kilometers from the battle line, but this is not so. The commander of the mortar unit says that their positions are 2-3 kilometers away, and sometimes on the same level as the infantry, because they constantly have to cover their comrades from the enemy.

There were a lot of them, I think there were more than twenty in total, maybe thirty, he said. The officer described the composition of the captured Russian servicemen. — These are fighters of a very different class. These are just some mobilized, usually without any strong training, just thrown into plugging holes.

That is, a very diverse contingent that entered, said the military man. Anton Baev said that the operation in the north of the Kharkiv region on the territory of the Lipetsk community was difficult and it is ongoing. — The operation was quite difficult and, in principle, it continues, because we understand that the area that we have now taken under our control has been recaptured, it needs to be established, it needs to be prepared, and further conditions must be created so that it is possible to was to improve the tactical position in the future.

The President explained why Western partners should support the Victory Plan	This said President Volodymyr Zelenskyi at a press conference following his participation in the meeting of the European advice -The victory plan is primarily a document that strengthens Ukraine, gives Ukraine the opportunity to be strong. This is not only a battlefield, it is a geopolitical strengthening, determination of Ukraine. It is not only about weapons, but also about certainty for the people - what will happen to them tomorrow, what will happen to their country, in which country they will live after the war,- said the President. Volodymyr Zelenskyi emphasized that the plan also includes weapons, invites Ukraine to NATO, and economic strengthening. -It is a certainty that there will be investments here, that our resources will be protected. And if they don't give (what Ukraine is asking for. — Ed.), it will be very difficult for us, and it will play into the hands of Russia. The weakness of Ukraine is a strength for Russia. And this will be a big mistake,- he said. The head of state explained that items such as an invitation to NATO, as well as a package of long-range weapons, are rather preventive measures. -This does not mean NATO membership right now. This is a sign that we will be there, that Ukraine is not alone. The same goes for weapons. Before deploying a weapon package, there is always an opportunity to give a signal to stop the war. And if you don't want to, we have the power to stop you,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

The reasons on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- the spokesman of the Naval Forces told Ukrainian Armed Forces captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. - It should be understood that they are actually in a closed water area. The Russians have no sense to somehow strengthen it, to replenish it with some units. The reason is the impossibility of using these units in the Azov-Black Sea region and the insufficient material and technical base, that is, the infrastructure facilities at the base point were not designed for such a number of ships and they are forced to stay at the Novorossiy base point, he said. Therefore, the Black Sea area is closed, the base in Novorossiya is unable to receive a larger number of ships, and the Russian occupiers are unable to effectively use their Black Sea fleet. This makes attempts to strengthen it meaningless. -Therefore, there is no question of any strengthening, strengthening, -deepening and expansion- as of now and there are no prospects for it and there are no reasons,- the spokesman emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform explained why Russians rarely launch missiles from the Black Sea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/17/akvatoriya-baza-sens-u-vms-oczinyly-perspektyvy-posylennya-chornomorskogo-flotu-rf/	2024-10-17T04:17:15-07:00

It is noted that during the program's year of operation, it was possible to attract only 18 doctors - at first 10 people, and recently eight more.

The effectiveness of individual -Calibers-: why the Russians launch missiles less often from the Bla...	The reasons on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- the spokesman of the Naval Forces told Ukrainian Armed Forces captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. — As practice shows, when there are one or two submarines in the sea, especially if only one of them, missile carriers do not perform tasks related to the use of missiles. They are performing the task of protecting the base point, he said. The officer spoke about the reason for the Russians' refusal to launch independent missile launches from the Black Sea. — Even if they decide to carry out launches not as part of a combined attack, but independently, as practice has shown, these launches are not effective. Therefore, the enemy no longer uses them individually. Even if the ships go to sea in the number of, for example, several units of cruise missile carriers, this does not mean that there will necessarily be shelling, the military officer noted. He noted that the reason for the rejection of independent missile launches from the ships of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation was the low efficiency of this type of weapon. — The low effectiveness of these weapon systems as of now has forced the enemy to use them more to distract air defense during massive missile attacks. Therefore, I can say that the situation is stable as of now, he said. At the same time, the spokesman noted that the threat of a Russian missile attack from the Black Sea is always present, because it takes only a few hours for the Russians to go out to sea and launch missiles. - It should always be assumed that danger is present. Because we observe one cruise missile carrier in the sea. In addition, in order to deploy, go out to sea and shoot back, they also need a little time - we are talking about hours, - said Dmytro Pletenchuk.

- Bribes from dodgers-: propagandists -attack- the TCC and SP	However, as found of Vox Ukraine analysts, this is not true. The news came from an unreliable source, and the post showed a photo from another search. The post appeared on an anonymous channel with a small number of subscribers, but when the post was picked up by one of the popular z-channels the next day, it gained more than 130 thousand views and went viral. After a reverse search on Google, it turned out that the fakers showed a photo from a search by the Security Intelligence Service in Zakarpattia Oblast, and not in Lviv. And it took place on September 20, 2024 in one of the military units, not in the TCC and SP. Russian propaganda uses every informational opportunity to deepen enmity in Ukrainian society and disrupt mobilization. If there is no information drive, it is invented. Today, TCC and SP are the main target, because it is the easiest to cause outrage. For example, information was recently denied that men who did not update their data in the TCC will have their certificates and diplomas revoked. And the alleged video evidence of fakers, in which a TCC employee threatened a woman over the phone to take her with a -man-evader-, actually turned out to be staged. As reported by ArmyInform , Russian propaganda stepped up efforts to disrupt the mobilization in Ukraine immediately after the checks carried out by TCC employees last Friday, in particular after the concert of the band -Ocean Elsa- in Kyiv.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/17/habari-vid-uhylyantiv-propagandysty-atakuyut-na-tczk-ta-sp/	2024-10-16T21:22:31-07:00

The apocalypse will not happen: an expert on possible Russian strikes on Ukrainian nuclear power pla...	-Indeed, our nuclear power plants are in constant danger from Russian air attacks. Of course, you can expect anything from crazy people. Are the Russians capable of hitting the nuclear power plant itself? In my opinion, they are capable, but there are several nuances. First of all, you need to find out what the water-water power reactor VVER-1000 is. These are, in fact, the main reactors at our nuclear power plants. There is an incredibly thick casing. They were developed specifically taking into account potential strikes by small-kiloton missiles in a nuclear configuration. In order to break through the casing, and a serious explosion occurred at the nuclear power plant, thousands of tons of explosives must be placed inside. And if you hit from above, on the reactor casing, then, for example, the Kalibr missile with a warhead of 250-400 kg, or the Kh-101, or the Kh-55, or even the Kh-47M2 -Dagger- (the warheads of these missiles vary from 300 up to 500 kg - ed.), unable to penetrate it. rockets can hit distribution devices of nuclear plants and transmission substations, which are critical for the safe operation of Ukraine's nuclear power industry. But again, the VVER-1000 reactor was built with such scenarios in mind. That is, if this happens, it (the reactor - ed.) will be shut down. Moreover, it is built in such a way that there are special containers under it. In the event of an accident, the reactor will melt and be hidden in these containers. And it will happen faster than the explosion and the release of radiation. Everything is thought out. After all, there is the experience of the first nuclear disaster in Great Britain, then the accident at the Three Mile Island NPP in the USA, our Chernobyl and the Japanese Fukushima. It is very important to inform allies and international institutions about the plans of the Russian Federation to damage Ukrainian nuclear energy facilities. the Russians have the ability to deliver a tactical nuclear strike. The same Iskander complex can be equipped with a nuclear warhead of up to 500 kt. And the Kh-102 and Kh-101 cruise missiles in nuclear configuration can have one megaton. If the Kremlin goes to such madness, we must understand, it will already be a nuclear precedent. Then surely the reaction of the Allies will be as it should be. What it will be, I cannot predict. God forbid that this (tactical nuclear strike — ed.) never happens. But for the moment, it is necessary to lower the degree that this could lead to some kind of global catastrophe. It can be very unpleasant and painful, but, in my opinion, there will be no disaster. I emphasize once again. The highlighted problems should be raised, the level of the threat should be outlined, but it should also be weighed against the scale of the apocalypse.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/17/apokalipsysu-ne-stanetsya-ekspert-pro-mozhlyvi-udary-rosiyan-po-ukrayinskym-aes/	2024-10-16T20:57:55-07:00
We need replenishment, we don't have enough strength: rock musician, defender Serhiy Vasylyuk appeal...	— I am a musician, and currently an active military serviceman, performing combat tasks in the Bakhmut direction. The war is far from Kyiv and Lviv, a little closer to Kharkiv and the Dnipro. In order for it to remain so, and ideally for us to still win, certain rotations, certain replacements must take place in our knightly family, because people get exhausted, burn out, get tired, get injured, die. An infantryman, mortar and aerial scout: the story of the leader of the band -Shadow of the Sun- Sergey Vasylyuk They need a replacement so that the war will continue to be far from your native homes. Therefore, take responsibility and help us, those who have been fighting for more than two years. We need replenishment, there are not enough forces. Please note that recruitment is currently possible. Use it. After all, highly intellectual areas of work in the Armed Forces are now in high demand, and you can, with a moderate risk to your life, perform combat tasks no less effectively than a traditional infantryman-warrior in the trenches. Therefore, join the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This is the only way we will surely win. Earlier in an interview ArmyInform Serhiy Vasylyuk shared his own experience of mobilization: — I was motivated by two reasons. First, in the repertoire of -Shadow of the Sun- the main theme is Ukrainian heroics. Starting with the album -Stormy Land- we sang about current events, before that we sang about the heroic past, which we projected into the present. Therefore, it was not even convenient for me not to join the army. And the second reason is that I probably would not have written such music, would not have sung such a song, if I had not had the spirit of a warrior in me, if I had not been fond of military games as a child. Just with a guitar in this age-old time, I would feel inferior. I believe that it is necessary to help my brothers on the front lines. Don't be afraid of mobilization. If I were not serving now, I would again go to the Military Commissariat to sign up as a volunteer. After all, we all have a noble chance to return from the war victorious. We remind you that the list of vacancies in the Defense Forces of Ukraine can be found on the ArmyInform website.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/17/nam-potribne-popovnennya-syl-ne-vystachaye-rok-muzykant-zahysnyk-sergij-vasylyuk-zvernuvsya-do-tyh-hto-shhe-vagayetsya/	2024-10-16T20:44:16-07:00
-In one breath-. How Celentano from the ZSU captured a Tajik under Robotyn	He joined the ranks of the ZSU in July 2023. Has the rank of junior sergeant. And twice with his brothers he captured ethnic Tajiks near Robotyn in Zaporizhzhia. For the second time, he led a small group that captured the second prisoner with a fight. Celentano serves in the 454th separate infantry battalion of the 141st separate infantry brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. After the training center, joined the unit as a machine gunner, now another position. In the spring of 2024, a story happened with a captured Tajik. -They told me to storm: because either ours entered there, or the enemies. It turns out that enemies. Went to the KSP, took a smoke grenade&#8230; You see, this was my first such assault, everything happened quickly and on adrenaline. In one breath, you can say (laughs - ed.). There was another occupant, but he did not survive. The situation was such that we threw a grenade, he suffered a severe shrapnel wound. And then he blew himself up with a grenade,- Celentano recalls a fragment of that day. The story of the capture of a Tajik is not the only one. He says that he often had to go to Robotyne. Such or similar forays happen often. Sometimes, he recalls, they came to work for two weeks. -We control the territory, monitor and stop the advance of the enemy, enemy assaults,- the serviceman succinctly recounts the specifics of his work. I ask what a military man would answer to all civilians who have not yet decided to join the ranks of the Defense Forces. Currently, the serviceman performs combat tasks together with the unit in the Zaporizhzhia region.

-He crossed himself, turned to Fortuna and ran on-: Guardsman Pooh about the fighting in the Pokrovs...	This story told in the National Guard of Ukraine. At the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the guardsman and his brother went on guard duty like a teroboron. On February 28, the first column of enemy vehicles entered Makarivka in the amount of more than 300 units, 111 of which were tanks. Pooh and his brother were not confused and immediately ran, sat quietly and counted the equipment, and later, through the headman, they transmitted data about the number. On March 18, 2022, Pooh was already in the army. After seeing with his own eyes, he couldn't help but come. Currently, he is a member of the 2nd Halych brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, performing tasks in the Pokrovsky direction. He is not only an infantryman, but also a medic in his unit. He must not only repel assaults, but also provide medical assistance to his comrades. Several times during the movement between positions, the enemy worked on it with various weapons. -We were asked by the company commander to go through the position where our guys were poisoned with gases when we were going to be replaced. You understand that your guys are sitting there, and especially since you are a medic, they need help, and you just do it because it's your job. They were covered very much, very much. Arta, mortars, drones, there was horror in that position. The cat, calling his friend, brought a pack of water. We gave the boys a drink of water and told them. While they were waiting for evacuation, drones flew in. Come on, give us nightmares. They asked to look at the sky. And this is where the contact begins. My brother and I run out, begin to cover the boys bit by bit. The boys left, thank God. Little by little, we began to move to another position,- the defender recalls. Pooh says that if the enemy notices a position, he destroys it in two or three days. Then everything goes into action: gases, fpv, artillery, resets. He was pulled out of one of these positions by a comrade from the Armed Forces. -If your guys get caught, there aren't many options. You have to run and help. And just like that, Lyoshka (my brother from the ZSU - author) came back for me. This happens very often. If we take this entire war as a matter of fact, then it probably rests on this. Good luck, brotherhood. There is a task, whatever it is, we try to fulfill it. Especially since there are our brothers, our boys. That is, if not you, then who? Crossed, what is it called. I once again believed in fortune and ran,- adds Pooh. Previously, ArmyInform told the story of the artilleryman -Bena-, who traded Denmark for Caesar.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/16/perehrestyvsya-zvernuvsya-do-fortuny-i-pobig-dali-gvardiyecz-puh-pro-bojovi-diyi-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2024-10-16T11:48:38-07:00

The collaborator, who managed a gymnasium under occupation and tried to Russify the educational proc...	This is reported by the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office. The woman was sentenced to 1 year and 6 months of imprisonment with deprivation of the right to hold positions in state bodies, in local self-government bodies, in state communal institutions, organizations and enterprises related to the field of education for a period of 10 years. Prosecutors proved that in July 2022, the accused, while in the territory of Kupyan Oblast, occupied by the Russian invaders at the time, voluntarily went to cooperate with the enemy. The woman agreed to the occupiers' offer to head the so-called -Velikohutor Gymnasium of the VGA of the Kupyan District-, created on the material and technical base of the Ukrainian educational institution. Newly baked -y. at. director- informed gymnasium teachers and students' parents about the establishment and implementation of Russian education standards. The collaborator collected lists of teachers willing to work under such conditions and recruited technical personnel. The accused carefully prepared for the new academic year - she conducted an inventory of property, received from a representative of the occupation authorities sample documents in accordance with the standards of the Russian Federation, including certificates of secondary education. In order to finally Russify the educational process, the -director- made a description of Ukrainian textbooks and books for their subsequent removal as -Nazi- literature. While preparing the premises of the gymnasium for the new academic year, the collaborator drew up a -list of office supplies for first-graders- and a -list of students- under her personal signature. The accused managed to organize and hold the First Bell holiday, but she failed to finally implement the plans for the Russification of the educational process due to the de-occupation. The collaborator was waiting for the trial while in custody. During the trial, she fully admitted her guilt. The guilty verdict was handed down by the Ordzhonikidze District Court of Kharkiv. There is currently an appeal period. Earlier ArmyInform reported , that a -hunter- was detained in Kharkiv under our anti-aircraft defense.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/16/kolaborantka-yaka-keruvala-gimnaziyeyu-pid-okupacziyeyu-ta-namagalasya-rusyfikuvaty-navchalnyj-proczes-otrymala-vyrok/	2024-10-16T11:03:46-07:00

How a secret unit of the GUR attacked military facilities on the territory of the Russian Federation...	About isin the material of the American TV channel CNN. Only two fighters with the callsigns -Serge- and -Vektor- were allowed to speak under the recording. According to the military, their target is an ammunition depot, namely train cars inside the depot loaded with recently delivered Iranian missiles. -There will be about 12 drones,- Serge tells Vector, holding a map in front of him detailing the target and range of Russia's air defense and electronic warfare systems. They then agree on the time to approach the target and the launch interval of the drones. Outside on the street, Vector climbs into his car. At dusk, the convoy pulls into the warehouse. Men dressed in black with balaclavas over their faces wait to hear their orders. Vector is brief, adding that there will be other units involved in this mission as well. He orders his men to begin preparing routes and relays information for the upcoming mission. -Planning is maybe 60% of success, it's all about planning,- he says. Each drone will be programmed for over 1,000 different waypoints to avoid Russia's complex air defense systems. -It seems that we are playing with them, but this is not a game. This is war,- Vector notes. In the warehouse, the Lyuty drone, manufactured mainly in Ukraine, currently wingless, stands surrounded by boxes painted in green camouflage with several Rubaka kamikaze drones. Vector explains that these smaller drones are critical to the success of any mission. The goal is simple: to overcome air defenses and divert Russian fire from the Furious, which often carries a payload of up to 250 kilograms. Opening one of the drawers, he takes out one of the decoy machines. Strips of metal foil were added to the wings to fool Russian radar. -We're trying to mix them up, and we're trying to send them from different distances, different launch sites&#8230; they try to destroy them. They send helicopters, missiles, turn on electronic warfare,- explains Vector. According to him, their goals are exclusively military. One of the many trucks backed up to load. In other parts of Ukraine, approximately 80 other GUR employees are preparing 90 other drones for flight, not all -Lyuty-. About 30 percent of all drones launched will be decoy missions, according to Serge. Men carefully load warheads into drone bodies. Each compartment then closes with the screech of a drill. Serge and Vector watch the final preparations. -Maybe (Russian people) do not understand what is happening in Ukraine, but when these UAVs arrive, they clearly understand what we have been living with for the past 10 years,- Vektor emphasizes. In total darkness, the drones move into position. A car with pilots moves behind. Once in the air, the fully autonomous drone begins to mark numerous waypoints. Back at the planning base, the hours tick by as Vector, Serge and the others track the drones with the help of trackers. According to the military, the success of the mission is monitored in three ways: with the help of human intelligence on the ground, messages in Russian Telegram groups and, later, analysis with the help of satellite technology. Only after evaluating all three can a mission be considered successful or not. Serge starts reading the messages he sees from Telegram channels all over Russia. The prevalence of this attack is becoming increasingly clear. Various cities in southern Russia — Voronezh, Yeisk, Rostov and Volgograd — are beginning to report drones flying into their airspace. According to intelligence officers, the mission to destroy missiles supplied by Iran was successful.

Survived a mine strike, and now hunts drones: the story of a fighter with the call sign -Kum-	His story told in the State Border Service of Ukraine. The beginning of the summer of 2023 is an important moment for the defenders of the city of Kherson. It was then that the Antoniv bridge became the scene of fierce battles. Vadim's group was given the task of controlling the approaches to the bridge, which became vital for the deterrence of Russian troops. The DPSU noted that thanks to their efforts, Ukrainian forces were able to maintain control over this key facility. -I remember when, after another artillery barrage, we had to constantly control the flanks and not let the invaders in. At one point there was an explosion, a mine fell under my feet, and at the same time the world seemed to slow down. I only remember that I managed to take a step back when the shock wave swept past,- Vadim said. According to the boy, the mine miraculously did not touch him. -The explosion itself took the breath away not only from Vadim, but also from all the brothers who were nearby. -Each of the fighters knew that such moments could prove fatal, but this time everything worked out,- noted the DPSU. New challenges awaited the boy during the hunt for -shaheeds-. The enemy began to use kamikaze drones to attack military and civilian targets. Vadim did not hesitate - he decided that his new task would be hunting -shaheeds-, and began to actively study the technologies of detecting and destroying drones. -It so happened that one moonlit night we were given information about several enemy UAVs moving in our direction. After discovering them, I took the machine gun and began firing in bursts. And then I saw a glow and realized that the target was hit,- recalled the Kum border guard. Vadim emphasized that every day is a new challenge. He understands that in modern warfare, every detail counts. His experience under the Antonovsky Bridge helps him today, because the ability to quickly adapt and make decisions is what saves lives. As reported by ArmyInform, Aiden Aslin with the call sign -Cossack- is a legionnaire from Britain. He fought against the Russian occupiers in the ranks of the 36th Marine Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. After a full-scale invasion defended Mariupol.

DOT stopped working with one of the food suppliers in Donetsk region. What is known?	About DOT reported on October 16. According to the DOT, the period of application of sanctions may be revised if the supplier takes measures confirming his integrity and ability to properly fulfill contractual obligations. The reason was the use of the annulled test protocol for canned stewed pork during the supply to the military in the Donetsk direction. -According to the results of a detailed study of the detected violation, it was established that the supplier shipped products with invalid quality documents several times. This calls into question the quality of the products themselves. As of today, the samples of this batch have been sent for repeated laboratory testing,- the DOT said in a statement. The incident occurred in military units in the Donetsk direction. From October 28, servicemen will be supplied by suppliers from neighboring regions. If necessary, another supplier will be involved through the framework agreement mechanism . -Integrity is one of the main requirements for suppliers of the Armed Forces. If we receive information about possible dishonesty of the supplier, we react immediately. This is what happened with the supply of stew with canceled quality documents. We conducted an analysis, as a result of which we found that Trade Granit Invest improperly used the test protocol for a larger volume of products than was approved by it. Such actions cannot remain without consequences, so we applied sanctions to the company. Also, we are now increasing fines for all suppliers for similar violations from 20% to 100% of the product value. I hope this will be a lesson for them and a safeguard against committing such unscrupulous actions,- said Dmytro Bigunets, Director of Risk Management and Compliance of the DOT. Currently, the process of controlling the compliance of batch volumes with those declared during selections for qualitative research and specified in the test protocols is not automated. Relevant documents are provided to military units when the goods are shipped. In order to strengthen control over the circulation of products, the quality of which requires additional attention, the State Operator of the Rear, at the request of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, plans to digitalize the process of compliance of the volumes actually shipped with those declared in the test protocols. Namely — to implement a system solution in the IT system of the management of the provision of the Armed Forces — DOT Chain. It is planned that without indicating the number of the test report or when the declared volume has already been exhausted according to it, the supplier will not be able to form a package of documents and ship the goods. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is investigating possible falsification of documents of the supplier of products for the Armed Forces. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/16/dot-prypynyv-robotu-z-odnym-z-postachalnykiv-harchiv-na-donechchyni-shho-vidomo/	2024-10-16T06:24:54-07:00

Became a hero without a weapon: a doctor gave his blood to save a wounded warrior	About this reports State Border Service of Ukraine. Nazariya was inspired to the medical profession by his grandfather, who devoted his whole life to medicine and, even at the age of 82, continues to consult patients.

-Combat- payments to the military: what they charge for and why they may not pay	Depending on the place of service and tasks performed, the Ukrainian military can additionally receive 30, 50, and 100 thousand hryvnias. In addition, there is an additional payment of 70 thousand hryvnias for those who are on the front line. But there are also reasons when the additional reward may not be charged. ArmyInform reminds whom and how much they should pay extra. An additional reward for the military has been introduced for the period of martial law. So that people who risk their lives every day can support themselves and their families. It is defined by the Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 168 and Order of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine No. 260. 100,000 is given to servicemen who are directly participating in hostilities at forward positions, in occupied territory, or between the positions of the Defense Forces and the enemy. This reward is also given to those who carry out fire damage tasks - these are rocket launchers, gunners and anti-aircraft units. Of course, they are not directly on the conflict line. But their time working against the enemy is also counted towards the payment of the 100 thousand reward. In addition, this amount is paid to those who is being treated after being wounded, and to military personnel, who were captured. 50 thousand are paid to those who perform combat (special) tasks as part of military administration bodies, headquarters and command, which carry out operational management of units. Including outside the areas of hostilities. 30 thousand are received by servicemen who perform combat (special) tasks in accordance with combat orders. In particular: Also, 30,000 gratuities should be paid to those who are engaged in demining (outside the areas of hostilities) and anti-aircraft cover and ground defense of critical infrastructure facilities. However, it should be understood that such a reward is paid proportionately to the time spent on the front line, or the performance of combat missions. On average, a little more than 3 thousand hryvnias per day. For example, if you spent 10 days on the front line, the payment will be a little more than 30 thousand hryvnias. This is an additional payment introduced from April 2024. It is intended specifically for those who directly perform combat or special tasks on the front line with the enemy or in his rear. This payment does not replace -combatants-, but is in addition to them. But it works on a storage system. That is, this money should be paid out only after a total of 30 days on the front line have passed. It can be for several months. It is important to ensure that these days are not lost in case of transfer or secondment to another unit. Read more about it here a>. Also, additional remuneration is received by instructors in the Defense Forces. How much they should be paid, read here. In practice, there are cases when -combat- servicemen are not paid. The reasons may be different. And you can defend your right to such a payment in court. But there are reasons when the additional remuneration may not be calculated on legal grounds: In all other cases, if you are entitled to the payment of additional remuneration, but do not receive it, you should resolve these issues with the command, or contact the hotline of the Ministry of Defense . We remind you that an additional reward is a payment that is in addition to a monetary security. How is the financial support calculated and whether it is possible to find out for yourself what amounts you should receive, hread in our other material.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/16/bojovi-vyplaty-vijskovym-za-shho-narahovuyut-ta-chomu-mozhut-ne-zaplatyty/	2024-10-15T21:00:09-07:00
They will see everything from the sky: Britain is mastering modified early warning aircraft	How claims the official portal of the famous American aircraft manufacturer, the currently unpainted aircraft is one of three of 737 NG aircraft on British soil, which are being modified by a highly skilled team of more than 100 people at STS Aviation Services, ArmyInform reports. 7: -This functional test flight, carried out safely and methodically, marks significant progress for Boeing and the Royal Air Force, demonstrating the rigor of our testing and the meticulousness of its evaluation.- In turn, team leader Richard Osselton, Wedgetail Program Director of the Royal British Air Force, emphasized the importance of this milestone: -This is a critical moment that reflects the extraordinary commitment of our program team. Together with our partners, DE&amp;S, Boeing and STS Aviation, we will continue this momentum and look forward to the next stages of testing and evaluation.- 7 are to completely replace the famous airplanes with -pancake- fuselages known as AWACS. How note analysts from the Army Recognition defense portal, the E-7 Wedgetail is designed for advanced detection and surveillance missions, capable of simultaneously tracking multiple air and sea threats thanks to its MESA radar, which provides 360-degree coverage. This aircraft is essential for situational awareness, which greatly improves command and control capabilities for decision-making. According to Maria Lane, president of Boeing UK, Ireland, and Nordics, the creation of the E-7 modification line in the Great Britain is a source of pride: -We are committed to providing this vital capability to support UK national security and promote regional stability.- The future Air Force E-7 squadron will be based at Lossiemouth Air Force Base in Scotland, where for now that the necessary infrastructure is being built. In addition, the Royal Air Force is part of a trilateral agreement with the Australian and US air forces aimed at increasing interoperability and joint development of capabilities. The E-7 program is also gaining importance on the international stage. In addition to the Royal British Air Force, the Royal Australian Air Force, the Republic of Korea Air Force and the Turkish Air Force already use this advanced system. In 2023, NATO also selected the Wedgetail for its Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) mission, further cementing the aircraft's role as a key element of collective defense. Following a series of flight tests scheduled for this fall , the aircraft will be sent to receive the official livery of the British Royal Air Force, which will be another step towards its full integration into the British armed forces. The MESA E-7 Wedgetail radar, developed by Northrop Grumman, is a significant improvement over the E-3 Sentry rotary radar. The MESA radar uses electronic scanning technology that allows it to track targets simultaneously 360 degrees with no moving parts, increasing reliability and reducing maintenance. It also offers superior detection range and enhanced ability to track high-speed targets, providing more complete and accurate situational awareness. How announced analysts of the IKK Defense Express portal, a radar with a phased array antenna and electronic scanning MESA - Multi-Role Electronically Scanned Array, has the dimensions are 10.8 by 3.4 meters, and the antenna arrays measuring 7.2 by 2.7 meters are also in the support. This allows you to get a simultaneous 360-degree view. Unlike old radar systems, operators can redirect power from -unused- sensors (for example, oriented to friendly lines) to strengthen the power supply of other similar devices. This increases their range and identification capabilities. The E-7 is equipped with upgraded communications systems that improve interoperability with other military forces, including ground, naval and air units. These systems provide secure, interference-resistant data transmission channels, enabling reliable transmission of critical information even in conflict environments. In contrast, the E-3 Sentry's older communications systems are less resilient to modern cyber threats. The E-7 is based on the Boeing 737-700 platform, offering better fuel efficiency and longer range than the E-3 Sentry, based on the Boeing 707 platform. This allows the E-7 to cover larger areas without frequent refueling, increasing mission endurance and operational flexibility. With ten mission consoles, the E-7 allows the crew to process and analyze data in real time , optimizing the management of the combat space. These consoles are connected by a high-speed internal network, which facilitates the processing of complex information and the coordination of operations. In contrast, the E-3 Sentry has older, less integrated mission systems with fewer real-time processing capabilities. The E-7 benefits from integrated logistics support and an expanded maintenance infrastructure, including software and hardware upgrades provision with the help of ground support systems. This optimizes the operational readiness of the aircraft. The older E-3 Sentry requires more maintenance and its systems are not as easy to upgrade. E-7 Wedgetail early warning aircraft in detail.

Can a florist become a paratrooper: in the 46th brigade of the DSHV they told how they recruit civil...	ArmiyaInform correspondents spoke with recruiters and instructors of the 46th Brigade of the DSHV about how recruitment in the DSHV takes place, what volunteers are offered and how people learn about the units. Recruiters emphasize that everyone can independently choose a profession in the army. - It is important that the choice is voluntary and takes into account the person's skills, abilities and civilian experience. We select the appropriate role in the Armed Forces, which also meets the needs of a specific military unit, so that a person can be useful, says Lieutenant Oleksandra Gerasimenko, head of the brigade's freelance recruiting group. Brigade instructors emphasize that everyone has their own strengths. — Someone shoots skillfully, and someone is not good at it. Maybe your forte is piloting. Young people who grew up playing computer games easily master UAV control, says the recruiter. Despite the fear of many that the army is associated exclusively with combat operations, the ZSU is a large structure that requires specialists of various professions. — For example, repairmen perform their tasks far from the front line. And there are civilian specialties that are not at all related to military service, such as florist. However, even they want to be useful, and that is why the intensive was created, so that a person could try himself in different roles in the army, Oleksandra Gerasimenko continues. Recently, the 46th FSV Brigade organized a two-day intensive for civilians. It is also part of the unit's recruiting campaign. The participants received all the necessary equipment. Among them were volunteers, wives of the dead and missing, as well as ordinary civilians who understand that war affects everyone. More you can read about this intensive in the ArmiyaInform report. One of the participants of the intensive, private entrepreneur Sashko, learned about the event from a billboard in Zhytomyr. — I was interested to see the army from the inside, to understand what discipline is. I came and found something useful for myself. I am thinking of mobilizing for a certain specialty, he shares his impressions and plans for the future. Another participant, Olena, saw the announcement in the Telegram channel and registered through the form. -It was important for me to feel at least a little what our military is going through, and now I'm considering joining the 46th Brigade,- she says. Recruiters add that there is a lot of information about the possibility of recruiting. — Information is available on the Work.ua, Robota.ua and LobbyX sites, as well as through outdoor advertising. People pay attention, call and join. Recommendations from brothers who understand that sooner or later the war will affect everyone and are looking for their own way also work, - adds Oleksandra Gerasimenko. You can also find a list of vacancies in the Defense Forces of Ukraine on the ArmyInform website.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/16/chy-mozhe-floryst-staty-desantnykom-v-46-brygadi-dshv-rozpovily-yak-rekrutuyut-czyvilnyh/	2024-10-15T20:29:59-07:00

About the course, dynamics and prospects of hostilities in the South of Ukraine on the air of the -Suspilne Novyni- marathon of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn told — The situation in the entire Southern direction is quite difficult, although there are not as many combat encounters there as in some other directions.

The officer singled out some of the hottest spots on the battle line in southern Ukraine. — Among the hottest sections of the battle line is the section in the direction from Priyutny to Velika Novosilka. In addition, near Orichov and near Gulyaipol. Separately, I would like to single out the Kherson direction. At the mouth of the Dnieper, the enemy is trying to take control of the islands and is constantly shelling and striking Kherson and coastal settlements, the spokesman said. Also, he noted, the situation along the coast of the Dnipro in the Dnipropetrovsk region, in the districts of Nikopol and Marhanets is tense. The military assessed the course of hostilities in dynamics over the past few weeks and predicted possible enemy actions based on the current situation and on the basis of currently known information. — The adversary carried out offensive actions and tried to take control of Ugledar. After he had some success in this direction, the enemy is now regrouping and will carry out assault actions in other directions. In particular, I now started in the direction of Priyutne — Velika Novosilka. In addition, he also transfers the personnel of the assault groups to advanced positions and prepares to conduct assault operations near Robotyn.

Losses of the Russian Federation in the amount of $8 billion: the Ukrainian army eliminated 144 arti...	informs about this Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The -blackest day- for the army of the aggressor country was September 22, when, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Ukrainian defenders destroyed 81 enemy artillery systems. It is noted that the 1st artillery division is 18 artillery barrels, the artillery brigade is 72 artillery installations. So, during 9 months of this year, the Defense Forces conditionally destroyed 144 enemy artillery brigades. The cost of Russian equipment destroyed this year is at least $8 billion. This is an approximate figure based on information from open sources and average prices for weapons and military equipment (AMT) on the world market. Thus, enemy self-propelled guns, howitzers and guns destroyed or disabled beyond recovery are perhaps the most expensive scrap in the world. Russia's spending on war, the seizure of foreign land, and the killing of Ukrainians could be directed to solving internal social issues. For $8 billion, for example, an aggressor could build 13 modern sports arenas or 18 healthcare facilities equipped with the best medical and diagnostic equipment. As reported by ArmyInform, the Cabinet of Ministers allowed the disposal of ammunition right on the ground demining.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/15/zbytky-rf-na-8-mlrd-ukrayinska-armiya-likviduvala-144-artbrygady-okupantiv/	2024-10-15T05:38:08-07:00

Will the occupiers be able to seize the entire Donetsk region in the winter: an expert's opinion	ArmyInform asked military expert Petro Chernyk about this: -Why are the Russians pressing so incredibly hard within their 2024 offensive campaign. The occupiers suffered a strategic defeat in terms of the liquidation of Ukrainian statehood. But from the point of view of geopolitics and, most importantly, saving the face of their Fuhrer, they need to complete the task at a minimum. This is access to the administrative borders of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. For Putin, this is fundamental. His order to enter the administrative borders of Donetsk was issued on October 7 last year. But since then, the Defense Forces have foiled the dictator's plans at least 4 times. This is actually very good news for us. Will the opponent press? As much as possible. Will he succeed in this cycle of dry weather to realize this idea? In my opinion, it won't work. At the moment, the Donetsk region is occupied by Russians for about 52-53%. Another 47-46% of the territory remains under the control of Ukraine. And in order to talk about such a phenomenon as the collapse of the front, they need to successfully conduct at least one military operation at the level of an army corps or division. But break through our battle formations somewhere 15-20 km deep within a day. This is what operational regulations show. There is no such thing. This is a very important detail. Of course, the fall of Ugledar is painful, but not catastrophic. We remember one of the laws of war, which says that battles can be lost, but the war must be won. One of the favorite historical examples, in the First World War, Romania lost absolutely all battles to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. But in the end she won the war. Plus, despite the fact that the Rashists took Vugledar, I have the impression that it will be the same as with Bakhmut. That is, they took Bakhmut, but they cannot advance further. Literally in a month or a half, the rains will come, the ground will be wet. And the Russians will not have the opportunity to carry out full-fledged offensive actions. Why? The equipment will not be able to move. This has already happened during the two previous winters. Let me remind you, heavy equipment: tanks are from 36 to 46 tons, depending on the equipment. Armored equipment: infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers are 12-13 tons, and armored vehicles - 5-8. Even a Russian infantryman, having seen it with his own eyes, cannot move through the field when the soil is very wet. The emphasis of the war will shift to a counter-battery artillery duel. In terms of counter-battery duels since last year, the Defense Forces have been significantly ahead of the Russian army. In just 90 days of summer, our gunners destroyed (damaged) more than 4,500 units of enemy artillery. This is a very serious indicator. If you divide this indicator by 72 (for example, the regular artillery brigade of the enemy is 72 artillery pieces. — Ed.), then more than 60 enemy artillery brigades have been destroyed (damaged). The average daily loss of Russians in manpower is more than 1,200 people. So far, the Rashists do not dare to raise the level of monthly mobilization higher than 40 thousand. They keep the bar at 36-38 thousand and do not go further. That is, we have, in truth, a simple and clear task. Wait for a month and a half. I think we can do it. And there will be winter weather. Next, in my opinion, there will be a so-called balance of fire. I believe that the Americans will eventually allow the Armed Forces to use longer-range weapons for strikes deep in the Russian Federation. Long-range weapons and the ability to use them are important for Ukraine, since the enemy uses its facilities in the rear to attack Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure. warehouses, logistics centers and command posts. Currently, the Defense Forces of Ukraine only use drones to attack enemy targets on the territory of Russia itself.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/15/chy-zmozhut-okupanty-zahopyty-vzymku-usyu-donechchynu-dumka-eksperta/	2024-10-14T21:02:50-07:00
Instead of a heart – an intelligent algorithm: Polish engineers have created a barrage UAV that can ...	As note the authors of the defense portal Army Recognition, barrage ammunition KRUK (raven in Ukrainian) is designed to increase the effectiveness and accuracy of strikes on the field combat, offering modern armies a cost-effective solution for asymmetric warfare and tactical operations, ArmiyaInform reports. The combat drone can operate at a height of up to 5 km. The KRUK payload includes a 500 gram warhead capable of carrying 180mm armor-piercing munitions or anti-personnel explosive devices. It has a cruising speed of 120 km/h and accelerates to 160 km/h when diving to a target, operating at an altitude of 250 meters above ground level for a maximum of 10 minutes after takeoff. The range of the UAV depends on the mode of operation: with a range of up to 10 km during direct line-of-sight control and up to 20 km in surveillance mode. The total weight of the system is only 1.5 kg, which ensures its lightness and portability. The launcher, made of lightweight materials, increases the total weight to 3.5 kg, which remains extremely low for unmanned systems of this type. One of the key features of the system is its ease of operation – it can be fully controlled by a single operator. The launcher is reusable and can be prepared for use in less than two minutes, which significantly reduces the logistical and time costs of deployment. KRUK is equipped with advanced target tracking and management systems, using intelligent algorithms to analyze the situation in real time. Electro-optical cameras enable accurate tracking of moving targets while minimizing collateral damage, which is especially important in modern combat operations. In addition, the drone easily integrates with various land, sea and air platforms, providing scalability and flexibility of use. The new drone has secure communications protocols to prevent data interception and can be operated remotely or autonomously for beyond-line-of-sight operations. And the modular design of the system enables its further modernization and adaptation to the changing needs of the army. Depending on the mission, the munition can hover in the air for observation or hit targets at high speed. KRUK is designed to meet the need for economical, precisely controlled and mobile weapons that can be quickly deployed on the battlefield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/15/zamist-serczya-intelektualnyj-algorytm-polski-inzhenery-stvoryly-barazhuyuchyj-bpla-shho-mozhe-atakuvaty-z-5-km/	2024-10-14T20:53:43-07:00
What kind of fake was invented by the Russian Federation in contrast to the story of the death in Ru...	As it turned out, the detainee was a participant of the Odesa anti-Maidan, she was seen in a pro-Russian tent camp on Kulykovo Field, later she came under the attention of the law enforcement officers for theft, petty hooliganism and drinking alcoholic beverages in a public place. The other day, Russian propagandists began dispelling a fake about her death in the Odesa pre-trial detention center. Margarita Simonyan even compared the -deceased martyr- with Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, a saboteur of the Komsomol during World War II. In fact, the pro-Russian activist is alive and under house arrest. This was reported in the National Police of Odesa region. And the fake was specifically launched to counterbalance the story of the death in Russian captivity of Ukrainian journalist Victoria Roschyna. She was detained in August 2023 in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. On October 10, Victoria's father received a letter from the Russian mini-murder saying that she had died on September 19. The causes and circumstances of death are still unknown.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/15/yakyj-fejk-vygadala-rf-na-protyvagu-istoriyi-iz-zagybellyu-u-rosijskomu-poloni-ukrayinskoyi-zhurnalistky-viktoriyi-roshhynoyi/	2024-10-14T20:42:34-07:00
F-16 shot down a Russian -dryer- -Chlopavka-: how the Kremlin -stumbled- in the Turkish direction	The AIM-120 AMRAAM belongs to the main armament of a number of F-series fighters, including the famous F-16 Fighting Falcon. Intended for hitting aerial targets beyond direct line of sight, depending on the modification, it is capable of hitting at a distance of half a hundred to over fifteen hundred kilometers. It was with the AIM-120 missile that the Turkish Air Force F-16 fighter jet shot down a Russian Su-24M bomber that violated Turkish airspace on November 24, 2015. Then the Russian pilots, returning from a combat sortie to the Khmeim air base, decided to -shorten the path- over the territory of the Turkish province of Hatay, which is -wedged- into the territory of Syria. The Russians deliberately violated the sovereign airspace of the Republic of Turkey, because they were warned 10 times about approaching the border and the need to change course. In view of this, the actions of the Turkish pilot, who had orders to shoot down any aircraft that flew into Turkey without authorization, were fully justified. The time during which the Russian intruder was in Turkish airspace over Hatay province was extremely small - about 17 seconds. Obviously, the Russian pilots counted on the fact that they would not have time to react to their actions. However, this time was enough for one of a pair of patrolling Turkish F-16s to capture the trespasser in its crosshairs and hit it with an AIM-120 AMRAAM medium-range radar-guided missile. The enemy target was destroyed at a relatively small distance, which was about 14-19 km. In the video published by Anadolu Agency and the Turkish television company Haberturk TV, it can be seen how the Russian -Sushka- catches fire in the air during the fall and crashes into the ground. After hitting the ground, a dull explosion is heard, after which an oblong mushroom of thick smoke rises over the hills. The Su-24M fell on the territory of Syria in the area known to the Turks as -Turkmen Mountain-. This enabled the Russians to falsely claim that the Turkish Air Force shot down a Russian bomber over Syrian territory. In fact, the missile was fired at the violator while it was over the Turkish province of Hatay, entering Turkish airspace to a depth of 4 km. Two Su-24M pilots managed to eject, but only one of them was lucky enough to survive — the second was shot from machine guns by Syrian rebels at the moment when he was descending by parachute. During the organized rescue operation, Russian forces also lost at least one marine and an Mi-8 helicopter. In any case, we can thank both the Turkish Air Force and the Syrian anti-government forces, which contributed to the weakening of the armed forces of the Russian Federation by one military aircraft, one military helicopter and at least two military personnel - a professional pilot and a contract marine. It was after this incident that Russian dictator Vladimir Putin uttered the phrase -stab in the back-, which spawned the -stab in the dog- joke and became the basis for numerous memes. The higher military and political leadership tried to frighten Turkey by aggravating relations, but it was not possible to go beyond loud but empty statements like -tomatoes will not be sold-. As it turned out, it is much more difficult to scare the Turkish autocrat Recep Tayyip Erdogan than the leaders of more democratic countries - Vladimir Putin ran into a tough and ready-to-escalate opponent in his person, and he was forced to -give back.- Turkey turned out to be almost the only NATO country ready to immediately shoot down Russian aircraft as soon as they violate its airspace. This is how Russia, according to the apt expression of network scumbags, -washed itself with tomatoes- and -rubbed- in the direction of Turkey. The downing of the Russian Su-24M military aircraft showed that Putin only understands the language of force, and all talk of the danger of escalation and unwillingness to resolutely strike in response is understood only as weakness and becomes even more arrogant. Unfortunately, NATO countries have not learned this historical lesson well enough. However, we also have certain reasons for optimism - Ukraine can receive the latest modifications of the AIM-120 AMRAAM 120 missile from the USA. This will allow shooting down Russian Su-34s — carriers of KABs, with which Russian aggressors terrorize peaceful Ukrainian cities and villages.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/15/f-16-zbyv-rosijsku-sushku-hlopavkoyu-yak-kreml-utersya-na-tureczkomu-napryamku/	2024-10-14T20:30:18-07:00

Unable to give advice: the Russian fleet is paralyzed in the Azov-Black Sea region	About this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- told the spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain 3 rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. - Whatever the degree of readiness, whatever the number of units, it actually cannot affect the course of hostilities in our theater. Despite the fact that they could transfer some units across internal waters, they will not do this, because they cannot help even the units they have left in the Black Sea, in the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, which is practically paralyzed in the Azov Sea. Black Sea region, he said. The Russians cannot send ships to the Black Sea from the Mediterranean Sea, and they do not want to from the Caspian Sea, because they will not be able to use them effectively anyway. — As for other water areas, such as, for example, the Mediterranean, they cannot get here from there. As for the Caspian Sea, with which the Russians have a channel, but you can see that they do not actually use it for this connection, the spokesman noted. The officer noted that the power of the Russian fleet should be assessed on the basis of its real actions, and that the Russians are very sad. — Of course, they can hold various events and they consider themselves a powerful maritime state. But, in any case, technologically they lag behind NATO countries. We saw their level of combat readiness in our Black Sea. Accordingly, the level of tactics and strategy too. Therefore, you can play with your muscles, of course, but real combat actions, as you can see, put everything in its place and the picture turns out to be a little different, Dmytro Pletenchuk emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the water area of ​​the Dnieper-Buzka estuary is extremely polluted with explosives and what the Russians are doing there.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/nespromozhni-daty-radu-v-azovsko-chornomorskomu-regioni-flot-rosiyan-paralizovanyj/	2024-10-14T11:37:39-07:00

Werewolf saboteurs: Russians resort to subterfuge in urban development	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — Such disguises allow them to infiltrate behind our positions in the guise of sabotage and reconnaissance groups. In addition, every Ukrainian soldier, our defender, needs to think twice about who is in front of him: a civilian or an enemy in disguise, who is simply preparing to attack him with a weapon, but hides it under civilian clothes, she said. Voiskova reported that such insidious tactics are characteristic of the enemy's actions, primarily in urban development. In addition to Toretsk, Russians resort to it in other cities as well. — It is characteristic of cities. Such Russian tactics are present, including in the Chasovoy Yar region. This is not a unique phenomenon. It is especially effective in urban development, the military woman explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Toretsk Russian soldiers change into civilian clothes, and also informed about the tasks of enemy saboteurs who infiltrate the rear of the Defense Forces in the East.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/dyversanty-perevertni-u-miskij-zabudovi-rosiyany-vdayutsya-do-pidstupu/	2024-10-14T10:24:52-07:00

The Ministry of Digital Economy saved ₴4.5 billion thanks to transparent procurement of drones	This was announced on October 14 by the Deputy Prime Minister for Innovation, Development of Education, Science and of Technologies, Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov. According to him, from the first contracts for drones within the Drone Army, they built a strict procurement control system. In order to sum up the results of joint work for the year and to formulate plans for the next one, drone manufacturers who have contracts with the State Special Communications, representatives of the BEB and NABU were gathered. Manufacturers voiced their concerns, discussed issues related to drone contracting, and formed a unified vision for the track. -In 2023, we opened the drone market - killed all the bureaucracy, created the best conditions for the development and scaling of companies, increased the margin from 1% to 25%. This is the highest indicator in the world,- noted Mykhailo Fedorov. Also, the state began to purchase drones through the closed functionality of Prozorro, in order to conclude contracts at the most favorable prices. -The market is developing, the number of manufacturers and contracts is growing, already 150 companies are selling drones to the state. The procurement process is as transparent as possible. NABU and BEB have access to the CRM system with all information about contracts and drones. Every UAV undergoes a mandatory price review,- he assured. The supply chain works separately - a team of experts, NABU and journalists who monitor the prices of drones. If an overestimated cost is found, the price is immediately adjusted at the stage of concluding contracts. -It is important for us that drone manufacturers do not overestimate the margin of 25%, because all cases will be recorded by NABU and BEB detectives. We have already passed 30+ resolutions to liberalize the market, and we are not stopping there,- said Mykhailo Fedorov. In his opinion, if Ukraine wants to win the war thanks to technologies, it is necessary to support the manufacturers of these technologies. -And we're doing everything we can to do that. At the same time, we demand an honest position from manufacturers as well. Only transparent cooperation between the state and manufacturers will make it possible to gain a technological advantage at the front,- he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, the government launched creation of certified private schools to train drone operators.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/minczyfra-zekonomyla-%e2%82%b445-mlrd-zavdyaky-prozorym-zakupivlyam-droniv/	2024-10-14T09:58:26-07:00

The water area of ​​the Dnieper-Buzka estuary is extremely polluted with explosives: what are the Ru...	About this spoke the spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. — The water area of ​​the Dnieper-Buzka estuary remains a combat zone, it is under both enemy and our fire control. The degree of mining of this water area should also be sufficiently high. At the moment, it is difficult to say, because it is practically impossible to investigate this question on a practical level. But, taking into account the fact that virtually everything that was washed away by the high water after the destruction of the Kakhovskaya HPP by the Russians got into this water area, there must be a lot of mine-explosive devices there, the spokesman said. In view of this, control over the water area of ​​the Dnieper-Buzka estuary is problematic. Also, its restoration is prevented by the Russian occupiers who are on the Kinburn spit. The officer commented on the information about the Russians' attempts to transfer boats to the Dnipro-Buzka estuary. — There is nothing unexpected in this. It should be understood that such units can be pulled by land on carriages. These are not such large units that require a mandatory passage by sea, the military explained. At the same time, the Defense Forces are actively countering the enemy, thwarting his intentions and disrupting his plans. — They are also repulsed, they are in the damage zone, don't forget that. That is why hostilities continue there, Dmytro Pletenchuk emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported thatin the Forces defense explained the reasons for the activation of the Russian occupiers on the Kinburn spit.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/akvatoriya-dniprovsko-buzkogo-lymanu-nadzvychajno-zabrudnena-vybuhovymy-predmetamy-shho-tam-roblyat-rosiyany/	2024-10-14T08:37:01-07:00

Why are they doing this and what measures are they resorting to on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- spoken the spokesperson of the Military -Marine Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. — They are making maximum efforts for this and this object continues to be a priority object to which they direct all their resources. We can even observe that such objects as, for example, an oil depot, turned out to be not as protected as the same so-called -Crimean bridge-, he said. The spokesman explained why the Kerch Bridge is such a valuable pastime for the Russian occupiers. — It is quite simple to understand, it is actually the only such still quite serious artery that connects the temporarily occupied Crimea with the so-called Russian Federation. And, of course, the propagandistic weight of this object is also not diminishing in any way, - emphasized the military man. The officer told how exactly the Russian invaders are trying to protect the Kerch bridge. — That is why the enemy is making every effort to preserve it, even without having the ability to do it from the sea, as it once was. Now they mostly use aviation, boom barriers, barge barriers for this purpose, that is, they use all possible available means, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform explained, why are Russian ships constantly -running back and forth- between the base in Novorossiya and the open sea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/najczinnisha-zabavka-okupantiv-u-vms-zsu-rozpovily-yakyj-obyekt-najpylnishe-zahyshhayut-rosiyany/	2024-10-14T08:01:25-07:00

For the fifth day, the Russians have been trying to break through our defenses in Kurshchyna,- he said. According to him, the Ukrainian guys are holding on and counterattacking. -There was an in-depth analysis by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the SSR about who exactly is helping Russia to wage its war of aggression against Ukraine - militarily, economically, politically, openly and covertly - and what steps we, our partners, need to take to weaken these criminal alliances,- - the President noted. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also listened to the report of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine regarding contracting for the current and next periods, in particular with the use of partner assistance, regarding the investments of our key partners in the Ukrainian defense industry.

Weather will affect FPV drones, but the enemy is attacking with infantry: what will be the solution	told about the impact of the change of natural season and weather conditions on the course of hostilities on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon spokeswoman of OTU -Luhansk- Major Anastasia Bobovnikova. - First of all, the daylight hours are decreasing. So the Russians are trying to actively use the daylight hours, launching the maximum number of FPVs, trying to storm our positions as much as possible, because it's much more difficult at night, she said. The spokeswoman explained that changing weather conditions will also significantly complicate the use of FPV drones. -In addition, the rains, wind, and fog are beginning - this also complicates the operation of FPV both from the enemy's side and from ours, unfortunately,- the military woman explained. Instead, the enemy will continue to attack in small infantry groups with minimal use of equipment. — The tactic of using small groups has proven to be effective. They have a lot of manpower, no one counts it. The command of the Russian army does not care at all. Therefore, they can throw them just endlessly, said the officer. It is because of this that the occupiers practically do not use equipment in the area of ​​responsibility of OTU -Luhansk-. — Their lives do not cost anything, the equipment costs a little more. Therefore, we are not observing the technique now, she explained. At the same time, in the opinion of the spokeswoman, it is worth waiting for the exhaustion of the enemy. — We inflict significant losses on them. Over the past day, they lost 200 killed and wounded. But that's still not enough, they still climb, she said. In view of this, the main bet should be placed on the equipment of the fortifications. - We just recently spoke with the head of the Toretsk city military administration. He shared information about how fortifications near Toretsk were prepared. Everything happened in interaction with the military. They prepared them well, because both the city military administration and the military understood how important it is both in deterring the enemy and in saving the life of each serviceman, said the spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, where in the East the heaviest battles continue.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/pogoda-vplyne-na-fpv-drony-ale-vorog-shturmuye-pihotoyu-yakym-bude-rishennya/	2024-10-14T07:16:20-07:00

According to the instructions of the Russian special service, the agent collected information about the base points, traffic routes and available weapons of the Defense Forces, which are involved in the protection of the region. -The occupiers were most interested in the locations of the fortified areas and the estimated number of personnel of the Ukrainian troops on the defensive lines,- the report says. Counter-intelligence officers of the SBU timely detained the traitor in June of this year and established the identity of his Russian supervisor. -He turned out to be FSB staff member Oleksiy Dobrytskyi, who is stationed in temporarily occupied Luhansk. The court sentenced the -mole- to 15 years in prison with confiscation of property and deprivation of military rank,- the SBU said. As the investigation established, the border guard came to the attention of the FSB when he was serving in eastern Ukraine. Subsequently, he was sent to the Volyn region, where he began to carry out enemy missions. In exchange for cooperation with the occupiers, the attacker was counting on -evacuation- to Russia and a -position- in the military formations of the Russian Federation. Based on the evidence collected by the investigators of the Security Service, the agent was found guilty under Part 2 of Article 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law).

-Suspiciously calm-: where the heaviest battles continue in the East	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. — The past day was difficult, but suspiciously calm. There were only 7 collisions in our direction. The most difficult was near Chasovoy Yar and in Toretsk. This is related to the general goal of the Russians to seize Donetsk and Luhansk regions. We repel them in our directions, and in the near future they will definitely not be able to complete this task, she said. The situation in Toretsk is difficult, where battles with the Russian occupiers continue in urban areas. — The situation in Turkey is difficult. It is dynamic and constantly changing. The fight is going on literally for every entrance, for every street. We can see that the eastern and southeastern areas of the city are currently occupied by the enemy, but the rest of the city is under active fighting. We are holding back the enemy there, the military woman said. The officer described the enemy's tactics in the city. — The enemy storms our positions in small groups of 5-7 people.

The horror of the occupation: 6 Russians who tortured, stuck a knife in the leg and mocked civilians...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informed about this on October 14. The accused are servicemen of the 3rd rifle platoon of the 4th rifle company of the 1st rifle battalion of the 202nd motorized rifle regiment of the LPR and the chief of staff of the 126th battalion of the National Guard of the Federal Service of the National Guard of the Russian Federation. Since March 2, 2022, the Russian military, including the six defendants, occupied the village of Savyntsi and the village of Dovgalivka in the Izyum district. According to the investigation, during the occupation of these settlements, the perpetrators kept pro-Ukrainian citizens in torture chambers and abused them. In order to obtain from the detainees information about the Ukrainian military and local residents who help the Armed Forces, the occupiers used physical, psychological violence and torture. -Victims' hands were tied behind their backs, their vital organs were hit, automatic weapons were fired next to them, some were taken to the forest and an execution was simulated. -People were kept in inhumane conditions, without access to food, water and in unsanitary conditions,- the statement said. It is noted that one of the illegally detained men was stabbed by the Russian military several times in the leg and drilled into the wound in order to cause as much pain as possible. One of the victims is a deputy of the village council of the Savinsk OTG. His interrogation was personally conducted by the chief of staff of the battalion of the 126th regiment of the National Guard of the Federal Service of the National Guard of the Russian Federation. He threatened the deputy with physical mutilation, namely cutting off the genitals. -At that time, another accused was beating the victim. After the abuse, the occupiers left the torture chamber. Later, the deputy heard how the door opened and the occupiers threw a smoke bomb inside the premises, which caused him to suffocate,- the law enforcement officers said. The extras pulled the man out into the yard, put a rope around his neck and began to squeeze him, gradually limiting the access of air. At the same time, the occupiers asked the victim questions about local partisans. The man fainted from lack of air, they brought him back to consciousness and began to kick his body while he was lying on the ground. This execution was carried out several times. -One of the victims, a man who was 59 years old at the time, received serious injuries incompatible with life as a result of torture by the occupiers. Fortunately, the other victims managed to survive,- the law enforcement officers noted. The prosecutors of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office approved and sent to the court an indictment against six occupiers for violation of the laws and customs of war committed by a group of persons based on a prior conspiracy (Part 2 of Article 28, Part 1, Part 2 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine).

They don't shout to me - go, fight! - a military TCC about how he continues to serve with a prosthes...	About the fighter on October 14 Poltavsky TCC and SP. By civilian profession, an electrician, in 2020 he signed a contract for military service for a period of three years. He chose the 72nd mechanized brigade named after the Black Zaporozhets, where his father was doing military service at that time. He gained his first combat experience in the OOS at the Avdiivska -promka-, took part in combat operations in Volnovas. Anton met a full-scale Russian invasion as part of his unit in the Kyiv region. He says that they knew about the upcoming offensive of the Russian troops and were on full alert for a week. They arrived in the capital on the night of February 24, an hour before the first enemy rockets flew. Then there was fear, the soldier admits: they did not understand how the Russian offensive would develop. And resisting rocket attacks is not a task for the infantry. In the evening, units of the 72nd brigade took up positions in the Irpen area. Near the bridge over the Irpin river, which was blown up to prevent the advance of Russian troops on Kyiv. -When it started, there was fear. And the first fight was already on adrenaline. I was the driver of an MTLB equipped with a memory stick. But we did not use it for its intended purpose, but to deter enemy assaults. In the two years of my participation in the OOS, I have never seen such a thing: there was an assault once every two or three days, or even a week, and in Irpen there was simply an onslaught, Russians marched by the thousands - on armored vehicles, on tanks. There were much more of them than us. But we were no longer afraid. There was an understanding that we have a job and it must be done. As they say, do what you have to and let it be, what will be,- recalls the military man. After the Defense Forces of Ukraine with titanic efforts managed to repel the occupying army outside Kyiv Region, the 1st Battalion of the 72nd Brigade, in whose ranks soldier Barantsov served, was redeployed to Kharkiv Region at the end of April. The battalion was to become the striking force of the Ukrainian counteroffensive on the occupied Kozacha Lopan. But he came under the target fire of the enemy, suffered significant losses of personnel and was redeployed. Anton received a concussion, and while the personnel replenishment and combat coordination were taking place, he had time to undergo treatment in the medical unit. Luhansk region became the next place of combat missions. -Black Zaporizhzhya- arrived in Siverskodonetsk district in June. Various units took up positions between Lysychansk and Siverskodonetsk. Barantsov's crew was performing tasks at the Lysychansk Refinery, so that the enemy did not enter and gain a foothold on its territory. Then, as part of the unit, they were redeployed to the Bakhmut direction, where they held their positions until September. In October, Ugledar became the new place of task performance. -My crew mainly had the task of stopping enemy assaults. Our large-caliber weapons are capable of firing 250 rounds in 30 seconds. They worked to suppress. They held positions in this direction for several months. And they repelled several assaults every day. Vodiane was still ours then. I remembered the day of February 23, 2023 forever. We went out to suppress the assaults three times from 9 in the morning until noon, every hour then the Russians stormed, wave after wave. At 1:00 p.m., we were intercepted by the Orlan. And the dugout where we were was directly hit,- the soldier said. At that time, the equipment was camouflaged in a forest strip, and six servicemen were in an underground hiding place a few tens of meters away from it. A powerful targeted explosion killed two soldiers, others were injured in varying degrees of severity. Two soldiers lost their upper limbs as a result of the explosion. One of them is Anton Barantsov. -He received a concussion of moderate severity, his left arm was torn off at the shoulder, a severe shrapnel wound on his leg, and another shrapnel stopped below the collarbone. He gave first aid to himself. He put two tourniquets on his arm and leg. He lay waiting for evacuation for two hours. To be honest, I already thought that the woman would have to cook cabbage and bake pies. Because we were lying wounded, and we continued to be -covered-. I did not expect that someone would pull us out. Thank God, our brothers were able to break through and evacuate us,- the soldier recalls. It was possible to deliver Anton and his wounded comrades from the unit to the evacuation point in time. Ahead was a checkpoint, hospitals, hospitals, many months of treatment and prosthetics in Poland. In the end, the soldier passed the VLK and was recognized as suitable for service in the rear units. In January 2024, he was transferred to the Third Department of the Kremenchug District TCC and SP in the village of Semenivka. His duties include dressing up and making announcements. -The people we talk to see that I'm wearing a prosthesis. They don't shout -go fight!- to me, but the guys with me do. Although they were all transferred after combat injuries. I understand that every woman, every mother is afraid to let her husband, son, father go to war. However, we now have a great war going on, which we did not start, but we had to finish it. Therefore, every man must stand up for the defense of the Motherland — there is no other way to defeat the occupiers. I saw what the Russians were doing near Kyiv, in the Kharkiv region - they must be stopped once and for all,- emphasizes soldier Anton Barantsov. As reported by ArmyInform, the Dnipropetrovsk TCC reacted to the shameful behavior of a businessman who publicly insulted military personnel.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/meni-ne-krychat-idy-voyuj-vijskovyj-tczk-pro-te-yak-dali-sluzhyt-z-protezom/	2024-10-14T02:27:00-07:00

Spies--filmmakers-- The SBU detained men who were filming for the Russian Federation	reported this on October 14 Security Service of Ukraine The cameras allowed the occupiers to monitor the effects of -arrivals- online, as well as to adjust repeated or plan new attacks. The main targets of the Rashists were military airfields of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, thermal power plants, and energy-generating enterprises. According to the case materials, first the agents found the -necessary- objects, and then they installed and disguised mobile phones that carried out online broadcasting in front of them. For uninterrupted operation of gadgets for a long time, external batteries were connected to them. Counterintelligence of the SBU gradually documented the subversive activities of the agents and caught them red-handed when they installed an espionage device near a military facility. According to the investigation, both persons involved were recruited by the occupiers in the summer of this year, when they were looking for quick earnings on Telegram channels. However, instead of the promised funds from the Russian Federation, the detainees received suspicion from the investigators of the Security Service under Part 2 of Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The perpetrators are in custody. They face life imprisonment with confiscation of property.

The Vezha battlefield video analysis platform is now available in DELTA — Kateryna Chernogorenko	About this reported on October 14 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. This will improve operational efficiency and accuracy through better interaction and data sharing between drone crews, artillery and command posts. Vezha gives the Ukrainian military a technological advantage and eliminates dependence on other services. Instead, the enemy still uses third-party video platforms, which are often blocked by their developers or the Russian authorities. -Thanks to Vezha, the military analyzes video from hundreds of UAVs, detects and classifies more than 4,000 intelligence objects every day. Voice communication, joint decoding of video materials and monitoring of the effectiveness of drone units allow our fighters to act quickly and inflict significant losses on the enemy,- commented Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Digitalization, on the integration. The Vezha module has added to the ecosystem of DELTA products. Authentication through the combat system guarantees secure data exchange and protection against unauthorized access to broadcasts. The new version of the Vezha mobile application is integrated with the BpAK application planning module Mission Control and allows you to avoid the frequency conflict of FPV drones. This application is distributed exclusively through MDM (Mobile Device Management) - the military equivalent of the App Store or Play Market. Vezha became part of DELTA thanks to the cooperation of several teams. Initially, the 411th Battalion -Hawks- as part of the Territorial Defense Forces created a platform for its own needs. Subsequently, the Innovation Center of the Ministry of Defense joined the creation of a unified video analysis platform based on DELTA, and the teams of streaming platforms Tube and Raven provided their experience and work. The Center for Scaling Technology Solutions created the streaming core, adapting it to field conditions. This significantly accelerated the development and implementation of Vezha in DELTA. Currently, the combined team continues to expand the streaming capabilities to support thousands of simultaneous streams from various types of drones and cameras. Also, the artificial intelligence of the Avengers platform is being improved for automated video detection of the enemy in difficult conditions, such as camouflage or dense forest. As reported by ArmyInform, DELTA entered three of the most popular combat systems among the Ukrainian military. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/platforma-videoanalizu-polya-boyu-vezha-teper-dostupna-v-delta-kateryna-chernogorenko/	2024-10-14T01:06:14-07:00

Decades of Showcase Renovation: How Occupiers Neglect People's Needs	This was announced by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. In particular, in Aidar (formerly Novopskov), the occupiers announced the repair of the local hospital. However, according to the plan, it is promised to be completed only in 2030. The problem is that there is almost no one to work in the hospital - most doctors have either left in the last two and a half years, or the remaining specialists are of retirement age. Local residents are forced to wait weeks for an appointment with specialists, and those who have the opportunity are treated in neighboring communities. Artem Lysohor also emphasized the critical situation with heating in the so-called LNR. Although the heating season should begin in the coming days, the situation in the old districts of Siversko-Donetsk remains almost unchanged from last year. Communal services demonstratively started earthworks in the middle of the streets back in the fall, but the work on the laying of heating lines has not yet been completed. Local residents are forced to remain without heat for the third winter in a row. As reported by ArmyInform, the cities of Luhansk region are trapped by garbage: russia turns the occupied territories into a landfill.

The second issue of -Chaplain-: what will be taught to the -unfit- at Interflex in Britain	On top of that, you need to be in good enough health to withstand the rigors of combat. It is impossible to turn someone unfit for military service into a special agent, no matter how motivated he is. However, the decision of the VLK on -unsuitability- is not always the final verdict. The correspondent of ArmyInform tells about what can be taught to the -unfit- during the BZVP as part of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. Today, in our training duo, both are -unsuitable-, which after all their /->misgivings with passing the VLK purely by chance - almost two hundred brothers and sisters from the training company will not be allowed to lie - ended up at Interflex in Britain. In terms of age, my partner is approaching 30, I'm 45. Both of us had several opportunities not to go to the army - it was allowed to do so by being abroad already during a large-scale invasion, appropriate education and positions, and, after all, neither of us was in perfect health. 'I. The last one worries the most, but not because we are worried about ourselves - we are afraid of letting down our brothers who will count on us during a combat mission. The current task, however, is not so physically difficult - we should choose and quickly arrange the simplest individual shelter on the edge of the forest. This should be a hidden observation position, which should immediately become fireable at the first need. In pairs, we work to watch each other, spot mistakes, and suggest solutions. While you choose and prepare a position, your partner observes and notes your actions, paying attention to both successful decisions and mistakes. This effective methodological technique allows you to capture the attention of dozens of cadets at the same time. While the first two explain and justify their decisions to the instructors, the others continue to complete the task and prepare for the test. I choose shelter first. From the very beginning, a low-hanging branch of a coniferous tree, densely covered with old spruce, attracted attention. This is not the spruce or pine we are used to - something purely British. A paw branch creeps above the ground and literally grows in a thicket of fleshy, juicy green ferns after a heavy rain. At first glance, this is an ideal shelter - in the weeds under a branch, you will be hidden from all sides and even covered from above. Without hesitation, I crawl under the branch and break the fern stalks that obscure the view. In just a few minutes, I let you know that I am ready for inspection. The shelter seems close to ideal to me, so I'm waiting for a high rating. In the end, however, my disappointment knew no bounds—as I crept in, the bramble shook from the branch and the broken fern stalks exposed the position from the front. The enemy can easily see not only the bright yellow muzzle on my machine gun, but also me. My partner with the call sign -Chaplain- confidently lists all the shortcomings of my position to the instructor. Conspicuity for the enemy, lack of cover from enemy fire and insufficient, despite the exterminated fern stalks, visibility within the range of direct fire. The dense thickets of ferns on both sides do not allow me to effectively and inconspicuously maintain contact with my comrades, instead, my helmet, which is not carefully camouflaged by ferns, contrasts against the background of the open air behind me. Mission failed - the enemy discovered me and opened fire. At best, I managed to crawl behind a tree trunk from which a pawed branch was hanging and return fire. There is no question of any observation anymore - because of my carelessness, the fight started. Wet, dirty and dissatisfied, I crawl out of the fern into God's light. It was I who exposed my brothers to enemy fire and put them in danger when it could have been avoided. Once again I listen to the list of miscalculations - now not from the -Chaplain-, but from the instructor. He shows me all the shortcomings of the chosen position, walks me around and pays attention to all the details. All I can do is sniff and remember. I go around my shelter from all sides. Now it no longer seems as perfect as it seemed at the time of selection. The sun's rays sparkle brightly in the drops of water on the young gorse, from which I shook the old needles, the crushed fern shows through a torn hole. Now it's Kapelanova's turn to choose a position. We move to another edge of the forest, where he settles in just as quickly as I did before. His choice at first glance seems wrong, but trained by previous analysis, I do not rush to conclusions. His chosen position is open from the rear and flanks, which allows him to communicate easily. Instead, from the front, he is camouflaged and protected by a tree trunk and a small hill, behind which his fern-masked helmet peeks out less than a quarter. The advantages of the position chosen by the -Chaplain- far outweigh the disadvantages, which I will inform the instructor about. He nods his head approvingly as the translator relays my words to him. -You chose correctly and you explained correctly. Now you've both made it,- says the instructor and orders you to continue. He goes to the next couple, and we move to the neighboring area of ​​the forest. Now it's up to me to choose a position again. Trained from previous examples, I do it much better than the first time. This position provides good cover, camouflage and protection, and visibility for direct fire is generally perfect. -Chaplain- approvingly lists the advantages, notes certain unavoidable disadvantages. The instructor agrees with everything. Now, he says, you've taken the first step toward becoming number two in a sniper pair. For a modest level of achievement, this assessment of our efforts is too high, but we are pleased. We understand that, despite all the shortcomings, thanks to training, we acquire the ability to perform combat tasks with high quality within the limits of our sphere of activity. A -Chaplain- prepares to become an assistant to a military chaplain, assisting and protecting him while serving on the front lines. I am preparing to go to the war zone as part of a mobile group of military journalists. It is unlikely that, with all the existing limitations, we will reach the level of becoming a real number two in a sniper pair. However, in order to become a well-trained military second-in-command alongside a military chaplain or a military journalist, we are more than suitable. Basic combined military training within the borders of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain is quite capable of ensuring this.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/drugyj-nomer-kapelana-chogo-navchat-neprydatnyh-na-interflex-u-brytaniyi/	2024-10-13T21:00:28-07:00
Mine protection is understood in Africa: armored personnel carriers with a high level of ballistic p...	As emphasize the authors of the defense portal Army Recognition, who examined the African armored personnel carrier at the exhibition site, this versatile machine, developed in accordance with modern operational requirements, combines mobility, ballistic protection and adaptability to different weapon systems, ArmiyaInform reports. It should be noted that since 2010 Paramount Group has been producing highly mobile, mine-protected and ambush-protected ( MRAP) MBOMBE vehicle in both four- and six-wheel versions (MBOMBE 6). From these developments was born the 8-wheeled model known as the -Mbombe 8-. It stands out for its ability to be configured for various missions, such as troop transport, logistical support and reconnaissance operations in hostile terrain. MBOMBE 8 is designed to accommodate a crew of two, plus a commander and eight additional paratroopers. With an empty weight of approximately 20,000 kg, the vehicle has a carrying capacity of 8,000 kg. Its design features a monocoque body that provides increased protection and a strong structure. This design allows the integration of various weapon systems, providing high versatility in various military operations. The modularity of the platform also allows for growth to integrate future hardware. In terms of performance, the MBOMBE 8 is powered by a six-cylinder turbo diesel engine that reaches a top speed of 100 km/h and has a range of 700 km. Equipped with a six-speed automatic transmission and pneumatic disc brakes with ABS, the APC provides excellent off-road maneuverability. The 16.00 R20 wheels combined with the optional central tire inflation system improve its ability to work in difficult terrain conditions. With a ground clearance of 450 mm and approach and departure angles of 40° and 49° respectively, the car can overcome significant obstacles and slopes of up to 60%. The throughput of an armored vehicle without preparation reaches 900 mm, which increases its operational range. The MBOMBE 8 offers a high level of ballistic protection, compliant with STANAG 4569 - Level 3 standards. It effectively protects the crew against a variety of threats, including 5.56×45mm to 7.62×54R API munitions. In terms of explosion protection, the vehicle can withstand 50 kg of TNT on the side and 10 kg of TNT under the body or under any wheel. These features ensure maximum safety during missions in high-risk areas. Regarding armament, the MBOMBE 8 can be equipped with various systems, including remote-controlled turrets. It is possible to install a wide range of turrets and combat modules, for example, the AU-220M turret armed with a 57 mm cannon and a 7.62 mm machine gun. This allows the military to adapt the vehicle to specific mission scenarios. Additional options include communications systems, battlefield management systems, 8-ton winches, and engine, compartment, and wheel arch fire suppression systems. The vehicle's dimensions of 8,000 mm in length, approximately 3,279 mm in width and 2,400 mm in height make it suitable for a variety of operating conditions. Its modular design and various weapon configurations maximize the use of this BBM in missions such as troop transport, logistics support, reconnaissance and special operations. In terms of deployment, MBOMBE 8 is already in operation in several countries. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the armored vehicle from the South African company Paramount is used by the armed forces of such countries as Kazakhstan, the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan. Its presence in these armies confirms its reputation for reliability, protection and versatility, which makes the APC suitable for various types of military operations, including peacekeeping missions and intervention in conflict zones.

Enemy propagandists forge inscriptions on crosses	-And how many of them are there all over the country- - the propagandists comment on the image of the alleged burial of an unknown Ukrainian soldier who died during the hostilities with the number 214 350. Pro-Russian sources also draw attention to the homemade wooden cross and the absence of flowers at the funeral - it seems to show disrespect to ordinary soldiers who give their lives in battle. However, this photo is a fake. First of all, any native speaker of Ukrainian immediately notices that the words on the plaque do not agree with each other — -Here rest the unidentified remains of the defender of Ukraine.- Secondly, in real burials of unknown soldiers, it is customary to use the phrase -temporarily unidentified- to emphasize that the identification of the soldier and the search for his relatives are ongoing. In such cases, the body is kept in the morgue for a certain time, DNA material is collected from it to continue the identification of the soldier and the search for his relatives, and then buried with military honors. When the deceased can be identified, his relatives have the right to rebury the body. In addition, the humanitarian mission -Black Tulip- ensures that fallen Ukrainian soldiers are given a dignified burial. The search team brings home the bodies of soldiers who cannot be immediately retrieved from the battlefield due to intense combat or landmines. So, the propaganda narrative about the negligent burial of Ukrainian soldiers does not correspond to reality. With the help of photo editors and artificial intelligence, you can draw a lot nowadays, so you should not take all the so-called -photo evidence- of any -betrayal- on faith. . Remember that the enemy works every day to destabilize the internal situation in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/14/vorozhi-propagandysty-pidroblyayut-napysy-na-hrestah/	2024-10-13T20:26:08-07:00

Star Wars: the US space force announced another orbital mission of the top-secret X-37B spacecraft	According to placed on the official portal of the US Space Force, the device will change its orbit around the Earth and safely dispose of the components of its service module in accordance with recognized standards for reducing space debris, ArmyInform reports. The X-37B is an unmanned spacecraft created by Boeing to test future space technologies. The device has a fuselage length of 8.28 m with a wingspan of 4.6 m. The maximum take-off weight, according to open sources, is 4990 kg. The device can launch a payload weighing up to 900 kg into space. The maximum speed provided by the Rocketdyne Ar2-3 engine is 28,200 km/h. As reported, this is the first attempt by the US Space Force and the X-37B spacecraft as part of the OTV-7 (Orbital Test Vehicle, Ukrainian) mission to perform a dynamic braking maneuver, building on the experience of six previous successful missions in the safe operation of the space plane. as well as a decade of general lessons learned by the scientific community during missions to the Moon and Mars. The U.S. Space Force says that using an aero-capture maneuver — a series of passes using the gravity of Earth's atmosphere — allows the spacecraft to change orbits while using minimal fuel. After the braking maneuver is completed, the X-37B will return to its test and experimental missions, after which the vehicle will de-orbit and make a safe return, as it has done on six previous missions. -This new and effective series of maneuvers demonstrates the Space Force's commitment to breakthrough innovations in national security missions in space,- said US Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall. The US Air Force Rapid Capability Office (AFRCO) has managed the X-37B program since 2010. It is aimed at developing the next generation of reusable space vehicles for the US Space Force. Starting December 28, 2023, the US Space Force, with the support of the Air Force Rapid Capability Office, is conducting radiation exposure experiments and testing space exploration technologies in a highly elliptical orbit. -This first-of-its-kind X-37B maneuver is an extremely important milestone for the US Space Force as we seek to expand our capabilities and capability to operate in this challenging domain,- said Pentagon Space Operations Chief Gen. Chance Salzman. -This success is a testament to the commitment and perseverance of the team.- The OTV unmanned vehicle, based on NASA's X-37 project, is designed for vertical launch into low-Earth orbit, where it can perform long-duration experiments and space technology tests. Controlled from the ground, the OTV autonomously enters the atmosphere, descends and lands horizontally on the runway, reports The Aviationist website. Development of the X-37 began in 1999. The US Air Force has started a test project with NASA. However, in 2004, the project was transferred to DARPA. The agency completed the ALTV portion of the X-37 program in 2006 and conducted a series of manned and free-flight tests. Orbital test spacecraft X-37B.

Our editors reported in June 2021 that the US had begun deploying Aegis Ashore missile defense systems in Poland. https://armyinform.com .ua/2021/06/22/ssha-rozpochaly-rozmishennya-u-polshhi-system-protyraketnoyi-oborony-aegis-ashore/ In July 2024, Aegis Ashore was placed under the command and control of NATO -for the protection of European states from the threats of ballistic missiles whose sources are outside the Euro-Atlantic region,- said US Navy Rear Admiral Douglas Williams, Acting Director of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). The then Secretary General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, claimed that the system was brought -to full operational readiness.- He called it an important step to ensure transatlantic security, stressing that missile defense is the most important element of NATO's collective defense. https://www.nato.int/ cps/en/natohq/news_227649.htm?selectedLocale=en -Ballistic missiles have been widely used in conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. As a defense alliance, we cannot ignore this threat,- Stoltenberg emphasized. Territorially, the base is located 165 km from Russia, has a radar station and three Mk 41 launchers, each of which is equipped with eight containers for interceptor missiles of the Standard Missile 3 family. NATO's statement emphasized that Aegis Ashore -is purely defensive in nature.- With the introduction of the anti-missile defense base in Poland, there will already be two such facilities in Europe. A similar one is located near the settlement of Deveselu in Romania. It started operating in 2016. Also key elements of NATO's anti-missile shield are four US Navy destroyers permanently stationed in Rota, Spain, and an early warning radar in Kuredcic, Turkey. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/13/u-polshhi-vidkryyut-bazu-pro-ssha-yaka-zmozhe-zbyvaty-rosijski-rakety/	2024-10-13T04:09:40-07:00

The idea is interesting, but it doesn't count. -There is the first recorded elimination of a human centipede,- joked fighter Stus.

The press officer said that seven-inch FPV drones are currently the most requested for the aviation units of his brigade. -We never had parity in artillery with the enemy.

Russian saboteurs are giving nightmares to their fellow citizens in Kurshchyna, - the spokesman of O...	About this on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyvi- said the spokesman of the operational-tactical group of troops -Siversk-, Colonel Vadym Mysnyk of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to the officer, the enemy is throwing new units into the region, so the concentration of enemy forces is quite high. The Russians actively use both combat aircraft that drop UAVs, as well as FPV drones and reconnaissance drones. Artillery shelling is also constant. At the same time, enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups operating in the Kursk region are also showing considerable activity. -The DRG not only opposes our troops, but also terrorizes and &#8220;nightmares&#8221; local population. Although we do not see anything new and strange in this. After all, the Russian occupiers operate in the same way in the captured Ukrainian territories. In their turn, Ukrainian soldiers demonstrate a dignified attitude towards the locals and tell what their compatriots, the invaders, did in Ukraine. In particular, from the first days of the operation of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region, Russian civilian residents thought that their authorities were evacuating them. But then they learned that the same authorities already treat those who have not left the territories of the Russian Federation currently under the control of Ukrainian troops as traitors who take food from Ukrainian soldiers. So the locals already feel the difference in the attitude of Ukrainians and their military towards them.- stated Colonel Mysnyk. According to the spokesman of OTU -Siversk-, the Russian troops, which could not dislodge Ukrainian forces from Kurshchyna and did not meet the so-called -deadline-, will continue to destroy their own settlements in the future. -Just like in Ukraine, they will destroy and demolish Russian settlements here simply ``under zero,'' Colonel Mysnyk said. As reported by ArmyInform, the spokesman of the operational-tactical group -Siversk-, Colonel Vadym Mysnyk kordonu/->told about the presence of Russian troops on the border.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/13/rosijski-dyversanty-koshmaryat-svoyih-spivgromadyan-na-kurshhyni-rechnyk-otu-siversk-vadym-mysnyk/	2024-10-13T01:26:44-07:00

The most terrible thing was hearing the screams of comrades when they were beaten: combat medic Gali...	After leaving Azovstal, the Ukrainian marines were sent to the infamous Olenivka. Halyna stayed here for more than four months, Mykola - one and a half. The rest of the time, almost until the exchange itself, he was in a medical facility in Donetsk&#8230; We were placed in the building of the former DIZO. There was no possibility to get medical help here, there were no medicines and hygiene products - only what we took with us from Azovstal. They fed porridges and soups, where only worms could be found as meat. Water — potable and technical — was brought, the doctor recalls. The girl says that after hygienic procedures, the water was poured into a bucket to the last drop in order to be used in the future to maintain cleanliness in the cell: washing the floor and what could be called a toilet with a stretch. Due to clogged pipes, waste products often flowed out of the sewers - there were stinking puddles in the places where Ukrainian prisoners of war were held and in the corridors. Not the only opportunity to wash completely, albeit with cold water, was involvement in field work, because the bath was at best once every ten days. Mykola lived with his brothers in a barrack designed for 150 people. However, about seven hundred Ukrainian servicemen were kept here. -In the early days, there weren't even enough beds - we just slept on the floor,- the man recalls. But, you know, it was much easier morally there than in Russia. We were in Ukraine&#8230; Several times Ukrainian radio made its way to us - once for a moment we heard the national anthem, then songs by Ukrainian artists. In the summer, Halyna learned that the Russians had taken her fiance to the Donetsk Detention Center. From what was known from those who were interrogated there, it was clear that one could not expect good news&#8230; Unfortunately, the girl's fears came true - after being bullied by Russian inhumans, the man ended up in the hospital with broken ribs and internal bleeding. Interrogations were conducted by FSB officers - they forced me to sign a -confession- that I had shot several civilian cars. All the -black work- - beatings and torture - was already done by our former compatriots&#8230; the Russians -didn't get their hands dirty- in Donetsk, says Mykola. After those tortures, the man was taken to Olenivka, where a fellow doctor diagnosed that his blood pressure had dropped to a critical level. He persuaded the Russians to take Mykola to the hospital, where he was urgently operated on. He spent another ten days in intensive care, then several months in a hospital inpatient. Then he was returned to Olenivsk DIZO. On the day of the exchange, we were called by our names and ordered to take our things with us. -We thought it was another stage - somewhere to Siberia, so we tried to take everything we had,- the man recalls. Before the trucks arrived for the Russian captives, their hands were tied and their eyes were taped. And then there were several hours of travel - to the airport, most likely in Taganrog, then a plane flight. Even in the last hours of captivity, the Russians did not miss a chance to humiliate or beat us, Mykola says, the boys on the second floor wanted to go to the toilet, but they were not allowed. Therefore, it all fell on us&#8230; When Halyna found out that her fiancé was involved in another exchange of prisoners of war, she felt great relief. The day before, the girls from -Azov- who worked at the bakery were taken away in stages, so I went there for two shifts. I just come to the bakery, and there are guys from the barracks. I learned from them that Mykola is already at large. And I knew that sooner or later I would definitely get out of there - I believed that women had more chances to be free. In the fall, Halyna was transferred to one of the boot factories in Russia. The conditions of detention became worse every month - from more or less tolerable food to stale bread, which caused many people to burst their stomachs, and then could not eat normally for several weeks. In addition, we did not have the easiest thing - due to the lack of feminine hygiene products, we used rags. The head was constantly itching and the skin was peeling due to the lack of vitamins and the ability to simply wash normally, the girl says. Due to constant malnutrition, in September 2023, Galina had a critical weight loss. Then they put me on additional rations - they gave me an extra portion of porridge that just didn't fit in my throat, and they stood over me until I stuffed it into myself. That is, you even had a choice - to eat it or not, - recalls the girl. In addition, constant interrogations continued - the Muscovites forced, through beatings and moral pressure and sexual humiliation, forced confessions from the combat medic in those crimes that the Ukrainian defenders did not commit: torture and murder of the local population, etc.&#8230; The funniest thing in that situation was that we saved even those civilians in Mariupol who openly supported the Russians, but at the same time suffered from their aggression! Because human life is the greatest value in this world! - recalls Galina. And between the beatings and abuse, the orcs forced the prisoners of war to memorize -fastidious- songs such as -Katyusha- and -Victory Day-, Russian poems, and the rules for staying in the boot camp. For a long time it was forbidden to sit in the cells, which was constantly monitored through the observation window in the door. Violators were severely punished - by beating or standing for hours -on the twine-. The most terrible thing in that period was hearing the screams of the brothers when they were beaten. There was more pressure on us mentally, and the boys had a hard time physically. These screams could really drive you crazy, says the combat medic. And complete isolation in relation to news about Ukraine was also morally damaging. The only thing that was learned during the entire stay behind Russian bars was that the invaders were occupying Bakhmut. But, in contrast to the expectations of the Orkish pack, this information only pleased the captives - for two years of full-scale aggression, the Russians never entered the borders of Donetsk region. At the beginning of January, Halyna and several other men were taken out of the cells, given their clothes instead of the slave clothes they were in, and put in a car. The girl was sure that they were being taken by stage to Donetsk or Taganrog. One of the Vertukhians told me that we were going home, but the Russians were not a nation to be trusted. Therefore, of course, I was sure of something else until the very end. Especially since one of the guys who was with me in the car park said that he had already gone to such an -exchange- three times, the girl recalls. Hope came when she heard the phrase -woman first- during another stop. It's not obscene, but a woman. Because in general, the word -woman- and -girl- are very rare words that were used against us - because you are in the captivity of anyone, but not a person. The prisoners had their data checked and were put on buses. That moment was almost the only one when Galina felt a normal attitude towards her from the Russian side - the accompanying woman herself offered her to go to the toilet, gave her water. &#8230; After the flight by plane, again in buses, the Ukrainian captives were allowed to remove the tape from their faces and their hands were relaxed. And then followed the cherished phrase - -Glory to Ukraine!- The representative of the Ukrainian special service, who met us, got out of the bus, and we all sit and look at each other. When I saw the boys, I was shocked by their appearance: there were many of them with medical masks on their faces - they had been diagnosed with tuberculosis. And I think they had the same impression about me, - Galina recalls. Already in Ukraine, Halyna was able to contact her mother. And then she congratulated Mykola on another anniversary - a few years ago, on January 3, the couple started dating&#8230; Already during such a long-awaited meeting, the man proposed to his beloved - the footage with the certificate then flew around the world! Behind the combat medic is complex rehabilitation after capture, several operations. Now she is waging a personal fight for every Ukrainian prisoner, telling the world about the torture that Ukrainian defenders are going through in Moscow. I cannot be happy in the full sense of the word until the last Ukrainian prisoner of war leaves the territory of Russia! R.S. Galina and Mykola got married two weeks ago. And they also raise a wonderful labrador named Dora. The man had a lover while the beloved was in captivity - this was a shared dream of the newlyweds. The dog became a real salvation for a serviceman from abysmal depression&#8230; Photo by the author and from the archive of heroes	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/13/najstrashnishe-bulo-chuty-kryky-pobratymiv-koly-yih-byly-bojova-medykynya-galyna-fedyshyn-pro-peklo-rosijskogo-polonu/	2024-10-12T20:43:56-07:00
The enemy invents nonsense about the recruiting center of the Ukrainian Legion in Poland	In the Polish city of Lublin on the Day of Defenders on October 1, 2024, the recruiting center of the Ukrainian Legion really started working. However, neither on its website nor on the official pages of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine there is no information about the -Apple tablet- raffle or any other raffles. Presumably, the propagandists simply made up this news in response to the opening of the Ukrainian Legion's first recruiting center abroad. Previously, the Russians already tried to discredit the creation of recruiting centers. They spread information, allegedly by opening them in Ukraine, they are expanding the network of military commissariats, where people will be forcibly mobilized. In fact, Recruiting Centers help to find out information about vacancies in the army and to choose a specific place of service, according to professional skills. Recruiters are prohibited from transferring data to TCCs and SPs to speed up mobilization. But Russian propaganda constantly produces fakes to discredit and disrupt the mobilization campaign in Ukraine. But they will not succeed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/13/vorog-vygaduye-nisenitnyczi-pro-rekrutyngovyj-czentr-ukrayinskogo-legionu-v-polshhi/	2024-10-12T20:30:27-07:00
In Kurshchyna, Ukrainian paratroopers destroyed stormtroopers - a very rotten brigade -	The Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported this in their telegram channel. -These were bastards from the 155th brigade of marines of the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Federation, who especially like to show off their -feats-. Namely: the abuse of prisoners, as well as the shootings of those Ukrainian servicemen who, finding themselves in a hopeless situation, surrendered themselves, -said the DSHV of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As you know, prisoners of war are protected all over the world by the Geneva Conventions. But the Russians don't really care about international humanitarian law, so they rudely and cynically violate it. -But here it was not possible to hypothesize these monstrosities in military uniform: having met in battle with Ukrainian paratroopers, they were all destroyed. The same fate will await other soldiers from this brigade,- the paratroopers emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the 155th Separate Guards Marine Brigade of the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Federation is known for its war crimes, it was even characterized as -very rotten brigade-.

He added that last week the enemy carried out logistical support for these assault groups, carried out a rotation and will now build up forces and increase the number of attacks. As reported by ArmyInform, Russian troops are trying increase the number of weapons on the Kinbourn Spit, this may mean preparing for an assault.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/12/vorog-proviv-rotacziyu-na-livoberezhzhi-hersonshhyny-namagayetsya-zagostryty-sytuacziyu/	2024-10-12T10:22:41-07:00

Treason in Toretsk: Russian soldiers change into civilian clothes	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. The presence of local residents in the city who did not have time to evacuate makes it very difficult to conduct battles in the urban development. After all, the Ukrainian military is forced to take care of the safety of civilians and help them leave the dangerous zone. Instead, the Russian occupiers do not pay attention to the casualties both among their own military and among local civilians. — This actually makes fighting in the city very difficult. Because the Russians don't care if they kill civilians or military. Life means little to them. And for us, the life of every civilian is a value. It is a tragedy when those we protect we have to bury, said the spokeswoman. The military also reported that the Russian occupiers in Toretsk resort to treachery and commit a war crime — they take off their military uniforms and change into civilian clothes. - I must note that the enemy uses insidious tactics, he disguises himself in civilian clothes. Therefore, our defenders need to think twice - is it an enemy before us or is it a peaceful resident in front of us, - said Anastasia Bobovnikova. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that for example Toretska in the Armed Forces of Ukraine explained why civilians should evacuate in time from a possible war zone.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/12/virolomstvo-u-toreczku-rosijski-soldaty-perevdyagayutsya-u-czyvilnyj-odyag/	2024-10-12T09:48:33-07:00
The occupiers became more active on the Kinburn Spit, the Defense Forces explained the reasons	This was said by the spokesman of the Defense Forces of the South, Vladyslav Voloshin, on the TV channel Freedom. The spokesman noted that Russian troops continue to increase their presence on the Kinburn spit to carry out assaults and possibly force the territory in the area where the Dnipro flows into the Black Sea. -Now we have a rather tense situation there,- said Vladyslav Voloshyn. He added that last week the occupying forces transferred a division of boats from Sevastopol, which will be used to control this territory. As reported by ArmyInform, as a result of active hostilities on the territory of the Kinburnska Kosa Reserve fires raged. The occupiers set up their positions there and periodically fire from there.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/12/okupanty-aktyvizuvalysya-na-kinburnskij-kosi-u-sylah-oborony-poyasnyly-prychyny/	2024-10-12T09:24:58-07:00
The Armed Forces calculated the losses of the occupiers in the Toretsk area for a month	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. She reported that, despite the heavy losses, the occupiers are significantly outnumbered in terms of manpower, regularly drop reinforcements into forward positions and continue to storm. — The situation in Toretsk is very difficult. Today, the enemy made 15 attacks in this direction. The vast majority was in Toretsk itself. City battles are difficult and unstable. Our troops are holding back the offensive at the moment, but the enemy is pressing in with larger forces. I will also note that the enemy is constantly adding manpower to the forward positions, she said. It is difficult to estimate what part of the city is currently controlled by the enemy. — The situation is unstable and it is extremely incorrect to talk about any specific percentages. The battles are going on, the battles are very dynamic, very difficult. We are trying to contain the enemy. During the last days, the enemy did not advance within the [direction] where the fighting took place. The spokeswoman described the street fights in Toretsk. — In the middle of the city it is very easy to mask mines, mining positions is very simple. In the city, on the one hand, it is more difficult, on the other hand, it is easier to hide, because there are basements. But when artillery works, it destroys houses, for example, completely erases them, and it is already more difficult to hide in these ruins in cities. Plus, the enemy can infiltrate the city. That is, a complex of measures is taking place that complicate the fighting in the city, the military woman explained. The officer reported the number of enemy casualties over the past day. — The enemy will suffer huge losses. Only in the past day, they lost 200 people killed and wounded. They just need to replenish the -meat stock- in their advanced positions, so they are recruiting new personnel. These are mostly contract workers, personnel units of the Russian army are against us, the officer said. She calculated the approximate number of Russian casualties per month only in the Toretska region. — In the past day alone, they lost 200 people wounded and killed. Imagine that in a month it is about 6 thousand people killed and injured. This is the size of an average Russian brigade. And this is only near one small town, the military woman emphasized. However, despite the heavy losses, the occupiers have a significant numerical advantage in manpower, weapons and military equipment. — The enemy outnumbers us many times. It also has a larger amount of equipment, artillery, b/c. They push with more force. They are now actively recruiting contract workers, they are being promised crazy money and that is why they are going for it. Thus, there is a constant transfer of personnel to advanced positions, - Anastasiya Bobovnikova said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the enemy controls only the eastern part of Toretsk .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/12/u-zsu-porahuvaly-vtraty-okupantiv-u-rajoni-toreczka-za-misyacz/	2024-10-12T09:03:35-07:00

A hit was also recorded on the garden society in Malodanylivska TG. The house was damaged. A 61-year-old woman experienced an acute reaction to stress. Under the procedural leadership of the Dergachy District Prosecutor's Office of the Kharkiv region, pre-trial investigations have been launched into violations of the laws and customs of war (Part 1 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). Prosecutors and police investigators are taking all possible and appropriate measures to document war crimes committed by Russian servicemen.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/12/vorog-zdijsnyv-aviaobstrily-peredmistya-harkova-postrazhdaly-dvoye-lyudej/	2024-10-12T08:43:28-07:00

Norway will appoint a person responsible for defense cooperation in the embassy in Kyiv	This was reported by the Minister of Defense of Norway Bjorn Arild Gramm in a comment on the portal Forsvarets forum. The official will act as a liaison and promote cooperation between the Norwegian and Ukrainian professional communities and industry in the field of defense innovation and industrial development. -To meet Ukraine's enormous needs, significant investment and commitment from the private sector is required. Norwegian companies want to share knowledge, experience and solutions both in the short term and in the long term,- said the Minister of Defense. According to him, in the long term, setting up production in Ukraine may become relevant for Norwegian companies. In August, the Norwegian government opened the door for the transfer of Norwegian defense technologies to Ukraine. Arms manufacturer Nammo concluded an agreement that makes it easier for the Ukrainian defense company -ukrayini/-> obtaining a license for the production of 155 mm artillery shells in Ukraine. In September, Minister of Industry Cecily Mirset visited Kyiv together with representatives of the Norwegian defense industry. -There is joint work between the Norwegian and Ukrainian professional communities and industry, which contributes to the development of solutions useful for the Ukrainian defense and those that have a transfer value for the Norwegian defense,- the Minister of Defense noted. As reported by ArmyInform, the government of Norway will allocate about $90 million to projects aimed at increasing defense capabilities, including for production as part of aid to Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/12/norvegiya-pryznachyt-u-posolstvi-v-kyyevi-vidpovidalnogo-za-oboronnu-spivpraczyu/	2024-10-12T08:27:14-07:00

CPD: Russian propaganda intensified efforts to disrupt mobilization in Ukraine	This is reported by the Center for Combating Disinformation. Hostile media present this situation as -lawlessness- and try to magnify this event, give it more importance than it really is. There is an increase in the number of publications in the media and social networks that promote the following anti-mobilization narratives: At the same time, the enemy's propagandists silence the harsh mobilization measures that are taking place in Russia itself. The CPD emphasized that the general mobilization was announced in Ukraine in connection with the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Russia as a forced measure and the only way to save the country from the Kremlin invaders. TCC employees act within their powers. As reported by ArmyInform, enemy propagandists spread information about the alleged disappearance 152nd separate hunting brigade of the Armed Forces together with the commander during the fighting in the Pokrovsky direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/12/czpd-rosijska-propaganda-aktyvizuvala-zusyllya-zi-zryvu-mobilizacziyi-v-ukrayini/	2024-10-12T06:49:41-07:00
The defense forces significantly slowed down the enemy's offensive in the Kupyansk direction	Yuriy Fedorenko, commander, told about this on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyni- battalion of unmanned attack systems -Achilles- 92 OShBr. According to him, the enemy aims to reach the left bank of the Oskil River, occupy a bridgehead with further access to the village of Kupyansk-Vuzlovy. For this task, the Russians use all available weapons, actively use aviation and try to fulfill this task. In previous periods, the enemy had little tactical success on the battlefield. -At the moment, thanks to the united and complex work of the Defense Forces, it was possible to significantly slow down the enemy's offensive. That is, the enemy will not change to go to the left-bank Oskil and gain a foothold. Heavy battles are going on at this moment. We believe that despite numerous losses, the enemy's assault potential remains,- Yuriy Fedorenko said. He added that the direction of Vovchansk has also become more active, the enemy does not stop trying to occupy the city, some positions are changing hands, the Defense Forces managed to squeeze out the enemy from some positions. -If we talk about the shortest administrative distance in the direction of Kharkiv, which is the settlement of Hlyboke, then the intensity of the enemy's hostilities has increased. They are trying to raise and put the rear services in order and have involved the Akhmat unit in this, an increase in manpower and equipment is recorded,- said the battalion commander.

-Not your war?-: How the network reacts to checks by the TCC and the police after the concert -Ocean...	It was stated that the documents of the men were checked, and some of them were allegedly detained. In addition, as is known from open sources, similar raids took place in Kharkiv, Dnipro, and Khmelnytskyi. ArmyInform gathered the opinions of military personnel, veterans, and government officials regarding the current situation. Yes, the head of the Humanitarian Committee of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Mykyta Poturaev stated that he does not consider the verification of documents after the -Oceanu Elsa- concert to be a threat to Ukrainian culture. -Just like after any public or mass event. Just as I do not consider document checks in bars or clubs a threat to the Ukrainian economy. Moreover, I welcome such checks, and I believe that they should be thorough and permanent. And everyone should know about it,- Nikita Poturaev wrote. Historian and journalist serving in the National Guard of Ukraine, Vakhtang Kipiani, also said about the situation that has developed. -If conscripted men went to the TCC or to specific military units themselves after every report in the press about the injury or death of a serviceman, then there would be no need to check any documents on the streets. Then there would be, if not enough, people in the defense forces, but definitely more than now. In place of the one who is eliminated, another must come. This is the main thing. If someone who has been waiting for his moment for more than two and a half years needs a special invitation to dance with a tambourine, then the uniform of the police and TCC is just that. If millions of men do not go to protect their families themselves, then the state exists to remind not only about rights, but also about responsibilities,- Vakhtang Kipiani believes. Military serviceman of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, public figure, human rights defender, founder of NGO -Princip- Masi Nayyem says: -There is a problem. We need to recognize this and look for a solution to preserve the state. It is extremely dangerous when there is an enemy at the border, and the mobilization takes place in such a way that the media only cover the problems of civilians with the TCC and the police. It is clear that there is a strong tension in the civilian population as well as in the military. And the negative buzz around the mobilization process can create tension between two large groups in our society.- Military serviceman Dmytro Ivanov is also reacted to the events in the capital on the evening of October 11. Yes, first of all, according to him, document checks during martial law are the norm. Secondly, the event gained resonance due to the fact that it happened in the capital. He also explained how he sees the answer to the question -why does a person go to war?-. -A person is faced with a choice: either a great chance to die, or to receive something that is worse than death for him. That is, the choice between -bad- and -absolutely bad-. A patriotic person, or simply a responsible citizen, goes to war, because living under the rule of the occupiers for such people is worse than death, that's all. But we have about 20-25% of such categories. And there is the remaining 75-80%, they have a different perception&#8230; And this category does not consider occupation more terrible than death, and therefore does not want to fight and will not go voluntarily. What does this category have to offer? Nothing but the choice between -risk of death- and -worse than death,- says the army man. Council member of the Public Council of Integrity Andrii Kulibaba emphasizes that for him the question of service and defense of the country is a question of justice and the distribution of duty. -I am very saddened by this video&#8230; Because these are the same people who at the beginning of the full-scale protest thanked the police and the military, when they pushed the Russians away from Kyiv, listened and sang along to songs about the dog Patron, Bayraktar and Vanka Vstanka, and wear a T-shirt with the inscription -Good evening, we are from Ukraine -. And now they are shouting shame, because personal comfort is sacred,- he said. Public figure Oksana Bailo draws attention more and to the fact that, according to her, in the third year of a large-scale war and martial law in the country, the concerts should be mostly people who are not subject to mobilization and military (on leave, on hospital leave, rotation, etc.). -And because of the fact that in our third (almost fourth!) year of the war of destruction, concerts and gyms are mostly attended by the same people who, for some reason, decided that they should not go to replace those who have concerts and gyms three years in a row look completely different, so forgive me, but sooner or later the second ones will begin to end, and then the raids begin&#8230; And yes, we need more raids&#8230; across all gyms, restaurants, business success conferences, etc. And a long time ago,- Oksana Bailo summed up on her Facebook page. And volunteer Oleksandr Karpyuk (known in social networks as Serg Marco) so reflectedthe events in Kyiv at the concert of a famous Ukrainian band: -In the list of things demotivating those on the front lines, citizens who were forbidden by criminal TCCs to use their civic duty to go to Elsa's ocean. Well, do you even understand what kind of eyes those on the front lines look at this? What will be their attitude to those who have already decided that it is -not your war-?- he asks rhetorically. ArmyInform also requested a comment from the Kyiv Police regarding yesterday's events, but has not yet received an official response. We remind you that during martial law, law enforcement officers have the right to demand from conscripts a military registration document and an identity document. Police officers can also check whether the conscript has updated his details in accordance with the mobilization law. If the law enforcement officers find out that the conscript is wanted by the TCC, they are authorized to detain and deliver the violator to the Military Commissariat. We also remind you of the opportunity to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces on our website and choose your unit without waiting for a summons or inspections. In addition, recently there was an opportunity to volunteer to mobilize directly by agreement with the military unit, bypassing the TCC. The introduced changes simplify the procedure for enlisting volunteers for mobilization as much as possible. From now on, if a conscript joins the army by mobilization, a reference (recommendation letter) from the unit is not required.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/12/ne-tvoya-vijna-yak-v-merezhi-reaguyut-na-perevirky-tczk-i-policziyi-pislya-konczertu-okeanu-elzy/	2024-10-12T05:51:41-07:00
