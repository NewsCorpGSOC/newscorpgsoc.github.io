The enemy uses them en masse. -Bradley went around the ravine from under the KABU and drove on,- Eneis said. According to him, the Russians are also actively using drones. -These are both ordinary drones and fiber-optic drones. The enemy uses them en masse, because he has a huge number. Enemy drones constantly fly over our positions. Those that are on the fiber optic are mostly used against our equipment and on our logistics routes,- said -Enea-. According to him, the Russians are constantly attacking, but the intensity of these attacks decreases after our strikes on headquarters and communication centers.

Five myths about sniping - the fighter -Roxy- tells how snipers fight now	The conversation with the soldier was published on January 2 on the brigade's channel. In particular, -Roxy- refuted several myths about snipers. Myth No. 1: A sniper must have 100% vision. Vision does not matter here at all. This is just a Soviet stereotype, because the PSO (sniper optical sight), which was developed in 1963 specifically for the Dragunov rifle, did not have a diopter. All modern optics have it - adjust it as you need. Myth #2: The main thing for a sniper is to shoot accurately. You need to be able to navigate the terrain, camouflage yourself, understand the essence of ballistics, read the wind, and observe at all levels of the distance. Pulling the trigger is the easiest, the tip of the iceberg. Myth #3. A sniper must freeze for hours. It is impossible to lie down and look into the optics for 8 hours, because after 40 minutes the eye will -swim-. But we can look at the tablet as much as we need. You have a long-range surveillance system, a thermal imaging camera, and there are rifles nearby. Something has moved - you go out and work. Myth #4. Snipers are lonely Another stereotype of the cinema. A pair works - the first and second numbers. But they will not leave without the escort of shooters, machine gunners, those who will mine, cover, observe. Now snipers must have a drone for reconnaissance. Myth #5. Equipment and weapons are incredibly expensive. It's true, but every member of our newly created team will receive everything for free, including state-of-the-art rifles and training in a special training center. You don't need to buy anything. On the page of the brigade, everyone is invited to join the sniper platoon. As reported by ArmyInform, the other day the tank crew of the 63rd mechanized brigade almost i-tochno-znyshhyly-vorozhi-pozyczyiy/->close shot the positions of the Russian invaders in Serebryan Forestry. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/02/pyat-mifiv-pro-snajping-boyecz-roksi-rozpovidaye-yak-zaraz-voyuyut-snajpery/	2025-01-02T10:17:51-08:00
They disguised themselves with a pickaxe and a shovel - the dodgers were detained at the border	This was reported by the State Border Service on January 2. According to border guards, such a railway route was organized by shippers. After arriving at the border town of Velikiy Berezny, the violators then set off in the direction of the forest, pretending to check the condition of the rails. However, the plan failed: the -railway workers- were detained by the border guards, and later their guides, near the barrier fence. The violators were brought to administrative responsibility, and the smugglers were taken into custody. The investigation is ongoing.

At the same time, according to Orest Drymalovskyi, the enemy is constantly raising reserves, throwing in new units, often these are fresh contract workers, former civilians who sign contracts for money. -And after two weeks of training, they are thrown into advanced positions. And the occupiers have almost no chance to survive in this circle of death. The occupiers' losses in equipment are so great that they are unable to use it in the same quantity as it was in October or November,- concluded the representative of the 79th ODSHBr.

MOU: Thanks to competitive bidding, more than UAH 2 million was saved on the purchase of lubricants ...	About this notified in the MOU. Savings of 14.3% of the announced cost became possible thanks to an effective procurement strategy, early announcement of tender procedures and active participation of suppliers. The first announced purchases included: The total cost of purchases amounted to UAH 13.52 million instead of the planned UAH 15.78 million. The average number of participants in DOT procurement was 4.17. This is higher than the average market indicators (2.6 participants) in the field of public procurement of the lubricants market. -The results of the work of the DOT show that thanks to transparent and effective procedures, we can not only meet the needs of the Armed Forces, but also achieve significant savings of public funds. More than four participants in the tender is not just a statistic, but an indicator of business confidence in the Ministry of Defense,- said Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. Involvement of a wide range of participants at each stage of procurement allows DOT to ensure the best ratio of price and product quality. This approach is particularly important for providing the Armed Forces of Ukraine with critically needed resources, in particular lubricants for various types of equipment. DOT continues to actively attract companies to participate in public procurement. For this, a series of educational materials -Tangent. How a business can become a supplier of military equipment-, available on the Diya.Osvita platform and the Diya.Business portal.

He added that it was a serious logistical branch for the Russians, as the ferries could carry up to 25 fuel tanks and wagons. -After that, they only had car ferries, which they also use for military purposes.

No money: Russia sells uranium business in Kazakhstan to China	About this reports Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The share of -Kazatomprom- (Kazakhstan) in JSC -JSC -Zarechnoye- has not changed and is 49.979%. In addition, -Uranium One Group- JSC plans to sell 30% of the shares of the Kazakh companies -JV -Khorasan-U- and -Kyzylkum- to the benefit of -China Uranium Development Company Limited-. -Kazatomprom- will keep its shares in these enterprises at the level of 50%. One of the reasons for Russia's decision was the negative impact of sanctions due to the war against Ukraine and reduced profits. Moscow's decision to sell its share of uranium deposits in Kazakhstan to China is a consequence of the impact of Western economic sanctions and limited resources for further investment in the development of these projects. Such a decision strengthens the influence of the PRC in the Central Asian region and changes regional politics in the energy sector: Beijing's control over uranium supplies is a strategic loss for Russia in the future. We remind you, 1 In January, the resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation came into force, canceling a one-time monetary payment to prisoners for signing a contract with the Russian Federation to participate in the war against of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/02/nemaye-groshej-rosiya-prodaye-kytayu-uranovyj-biznes-u-kazahstani/	2025-01-02T05:09:57-08:00

Training of F-16 pilots, digitalization of VLK and -Package of the wounded-: interview of Serhiy Mel...	In his busy schedule, he found time to talk with ArmyInform correspondents. What did Serhiy Melnyk remember about the defense of Kharkiv in 2022, in which he took a direct part? What radical changes have taken place in the army? How many Ukrainians visited recruiting centers last year? Read the answers to these and other questions in our interview. —You took a direct part in the defense of Kharkiv. What made it possible to defend a regional center important for the country at the beginning of a large-scale invasion? - Kharkiv survived thanks to the incredible courage, determination and self-sacrifice of our military, volunteers and ordinary residents of the city. From the first hours of the large-scale invasion, everyone was united around one goal: to stop the enemy. Residents of Kharkiv massively joined the defense: they helped at checkpoints, provided the military with food and necessary things, and worked under constant fire. The clear organization of the city's defense system also played an important role. The enemy advanced from all directions, carried out massive attacks on key infrastructure facilities, tried to destroy the air defense system and the command posts of our units. We operationally divided the city into seven defense sectors, and each sector had clear tasks and coordinates for defense. The first morning of the war was indicative. At 9:30 a.m. on February 24, enemy tanks had already appeared on the outskirts of Kharkiv, but at 9:43 a.m. they were destroyed by our forces. The enemy suffered heavy losses and was unable to advance further. Over the next few days, Russian sabotage and intelligence groups tried to enter the city in stolen civilian cars. They were in ordinary clothes and attempted to establish themselves in residential quarters before the approach of the main forces. However, this plan failed. Our mobile fire teams effectively identified and destroyed saboteurs. In the first five days alone, there were dozens of combat clashes between our units and Russian forces. Each fighter, each officer and each volunteer understood that not only the fate of the city, but also the future of the entire country depended on his actions. It was thanks to this unity, determination and effective organization of defense that Kharkiv held out and did not allow the enemy to achieve their goals. — Many military observers spoke about the moral superiority of our soldiers at the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. And what other advantages did our army have in February and March 2022 - technological, tactical, etc.? - The main advantage of our forces was that we fought on our soil. This is not just a territory - it is our home, every corner of which is familiar to the smallest detail. Our military protected every patch of land, every street, every house. And in each of these houses, the enemy could be met not only by a military man, but also by a civilian, ready to resist. The second important factor was non-standard, bold and proactive decisions of Ukrainian commanders. They acted in advance, used maneuverable tactics, struck at the enemy's vulnerable points, not allowing him to gain a foothold in important positions. Another advantage is the high level of cohesion of Ukrainian society. In the first weeks of the war, the country united in a way that rarely happens in history. This was felt by the military on the front lines, it gave them the strength to stand to the last. Every Ukrainian, regardless of their status, played an important role in the common cause. Special mention should be made of volunteer assistance, which came almost from the first days of the war. Volunteers provided the military with medicines, necessary equipment, means of communication, transport and equipment. International aid also began to flow in very quickly, and this became an important factor in strengthening our defense capabilities. The combination of these factors—motivation, flexible tactical decisions, public support, the volunteer movement, and international assistance—became the basis of our resilience in the most difficult first months of the war. — Today there is an opinion that our Western partners are not helping our army enough or are doing it too slowly. But still, to what extent did the help of partners contribute to the fact that Ukraine is holding on, that our state did not fall under the blows of the aggressor? - International aid was and remains critically important for our struggle. Yes, we always want faster delivery and higher volumes. But without the support of our Western partners, especially in the form of modern weapons, air defense equipment, intelligence and technological equipment, holding the front line would be much more difficult. Western weapons saved tens, and possibly hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian lives. Modern anti-aircraft systems, artillery, armored vehicles, long-range missiles and drones allowed us to effectively oppose much larger enemy forces. But partner support isn't just a weapon. Financial stability, humanitarian aid for war victims, as well as political support in the international arena are important. The world continues to show that Ukraine is not alone in its struggle for freedom. Every tranche of financial aid, every package of military support, every diplomatic statement is an investment not only in Ukrainian victory, but also in global security. The entire democratic world understands that the success of Ukraine is the success of the entire civilized world. And we are grateful to each partner for this support, continuing to work on strengthening and accelerating it. —Ukraine has been holding out for the third year since the start of a large-scale invasion. But we cannot discard the war period before it. What can be recorded in the achievements of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during this period? - During this time, radical changes took place in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which fundamentally transformed the army. It was not only overcoming Soviet stereotypes, but also building the foundations of a modern army. An innovative, flexible personnel training system was introduced, personnel selection and recruitment processes were improved, a transparent system of career growth was created, as well as opportunities for self-realization of servicemen. It is important to emphasize that these changes are based on the experience of the world's leading armies and NATO standards. This brought the Armed Forces of Ukraine closer to achieving a high level of interoperability with the Alliance forces, which is an important factor in joint operations and strategic partnership. Experience gained in the years before a large-scale invasion became decisive in February 2022. The Ukrainian army already had battle-hardened commanders, trained fighters and experience of effective defense, which made it possible to stop numerous attacks by superior enemy forces. In addition, these years helped to mobilize defense resources and organize an effective resistance to the army, which had a significant numerical advantage. The first months of the war became a vivid example of how hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians — military and civilian — were able to unite for a common goal. It was not only a military, but also a spiritual and national union. It was at these moments that Ukrainians realized their identity, national uniqueness and the right to be masters of their land. This unity has been the foundation of resilience and continues to inspire us to fight on. - Moving to a new position in your case is not only about scaling, but also about a significant transformation of the scope of authority and responsibilities. Are there any successful practices or developments that were useful and effective in your previous places of service and you plan to implement them in your new position? - My competence in the Ministry of Defense includes strategically important areas: military education and science, rights protection military personnel, recruiting, training, physical education, humanitarian support and social support. In fact, it is almost every aspect related to the support and provision of our military. The experience of organizing the defense of Kharkiv gave me an understanding of how the Defense Forces should work effectively in critical conditions. This experience allows me to better see the real needs of the military and to orient the ministry's work to solving specific tasks. One of the key principles that I have always emphasized and continue to implement at the state level is quality training. Not only the success of individual operations depends on professional training, but also the effectiveness of the army as a whole. A systematic approach to training, modern training methods and an individual approach to each serviceman are what we are actively developing. It is important that military personnel, veterans and new recruits feel the constant support of the state, both during and after their service. Among the specific examples of such support is the-Wounded Package-, which will begin to be issued to military personnel already next year. We are also working on the development of adaptive clothing for wounded servicemen and specialized clothing for military womenthat will provide comfort and functionality. Another important direction is the improvement of the food system and the introduction of additional financial incentives for the military, which will increase motivation and improve service conditions. These initiatives are only part of the systemic changes we plan to implement. They are designed not only to support our military today, but also to create the basis for their protection, development and a secure future. —During communication with many military personnel, we hear the following thesis: in the spring of 2022, we were constantly and a lot more creative and reported less. The initiative and the ability not to coordinate every step paid off then. But then the state began to demand that every step be coordinated. How to combine initiative and output with accountability and responsibility? - In the early days of a full-scale invasion, initiative, flexibility, and speed of decision-making were key factors in stopping the enemy advance. Then each commander, each unit acted as autonomously as possible, relying on their own experience and the situation on the ground. But warfare has changed—it now requires clear coordination, coordinated solutions, and integrated approaches. This does not mean that the initiative should be completely limited. On the contrary, the main challenge today is to find the right balance between freedom of action, accountability and accountability. It is important that commanders have the ability to quickly respond to challenges and make decisions, but at the same time be able to ensure transparency and accountability of their actions. To achieve this balance, we are actively implementing digitalization of processes and electronic document management. These tools not only reduce bureaucratic pressure, but also allow better control and optimization of processes. In particular, the -Reserve+- platform has already demonstrated its effectiveness. It greatly eased the administrative burden for both the military and civilians. Now updating data, extending deferrals for certain categories of citizens can be done directly in a mobile phone, without the need to visit territorial collection centers. The Army+ application is also constantly being improved. Now servicemen can submit reports for transfer, as well as order train tickets from the special reserve through a mobile application. In 2025, large-scale digitization of the process of military medical examination is planned. Both Reserve+ tools and general bases of the healthcare system will be applied here. This will not only reduce the burden on doctors, but also significantly simplify procedures for military personnel and citizens. The goal of these reforms is to create an effective, transparent and flexible management system, where initiative and responsibility do not conflict with each other, but work together for Ukraine's victory. —The recruiting process is gaining momentum in Ukraine. What interim results are already available today in this direction? What difficulties do we face? And can we announce the number of open recruiting centers? - We continue to improve the system of staffing the Armed Forces and the Defense Forces with motivated and trained personnel. Today, recruiting activities are carried out in two main directions. The first direction is the civilian component. As of now, 47 recruiting centers of the Ukrainian army have already been opened in Ukraine. This is just the beginning, and this network will continue to expand in the coming year. These centers are an innovative form of interaction between state structures with local self-government and the Ministry of Defense. Our goal is to create an extensive network of recruiting centers in different regions of the country, which will make it possible to maximize the opportunities for voluntary involvement of citizens in the ranks of the Armed Forces. An important feature of these centers is their location at TsNAPs, which ensures a comfortable and transparent process for citizens. They are not related to the territorial centers of recruitment and social support (TCC and SP). Qualified civilian specialists provide comprehensive information about military service, help choose a specialty and place of service, and also accompany the candidate at all stages of document preparation. For 10 months of operation, these centers have consulted more than 32 thousand citizens, and every fourth of them is already being selected for military service. An important indicator is that 20% of candidates are women. The main advantage of admission through the recruiting center is the opportunity to choose a specialty that corresponds to the candidate's abilities and desires, as well as to receive an extended package of benefits and social guarantees, which also apply to family members of a serviceman. The second direction is the recruiting centers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Currently, 5 specialized recruiting centers have been established in different types of Armed Forces: Ground Forces, Naval Forces, Airborne Assault Forces, Special Operations Forces and Territorial Defense Forces. Another center is being formed in the Unmanned Systems Forces. These structures are actively acquiring the necessary capabilities and are staffed with qualified specialists. In the near future, we will see their effective work in practice. In addition, the capabilities of commanders of combat units were expanded to independently select candidates for military service. Separate combat units already have their own recruiting units, which demonstrate effectiveness in attracting motivated military personnel. At the level of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff, appropriate structural units have been created to coordinate and direct recruiting activities throughout the country. These steps allow Ukraine to systematically approach the Armed Forces recruitment process, ensuring quality, transparency and flexibility at all levels of recruiting. Military education in Ukraine should be implemented according to NATO standards. To what extent is our military education already compatible with the Alliance? What areas are being most actively reformed? — Military education in Ukraine is currently undergoing a large-scale transformation in order to achieve maximum interoperability with NATO standards. But this process is not simply copying Western approaches. We adapt NATO standards to our own realities, combat experience and current needs of the Ukrainian military. These changes are not only about tactical or technical aspects - they are also about changing the culture of thinking, strategic planning and training new military leaders. One of the key tools of transformation is the NATO DEEP (Defence Education Enhancement Program), which has been operating in Ukraine for more than 10 years. Thanks to this program, Ukrainian military educational institutions gained access to advanced Western methods and educational technologies. Main achievements in this area: Special attention is paid to the training of military pilots. The process of obtaining private pilot certificates by cadets has been optimized, which allows to reduce the training time of F-16 pilots by almost three months. This provides an important operational advantage in the air. However, the war demonstrated that victory is ensured not only by modern weapons, but also by strong leadership. Therefore, one of the main goals of military education is to educate a new generation of military leaders who are able to make effective decisions in the most difficult conditions and lead their units to victory. This approach especially applies to officers and non-commissioned officers, who are a key link in the Armed Forces. The concept of transformation of military education of Ukraine is a strategic plan until 2032. It includes a systematic approach to training, implementation of best global practices and close cooperation with other government agencies and international partners. This reform is not just an update of standards, it is an investment in the future of the Ukrainian army, which will be able to effectively respond to modern challenges and ensure national security.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/02/pidgotovka-pilotiv-f-16-czyfrovizacziya-vlk-ta-pakunok-poranenogo-intervyu-sergiya-melnyka/	2025-01-01T21:10:32-08:00
How a combatant -Hetman- and his soldiers retook positions in Krynk and captured a scout from Moscow	-When I entered the military school, I was not yet 17. I dreamed that I would serve 25 years, keep bees&#8230; But here it is already 31 years of service, and I'm still in the army and somehow not into beekeeping,- -Hetman- laughs. In 1996, Oleksandr Getmachenko graduated from the Kharkiv Higher Command Tank School. Then there were the steps of the army career: from the commander of a tank platoon to the chief of staff of a tank battalion. Rotation in Iraq as a rifle platoon leader, serving in the 27th and 28th Separate Mechanized Brigades. 10 years of work in law enforcement agencies, returning to the army in 2016, three rotations in ATO/OOS. The next step would probably have been to fulfill the dream of a quiet life as a beekeeper, but a great war had begun. In March 2022, the officer had to form a territorial defense battalion from scratch: there was a huge queue at the military commissariat in Yuzhny, so the unit was formed in literally three days. The battalion performed tasks in Odesa region, Mykolaiv region, and since the end of 2022 has been holding defenses on the right bank of Kherson region. The commander of battalion 126 told ArmyInform about the rescue of civilians after the Russians blew up the Kakhovskaya HPP, the work on the left bank of the Dnieper, the specifics of the enemy's actions in the South, the destroyed settlements on the coast, as well as the decision to personally lead the operation to repel enemy positions and the -combat moped- of a separate brigade TrO of the 30th Marine Corps: -November 22 of this year marked two years as a battalion here in Kherson region. Constantly on the front edge of the defense. During the liberation of the Right Bank in the positions left by the enemy, we managed to take a large number of trophy weapons and ammunition, which came in handy when we deployed the defense line. Opposite us stood an -unbeaten- military unit of the occupiers, which had not previously participated in active hostilities. At that time, they also equipped positions and built fortifications on the left bank - brazenly, especially without hiding. But we quickly corrected it, forced them to calm down, hit the enemy with everything we had - both trophy weapons, our own, and weapons provided by foreign partners. In the intercepts, it was constantly heard: -They are working with this Biden crap again!- They worked with ATGMs, LNG, then connected 120 mortars. We did everything possible so that the Russians could not freely and calmly equip positions. I always told my guys this: everything should work against the enemy. It doesn't matter whether the weapon is old, whether it is modern, whether it is ours, whether it is Western. Even stones will agree if there is nothing else left. The enemy must not be at rest for even a second. I vividly remember the day when the Russians blew up the Kakhovskaya HPP. The water rose before our eyes, carrying with it mountains of garbage. Cars, animals, trees, pieces of buildings - everything. Heavy water blocked almost all roads. There was only one road left at that time, along which my guys evacuated civilians, helped them transport pets, things. At that time, I was very worried that the battalion would not be cut off by water from the only logistical artery at that time, because at the peak moment the height of the water rise reached 8 meters. Fortunately, everything worked out. From the intercepts, we learned that the Russians, who were then sitting on the Dnipro Islands, drowned. That is, the enemy did not even warn his own about the detonation of the HPP. In the summer of 2023, our brigade began an operation on the left bank of the Dnipro River. First, the assault units came in, and the units of my battalion were already supposed to start holding positions. During the third rotation, already in September, I myself went to the left bank. We were given the task of recapturing the lost positions and getting a foothold there, I decided that I should go with the guys. Well, I could not set a task for the staff, draw something on the map without visualizing it. We went there very nicely, quietly. Fortified, inflicted fire damage on the enemy. Two were killed, one was taken prisoner - a mother of such a scout from Moscow. In total, we managed to recover 750 meters of land during that exit. They were supposed to take 800 meters of the area, but 50 meters could not be taken. A total of ten came in. The same number came out - and this is the greatest happiness for me as a commander. Only one fighter was lightly wounded. The experience of going to the left bank later helped me a lot when planning combat missions and making decisions. I already know the specifics of the terrain, the specifics of movement, camouflage, and combat, where it is possible to gain a foothold and where it is not possible. To be honest, the operation on the left bank, on the islands, in Krynyky was difficult for me. I commanded a rifle platoon in Iraq for half a year, I did not have any losses, there were wounded in the anti-terrorist operation, but no one died. And here I was losing guys. And this is my biggest pain. In general, when my fighters go out, all the forces and means of the battalion work for them - drones, mortars, rocket launchers. And I still worry about people every time. I actually know all of them. Here, for example, a group of 8 people went to one of the extreme exits to the islands - very strong fighters, half - experienced scouts, my personal guard, as I call them. One of them is a young guy, a cool fighter, who recently returned from training in Germany. So, at that time, his fourth child was to be born. I did not force him to go, on the eve of leaving I asked if he was sure that he was ready to go on the task. Said he was sure. The boys stayed there for three weeks - due to difficult weather conditions, we could not get them out earlier. Of course, they had no contact with their relatives. Therefore, we relayed the news about the birth of a son to the soldier by radio. Well, the wife was also informed that the young father is alive and well. When the group left, I gave this warrior leave so that he could go to the family, see the youngest. Look, he could have already been released, this is already the fourth child, all minors, but he does not abandon his siblings, performs difficult tasks. I really respect and appreciate such people. Sometimes, you know, I'm surprised how unpredictably people show themselves in extreme situations. Those you don't expect suddenly do incredible things on the battlefield, and others you hope for -blow off-. Strange human psychology, you won't guess. We have a fighter nicknamed -Cunning-. All the time he was so quiet, an unremarkable, mediocre soldier. And he showed himself heroically in Krynyk. He pulled out the wounded, led the battle, encouraged, motivated. We took a close look at -Cunning-, made him a squad leader, then a platoon sergeant major. He copes with the tasks, it is nice that we were not mistaken. The war has changed dramatically in the two years that we have been in Kherson region. Now it is dominated by unmanned aerial systems - drones, FPV. They are actively used both by us and by the Russians. It's kind of, you know, a constant race. The enemy cannot be underestimated or considered weak. The Russians are improving, changing frequencies so that we can't hit them or suppress them with our EW. Recently, the enemy has begun to use dense mining, especially on the roads where we travel. Scatter -petals-, spikes. The rubber is punctured, as soon as the car stops to change a tire, the mavics with resets start working. In this way, the enemy is trying to destroy our logistics. Also, in the last few months, the enemy began to use aviation more, in particular, helicopters. They do not cause special damage, but morally, of course, they pressure. It is not pleasant when two -pinwheels- come out at you and launch 28 rockets each. FPV is not the most annoying. At the same time, the Russians do not care who to hit - civilians or military. A woman is walking, in ordinary clothes, in rubber boots, and an FPV is flying behind her. It's good that she managed to fall under a tree and the explosion hit the branches, it saved her. The enemy is constantly terrorizing the civilian population, enemy FPVs are chasing civilians, destroying their vehicles, houses. It pains me to watch how the Russians turn once rich coastal villages into an apocalyptic wasteland. When we just drove into Kherson region, I was in for a pleasant shock. Wealthy, beautiful villages, where people were mainly engaged in agriculture, earning a penny with their work. I have never seen fields like here in my life, although I myself come from sunny Bessarabia. Peach, pear, apple, cherry orchards, hectares of strawberries, raspberries, grapes, all under irrigation. How much human labor and money is invested here! It was all destroyed because of the Russians. Villages and towns along the Dnieper look like something out of a horror movie. Everything is burnt, broken. They simply methodically destroy street after street, house after house for two years. It is no longer possible to move during the day. Any car becomes a target. Man is the same. It got to the point that I had to take the moped from Yuzhny and drive it around the positions at night with a headlamp. There is no other way to move through a large area of ​​responsibility. It's normal - I ride, check the positions, familiarize myself with the situation, talk to the guys, ask what help is needed, what problems there are. If at the beginning of a full-scale war I had a lot of people and few weapons, now the situation is completely different. There are weapons, not enough people. It's no secret that very few motivated and, most importantly, completely healthy people who are able to fight come to the army, in particular, to my unit. You understand, to fight is to wear a bulletproof vest, a helmet, some kind of weapon, equipment. You have to have some health to lift it all. And when 55+ men come along, well, they can't physically be effective even if they want to. I speak personally with everyone who comes to the battalion. I ask what he did in civilian life, I try to find a position that would take into account a person's knowledge and skills. If you know about technology, like to turn nuts - here is the position of a repairman, please. A gamer - I have a boyfriend, a European champion in computer games - let's take it to drones. A fitness trainer means you can be a doctor. There is a great need for a personnel - now I will say rudely - with eggs. Who can not only sit in the trenches or in the basements, but also go out, move forward, inflict fire damage on the enemy. It's okay to be afraid. It's scary sometimes, to be honest. I want to live, I want to see my grandchildren. But there is a task to be done. It is necessary to save the country, so fear must be overcome. People are also needed because those guys who have experience and have been fighting for a long time are very tired, very tired. However, they do not give up their arms and weapons. I have an extremely good team - battalion management, company commanders, sergeants, sailors. Despite the fatigue, they work, they say: -Combat, we are with you.- They believe me, I believe them too. We cover each other's backs and continue the fight.

The German standard of accuracy: which long-range sniper rifles were included in the next package of...	According to statements from the German government, the total number of these special weapons will increase to 340 units with the November delivery, ArmyInform reports. Official portal manufacturer characterizes Haenel HLR 338 as a new precision bolt-action rifle that combines excellent long-range qualities with a modular concept and a significant weight reduction compared to the authoritative RS class from CG Haenel. Officially this rifle presented in 2023. The Bundeswehr has already managed to take it into service. This sniper rifle is designed for high-precision engagement of long-range targets. It is the most powerful rifle in the HLR series. This series also features HLR 308 Basic rifles in .308 Win and 6.5 Creedmoor. This rifle has an adjustable two-stage trigger with 10 to 20 N pull (equivalent to approximately 1.0-2 .0 kg). The trigger force can be adjusted. The 3-stage trigger guard prevents an accidental shot. The rifle weighs 7.5 kg. The length of the barrel of the weapon is 600 mm, and the diameter is 22 mm. The total length is 1275 mm, and when the butt is folded, it is 1020 mm. Picatinny 4694 and M-LOK rails are integrated in the forend. The rifle has 10 rounds in its magazine. This is another plus, because you don't have to reload the weapon all the time. The 22mm cooled match barrel is made by Haenel and has an M18x1.5 muzzle thread for a muzzle brake and/or silencer. German gunsmiths, creating this era, took care not only of equipping army snipers, but also of sports shooting enthusiasts. Two variants and several calibers are currently available from Haenel. Basic and Pro differ mostly in equipment. The HLR Basic has a controllable stock length with an adjustable cheek rest, which creates ideal ergonomic conditions for safe operation. The rifle is compatible with AR-15 class examples. HLR Basic is available in calibers: – .308 Win. (barrel length 600 mm with a twist of 12 inches); – 6.5 Creedmoor (barrel length 600 mm with a twist of 8 inches); – .338 Lapua Magnum (barrel length 690 mm with 10- twist).

If we talk about the cartridges used in this weapon, then we are talking about .338 Lapua Magnum (8.6×70 mm or 8.58×70 mm). It is a center-fire cartridge with a bottle-shaped case, without a protrusion at the edges, designed for military snipers for effective shooting at long distances. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq proved its effectiveness in practice and contributed to its significant spread. .338 Lapua has a dual purpose: combating enemy manpower and equipment. But the possibilities of combating equipment are limited by the lower kinetic energy of the bullet, especially compared to .50 BMG. The diameter of the flange is 14.93 mm, and the total length of the bullet is 93.5 mm. The bullet is able to penetrate better than standard body armor at a distance of up to 1000 m, and the maximum effective distance of fire reaches 1750 m. The initial speed of the bullet depends on the temperature and composition of the gunpowder and varies from 880 m/c to 915 m/c for a civilian bullet weighing 16.2 g, and the initial energy of the bullet is about 6525 J. In general, long-range sniper the HLR338 rifle combines incredible functionality and impressive accuracy. It has an ergonomic design and modular construction. That is, it can be easily and quickly adapted to a specific task. Exhibition presentation of long-range sniper rifle Haenel HLR 338.

Leopard and -Santa Barbara-: how the -Shaggy- NATO tank protects tankers	The crew of the Leopard 2A4 tank with the call sign -Lokhmaty- of the 33rd separate mechanized brigade told ArmyInform about all this. The commander of the tank -White-, the driver-mechanic -Tokmak-, the gunner -Paly- and the loader -Chechen-. Not so long ago, they all had civilian professions, but with the beginning of a large-scale invasion, they joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and mastered a formidable combat vehicle - the Leopard 2A4. This crew is fully interchangeable - each member can fill in for another in an emergency. At the basic level, this was taught during training in Spain, and then tankers independently improved their skills after returning to Ukraine. — Here, Ruslan has already fought as a gunner, and as a loader, and as a driver-mechanic—whatever he was. And he worked as a commander. Someone who, for example, was a charger from the beginning, can become both a mechvod and a gunner, if it is necessary in combat conditions, says -White-. It is not difficult to learn to fulfill the responsibilities of a brother, they assure. Of course, the one who fights as a gunner or mechvod longer will be more skillful, but everyone should know the basics and it is unnecessary to relearn for a long time. - There is nothing complicated, the main thing is to understand. The crew should be interchangeable, because if, God forbid, something happens, then the loader takes control, the gunner takes control. -Everybody rides our tanks, and they know everything about charging and guidance,- the tank commander assures. Tankers remember training in Spain with gratitude and, smiling, say that they would gladly go to study more. Two of them came from the infantry, two more, including the tank commander, transferred to the Leopard from the T-64. — Did you go on -Zhiguly-? And then they switched to a foreign car - a BMW or a Volkswagen? So it's the same as changing from a bogie to a normal car - here everything is made for people: handles, footboards, -sandpapers- on the armor so that the feet don't slip and the nose doesn't get stuffed, -White- points to the special coating on the tank's armor. However, the T-64, on which he served conscript service and fought in 2022 in the 4th separate tank brigade, is fondly remembered. It was on this Soviet tank that he took part in the Slobozhan offensive operation, when the Russians were hastily fleeing from the Kharkiv region. — They tarred the Russians so much that their fur coats turned upside down. Kupyansk, Tabaivka - we then chased them and beat them so much that if we had given the order, we would have reached Belgorod, but we crossed the border - and they are standing! That's how we didn't enter Russia then, - the tanker driver is happy and sad at the same time. Now fighting on the Leopard, he and his brothers note that the 64 does not stand a chance compared to him and is only suitable for shooting from closed positions as ersatz artillery. And in this, they add, the T-64 can be quite effective, because its gun provides a significant range and accuracy of shots. — If 40 years ago the Soviet Union and NATO had -bited down-, then Soviet tanks with -Leopard- would not have stood nearby. -Leopards- are very good, they are good now, but they were made back in the 1980s and they were good in the 1990s. And now drones have changed everything, -White- is convinced. However, even now -Leopard- has significant advantages over obsolete Soviet tanks already 40 years ago. It is not only noticeably larger and significantly heavier, but also significantly more powerful, faster, more maneuverable, more spacious. And also, despite more than 60 tons of weight and a 1,500-horsepower engine, it is quieter. Already 50-70 meters away in the forest, the hum of a tank engine can be heard as the work of a large, but quite calm agricultural mechanism. When the tank is 120-150 meters away, you need to listen carefully to hear it. And no wild roar at start-up or crazy growl while driving. It is almost impossible to audibly detect the Leopard on the battlefield among other numerous noises, shots and explosions. And with the simplest masking, it becomes inconspicuous visually. The tank shown to us is covered with camouflage -kikimora- and it becomes inconspicuous already at a distance of 30-40 meters. - We call him -Shaggy- because he has such a disguise. It has already broken off in some places, so the armor is visible. But when we attach everything back, it is almost not visible, says -Tokmak-, who is in the combined crew as a mechvod, but was also a gunner. For a war machine of this size, the Shaggy Leopard's camouflage looks really amazing. When the tank that was standing on the lawn drives deep into the forest, we see its dark silhouette only because we know its location. — This particular tank was standing on a mowed field of yellow color, covered in the same way as this net, — shows -Tokmak- on the -kikimora- on the -Leopard-. — And it's not even visible if you don't know it's there. And he stands and works on the enemy, he is especially not even disguised, he stands and just works. And one hundred percent that the people who saw the video of his work did not even understand that he was shooting like that. Before driving back into the forest, the Leopard rotates the turret with the barrel of the gun in the direction of the stern. This is a transport position, the tankers explain, this is how the tank moves on the march, how it is driven onto railway platforms or trawlers. Therefore, an uninformed civilian should not approach the tank from any side - the direction of the gun barrel does not at all indicate that the mechvod sees you. — There were incidents when cars were left a few meters behind the tank, believing that the direction of the gun barrel pointed to its front. While everything was quite the opposite - it was the stern, -Tokmak- explains. In general, everything is thought out - the tank even has rear-view mirrors, side and stop lights. Thanks to this and rubber pads on the tracks of the tracks, the Leopard can easily drive around the city, fitting into traffic flows and not damaging the asphalt. In the set of equipment provided with the tank, there is even a special flashing beacon, which is used to mark large-sized equipment when driving on public highways. — The rear-view mirrors were not made of glass, but of metal, polished -stainless steel- so that you can see plus or minus like a mirror. Not super clear, but enough to see what's behind, says -White.- He speaks favorably of how the Leopard is adapted for transportation on trawls or by rail in EU countries. The German armored car clearly stands on the platform, while the Soviet tanks have half of the tracks hanging on both sides during rail transport. - It will run 80 kilometers on the dirt road - just like that! And on the asphalt, the -hundred- will go for a sweet soul. If all the components work perfectly, then this is a great car. 40 years ago it was basically a tank - fire! - enthusiastically says about the -Leopard- of the -White- tank commander. Mehvod adds that the automatic transmission allows you to -not worry- about gear changes. -Sat down, -started- and drove away- - the tank does not need any warm-up and long acceleration time to gain speed. Also, the -Leopard- is extremely maneuverable, and the steering wheel of the armored vehicle can be controlled with one hand. Mobility gives the tank important, often decisive, advantages on the battlefield when time is counted in fractions of a second. - We are always moving - through lowlands, forest strips. There were cases when the enemy was approached at close range - at a distance of several hundred meters. We stick the barrel into the enemy's dugout and shoot, - laughs the tank commander. The tank easily goes off-road - mud, mud, dry sand. The only problem for him can be wet sand, on which during a turn the Leopard can -take off his shoes-, losing the track - it slips off the tracks. However, returning the -goose- to its place is not a problem - it does not require significant effort and time. Tankers call the main threat to a tank in battle barrage ammunition such as -Lancet- and FPV-kamikaze. ATGMs and mines are also a significant threat, but much less so than drones. — If it weren't for these -efpivishkas-, we would have already broken the -star- from the Kremlin with the -Leopard-. Mines, dumps, grenade launchers - everything that can be survived, escaped or maneuvered. And when the FPV is -hugging- at 180 kilometers per hour - how can you escape from it? says the commander of the -White- tank. -Tokmak- emphasizes that one cannot underestimate the enemy and consider him stupid and weak. Everything is dangerous on the battlefield, but Lancet calls it the most dangerous. - It's even cooler than FPV - it's like ten FPV flying into you. As soon as the weather is good, the sun will shine - right in the Supercam sky, and the Lancet can fly. The enemy cannot be underestimated, because he knows a lot and learns well, there are many of them, they have a lot of resources, he notes. Tankers recall the devastating effects of Lancets and FPV hits on armored vehicles and show the places where the cumulative jet was hit - the -skin- of this -Leopard- already has some scars. Instead, the mines, they say, do not pose a danger to the lives of the crew. - It holds mines like peanuts. The crew just climbs out like a plague, the light flashes. Contused, but alive and whole. We have those here who have been blown up several times. It feels like the head was stuck in the bell and the bell was hit with a sledgehammer. My ears are ringing, but 80% of our staff here are already a bit contused, so this is a normal thing, says -White-. Tankers are critical of -sheds-, -barbecues-, protective nets and gratings. It is said that any extra structures greatly impair the tank's maneuverability. They are difficult to install so that they do not interfere with the rotation of the turret, and they also prevent the crew from quickly leaving the armored vehicle in case of need. — She only gets in the way. Well, you can plaster, weld this grill. But if you boil otaku halabuda on top, then this is also a disadvantage in terms of masking - especially since you cannot hide it. We covered the engine compartment, put it in the front, but it all doesn't hold well - it's enough to drive into the landing and it will be demolished. This is such a tank that the grill just gets in the way, explains the commander of the -Shaggy-. On the other hand, tankers respond favorably to the dynamic protection blocks installed on the armor, recognizing their feasibility. Even a thick rubber collar on one of the tank's vulnerable spots is useful because it dampens the cumulative jet. -Leopards-, they say, came from Germany -naked-, so they had to install a dynamic defense already in Ukraine. Unlike protective grills, these additional -accessories- in no way affect the advantages of the tank in battle, such as speed and maneuverability, do not expose it and do not endanger the lives of the crew in the event of an emergency exit of the combat vehicle. Recognizing the importance of EW devices, which are also installed on tanks, tankers still rely more on the tank's mobility, camouflage and smoke, shooting which -Leopard- can so -fog- the battlefield that it itself makes its way almost by touch. Fighters consider the so-called -Santa Barbara- to be one of the biggest advantages of the -Leopard- over old Soviet tanks - a special compartment of the tower, which houses an ammunition kit of 15 shells, which are stored in special tube drawers. The name of this part of the tank tower comes from the legend of Saint Barbara, a great Christian martyr who is considered the patron saint of gunners, sappers, military engineers and rocket launchers. It is she who, according to established tradition, provides protection against death due to explosions, thunder and lightning. In Spanish, French and Italian, the word -Santa Barbara- means an artillery cellar or a place for storing gunpowder and ammunition on a warship or in a fortress. Previously, statues of the saint were placed near them as a talisman against the explosion. In the -Leopard-, the -Santa Barbara- is arranged in such a way that it is completely separated from the main part of the turret, and in the event of an ammunition explosion, the blast wave and debris are directed and scattered outside, not inside the tank. This is what allows you to save the lives of tankers. — Even in the event of an ammunition explosion, the crew will definitely survive and the tank itself will survive and remain on the move. You have definitely seen on the video how Soviet tanks explode from the inside, how the tower is torn off. This can never happen on the Leopard if the ammunition is placed only in the Santa Barbara, says the tank commander. The last clarification is important, because the tank also has a magazine rack, on which you can store additional shells, increasing the tank's ammunition to 42 rounds. However, now tankers do not do this, because then the danger of detonation due to hitting enemy ammunition is too high. — It is bad that there are few bullets, only 15 pieces. But we don't put shells in the BC rack, because it's too dangerous. same Now they cannot be used under any circumstances, except to store stew or something else, because additional space appears inside the tank, - explains -White-. In addition to -Santa Barbara-, Leopard has a few more -chips- that help save the lives of tankers. One of them is the ability to continue driving in a special emergency mode even if the engine compartment is hit by enemy ammunition. - To survive, it has many functions. For example, when the FPV engine is flying, the crew switches it to emergency mode and can continue to drive for some time. Another 5 or even 7 kilometers can be driven until everything leaks out of the engine and it burns out completely, says -White-. In addition, excess pressure is created in the closed body of the tank, which allows you to protect the crew from harmful penetration from the outside - a chemical, biological or even nuclear threat. It also allows the -Leopard- to -swim- well - more precisely, overcome water obstacles by wading. Tankers note that the main thing is that the bottom is hard enough and the tank does not get sucked into the mud. — You check all the nodes completely so that everything works. One click lever and everything is completely hermetically sealed. You turn on the drainage pumps, bilge pumps. You turn on the ford crossing system, the driver-mechanic has a pressure gauge that shows whether the pressure is maintained, whether the system is working - and forward, says the tank commander. Unlike Soviet tanks, which need to be caulked for a long time before diving, everything is done automatically in the Leopard. The armored -predator- can easily overcome a water obstacle up to three meters deep. Enemy dugouts and fortifications, infantry and armored vehicles - Leopard crews had to work on a wide variety of targets. Tankers tell about the destruction of a column of enemy armored vehicles from 8 units and a skirmish with a Russian tank, which ended in a shameful defeat for the enemy. — With one -Leopard- the guys from our company -dismantled- this entire moving column. And it is this -Leopard- - you can find a video on the Internet - clearly put a -crow- in the stern of a Russian tank, which we encountered in one of the villages in Donetsk region, and it ran away from us. -He was turned around after being hit,- says -Tokmak-. Tankers call an armor-piercing projectile a -scrap-. Thanks to the laser rangefinder and clear aiming, this accurate shot was made at a distance of 3 km 200 m. However, then the rangefinder failed, and the enemy tank began to maneuver and leave the affected area. — Of course, we released the entire BC on it. It fell next to him, fell in front of him, fell behind him, but without accurately measuring the distance it became very difficult to hit. But then we asked him kindly, says the tanker. -Leopard-, he emphasizes, is a great fighting machine, but, like any other equipment, only if all nodes, units and devices work flawlessly. In case of breakdowns, the quality of the tank's combat performance drops. However, in any case, it remains much better than the old Soviet tanks on which the Russians are fighting.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/02/leopard-i-santa-barbara-yak-lohmatyj-tank-nato-berezhe-tankistiv/	2025-01-01T20:15:40-08:00
A new masterpiece of Russian disinformation: the fake that Ukraine is -destroying- its own GTS	Let's imagine for a minute that Ukraine decided to destroy its own GTS. It is like a farmer burning his crops to salt his neighbor. After all, the GTS is not just pipes, but also a strategic asset that brings income from gas transit. The destruction of this infrastructure would cause harm, first of all, to Ukraine itself. The purpose of spreading such fakes is to discredit Ukraine in the eyes of European partners, to sow doubts about its reliability as a transit point, and to justify Russia's own actions. After all, if you believe this nonsense, it turns out that Ukraine is depriving itself of income and undermining Europe's energy security. The Ukrainian side has repeatedly denied similar statements, emphasizing its commitment to obligations to European consumers and its desire for energy cooperation. However, it seems that Russian propaganda does not tire of inventing new ways of discrediting. The fake about Ukraine's -destruction- of its own GTS is another example of how the Russian disinformation machine tries to manipulate facts and mislead the international community. However, as practice shows, the truth always comes to the surface, and such attempts only undermine the credibility of the very sources of disinformation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/02/novyj-shedevr-rosijskoyi-dezinformacziyi-fejk-pro-te-shho-ukrayina-znyshhuye-vlasnu-gts/	2025-01-01T20:04:16-08:00

President: Stopping transit of Russian gas is one of Moscow's biggest defeats	This is stated in the statement of the head of state in the telegram channel. -When Putin was given power in Russia more than 25 years ago, the annual gas pumping through the territory of Ukraine to Europe amounted to 130+ billion cubic meters. Today, the transit of Russian gas is 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats,- the President said. The transformation of energy carriers into weapons and cynical energy blackmail of partners is what deprived Russia of the most attractive and geographically accessible market for Russia, added Volodymyr Zelenskyy. -Considering the circumstances, the absolute majority of European countries have successfully adapted to such changes. Today, our joint task is to support Moldova in the period of energy transformation. We also have to withstand the hysteria of some European politicians who prefer mafia schemes with Moscow instead of a transparent energy policy,- the head of state said. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also expressed hope for an increase in the supply of American gas to Europe, which was already mentioned by US President Donald Trump. Cooperation and maximum offers from partners on the market will make it possible to make prices more comfortable. -The more gas there is on the market from Europe's true partners, the sooner the last negative consequences of European energy dependence on Russia will be overcome,- concluded the President.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/prezydent-zupynka-tranzytu-rosijskogo-gazu-odna-z-najbilshyh-porazok-moskvy/	2025-01-01T08:14:55-08:00
Olga Reshetylova spoke about the primary tasks of the military ombudsman	The interview was broadcast by the telethon -The only news-. Olga Reshetylova explained that she is currently performing a coordinating role, as Ukraine has not yet adopted the legislation on the military ombudsman. -Therefore, the first task is the adoption of the draft law on the military ombudsman. We worked on it before, I was part of the working group, and it is almost finalized. I think that in the coming days the final version will be presented to the President and I hope that we will be able to submit it to the parliament,- she said. The second task is to solve the most pressing issues. -Immediately after the appointment, I received a huge number of complaints that need to be responded to and we are already doing it. There are complaints of an individual nature and there are more general problems that require a systemic solution,- said Olga Reshetylova. She gave an example of a system for collecting DNA analysis during military service. There are relevant regulations, but this work is not systematically established. -I want to emphasize that both now and after the adoption of the law, we are talking exclusively about active servicemen. And about everything related to passing the service. And this is important, because when entering the service, military personnel voluntarily give up some of their rights and freedoms, and in return do not receive any protection. This applies to issues of social, legal protection, etc.,- emphasized Olga Reshetylova. As reported by ArmyInform, on December 30, 2024, Volodymyr Zelensky appointed Olga Reshetilova for the post of military ombudsman.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/olga-reshetylova-rozpovila-pro-pershochergovi-zavdannya-na-posadi-vijskovogo-ombudsmena/	2025-01-01T07:57:26-08:00

-Bath day- and -army games-: a Russian who tortured people during the occupation of Kharkiv Region w...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this on January 1. The accused is a citizen of the Russian Federation from the Belgorod region. In recent years, he lived in the village of Strelecha in Kharkiv Oblast. Already during the full-scale invasion, the man performed the duties of the head of the self-proclaimed people's police body in the temporarily occupied territory of the Lipetsk OTG of the Kharkiv region in the position of precinct chief. -He had information about local residents in the community, so he knew with whom it was necessary to -conduct prevention- for a pro-Ukrainian position. the Russian military forcefully detained people and took them to the prisons that were set up in the building of the MPP -Hoptivka- and in the basement of a high-rise building in the village of Shooting in the Kharkiv district,- the message says. The occupiers, together with the accused, inflicted chaotic blows on people with rubber batons, stun guns, and hit them on the head with a wooden hammer. They also poured water on the faces of the victims through a towel, thus blocking the access of air. The accused cynically called this execution procedure -bath day-. In addition, the person involved forced the victims to participate in -army games-, which involved dressing up as border guards or police officers and performing certain tasks. Detainees were fed rations after the military of the Russian Federation. It was established that one of the victims of Russian terrorists was a civilian man suffering from cancer, who has the most severe stage of cancer. -The figure, disregarding everything, beat him almost to half-death, trying to -beat out- information about the Armed Forces. Such hatred towards the victim was caused by the fact that his son is a Ukrainian serviceman,- the law enforcement officers said. The prosecutors of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office have approved and sent to the court an indictment against a 41-year-old man for the fact of brutal treatment of the civilian population, committed by a group of persons based on a previous conspiracy (Part 2 of Article 28, Part 1 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (as amended to 24.10.2024)).

On New Year's Eve, the occupiers left the residents of Mariupol's construction center without heat	About this reports Center of National Resistance. The situation in temporarily occupied Mariupol is particularly critical. The reason for the situation is the criminal activity of local collaborators.

After all, the majority of housing and communal services workers in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine were sent to their -homes-, and those who managed to avoid -service- in the enemy's army are not paid their salaries for months. We remind you that due to the increase in tax pressure, the government the Russian Federation is trying to find funds for the continuation of the Russian-Ukrainian war, namely, to finance the defense expenditures included in the federal budget for 2025–2027 years.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/u-novorichnu-nich-okupanty-zalyshyly-bez-tepla-meshkancziv-to-mariupolya/	2025-01-01T02:48:41-08:00
A soldier who came on vacation was robbed: two men were detained in Kharkiv	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this on January 1. According to the investigation, on December 27 at around 5:50 p.m., two men were near an underpass in Kharkiv, where they saw a 45-year-old military man who had come on vacation. -Having caught up with him, one of the criminals punched the victim in the face, and when he fell down, he continued to kick him with his accomplice. Having overcome resistance in this way and inflicting physical injuries on the man, the robbers took his property,- the message reads.

Worthy of attention is the fact that the personal income tax for participants in the Russian-Ukrainian war will remain at the level of 13-15%.

The President of Ukraine commented on the Russian shelling on New Year's Eve	This is in the message of the head of state in the Telegram channel. -even on New Year's Eve, Russia was only concerned about how to hurt Ukraine. One hundred and eleven strike drones against our cities,- the President said. According to him, most of them did not achieve their goals thanks to Ukrainian air defense equipment, mobile fire groups and EW systems. -But, unfortunately, at this time it is known about one dead person. My condolences to family and friends. There are also casualties and destruction. All services are engaged,- he informed.

Received Russian documents regarding the plane crash in Baku	This is reported by Center of National Resistance. It shows the degradation of the Russian regime, total mendacity, and rapid loss of foreign policy influence. It is also quite likely that the Russian dictator will not punish his faithful vassal Kadyrov or anyone from the Chechen administration in general, and will appoint someone completely insignificant as the culprit. The so-called head of the Chechen Kadyrov has an extensive network of representatives throughout the Russian Federation. The document, which will be discussed further, was developed and sent on behalf of the representative of the head of the Chechen Republic in the Ural Federal District, Turpal Akhmedovich Ilyasov. The source that handed over Ilyasov's letter to the CNS received it from the mail of Ilyasov's son, Adam, who also works at this representative office, is the head of the secretariat and is responsible for interaction with the media. The document itself is a kind of -darkroom- with instructions on what should or should not be commented. As it follows from the text, it reflects the position of Kadyrov and the head of his administration, Galas Taymaskhanov. In particular, in the letter you can see how in Russia language becomes a tool for building a parallel reality. For example, it is suggested to ignore any mention of a plane being shot down. Instead, it is recommended to call it a tragic incident - because that is what Russian dictator Putin called it in his address. However, the letter further contains interesting details of the behind-the-scenes intrigues of the Russian ruling elite. For example, it is claimed that the Russian Federation will never admit its guilt and this is a clear position of Putin. So this is just a tragic accident that happened in the -airspace of Russia-. The letter also shows that Putin depends on the loyalty of his Chechen vassals and oprichniks. Putin's official apology, which he expressed to President Aliyev, was of a general nature and demonstrates how dependent the Russian Federation is on maintaining relations both with Azerbaijan and its partners in the region. In fact, Putin is in a weak position to ignore this incident. If earlier, as in the case of the downed Malaysian flight MH-17, Russia could afford to ignore and silence the facts for years, to overload the information space with mutually exclusive false versions, then in the case of the Baku-Grozny flight, no matter how much Putin wanted to, he had to apologize. Of course, this was a -half- apology - because Russia still does not want to admit its guilt. And that's why they play -newbie- with -tragic incidents-. However, such an apology does not suit the Azerbaijani side. The latter requires finding the culprits and bringing them to justice. Here it is worth mentioning that on December 24, Khamzat, the secretary of the Chechen Security Council and Kadyrov's nephew, announced on Instagram that all drones in the sky over Chechnya had been destroyed. He became practically the only official who confirmed that Chechnya was attacked by drones. -The information that the drones hit some object is not true, everything has been shot down!- - he wrote in a comment to the video of the destruction of one of the drones. The next day, when it became known about the downing of the Azerbaijani plane, Kadyrov awarded his nephew the medal -For services to the Chechen Republic.- Obviously, this gave rise to versions about the involvement of Kadyrov's relatives in instructing controllers to divert the plane so that it would crash into the sea, thereby hiding all evidence of the crime. It is also worth mentioning here the fact that Chechnya and the Kadyrovs are a kind of Putin's henchmen. Moscow does not touch the Caucasus, Chechnya has one of the lowest rates of involvement in the Russian occupation army, as well as the level of casualties. Other, more distant regions (such as Bashkiria or Tatarstan) bear disproportionately greater human losses. So, in this situation, when Putin is tied to the loyalty of the Caucasus, but has to find those responsible for the downing of the plane, he will most likely choose the traditional option of appointing a scapegoat. And from the letter it becomes clear that it will be the dispatchers, not the Chechen administration. Therefore, Kadyrov's nephew can receive a dozen more orders named after Kadyrov and not worry about the consequences. The temnik sent by Turpalov clearly shows the rapid degradation of the Russian Federation. After all, a regime built on lies and crimes cannot give the world anything but the suffering of innocent people. We remind you, at the end of December, seven teenagers blew themselves up with an explosive device in Lysychansk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/otrymano-rosijski-temnyky-shhodo-katastrofy-litaka-u-baku/	2025-01-01T01:43:16-08:00

Energy security of the world: TOP-25 forecasts for 2025	-In 2024, the global energy map of the world has undergone significant changes. At the same time, before identifying the main factors of influence, it is worth first of all to outline the very concept of energy security, which is a sufficient amount of energy resources that are transported through a stable infrastructure to transparent markets, to which a paying consumer has equal access. The global portfolio of energy resources, in the part of oil, can be considered practically balanced, because the global level of consumption of 102.8 million barrels per day is covered by the production of 102.6 million barrels. Such an indicator indicates the balance of the market, despite military tensions in the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East. In this context, it is appropriate to mention that in the third quarter of the current year, Iran repeatedly resorted to public statements of various nature, expecting, in particular, changes in the global oil market. In fact, the supply and demand situation has been balanced by the increase in oil production in the United States and the decrease in demand from Chinese consumers. Thus, for the second year in a row, the American oil industry demonstrated a record increase in black gold production by 2% to 13.2 million barrels per day. At the same time, China reduced its oil consumption by 10%, which made it possible to reduce the growth rate of global demand to 1%, compared to the previous year. In addition, the Chinese market reduced its consumption of Russian oil by 7%, replacing it with black gold from Saudi Arabia. This trend occurred due to the increase in the cost of delivery of Russian raw materials against the background of sanctions, which are not enough to bleed the aggressor's economy, which mostly sells its black gold on the markets of China and India. Unfortunately, during 2024, the aggressor managed to export about 4.8 million barrels of oil worth $320 million. Taking into account the current level of activity on the oil market, in 2025 we should expect a further increase in the production of black gold to 104.5 million barrels per day. Taking into account such a forecast, it is possible that there will be a surplus of oil supply in the global dimension next year. At the same time, it is worth paying attention to the indicators of the enemy's oil production industry and not to allow violations of international law, in particular, UN Resolution No. 2375 of September 11, 2017, which imposes a ban on the supply of oil and petroleum products to North Korea. Global demand for natural gas grew by 2.4% during 2024 and returned to pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, the driving force behind growth was the Asia-Pacific region and liquefied natural gas, the market share of which increased to 40%. Notably, Qatar, the United States, and Australia remain the leaders in the supply of liquefied natural gas, while the EU and Asia remain key sales markets. At the same time, there is a rather dangerous tendency for the aggressor to increase gas production, by more than 9%, compared to the indicators of the previous year. At the same time, in the next year, the aggressor may increase the production of liquefied natural gas to 40 million tons, which once again indicates the urgent need to introduce new sanctions. This trend is connected with Russia's attempt to increase natural gas supplies to China. At the same time, total Russian gas exports to the EU by all routes rose to 32 billion cubic meters, down from 28.3 billion cubic meters in 2023, falling to the lowest level since the 1970s. Despite this growth, the volume of Russian gas supplies to Europe remains significantly lower than in previous years. For comparison, in 2018-2019, the annual flow of gas to Europe reached 175 to 180 billion cubic meters. The global coal market in 2024 was characterized by stable supply and demand, but consumption remained at the level of the previous year, amounting to approximately 8.7 billion tons, which contributed to a record increase in street carbon dioxide emissions to the level of 41.6 billion metric tones. At the same time, the Russian coal industry faced serious financial difficulties in 2024, which was reflected in its main indicators. First of all, the aggressor reduced the volume of coal production by 4.4% in annual terms, which determined the decrease in export supplies and the loss of sales markets. For example, one of the largest importers of Russian coal in Taiwan, Taiwan Cement Corporation (TCC), completely stopped cooperation with the aggressor. Overall, the income of the Russian coal industry fell by 97%, and the vast majority of mining companies suffered losses. Concluding the resources section, it is worth paying attention to the mining of uranium and the production of nuclear fuel from the overview of the development of low-carbon energy sources. In the current year, there was a 3% increase in the volume of uranium mining to the level of 50,000. tons Despite the fact that Kazakhstan is the largest producer of uranium, the aggressor continues to control more than 40% of the world's uranium enrichment. In the next year, Russia's share in this segment may decrease due to the development of its own capacities in the USA and the EU, as well as the attraction of investments in fields in Canada and Namibia. In the past year, many significant infrastructure projects in the energy sector were implemented, which affected global energy and contributed to the development of sustainable energy systems in the world, in particular: 1. Projects in the field of low-carbon, renewable and hydrogen energy. 2. Network integration and infrastructure of liquefied natural gas 3. Energy storage and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions As we can see, in 2024, the implementation of large-scale energy projects around the world demonstrated the growing interest in sustainable, integrated and decarbonized energy. These initiatives have significantly strengthened the position of renewable energy sources, liquefied natural gas, hydrogen and innovative technologies in the global energy system. Speaking of quotations on the global oil market, during 2024 there was a tendency for the price to decrease, for example, at the beginning of January one barrel of Brent was sold for $76.3, and at the end of December it was 3% less. Taking into account the forecast for the growth of oil production in 2025, it is possible to assume a further decrease in quotations to the level of 65 dollars per barrel. The opposite is the case with natural gas prices. In 2024, natural gas prices in Asia and North America have risen by nearly 50% and look set to continue rising in the first quarter of next year due to active storage depletion. At the same time, the level of liquefied gas price growth will be determined by seasonal demand and storage capacity. In 2024, coal prices remained relatively stable. For example, in Australia, prices remained at the level of about $203 per ton. The price situation on the global market of primary energy carriers led to the fact that during the current year the electricity market in the European Union underwent the following changes. First, after significant price volatility in the previous two years, electricity prices have declined in 2024 due to stable gas supplies, full gas storage facilities and favorable weather conditions. Thus, in Germany, France, Italy and Spain, average electricity prices were 30-40% lower than in 2023. This trend, in particular, was influenced by the slowdown in the economic growth of the EU, for example, the demand for electricity decreased by 5%. Second, the share of renewable energy sources (wind, solar, hydro and bioenergy) has exceeded 50% in many EU countries, including Germany, Spain and Denmark. This was also facilitated by a new investment-attractive pricing model for energy produced from alternative sources. This approach has created the conditions under which the European Union has completed large-scale investment projects in solar energy, providing more than 50% of electricity generation from RES in many member states. Actually, such changes affected the fact that the average price of electricity in the EU for household consumers during the current year was about 12.67 hryvnias/kWh, which is equivalent to approximately 0.29 euros/kWh at the exchange rate of 43.85 hryvnias for 1 euro . Despite the development of network infrastructure and the decentralization of power systems, blackouts have occurred in various parts of the world this year. The most common cause is natural disasters, in particular In the United States, powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico region caused damage to energy infrastructure, especially in the states of Louisiana and Texas. At the same time, in Southeast Asia, typhoons caused power outages in the Philippines and Vietnam. The stability of energy supply this year has been affected by extreme heat, for example in the EU and Asia, abnormal heat waves led to an increase in electricity consumption for air conditioning, which caused local blackouts in Italy, France and India. Secondly, the short-term disconnection of consumers from electricity was caused by cyber-attacks, for example in the USA there were outages due to external influences on the IT infrastructure of electricity grid operators. Third, technical failure and wear and tear of networks. For example, the Republic of South Africa continued to suffer from large-scale blackouts due to the failure of the state-owned energy company Eskom to ensure stable grid operation. Periodic -load-shedding- (planned outages) have become part of everyday life. A similar situation took place in Pakistan, in early 2024, a large-scale failure in the national power grid left more than 200 million people without electricity. The stability of energy networks was also affected by the sufficiency of primary energy carriers, for example, in Cuba there was an energy crisis due to a lack of fuel and wear and tear of thermal power plant nodes. Fourth, military conflicts. One such example, the escalation of conflicts in the Middle East region has affected the power systems of Syria, Lebanon and, in part, Israel, causing power outages. Fifth, high demand and unpreparedness for a full energy transition from fossil to renewable energy sources. In the first quarter of 2024, cold weather and delays in renewable energy sources (such as insufficient wind for wind farms) caused short-term blackouts in selected regions such as Germany and Poland. In the past year, Russia has continued to commit war crimes, having carried out 13 massive attacks on energy infrastructure facilities in Ukraine. According to various calculations, the enemy used more than 1,200 rockets to carry out these crimes alone, causing damages of $56.2 billion. One of the largest attacks occurred on August 26, 2024, when the aggressor used 236 drones and missiles. In general, the Kremlin's war crimes against the energy infrastructure of Ukraine were aimed at creating a humanitarian crisis, undermining the economy and reducing the defense capability of our state. Despite these actions, thanks to international support, the prompt restoration of damaged facilities and the resilience of fellow citizens, Ukraine's energy system continues to function even in the face of large-scale challenges. Russian war crimes must be condemned both at the international (International Criminal Court, UN International Court of Justice, European Court of Human Rights) and national levels. In the next year, the sanctions pressure on the aggressor should be significantly increased for several reasons. First of all, the aggressor is the biggest threat to global energy security, as in particular it actively uses sophisticated schemes of transshipment of oil at sea, -shadow flotillas- and hides the final destination of cargoes to avoid sanctions. However, unfortunately, not all countries or companies comply with the sanctions due to difficulties in verifying supply chains and a lack of strict controls. Along with this, China, India, Turkey and other countries of the Global South have not joined the sanctions regime and are taking advantage of reduced prices for Russian resources, providing the aggressor with financial opportunities for a war against the democratic world. It is clear that there is insufficient pressure associated with Russia's adaptation to sanctions and the lack of a unified global approach to countering its energy expansion. Increased control and the establishment of secondary measures of influence on companies and countries that help the aggressor to circumvent restrictions can increase the effectiveness of sanctions. In addition, in the next year, the role of the aggressor in the energy security of the world should be reduced, in particular by imposing sanctions and introducing new political restrictions on the nuclear fuel market. Energy security in 2025 will remain a multidimensional challenge and will depend on geopolitical stability, adaptation to climate change and the pace of innovation. Countries investing in the diversification of energy sources, decarbonization and strengthening of infrastructure will have an advantage in ensuring the stability of energy supply. 1. Reducing dependence on fossil fuels, increasing the role of nuclear energy. 2. Intensification of competition for resources 3. Diversification of energy supply and infrastructure development. 4. Digitization of the energy industry. 5. Environmental policy.

- Occupant cutter - near Kurakhov: ArmyInform report from the position of one unit of drones	Correspondents of ArmiyaInform managed to get to the positions of one of the units of FPV drones of the 148th separate artillery brigade of the Zhytomyr DSHV of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and record one day of heavy combat work of our drones. Get to the positions in the Kurakhovo district &#8211; it is always risky and dangerous. Night, the moon in the sky is breaking through the clouds, our car is moving towards the front line, the rumble of explosions is getting louder. We leave the car in the -hideout- and get into the unit's pickup, which is equipped with a REBU device. It has begun to dawn a little, the traditional -sirak- is the safest time to leave. We drive on broken roads. The paratrooper-driver begins to turn on the red switches one by one. This is REB, because where we are going, there is, unfortunately, a lot of enemy deadly debris flying. A settlement can be seen on the horizon. We drive closer, the picture is depressing: everywhere destroyed houses, torn down fences, cut with splinters of wood, in a word all around -complete desolation-. Let's go further. We stop near the plantation, the car leaves us while it is still dark, and we quickly go to the dugout, which is well camouflaged from the outside. A few steps underground, then the door, and the positions of our drones are hidden there. From here, it is only a few kilometers to reach the Katsap troops. In the dugout, everything is arranged so that our guys have work as comfortably as possible. Excavated room 3 by 4 m: operator area (pilot and gunner), place of miner who charges drones with ammunition and place for coffee break. There is a narrow passage between the self-made work table and the couch, there is also a small bench, and the ammunition boxes are used as chests. In general, everything here is very practical and ascetic. There are no extra things, only things that will definitely come in handy for the boys. -The days when you could drive a car along the -front- are long gone. Now the drones are hunting a single rashist and he cannot evade, &#8211; says Yuriy, the commander of the FPV-drone unit with the call sign -Sparta-. &#8211; Look here (Yuri shows a video on a smartphone - author): this is video evidence from the front, where our crew attacks the invaders in the middle of the field, under trees, in houses, now you can get the enemy almost everywhere. The occupiers will not hide anywhere from us. On the right in the dugout we see already charged drones standing ready. The boys prepare them in advance. The military uses FPV drones as a kamikaze drone with various combat parts and to drop ammunition on the enemy with the subsequent return of the drone. For each target there is a drop: there are shrapnel (grenades or other explosive surprises) for enemy manpower , -cumulatives-, incendiary ammunition and -bombs- for enemy equipment and defensive fortifications. Weather conditions significantly affect the operation of drones: cold, rain or strong wind make flights difficult. The duty of the UAV operator is to be ready for such tests. Regarding the tactics of the Russian Federation in the Kurakhiv direction. The enemy attacks both in small infantry groups, and in some places uses BMP, armored personnel carriers, motorcycles, buggies. The guys say: armored vehicles are mostly used at a considerable distance from the battle line, for logistics or rotations. The enemy is trying to quickly drop the landing party and escape from the affected area. But our drones get the Rashists there too. Each meter of the enemy's advance is very expensive. Usually ordinary Russian infantrymen go on assaults. This is the tactic of -bloody collective suicides.- Using the topography of the area, the invaders advance in small groups of 5-8 people. Armed only with assault rifles, another group of Rashists is already 50-60 meters behind them. They carry BC, some have machine guns, they are accompanied by drones. So, the first group of -suicides- lands on Ukrainian soil almost immediately. Our FPV drones instantly destroy the bodies of Muscovites. Then other rashists climb over their corpses. The picture is almost the same, the occupiers are also destroyed. Some try to escape from our drones, but they don't succeed for long. Small enemy assault groups especially try to infiltrate in the morning &#8211; -gray- when the weather is foggy. That's when our reconnaissance drones can't always work effectively. -Sometimes one gets the impression that the occupiers are high. They do not pay attention to our resets, move chaotically, but continue to break through to our positions. There are days when the enemy moves without stopping and suffers simply incredible losses. Once we destroyed up to 80 rashists in one full day of combat work. Perhaps there were more of them, of course, no one counted them. The human resource of the Russian Federation is unlimited. People are just meat for the Kremlin and there is no such price that the Russian people would not pay for the destruction of Ukraine. Rashists will continue to climb, and we have to stop them,- &#8211; says the commander of the unit Yuriy. Yuriy from Volyn, former commander of the BM-21 -Grad-. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the Russian Federation mobilized the 95th separate assault-assault Polish brigade. He was the commander of an airborne assault unit, he was seriously wounded in battle. It happened in the Izyum direction in the village of Dovgenke during an enemy assault. The shrapnel tore the back and arm, severed the nerves in the arm and the arm did not work normally. He underwent treatment and rehabilitation, according to the conclusion of the VLK, he could receive a disability group. But he refused to undergo MSEK. The man says: -I will beat the occupiers until Victory.- He was an instructor in the 95th brigade, then transferred to the rocket artillery unit of the 148th artillery brigade. They carried out combat missions in the Zaporozhye direction. Somehow, for almost a week, the -Grad- of paratroopers did not go into combat, then Yuriy was asked to become the driver of the UAV unit for that time. -. I tried it, it went in and started working on -maviks-. He studied on the go, -on combat-. There was reconnaissance all the time in Zaporozhye, we worked without resets, there were quite intense actions, storming of enemy positions, there were a lot of flights in a day. And when they moved to the Donetsk direction, they began to work against the enemy already with discounts. Then switched to an FPV drone and never regretted it. There is more emotion and drive here,- &#8211; says Yuri -Sparta-. ...Finally dawn, combat work begins. The boys are told by walkie-talkie that the Russian infantry is advancing, supported by tanks and armored vehicles. Commander Yuri commands -before the battle.- Everyone takes their position. -Sparta- works as an operator, takes the control panel, puts on glasses, and the gunner -Tarantino- instantly fills in the coordinates of the target on the tablet, displays the video broadcast on the monitor, makes a report on readiness for departure. Miner Yevgeny on the call sign -Johnny - with a drone, which is equipped with ammunition, comes out of the shelter, puts the -bird- in position. He removes the fuse, and not a few minutes pass as the drone flies into the sky to bring justice to the occupiers. By the way, -Johnny- worked as a driver of the Kyiv subway until February 24, 2022. On the first day of the invasion, I took the minibus to work from Vasylkovo to Kyiv as usual. The metro has been working since 2010. It is very interesting to watch the work of the crew, they act as one mechanism, guide the drone to the target. After a few minutes, we can already see the plantation. An enemy tank was lurking 7-8 kilometers away, and it is the goal of the operation. As it turned out, the EW works on it, this is a problem, the connection is lost for a few seconds, the screen flickers, the video from the drone has disappeared. for afforestation. The guys managed to set up the broadcast quickly. The barely noticeable movements of the pilot's fingers are conjuring over the drone control panel, the tension on Sparta's face is clear, we can see the next maneuver to defeat. -Fpvishka- flies to the tank. Boom! The video has disappeared, and we are all overjoyed. The commander gives the command - -launch the next drone.- It is necessary to check whether the enemy tank is on fire. A few minutes later, on video, we see the Katsap tank on fire. And this means that the work was carried out meticulously. -We were lucky today. Usually, we spend more time and drones on such a -fat- target as a tank,- &#8211; says -Sparta-. We ask: how many attacks by drones on the enemy can usually be made in a working day? -It depends on the actions of the enemy. If there are assaults, we can make up to 20 sorties. The other day, during the Russian offensive, there were 19 sorties in one day. When needed, drones are brought to us additionally, there is no such thing as a lack of drones, we always have enough and that makes me happy. After defeating the equipment, we can burn one unit of the enemy's combat equipment in one day of work, sometimes we manage to destroy 3-5 units. It depends primarily on the work of their REB. And it is possible not to impress anything in terms of technique. Then we work in small assault groups,- &#8211; notes the gunner of the FPV drone -Tarantino-. Russians actively use EW tools to suppress the operation of our drones. We do the same. The -combat of frequencies- occurs constantly. During flights, we try to quickly switch to other frequencies when we see that the enemy is suppressing our -video picture-. Of course, there are -own chips- that the enemy does not know about. This helps us a lot in destroying racist targets. In general, shooting down an FPV drone with small arms is extremely unlikely, it is very maneuverable. It is also important not to -burn- your positions. Drone crew for the occupiers &#8211; priority goal. He is constantly looking for our location. As we are theirs. Somehow, one of our points was -burned- by the Rashisti, and we were then covered with artillery for more than 5 hours. They started around 11:30 a.m. and finished around 5:00 p.m. They fired cannons, covered with mortar fire, even the tank was working. Fortunately, the shells landed next to the dugout. Survived We waited until it got a little dark, collected all the things, the car arrived and we quickly left the position,- &#8211; the guys say. We ask: how often do you have to change positions? -During this month, we moved a lot. It all also depends on the intensity of the enemy's assault actions. In autumn, for example, we worked at one point for more than a month,- &#8211; says -Tarantino-. … Evening. We say goodbye to the boys and leave the positions of our drones -in the dark- in cars. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/okupantoriz-pid-kurahovym-reportazh-armiyainform-z-pozycziyi-odnogo-pidrozdilu-dronariv/	2024-12-31T20:55:18-08:00
Armored vehicle of a united Europe: what is known about the project of a joint system of armored veh...	As reported by portal of German broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW), four EU member states - Finland, Latvia, Sweden and Germany, will implement the project on the common system of armored vehicles (Common Armored Vehicle System, CAVS) - the purchase of modern armored personnel carriers for the protected transportation of troops, ArmiyaInform reports. In general, as DW reporters note, the purchase of new armored personnel carriers for the armies of the above-mentioned EU countries is part of a large defense project implemented within the framework of the European Instrument for Strengthening the Defense Industry through Joint Procurement (EDIRPA). The EDIRPA program is a short-term instrument adopted after the start of Russia's aggression against Ukraine and designed for the period until 2025 with the aim of stimulating cooperation in the field of the most urgent defense goods, the EU emphasizes. -The program supports the purchase of defense equipment by the armed forces of EU member states and Norway. The EDIRPA budget does not pay for defense products, but compensates member states for additional administrative costs associated with joint procurement,- stated in the notification of the European Commission. As for the direct implementation of the armored vehicle project within the CAVS (Common Armored Vehicle System), according to the experts of the defense site Army Recognition it is aimed at supporting the joint acquisition of modern 6x6 armored vehicles as part of a multinational program for the development, procurement and life cycle management of modern armored vehicles. This project builds on the similar capacity needs of participating states, thus creating a basis for enhanced cooperation and added value. The CAVS program has already activated serial production of 6×6 wheeled armored vehicles in Europe and continues to build production capacity on the continent. The project is directly supported by four organizations from EU member states: the Defense Forces of Finland, the Ministry of Defense of Latvia, the Swedish Defense Assets Administration and the German Bundeswehr. The initiative receives a maximum EU contribution of €60 million under the EDIRPA instrument for 2024. The main goal of the CAVS project is to develop and produce a common armored vehicle optimized for protected troop transport that meets the diverse operational needs of participating nations. This machine will integrate advanced technologies to provide reliable protection against ballistic threats, mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Its modular design will allow the vehicle to be adapted for various tasks, such as troop transport, medical evacuation, logistical support, reconnaissance and combat operations. In addition, its high mobility, which is ensured by a design adapted to difficult terrains and optimized off-road capabilities, will ensure high autonomy of the BBM in difficult conditions. The CAVS project also aims to promote a standardization approach that will reduce the current fragmentation of military equipment in the European Union. By opting for a shared vehicle, participating states will benefit from economies of scale through centralized production and coordinated maintenance. This standardization will also contribute to increased interoperability between the armed forces of different countries, facilitating joint operations and materiel exchange. In addition, the project will support the European defense industry by promoting the development and production of the vehicle in the EU, thus contributing to the strengthening of Europe's autonomy in this strategic area. The development of CAVS is also consistent with the broader context of strengthening European strategic sovereignty, particularly highlighted by geopolitical tensions related to Russia's aggression against Ukraine. This large-scale invasion highlighted the need to modernize the EU's military capabilities and reduce its dependence on external suppliers. It is within this dynamic that the EU has decided to invest heavily in projects such as CAVS, symbolizing a commitment to strengthening collective defense capabilities while defending sovereignty in the face of external challenges. Once developed and deployed, the CAVS armored vehicle will not only enhance the operational capabilities of the four member states, but will also create a common standard for future cooperation between EU member states. This project is a key step towards a more integrated and sustainable European defense capable of addressing current and future strategic challenges in a coherent and coordinated manner. As part of the international Common Armored Vehicles System (CAVS) program, the Finnish defense company Patria, about whose armored wheeled products our editors repeatedly told in its materials, will be the main contractor if Germany decides to buy machines from this manufacturer. Patria will lead the design and development of the system, while DSL in Freizen and FFG at its units in Flensburg (FFG) and Kirchen (JWT) will provide local design, manufacturing and life cycle support in Germany. Along with the start of more detailed preparations for localization, the production team will also involve other German companies to work on the program. It is interesting that the machine developed under the CAVS project can be based on a proven platform such as Patria 6×6, which is already used by several European armies. This armored vehicle, produced by the Finnish company Patria, is known for its reliability, modularity and ability to perform a wide range of tasks, making it the ideal basis for a European standardization project. The Patria 6×6 provides excellent protection against ballistic threats and mines, while being able to overcome difficult terrain thanks to its independent suspension and high off-road mobility. In addition, its modularity allows the vehicle to be easily adapted for different tasks, such as troop transport, armored ambulance, or even configurations for command or reconnaissance missions. By choosing an already proven and widely used platform, the EU could accelerate CAVS development using existing technology and materiel, thus easing the transition to a common armored vehicle for its armed forces. The goal of the CAVS program is to develop a 6×6 armored system to meet the needs of participating nations. Sweden joined the CAVS program in 2022, followed by Germany in 2023. Finland has ordered 164 armored personnel carriers (APCs) under the project, and also signed an agreement on vehicles HAPC (Heavy Armored Personnel Carrier), intended for crisis management situations Latvia, which has participated in the program since its inception, has ordered more than 200 APCs and recently signed a contract for 56 C2 vehicles (Patria 6×6 command-and-control). Last spring, Sweden signed an agreement to supply a total of 321 CAVS armored vehicles. Patria 6×6 stands out for its modularity, which allows it to be adapted to various military and security tasks. It can be configured for troop transport, designed to accommodate 10 fully equipped soldiers, or for medical evacuation via an ambulance module equipped with stretchers and patient stabilization equipment. The BBM can also serve as a mobile command post, combining advanced communications systems and workstations for strategic operations. Performing the role of logistical support, it can transport up to 8.5 thousand kg of equipment with the possibility of integrating a transport crane. To perform combat missions, it can be equipped with a remotely controlled turret, anti-tank missiles or air defense systems. Its reconnaissance capabilities include optical and infrared sensors, surveillance radars and even airborne tactical drones. Finally, technical support configurations allow for maintenance and towing of damaged vehicles. This versatility makes the Patria 6×6 an essential platform to meet the diverse needs of European armed forces while increasing interoperability and effectiveness.

Autocivilka for UBD: what will change in 2025	If previously combatants were exempted from mandatory civil liability insurance, then from now on you need to issue a civil liability insurance. In particular, Article 13 of the Law suffered certain changes. And now there are no categories of citizens who are exempt from compulsory insurance. In return, combatants will receive a discount. In particular, for them, -the amount of the insurance premium under the domestic insurance contract is reduced by 50 percent.- But there are also certain nuances. The discount is provided for a vehicle that has an engine displacement of up to 2500 cubic centimeters or an electric motor power of up to and including 100 kilowatts and is owned by a combatant /strong>, provided that such vehicle is driven exclusively by the insured or by a person who also owns to preferential categories, and using a vehicle without the purpose of providing paid services for the transportation of passengers and/or cargo. Another important nuance — the amendments to the Law indicate that the reduction of the insurance premium can be applied simultaneously only regarding one vehicle of the insured.

Liquidation of MSEK: How a serviceman can get the status of a person with a disability in 2025	In Ukraine, there are no more medical and social expert commissions (MSEK) that established disability statuses. In their place, expert teams will work to assess the daily functioning of a person, created at health care institutions. The Ministry of Health notes that the path to disability status will be much easier for a person, as most processes will be shortened and digitized. And all evaluation stages will be recorded in the electronic system. And what will change for the military? ArmyInform tells what military personnel must do to obtain the status of a person with a disability. And also who needs to be re-evaluated. If an injury or illness significantly limits the functioning of a serviceman, he may be referred to a facility with expert teams to assess daily functioning, clarifies the Ministry of Health. This can be done by the attending physician or the head of the VLK. At the same time, there is no need to wait 120 days from the moment of injury. After stabilization of the serviceman's state of health, the head of the VLK has the opportunity to immediately form an electronic referral for the assessment of daily functioning. The evaluation is carried out by an expert team of doctors who specialize in determining the degree of limitation of a person's functioning due to injuries or diseases. The expert team works on the basis of multidisciplinary healthcare institutions. The doctor and the serviceman can choose a medical facility together from the list available in the electronic system for daily functioning assessment. The choice depends on the serviceman's place of stay, as well as the chosen form of evaluation: The evaluation of daily functioning must be carried out within up to 30 days from the moment of submission of the electronic referral by the head of the VLK. The administrator of the health care facility where the expert team works must review the submitted case within 5 days from the moment of receiving the referral to either put the case in the queue and the system will determine the date and time of the evaluation, or return the case for revision due to inaccuracies. If the case is added to the queue, the serviceman will receive a notification via e-mail (his or a representative's e-mail) about the form, time and place of the assessment. If there is no e-mail, the information will be sent by registered mail to the military serviceman's physical address. The expert team analyzes the documents, and in the case of face-to-face, remote or on-site assessment, conducts an additional review or examination. Attention is paid to the degree of functional impairment, the impact of the injury or disease on daily activities, as well as the need for social support or rehabilitation. Based on the obtained results, the expert team must make a decision on the establishment of disability, determine the terms of re-evaluation (if necessary), and must provide recommendations for rehabilitation. The decision will be entered into the electronic system, and the serviceman will receive a copy of it by e-mail or, if necessary, in printed form. The document will also be available in the electronic office of the referring physician for evaluation. All data will be transferred to social security authorities responsible for further assistance. On the basis of the adopted decision, the serviceman may: The serviceman may appeal the decision of the expert team. To do this, you need to submit a complaint to the Center for Assessing the Functional State of a Person. Considering the large number of fakes of enemy propaganda, in particular, that from January 1, people with disabilities will be mobilized due to the fact that MSEKs were liquidated, and instead special commissions will cancel previously received statuses, the Ministry of Health emphasizes: -all people who have the status of disability continue to receive benefits, services, assistance and, in particular, deferment from mobilization, on the basis of the conclusion of the SCEC during its period of validity-. The Ministry of Health also clarified who and when should undergo repeated examinations: 1) all those who have limitations in daily functioning, i.e. legal grounds for the status of disability, will be evaluated by an expert team of medical practitioners within the prescribed period; 2) if the disability is established indefinitely, it is not necessary to pass the assessment, only at your own request: all benefits, guarantees and payments remain in force; 3) if a person during the years 2022-2024 had to undergo a re-examination, but could not undergo it for good reasons and in accordance with the exceptions provided for in the legislation during the martial law, then it will be necessary to undergo it: men aged 25-60 from 2 or 3 by the disability group - until November 1, 2025; to all other patients by April 1, 2026. Exceptions are the impossibility of re-examination for the following reasons: people are in hostilities or temporarily occupied territories; patients with severe disorders of body functions (do not have a limb or any of the paired organs, cannot hear or see, have an oncological or mental illness); active servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations - for them, the disability status remains valid during the period of military service and within 60 days from the date of discharge from service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/likvidacziya-msek-yak-vijskovosluzhbovczyu-otrymaty-status-lyudyny-z-invalidnistyu-v-2025-roczi/	2024-12-31T20:12:46-08:00
Propagandists cry about the flow of refugees from Ukraine: the border guards reassure	The border guards reassure: there is no outflow from Ukraine, the usual Christmas and New Year traffic. The border service of Poland recorded the traditional increase in traffic, which occurs every year during the New Year holidays, said the spokesman of the -Richka Bug- border unit Dariusz Senicki, who quotes edition PAP. The highest traffic on the Polish-Ukrainian border is usually recorded in the summer, when Ukrainians travel through Poland on vacation, and also during Christmas, when many Ukrainians return to their families in Ukraine. Since December 20, longer queues than usual began to form at the border with Ukraine, but traffic is evenly distributed in both directions, with a predominance of departures from Poland. The peak day was December 22, when almost 89,000 Ukrainian citizens crossed the Polish-Ukrainian border, but most of them, almost 49,000, left Poland. The spokesman emphasizes that the figure of 150,000 citizens of Ukraine, who allegedly want to enter Poland, has not been recorded at the border for a single day. So the report about the so-called -escape of Ukrainians- is a deliberate misinformation of the Kremlin, which serves to incite panic in Ukraine and anti-Ukrainian sentiment among Poles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/propagandysty-volayut-pro-potik-bizhencziv-z-ukrayiny-prykordonnyky-zaspokoyuyut/	2024-12-31T20:00:04-08:00
Rustem Umyerov: 2024 was full of challenges, but at the same time it showed how strong we are	ArmyInform provides the full text of the greeting. -Dear Ukrainians! 2024 was full of challenges, but at the same time it showed how strong we are. Together we have come a long way and achieved significant success. We have moved the hostilities to the territory of the enemy, and the long-range operations of Ukrainian drones reach the most distant points of the aggressor country. We have prepared a Victory Plan and have a clear understanding of what needs to be done together with our partners to achieve success. This year, Ukraine laid the foundation for the creation of the army of the future — Future Force. In cooperation with partners, we have built 8 coalitions of capabilities to support our state. This format of working with allies this year ensured a significant strengthening of our army, in particular, in aviation. F16s in Ukrainian skies are already successfully attacking the enemy and repelling enemy missiles. The next step is the French Mirage in Ukraine. We have moved to long-term planning for years ahead to strengthen our power on land, sea and air. It is important that working in coalitions strengthens Ukraine's compatibility with NATO and brings us closer to membership in the Alliance. We launched the process of digitalization of the Defense Forces, so that our army would be even more effective, and state structures would be faster and more transparent. Army+, Reserve+, our Ukrainian Delta have already become revolutionary products in the world. Ukraine attracted record financing for its own defense production - more than 5 billion dollars. The result of the rapid development of domestic industry is drones and missiles that are already hitting targets thousands of kilometers from our border. We have produced and delivered more than 1.5 million drones to our soldiers. Through joint efforts with our allies, we have systematically strengthened our defense capabilities. We attracted 10 countries to finance the Ukrainian defense industry, now it is more than 2.6 billion dollars for 2024 and 2025. And this number is constantly growing, and the number of partners is increasing. In the state budget for defense in 2025, the government laid down a whopping 2.23 trillion hryvnias. These funds will be fully directed to the support of our soldiers and the development of the Defense Forces. We will spend UAH 739 billion on the purchase of weapons and military equipment, and another UAH 55 billion on the modernization of Ukrainian industry. We aim to make the budget for next year a budget for changes on the battlefield. I sincerely thank our military, volunteers, medics, engineers - everyone who is working to defeat the Russian invaders. Eternal memory to the heroes who paid the highest price for the freedom of Ukraine. We do not forget those who meet the new year in occupation and in captivity. We will make every effort to free everyone from Russian oppression. May the new year be bright for all of Ukraine.

The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces congratulated the soldiers on the New Year: Thanks to you...	ArmyInform provides the full text of the greeting. -Dear brothers-in-arms and sisters-in-arms! Happy New Year 2025! Thank you for this year of fierce and uncompromising struggle! And thank you for the independence of Ukraine, which we preserve thanks to your strength. The eleventh year of Russian aggression against Ukraine is coming to an end. And for the third year, Russian troops tried to -take Kyiv in three days-, and some already wanted to see Ukraine erased from the political map of the world, and our people - destroyed. All of them underestimated the strength of Ukrainians — our heroic people, of whom one can only be proud. In 2024, we managed to stop the enemy's offensive in Kharkiv Oblast and protect Sumy Oblast from capture. The enemy wanted to create his -buffer zone- on our land, but we prevented this and began to return the war to where it came from - to Russian territory. I want to especially mention all our units, all our soldiers who perform combat tasks in Kurshchyna: guys, thank you! Thank you to everyone who fights in the most brutal areas of Donetsk region, to everyone who defends Zaporizhzhia and Kherson region. Thank you to each of our soldiers who destroys the occupier and chooses life for Ukraine. This year, the Russians paid the highest price for the war against Ukraine, because our army and all our Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine destroyed more enemy equipment and manpower than in any of the previous years of the war. We defend our state. Ukraine must preserve its life and independence. And win an honest peace for yourself. What Ukraine definitely deserves. We will never forget all our boys, all girls, each and every one who gave his life for the sake of Ukraine. I bow my head, honoring every warrior, every fallen hero. War dictates its difficult realities. But YOU, Ukrainian soldiers, YOUR bravery and resilience inspire all our Ukrainian people and fill the hearts of Ukrainians with faith. We have to win. We must preserve Ukraine and independence. Let 2025 be the time to realize our goal. I wish all our soldiers and their relatives health, warmth, comfort and a quick meeting — at home, with victory and in peace. Happy New Year!

Social elevators in the army: the MOU explained how the system of obtaining officer ranks will chang...	This was reported by /a> Deputy Minister of Defense for Digitization Kateryna Chernogorenko In this way, she commented on the changes, which provide for the simplification of the mechanism of obtaining officer ranks for soldiers and sergeants with combat experience. Kateryna Chernogorenko noted that an officer rank will be assigned simultaneously with the appointment. For this, servicemen no longer need to undergo a military training course under the officer training program and do not need to enter into a contract for military service. -Why is it important? Many strong specialists were mobilized to the army. After vast experience in management positions. After dozens of implemented projects. Previously, without an officer's education, they could only hold soldier positions. We must replenish the army with professional personnel and give managers with great experience all the opportunities for development. The army must be technological and modern,- explained Kateryna Chernogorenko.

The enemy forced Ukrainian children to give gifts to the occupiers	This is reported by a> Center of national resistance. Elementary school children in a number of captured schools of the occupied Kherson region were forced to make -garlands- for the occupiers and write poems. At the same time, parents had to rush to buy gifts for the fighters of the Soviet Union. Of course, propagandists highlight this as the desire of the children themselves. In this way, the enemy uses children for its own purposes, and at the same time tries to change their self-identification, heroizing the occupiers. We remind you that on temporarily occupied territories, the Russians conducted another wave of confiscation of cars from the civilian population.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/31/vorog-zmusyv-ukrayinskyh-ditej-skydatysya-na-podarunky-okupantam/	2024-12-30T21:56:38-08:00

Colombian-style action: a report from Donetsk region about the training of foreign volunteers	ArmyInform visited the training of foreign volunteers in one of the front-line cities in Donetsk region. What we see in the empty dilapidated building, which was once a multi-story building, resembles the shooting of an action episode of an expensive Hollywood blockbuster about special forces. Silhouettes of fighters with weapons at the ready emerge from the empty window openings of the building, which is divided into numerous rooms and corridors. Shouts in Spanish and simulated gunshots are heard. From time to time, the soldiers, at the command of the instructor, stop and listen to the remarks. After that, they change roles and return to their starting positions to play the scene, that is, to practice the exercise again. Instructor -Hulk- acts like an experienced director, repeating the same scene take after take to get it as close as possible to the ideal. The movements of the fighting actors are precise and lightning-fast, but he notices flaws and demands perfection. — We work out the approach to the house, cleaning the building, moving, -cutting- corners with a change of hands. That is, we go to the right corner, to the left corner and enter so that the enemy does not notice you, but you see him first, he explains. Moving through the building, the fighters seem to -fence- with automatic weapons, covering corners and quickly changing hands on the pistol grip and forend. Those waiting for them in the next room do not see the threat until a conditional shot is fired. This means that the enemy is destroyed before he had time to react in any way to the coordinated actions of the fighters. After that, the -actors- change roles and -play the scene- again - the repetition continues several times. — When you approach one corner and are comfortable from the left, the machine shifts to the left shoulder. When we need to clear another corner, we transfer the machine gun to the right shoulder, -Hulk- explains the essence of the exercise. He praises the foreign fighters, saying that they are motivated and responsible, ready to learn and want to do it, always listen carefully to the instructor and conscientiously do what is required. - Some of them have experience of military service and participation in hostilities, but for modern warfare, they are not enough, so they are constantly studying. There has never been such a war and no one has such experience, the military officer explains. The weapons of the volunteers from Colombia, who practice storming and clearing the building, are still unfamiliar to the Ukrainian eye. This is a CZ BREN 2 assault rifle, which has already proven itself as a reliable machine gun. Working with BREN 2 from Česká zbrojovka is easier and more convenient than with the usual AK-74. A high degree of modularity allows you to quickly adjust the machine to a specific fighter and task. - BREN 2 is a very good machine gun. It has been with us in the Legion since 2024 and has already proven itself to be extremely reliable and accurate. Compared to the AK-74, it is like the Mercedes of 2020 versus the Zhiguli of the 1970s. There were never any problems with it - no delays, no sticking - the instructor praises the weapon. Some of the fighters have additional front handles, sights, silencers installed. The BREN 2 makes it easy to do this, making the assault rifle even more convenient and versatile. Among the advantages of BREN 2, one can also count the caliber 5.56 × 45 mm for the standard service rifle cartridge for NATO forces. The instructor says that in a little more than a year, infantry tactics on the battlefield in urban areas have changed very significantly due to the proliferation of drop-bomber drones and kamikaze FPV drones. - They are like flies everywhere now. Therefore, the tactics of approaching the buildings, accumulating strength before the assault, have changed. If earlier it was possible to storm in eights or fours, now we act only in twos. Because where more than two fighters gather at the same time, something is guaranteed to fly, -Hulk- explains. Now, when smaller forces have to fight a more numerous, well-prepared and well-secured enemy, the level of training of fighters plays an important role. — We need to defeat a strong opponent with smaller forces. And whoever says that the Russians are stupid and do not know anything, do not understand anything, is deeply mistaken. We are fighting a very skilled enemy who learns quickly, he says. Therefore, now, he is convinced, it is necessary to learn faster and better than the enemy, to pay as much attention as possible to training. It is for this reason that when leaving their positions for rest, the fighters of the 2nd International Legion are always training, improving their skills and learning new techniques. -Hulk- tells about new methods of combating enemy drones, which have begun to be implemented in the unit and have already proven their high efficiency. — We practice working with 12-gauge, that is, with smooth-bore rifles that shoot shot. -Through trial and research, we have selected the numbers of meal that are the most effective,- says the instructor. In most cases, destroying an enemy UAV at such a distance is safe for the fighter, even if the drone explodes in the air. Therefore, the main task is to spot the enemy aircraft in time. In view of this, one of the skills that fighters practice is observing the airspace of the battlefield. — I started doing this when I was in the Serebrian Forest last winter. When a real influx of enemy drones began, something had to be done urgently about it, and there were very few anti-drone guns. Smoothbore rifles with shot became a good solution, recalls the soldier. Now he implements this experience also in the 2nd International Legion, and Colombians and other foreigners are happy to learn it. After all, constant training, training and innovation on the battlefield is the way not only to survival, but also to victory over the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/31/ekshn-po-kolumbijsky-reportazh-z-donechchyny-pro-pidgotovku-inozemnyh-dobrovolcziv/	2024-12-30T20:48:42-08:00
They will deal with it without a person: French engineers have created an unmanned all-terrain vehic...	As informs the Zone Militaire portal, the HE 441 is a small all-terrain vehicle of the Fardier/mule type (Fardier /mule, Fardier is an old French military term for a wheelbarrow used to transport heavy artillery, but this designation was later adopted in France and for all-terrain vehicles, ed.), designed according to the 4×4 scheme, which can be remotely controlled and/or move autonomously, ArmyInform notes. The key -feature- of the new machine of the company Soframe is not its high maneuverability and modular design, but the HELNA-P laser installation from Cilas, capable of shooting down fast-flying drones. In turn, the experts of the defense portal Army Recognition, who investigated the new product, claim that the HE441 off-road robot was created for the army work on various and difficult terrains, has a light but strong construction that allows it to move over uneven areas and off-road at high speeds. This mobility, combined with an open cockpit, allows the self-driving vehicle to function as a multi-purpose platform suitable for rapid deployment in high-stakes combat scenarios. The open cab layout provides flexibility, allowing operators to load the vehicle with special equipment, including weapons systems, communications or sensor arrays. With such modular upgrades, the HE441 all-terrain vehicle can be adapted to meet a wide range of defense mission requirements, from reconnaissance and troop transport to convoy protection and direct armed support. An important aspect of JNI's demonstration of the HE441 was its integration with the HELMA-P laser weapon system, an advanced anti-drone technology developed by Cilas. This laser-based anti-drone solution reflects the growing need for advanced countermeasures against the use of UAVs for surveillance, reconnaissance and even offensive attacks. Thanks to the HELMA-P system, the HE441 ground unmanned vehicle is capable of providing precise non-kinetic engagement of enemy drones, using high-energy laser beams to disable or destroy critical drone components. This allows ground forces to respond quickly to air threats without the use of conventional munitions, making the system cost-effective and sustainable for long-term operations. Thanks to the high-energy HELMA-P device, the ground robot HE441 turns into a mobile defense vehicle that moves. This mobility is critical because it allows infantry units to carry anti-drone equipment wherever they go, rather than relying on fixed or stationary air defense systems. Traditional anti-aircraft measures may be limited against small, fast-moving drones. And HELMA-P's fast laser targeting closes this gap, neutralizing drones silently and with minimal collateral damage. This silent strike capability is especially valuable for infantry and reconnaissance teams operating in sensitive areas where stealth is essential. The peculiar symbiosis of the HE441 unmanned mobile platform and the high-energy HELMA-P system represents a significant advance in modern combat readiness. Their combination offers a tailored solution to the rapidly changing threats faced by military forces, especially as drones become increasingly common in combat arsenals. For infantry units, the ability to move with a mobile anti-drone solution increases both security and operational flexibility, as they can respond to enemy UAVs in real-time without the delays or limitations of traditional stationary defenses. This combination is also economical. Unlike projectile-based anti-drone systems, which can incur significant costs due to ammunition consumption, the laser-based HELMA-P can neutralize multiple kamikaze drone threats with minimal resource expenditure. This system is designed not only for current needs on the battlefield, but also to adapt to the rapidly changing demands of modern warfare. HE441 tactical all-terrain drone.

The enemy is manipulating the numbers again: only the estimates are Chinese	Yes, at least since April 2024, seemingly Chinese estimates of the losses of the Armed Forces have been roaming the Internet. The figure is estimated to be more than 1.8 million dead. However, in open sources there are no and there have never been any official comments of the PRC regarding the losses of the Defense Forces. This is an outright fake, because according to official data, the total number of military casualties of Ukraine is many times less than claimed in Russian channels. Since the first days of the war, the Kremlin has been manipulating numbers — significantly reducing its own losses and significantly exaggerating Ukraine's losses. However, no one in the world believes in any Russian statistics. That is why, in order to convince someone, Russians from time to time refer to fictitious sources from other countries.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/31/vorog-znovu-manipulyuye-czyframy-tilky-oczinky-vzhe-kytajski/	2024-12-30T20:18:21-08:00

A new wave of confiscation of civilian cars for personal use has been recorded at TOT	About this reports Center of National Resistance. Officially, cars are confiscated from offenders for their own needs. However, the enemy is actually looking for a reason to confiscate, because the road inspectorate has a plan that it is trying to carry out. There have been recorded cases when a car was confiscated for minor debts due to non-payment of fines. In the future, the cars are handed over to the occupation units, which use the stolen cars during the assaults on our positions. We remind you, Russian dictator Putin signed a decree approving a new strategy for combating extremism in the Russian Federation, where Ukraine is identified as one of the -main sources of extremism-. The document aims to legitimize the Kremlin's aggressive policy towards our country, shifting the emphasis to -external provocations- and diverting attention from internal problems.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/30/na-tot-projshla-nova-hvylya-konfiskacziyi-czyvilnyh-avto-na-potreby-svo/	2024-12-30T11:42:25-08:00

They captured eight occupiers and freed captured Ukrainians: how the Rangers stormed the Russians	informs the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine about this. -A morning that started with tension. The enemy broke through to our positions, occupied the dugout and began to entrench. The task was clear and urgent: to destroy the enemy or force him to surrender,- the statement said. The fighters, together with the platoon commander, quickly assessed the situation, determined the route and developed an assault plan. The main problem is the unknown: how many of them, what kind of weapons, are they led by drones? Therefore, they decided to act decisively and in the most coordinated manner. Scouts set off to land. Drones closely monitored the situation, and commanders adjusted actions in real time. On the approach to the dugout, the group split: the machine gunner and his partner remained in cover, the others bypassed the position from the flank. Heavy fire and grenades did their job - the enemy began to retreat in confusion. The order from the commander sounded clear: to offer the Russians to surrender. -It's always more difficult than just destroying. It is necessary to convince the enemy that surrender is the only reasonable solution,- says the platoon commander with the call sign -Groundhog-. And they gave up. However, in a moment it turned out that there were Ukrainian prisoners among them. -There was no information about who they are and how many there are. -Rangers- acted clearly: they forced the enemy to leave one by one, without weapons and armor. They counted 10 people, including ours. This created a new problem: there was not enough space in the -box- for everyone,- said the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Some of the prisoners with an escort were sent immediately, the rest were left under the guard of two soldiers. The irony of fate: I had to hide from Russian artillery fire in the same dugout that was stormed a few hours ago. The General Staff of the Armed Forces noted that the operation was completed successfully. Not one wounded among our people, two freed Ukrainians and a priceless chance to exchange prisoners. -The main thing is to save the lives of loved ones and to return home those who are waiting for freedom.

Russia's new strategy for countering extremism should divert attention from domestic problems	About this informs the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The strategy states that threats from -radical neo-Nazi formations- are supported by external forces. The -Ukrainian crisis- is being used by -unfriendly states to launch hybrid wars against the Russian Federation and inflame aggressive Russophobic sentiments in the world.- It was determined that the elimination of threats originating from the territory of Ukraine is one of the main goals of the strategy. For the first time, the term -Russophobia- is introduced, which is defined as -an unfriendly, prejudiced, hostile attitude towards the citizens of Russia, towards the Russian language and culture-. Discriminatory actions by the authorities of -unfriendly- countries are also considered Russophobia. Among the factors of destabilization are uncoordinated protest actions that -deliberately- turn into mass riots, as well as the illegal activities of migrants and the destructive work of international non-governmental organizations. The strategy provides for prosecution of persons engaged in extremist activities (without the possibility of avoiding punishment), and keeping records of all those who travel outside Russia to participate in extremist organizations or to undergo training in -centers of unfriendly states.- As part of preventive measures, the document suggests developing migrant adaptation programs, creating patriotic social advertising for young people, publishing the consequences of violent crimes on extremist grounds, implementing the capabilities of -artificial intelligence- technology to deanonymize extremists, and also organizing -Saturdays- at the graves of World War II veterans. -svo-, the Afghan war and the war in Syria.

It was established that intruders set fire to two relay cabinets on railway lines that regulate the movement of trains through Kyiv region. To commit the crimes, the perpetrators purchased a flammable mixture and a screwdriver, which they used to break the doors of power plants, and then doused their technological parts with gasoline. Two more attackers were detained in Volyn when they set fire to a service car of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which was undergoing maintenance in the region after completing combat missions at the front. The detainees were an 18-year-old student of the local vocational school and his 15-year-old accomplice. During the searches, mobile phones with evidence of correspondence with the enemy and clothes in which they committed the arson were seized from the suspects. Currently, the detainees have been notified of suspicion (according to the crimes committed) under several articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: Criminals face from 10 years in prison to life imprisonment with confiscation of property. We remind you that on the night of December 30, 2024 (from 19:00 on December 29) the enemy attacked with 43 Shahed-type shock UAVs and other types of drones from Primorsky-Akhtarsk - Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/30/meni-nravyczya-yak-vono-goryt-zatrymano-pidpalyuvachiv-yaki-praczyuvaly-na-fsb/	2024-12-30T00:09:15-08:00
Aviation instead of the fleet: the spokesman of the Navy explained why the number of Russian ships i...	The spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain 3rd rank, told about this on the air of the Edyny Novyny telethon Dmytro Pletenchuk. Currently, Russian planes patrol the Black Sea and coastal waters instead of ships and boats. -Russian aviation remains active, a fairly large part of the functionality has actually been transferred to it, including from the ship and boat fleet. Airplanes patrol both the water area and the coastal zone, these issues mostly depend on aviation now,- he said. According to Dmytro Pletenchuk, such changes were caused by the destruction of several ships near the occupied Crimea during the year. As a result, the Russians were forced to leave their bases in Crimea and focus on preserving the remnants of their naval fleet. As reported by ArmyInform, as of the morning of December 30 in the Black Sea, one enemy ship, which is a Caliber cruise missile carrier, missiles are missing.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/30/aviacziya-zamist-flotu-rechnyk-vms-poyasnyv-chomu-zmenshylas-kilkist-rosijskyh-korabliv-u-chornomu-mori/	2024-12-29T23:53:05-08:00

Liquidation of MSEK: How a serviceman can get the status of a person with a disability in 2025	In their place, expert teams will work to assess the daily functioning of a person, which will be created at health care institutions. The Ministry of Health notes that the path to disability status will become much easier for a person, as most processes will be shortened and digitized. And all evaluation stages will be recorded in the electronic system. And what will change for the military? ArmyInform tells what military personnel must do to obtain the status of a person with a disability. If an injury or illness significantly limits a serviceman's functioning, he may be referred to a facility with expert teams for daily functioning assessment, explains the Ministry of Health. This can be done by the attending physician or the head of the VLK. At the same time, there is no need to wait 120 days from the moment of injury. After stabilization of the serviceman's state of health, the head of the VLK has the opportunity to immediately form an electronic referral for the assessment of daily functioning. The evaluation is carried out by an expert team of doctors who specialize in determining the degree of limitation of a person's functioning due to injuries or diseases. The expert team works on the basis of multidisciplinary healthcare facilities. The doctor and the serviceman can choose a medical facility together from the list available in the electronic system for daily functioning assessment. The choice depends on the serviceman's place of stay, as well as the chosen form of evaluation: The evaluation of daily functioning must be carried out within up to 30 days from the moment of submission of the electronic referral by the head of the VLK. The administrator of the health care facility where the expert team works must review the submitted case within 5 days from the moment of receiving the referral to either put the case in the queue and the system will determine the date and time of the evaluation, or return the case for revision due to inaccuracies. If the case is added to the queue, the serviceman will receive a notification via e-mail (his or a representative's e-mail) about the form, time and place of the assessment. If there is no e-mail, the information will be sent by registered mail to the military serviceman's physical address. The expert team analyzes the documents, and in the case of face-to-face, remote or on-site assessment, conducts an additional review or examination. Attention is paid to the degree of functional impairment, the impact of the injury or disease on daily activities, as well as the need for social support or rehabilitation. Based on the obtained results, the expert team must make a decision on the establishment of disability, determine the terms of re-evaluation (if necessary), and must provide recommendations for rehabilitation. The decision will be entered into the electronic system, and the serviceman will receive a copy of it by e-mail or, if necessary, in printed form. The document will also be available in the electronic office of the referring physician for evaluation. All data will be transferred to social security authorities responsible for further assistance. On the basis of the adopted decision, the serviceman may: The serviceman may appeal the decision of the expert team. To do this, you need to submit a complaint to the Center for Assessing the Functional State of a Person.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/30/likvidacziya-msek-yak-vijskovosluzhbovczyu-otrymaty-status-lyudyny-z-invalidnistyu-v-2025-roczi/	2024-12-29T20:53:46-08:00
300 combat and salvo to repulse the assault: the shooting intensive at Interflex continues until the...	The correspondent of ArmyInform tells about the training repulse of an enemy assault, which completes rifle training during the BZVP within the limits of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. Marksmanship training with live ammunition is the final stage of intensive training and daily intensive training during basic military training within the Interflex mission. In our case, it lasts nine days. Shootings take place in a number of locations - on a specially equipped shooting range, on a range with structures for practicing shooting from awkward positions, and in several places in the middle of forest plantations, which we would call forest plantations. In a few days, we go from conducting fire at the shooting range exclusively from stationary positions under the strict control of instructors to simulating fire contact with the enemy while patrolling and moving across the field or in wooded areas. We shoot a lot, without regretting and without counting cartridges - there are plenty of them. It is the norm, not the exception, to shoot several dozen or even more than a hundred shots in a school day. In recent days, especially active enthusiasts are allowed to shoot even more. However, the biggest daily attack will come on the last day of training, when we no longer work in twos or fours, but act simultaneously in two divisions. On this day, everyone fires at least 300 live rounds. Having entered the positions, we will hold the defense until the last cartridge - until all magazines and all zincs with cardboard boxes for storing cartridges are completely emptied. The instructors are interested in us shooting everything -to zero-. Our task is to repel a conditional enemy assault and hold positions in two nearby trenches. The greatest responsibility rests with the department commanders who organize the defense and coordinate the opening and cessation of fire. It all begins with an imitation of artillery shelling, during which instructors scatter explosive charges--firecrackers- literally a few meters from the chances. In terms of volume, it is similar to mortar fire, but unfired fighters need to start small. We are already familiar with such explosions, because during the previous classes on throwing grenades in trenches and defending positions, instructors used such charges. But now the simulated artillery fire is particularly intense, with several dozen explosions near both trenches. During the -artillery fire- we literally squeeze into the smallest gaps of chance, and after it in pairs we check weapons, equipment and ourselves for possible injuries. Instructors monitor how we communicate with each other and follow the algorithm. Thanks to previous training, such checks have already been brought to automaticity. The fighter with the call sign -Italian- with whom I work in a pair does it almost twice as fast as me - due diligence and previous experience. After completing the check, we send a signal of readiness to the unit commander and take a waiting position. The commander or a fighter designated by him conducts observation and maintains contact with an observer from a neighboring trench. Established and well-practiced communication within the department and between departments is perhaps the most important key to the successful completion of a combat mission. It is given no less attention than the rules for handling weapons. At the beginning, we were literally forced to shout loudly to each other, duplicate commands and inform the commander and comrades about what was discovered. By the last day of training, this is already a firmly learned habit. Foreign instructors do not understand what we are saying to each other, but they hear the communication and see the correct actions. This is enough to see that we are saying the right things. Only occasionally do they ask for the help of translators. Having noticed the appearance of the enemy, the observer reports to the commander. Having quickly received a signal of readiness from each of the fighters of the unit and coordinating actions with his comrades, he orders to open fire. It is necessary for all shooters to do this at the same time in order to cover the enemy with the first shots and force him to lie down or retreat. A joint volley of 16 machine guns of both divisions and rapid fire after that gives the impression of the fire superiority of the defenders of the positions. It will be possible to achieve the desired effect of simultaneity only with the second attempt - coordinating the actions of such a large number of shooters from two departments in neighboring chances turns out to be a difficult task. However, then we easily repeat it several times in a row. When conducting fire, we change positions after every 3-5 shots. Targets repeatedly rise and fall rapidly, hit by well-aimed shots. Everyone covers their sector, firing first at the nearest and then at the distant targets. The instructors are happy with our communication - working in pairs during reloading, checking weapons and equipment is firmly in place. Accuracy does not suffer either - the targets fall one after another, proving a hit. The brothers with the call sign -Grandfather- show special effectiveness, knocking out distant targets with the first shot. I'm left to shoot my neighbors and cover my neighbors while they reload. During the day, we manage to repulse an enemy assault six or seven times, alternating our actions with other units. Fortunately, the weather cooperates - in the midst of constant rain, Misty Albion is unexpectedly warm and sunny today. Our ears are ringing with explosions and shots, and our arms and legs are tired, but we are ready to go on when it turns out that there are no more cartridges left - we have fired everything, firing at least three hundred rounds each. Thousands of shell casings crunch underfoot in the trenches and sparkle in the evening sun next to the trenches. It takes more than an hour to collect them, but we are already almost stretching the pleasure, looking for bright cylinders even 10 meters from the positions. The last day of training at Interflex ends earlier than planned and we return to the camp even more enviable. This is perhaps the first case during the entire training period, because usually classes and training lasted until late in the evening.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/30/300-bojovyh-i-zalp-dlya-vidbyttya-shturmu-strileczkyj-intensyv-na-interflex-tryvaye-do-ostannogo-patrona/	2024-12-29T20:39:35-08:00
Karma will catch up with the enemy: a well-known German manufacturer of AI-based solutions in Ukrain...	According to the Army Recognition (AR) defense team, the HX-2 Karma is a new generation of ammunition, designed for high accuracy and adaptability in difficult combat conditions, ArmiyaInform reports. AR experts reported that according to Helsing GmbH, which has been operating in Munich since 2021, a drone equipped with state-of-the-art features, including the ability to navigate and perform missions even in areas where global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are jammed or unavailable, solving critical problem of modern electronic warfare. With Helsing's Altra Recce-Strike software, multiple HX-2 drones can operate simultaneously in coordinated missions, using swarm tactics to overwhelm enemy defenses. Integrated artificial intelligence allows autonomous identification and hitting of targets with an accuracy of up to 50 centimeters. This capability minimizes collateral damage and maximizes mission effectiveness. However, according to experts of site IKK Defense Express (DE), information about these drones is extremely limited. It is only noted that they have developed -artificial intelligence- for autonomously hitting targets and ignoring EW, have a range four times greater than Ukrainian kamikaze drones and are cheaper than the American Switchblade or the Russian Lancet. -The latter directly indicates that the drone itself is a barrage munition for hitting targets at a range of 40-60 km,- DE stated. In turn, the authors portal of the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle indicate that Helsing drones work on the basis of software, which makes them virtually invulnerable to electronic warfare. A defense expert familiar with the situation told the German publication Bild that this drone is capable of -learning by itself terrain- and recognize from thousands of landmarks where it is, thus helping the operator stay on course even in adverse weather conditions or in bombed-out areas. -After the target has been found and the operator has given him instructions, the drone flies to it by itself,- the publication quotes. Bild's interlocutor's words. According to Bild, we are not talking about ordinary kamikaze drones controlled by operators, but about high-tech aircraft controlled by artificial intelligence, which are also called -mini-Taurus-. However, the latest claim of some kind of technological kinship with the -Taurus- has already caused critical statements. In particular, the Ministry of Defense of the Federal Republic of Germany disagreed with the journalistic comparison of German drones with AI elements to long-range missiles. This was said by the representative of the Ministry of Defense Natalie Jenning at a briefing in Berlin, Ukrinform reports. The spokeswoman noted that these are -tactical drones with a limited range.- She criticized the fact that the drones were called mini-Taurus and said that these drones cannot be compared to Taurus missiles. At the same time, Jenning refused to provide specific technical details regarding the drones. The position of the German Defense Ministry and DE experts are supported, citing the fact that a barrage munition with the ability to hit targets at a range of 40-60 km cannot be compared to a powerful cruise missile. -Already on the basis of this, it is possible to immediately understand that these drones are not talking about any -mini-Taurus- or at least a fraction of the capabilities of Taurus. Because the task of this German cruise missile is to destroy highly protected objects with the help of a 480-kg warhead at a range of more than 500 km. And any drone, even if it has a similar range, cannot physically destroy similar targets with the help of a warhead weighing several tens of kilograms,- Defense Express emphasized. However, as Western military experts emphasize, the use of unmanned munitions with the capabilities attributed to the HX-2 Karma reflects a broader trend in modern military operations, where unmanned systems and technologies controlled by artificial intelligence are becoming indispensable. The ability of the drone to operate in conditions where GNSS is not available and to use swarm tactics is aimed at solving two of the most important tasks: defeating electronic warfare and countering massive enemy forces or equipment. It should be noted how reported ArmyInform, at the beginning of May this year, Deputy Minister of Defense Kateryna Chernogorenko met with representatives of the Helsing company, which is engaged in integration of artificial intelligence in defense technologies. Together with the CEO and co-founder of Helsing Gundbert Scherf, they discussed the possibilities of integrating solutions with the use of artificial intelligence into the existing software of the Ukrainian army. In turn, in February of this year, the heads of the Ministry of Strategic Industries of Ukraine and Helsing GmbH signed a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation in the field of security and defense. The purpose of signing the memorandum is to strengthen Ukrainian defense technologies. It is about the implementation of artificial intelligence technologies in drones, in particular UAVs, manufactured in Ukraine. Presentation of HX-2 UAV capabilities.

Khorezmi said that he does not consider Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to be part of Pakistan's territory.

The Russians have a tank with REBs going forward, sewn up as much as possible so that our FPV drones don't hit them, but it doesn't save them. Sometimes it happens that 5-7 hits plus mines don't help,- said Serhiy Volkov. According to him, the enemy's advantage in personnel remains the biggest problem. -If the enemy's infantry is not destroyed, they run around the landings, and then it's a lot of trouble to knock them out. Therefore, the enemy is now trying to cut off the logistical routes to Velika Novosilka, and this is one of the very difficult directions,- said Serhiy Volkov, whose brigade is fighting hard and is even trying to counterattack.

But there are quite expected changes to these barrier systems that they have been building so enthusiastically for almost the entire warm period. As of now, it is likely that quite a large number of these barriers are not functional. Storm season isn't over yet. For another 2-3 months, rather harsh weather at sea will continue. And I hope that soon we will see even more results of the intervention of -General Storm-, who mostly helps us,- noted Dmytro Pletenchuk.

Due to the price regulation of TOT, there was a shortage of products	This is reported by a> Center of national resistance. Such a price policy leads to logical consequences, namely a shortage of products. This is primarily about oil, because the fixing of its price has led to the fact that it is now being sold from the -showcase-, because the fixed price does not correspond to the market price. Russia is synonymous with the word deficit. Therefore, the result of the reign of each king is necessarily the disappearance of goods from the shop windows. Currently, the Russians are trying to impose cash registers on sellers, which will become mandatory from February 1, 2025, and this will only increase fines, and the goods on the shelves will not be returned.

Russia recognized the collapse of the economy	This is reported by the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The main change is that the exchange rate of the yuan is now determined both by the results of trading on the Moscow Stock Exchange and by taking into account the agreements made on the over-the-counter market. Since June 2024, the exchange rate of the dollar and the euro has been determined on the basis of over-the-counter data due to US sanctions, while the exchange rate of the Chinese currency is based only on the results of trading on the Moscow Stock Exchange. This decision of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation indicates the transition to manual regulation of the currency market and the growing role of the political component in the activity of the regulator. We remind you that the situation on the labor market in the Russian Federation will continue to deteriorate. Today, the shortage of personnel in Russia is about 1.5 million people with an unemployment rate of 2.3%. The reason is stagflation processes in the economy of the Russian Federation due to the war against Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/29/rosiya-vyznala-kolaps-ekonomiky/	2024-12-29T03:12:36-08:00

According to him, the enemy is trying to take the city by storm. Both mechanized frontal attacks and small infantry groups are used. -In particular, infantry groups are trying to infiltrate through the positions of our defenders and impose a battle in the rear. But they do not succeed. Because these groups are revealed very quickly.

The enemy is looking for land plots whose owners left the TOT	This is reported by Center of National Resistance. It is about captured lands of the Kherson region. Currently, the local -grain operator-, which was created to forcibly take grain from local farmers, forms lists of lands whose owners left the region because of the -liberators-. Next year, the occupiers plan to put these plots up for sale, that is, they actually want to take them away from their rightful owners. However, we note that any documents issued by the ROA are legally null and void and have no legal force.

In Russia, there is a growing shortage of personnel	This is reported by Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. In 2022-2024, the number of labor force decreased by 1 million and today it is about 76.3 million people. A particularly rapid reduction is observed in the groups that are most in demand on the labor market - persons aged 19 to 40 years. Only during July-September 2024, employers posted 3.3 million vacancies. By the end of the third quarter, the ratio of open vacancies to unemployed Russians was 5 to 1. Throughout 2024, the largest shortage of personnel was observed in the field of retail trade and the IT sector. In the construction industry, the deficit in general can reach more than 400,000. persons By 2030, the shortage of personnel may increase to 4 million people. Given the Kremlin's intentions to continue the Russian-Ukrainian war, it will not be possible to solve the personnel problem in Russia thanks to internal reserves. Improvement of the situation on the labor market at the expense of foreigners is unlikely given the strengthening of the migration policy and double standards for labor migrants. We remind you that due to the refusal of the majority of local doctors to cooperate with the enemy, the occupiers cannot cope with the personnel shortage in the temporarily occupied territories of the Zaporizhzhia region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/29/u-rosiyi-fiksuyetsya-zrostannya-deficzytu-kadriv/	2024-12-28T23:29:33-08:00

-The gun -Bogdany- is our 155-caliber sniper rifle-: the Russian locust is fired by the -Artist- fro...	Currently, -Artist- serves in the 48th separate artillery brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the position of service number of the self-propelled artillery installation -Bohdan-. — Served, as theatergoers say, 20 years. Retired, had another civilian profession. And then he was mobilized and went to this damned war. Since then, I have been in the army for the second time, says Yuriy. This is not Yuriy's first time in the army - he served in the military at the end of the 1990s. Even then, he was recognized as visually impaired, so based on this and his acting talent, he served a year and a half in the Song and Dance Ensemble of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, performed on the same stage with many Ukrainian celebrities. — However, now I feel that it is suitable, because it is necessary for the defense of Ukraine. Therefore, when the summons was served, he left without hesitation. He was mobilized on March 1, 2024, trained in the Poltava region, says the soldier. Having the right not to serve on account of his health, he decided not to use it and willingly went into service as soon as the need arose. After all, he says, when the war is going on, everyone who is ready to defend the country is healthy and fit. — Everything was polite, cultured. They served a summons and the next day I arrived at the TCC, filled out the documents, went through everything and went to the training center, says Yuriy. - Before that, I volunteered - this is also an important job, because it is necessary to hold the rear and provide for the army. He was engaged in the delivery of food to the military and volunteers, helped his wife, who was weaving camouflage nets with her friends, he recalls how the first two years of the large-scale invasion passed. Yury fondly recalls how he once came across a video recorded by the military, in which they thanked for the products transferred from the company in Cherkasy, where he worked. — They recorded tiktok and it had our brand, our company! The guys ate exactly our products - this greatly inspired everyone at the time, because it showed that we are doing an important, necessary thing - the artist does not hide his emotions. After the war, he seeks to return to the friendly team from which he was forced to go to the army because of the war. Yuriy is sure that they are waiting for him there, because over the years of joint work and volunteering, his colleagues have become a single family. -We need a strong rear, but there are not enough hands in the army, so when I was called, I immediately left,- he says firmly. — In the -textbook- we were called -validators-. The youngest was 40 years old, the oldest was 58. Of course, compared to the younger guys, it was difficult for us, - he says about the training center. However, they were taught qualitatively - in a month, the -Artist- learned significantly more about military affairs and in a much better quality than he had once during a year and a half of military service. — So what happened before? Overcoat, -hem-, edging, boots - and to make everything rub and shine. We painted more squares and painted curbs than we shot and learned to fight, he says. Now they teach the practical things that are really needed in the war, and they do it not for formal reporting, but to prepare the soldier for combat operations. - -Training- was a great experience. There were experienced instructors, qualified, who had already gone through the war themselves and knew what we would really need. It was necessary to be with them like a sponge - to soak up everything they gave, what they taught, -Artist- notes. When the -buyers- came for the graduates from BZVP, Yuriy was selected as an artilleryman. A motivated responsible soldier was selected after a short interview and was sent to study a profession. — The colonel who came after us was primarily looking for those who had a technical education. But when I found out that I was a ballet dancer, I became interested and invited him to join the artillery. I agreed because they promised to work on a combat vehicle, -Artist- recalls. The second stage of training was less physically exhausting, but extremely responsible, because it was necessary to master subjects completely unknown to the former theater actor. However, persistence and responsibility quickly yielded the desired result. — At first you don't know from which side to approach this technique. But the main thing is to start and not be afraid. When a harmonious crew is formed, everything will go as it should. Because in combat conditions, the main thing is coordination — for the machine to arrive, for us to quickly -decompose- it, prepare it for battle and shoot accurately, says the soldier. After training in a specialty from May to today, Yuriy serves as a maintenance officer of the -Bohdana- ACS. - There are a lot of combat sequences, but this is just work. The most important thing in the war is my brothers, my crew, the guys I work with. People are always the most important thing. When we are confident in each other, everything always works out even in combat, says -Artist-. He by no means wants to leave combat work at the SAU for another position, because he is sure that this is where his place is during this war and this is where he can be of the greatest benefit. Yuriy does not consider the inability to see as an obstacle, because he is not a sniper and he has to shoot with a completely different -rifle- - the 155th! — caliber. - We shoot from the cannon exactly at the target. Our gun is our sniper rifle. The acuity of my vision does not affect this. If the Komgar (gun commander - ed.) orders, then we will make our doll, and we will bang, hit, and burn that Russian locust! — a confident gunner. Yuriy says that the main motive for him is not ostentatious patriotism, to which he is skeptical, but responsibility for his family, brothers, and country. — I have responsibility from my father. And my family motivates me. Because the family is the motherland. My mother-in-law lives in the Dnipropetrovsk region. So where should I go next? She is part of my family and I have to protect her, he explains. In the same way, he is convinced, everyone should think about taking responsibility for themselves and protecting their family, country, Ukrainian people and the state of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/29/garmata-bogdany-nasha-snajperska-gvyntivka-155-kalibru-rosijsku-saranu-vypalyuye-artyst-z-baletu/	2024-12-28T20:50:37-08:00
A new addition to the cat family: the Bundeswehr received a new version of the Leopard 2 tank	The German defense company KNDS Deutschland presented the Leopard 2A7A1 main battle tank equipped with an Israeli active defense system Trophy (APS). The prototype was presented at the company's plant in Munich during a demonstration attended by representatives of the German Bundeswehr and an Israeli delegation, ArmyInform reports. According to the information shared by the defense resource Defense Industry Europe, we are talking about equipping the serial tank of the latter, for this time, modifications with the active protection complex (KAZ) Trophy, from the Israeli companies Rafael and IAI. Previously, the Leopard 2 was equipped with Trophy armor only on research and demonstration models, but now the Bundeswehr has become the first customer of this version. This system, according to the experts of site Army Recognition, provides reliable protection against anti-tank missiles and rocket launchers, detecting and neutralizing incoming threats before they hit the tank. The Trophy system includes radar antennas and launch platforms externally, while internally it includes a control unit and power supply integrated into the turret and chassis. According to the Defense Industry Europe portal, the Leopard 2 A7A1, intended for active service starting in 2025, will strengthen Germany's 203rd Armored Battalion. It is planned to deploy this unit in the German combat brigade stationed in Lithuania. The German Defense Procurement Agency (BAAINBw) has confirmed that the tank will soon begin testing, with final approval expected by the summer of 2025, after which the first units will go directly to the troops. Integrated with the Leopard on-board computer and battlefield management systems, the Trophy system includes an advanced targeting locator. This system identifies the source of incoming threats, transmitting precise coordinates to the tank control system for rapid automated countermeasures, significantly improving defense response times. In 2021, the Bundeswehr agreed with Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (now KNDS Deutschland) to produce 17 Leopard 2A7A1 tanks and a test vehicle, deliveries of which will begin in 2024. A simultaneous contract was also signed with Israel for Trophy components, munitions and special equipment, part of a €120 million program jointly funded by Germany and Israel. The new KNDS Leopard 2 chassis meets the power requirements of the Trophy system with modifications including a 20 kW power supply and improved cooling for the updated MTU Friedrichshafen engine, ensuring optimal mobility despite increasing the tank's weight to 70 tons. The Leopard 2A7A1 is expected to be an interim solution until the more advanced Leopard 2A8 enters service in 2025. Incorporating an improved, lighter Trophy system optimized for drone protection, the A8 represents the next evolution of the Leopard series with the Trophy fully integrated into its turret, contrasting with the optional A7A1 system setup. Currently, Trophy in the Leopard 2A7A1 version is not designed to combat kamikaze drones, but Israeli engineers plan that this function will appear in future models. In October, Rafael announced the successful completion of development, which gives the ability of the Trophy complex to protect against modern threats, including FPV drones. These drones pose a serious threat that exceeds the risks from ATGMs and anti-tank grenade launchers, which the Trophy was originally designed to combat. Currently, only two countries in the world have serial tanks with KAZ - these are Israel and the USA. The US military equipped its Abrams MBT with the Trophy system as early as 2021, following a contract signed in 2018. Trophy® APS tank protection system. Video: RAFAEL Advanced Defense Systems Ltd.

Maksym Bilousov, the head of the communications department of the 60th Ingulets mechanized brigade, told on the ArmyTV stream about this. -According to my feeling, there have been fewer CABs. At least, from what I saw in our chats, when there is a warning about the operation of KABs, I haven't seen such active use of KABs for quite some time, as it was before. That is, even a month ago, messages -Reset KAB, reset KAB, reset KAB- were constantly coming. It happened every day and 3-4 times a day.

President: It seems that Putin has instructed to open a second energy front against Ukraine	This is stated in the statement of the head of state. -It seems that Putin instructed Fico to open a second energy front against Ukraine at the expense of the interests of the people of Slovakia. Only this can mean Fico's threats to cut off the emergency supply of electricity to Ukraine in the winter in the context of Russian attacks on our power plants and distribution network,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He explained that Ukraine's need to import electricity arose only because of Russia's occupation of our Zaporozhye nuclear power plant and the purposeful destruction by Russian missiles and Shaheds of a significant part of Ukrainian thermal and hydrogen electricity generation. Thanks to the heroic work of our energy workers and life-saving cooperation with the EU, USA, Great Britain, Norway, Japan and our other partners in Ukraine, we managed to prevent a blackout. -Now Fico is also involving Slovakia in Russia's efforts to hurt Ukrainians,- the President said. The head of state reported that the share of Slovakia in the import of electricity to Ukraine is about 19%. The Government of Ukraine is working with our neighbors in the EU to maintain the necessary amount of electricity supply. -Slovakia is part of the single European energy market, and Fico must respect European rules. Any arbitrary decisions in Bratislava or orders from Moscow to Fico regarding electricity will not lead to a halt in the import of electricity to Ukraine, but can definitely lead to a break between the current government of Slovakia and the European community,- the President emphasized.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/28/prezydent-shozhe-putin-doruchyv-vidkryty-drugyj-energetychnyj-front-proty-ukrayiny/	2024-12-28T04:24:52-08:00

Mirage 2000 fighters have already shot down the Shahed-136. But not yet in Ukraine...	ArmyInform wrote about possible tasks -Mirage- in Ukraine, but did not mention that in 2024 these aircraft had already successfully shot down two enemy Kamikaze UAV Shahed-136 in combat conditions. However, not in Ukraine. Since the transfer to Ukraine, the F-16 Fighting Falcon multi-purpose fighters have convincingly demonstrated their -bojovi-sokoly-pid-chas-neshhodavnogo-obstrilu-ukrayiny/->efficiency as a means Air defense, shooting down dozens of Russian cruise missiles and kamikaze drones during massive combined air and missile strikes on the Ukrainian energy infrastructure. -Fighting Falcons- began to -learn- to shoot down -Shakhed- - more precisely, small-sized unmanned aerial vehicles at low altitude - at the end of 2019, when the USA and other NATO countries realized the threat from the Russian Federation and Iran due to their active use of cruise missiles and kamikaze drones. French Mirage 2000 multirole fighters are also capable of shooting down UAVs and cruise missiles. At the same time, unlike the F-16, they proved it not only during tests, but also in combat conditions even before they appeared in the Ukrainian skies. They had to act not against training targets, but against Iranian-made Shahed-136 combat UAVs. This happened during the Prosperity Guardian operation, which the coalition of states led by the United States is conducting from the end of 2023 to the beginning of 2024 with the aim of restoring the safety of shipping in the Red Sea. The operation is directed against the pirate actions of the Houthi paramilitary group, which operates from the territory of Yemen. Despite the fact that France has refused to participate in Operation Prosperity Guardian, its armed forces take part in patrolling the waters of the Red Sea as part of the European Union Operation Shield (EUNAVFOR Aspides) and interact with the US-led Prosperity Guardian coalition forces. Acting together with allies within the limits of both operations, French warships and aircraft patrol the waters of the Red Sea, repulse Houthi attacks on civilian vessels, and also provide the necessary self-defense in the event of a threat from enemy weapons at sea and in the air. On the morning of March 9, 2024, the Houthis launched four Shahed-136 kamikaze drones against the Barbados-flagged commercial vessel True Confidence. Their route lay in close proximity to and posed a threat to the French Navy's Aquitaine-type multipurpose frigate -Alsace- (FS Alsace, D656). Acting in self-defense and protecting a civilian vessel, the French armed forces opened fire on air targets and shot down four enemy UAVs. Two Shaheds shot down the frigate's 76 mm cannon, the others destroyed two Mirage 2000-5F fighters patrolling the airspace between the ship and the coast. Overall, during a Houthi airstrike on March 9, 2024, the armed forces of France, Great Britain and the United States jointly shot down 15 enemy UAVs. The significant contribution of Mirages has convincingly demonstrated their ability to effectively shoot down small air targets, such as drones and cruise missiles, at low altitudes in combat conditions. This allows us to believe that French fighters can become no less effective means of air defense in the defense of Ukrainian skies than the F-16.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/28/vynyshhuvachi-mirage-2000-vzhe-zbyvaly-shahed-136-ale-shhe-ne-v-ukrayini/	2024-12-27T20:57:01-08:00
117 brigade -gained weight-: what tanks are capable of on the modern battlefield	Spoiler alert: From point-blank fire to an evacuation vehicle, tanks can do just about anything. The chief of staff of the 117th separate heavy mechanized brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Oleksandr Shaptala, told ArmiyaInform about the role of tanks in modern warfare and the unique tank operation to evacuate soldiers from positions half-surrounded by the enemy. Tanks, as a means of maneuvering combat and powerful fire damage to the enemy, have shown high efficiency during modern warfare. In interaction with mechanized units, they are used both during offensive actions and in defense. — We have widely used tanks where the enemy is conducting offensive actions in the direction we are in. It was thanks to the tank units that we effectively restrained the enemy's offensive and inflicted maximum damage on him with the help of tanks, going into direct fire, Oleksandr Shaptala says. The military is convinced that, despite the development of anti-tank weapons that damage tanks, heavy tracked gun armored personnel carriers have not lost their importance and can and should continue to be used on the battlefield, as they provide effective and tangible support for infantry who are on the offensive or on the defensive. . - During defensive operations, they are used as a general military reserve, as armored groups that go to the border for direct fire and deter the enemy, reducing the pace of his offensive actions and completely stopping his advance - explains the main role of tanks on the modern battlefield. This led to the reformation of the 117th brigade into a heavy mechanized one with an increase in the weight of the tank component in the compound. At the same time, it is not just about a simple increase in the number of tanks, but also about new approaches to the use of armored fighting vehicles on a tracked chassis based on the challenges of the modern battlefield. Tanks are mainly used for direct fire after a quick and unexpected exit to the line of fire by the enemy. Instead, they try to resort to fire from closed firing positions less often. — We don't have as much ammunition to fire tanks as we do artillery. That's why we try to use tanks for direct fire as much as possible, because it gives a hundred percent hit, - explains Oleksandr Shaptala. Shooting from closed fire positions is also possible, as it provides a level of damage to targets commensurate with high-precision artillery fire. However, taking into account the resource of the crew, the gun barrel and the amount of ammunition, it is more profitable to use the tank not as a substitute for artillery, but for the direct purpose of an armored vehicle. - Using a tank for direct fire is much more effective than from closed fire positions. So, if possible, when the enemy already discovers our routes of advance for direct fire, we try to use tanks to fire from closed firing positions. But direct fire remains the most effective, the officer emphasizes. At the same time, the chief of staff notes, it is important not only to perform a combat mission, but also to preserve military equipment and, especially, the crew. Therefore, when planning operations, they try to take into account all hazards and avoid excessive risks. Among the main threats to tanks, the military mentions UAVs, barrage munitions and anti-tank guided missiles. The biggest problem of all is kamikaze FPV drones. You can effectively protect tanks from them by installing powerful EW devices that cover a wide range of frequencies and protective grids. — The tank saves, first of all, the -scalds- that the repair and restoration units of the regiments, our repair and restoration battalion, do on their own. It is very effective. First, it is necessary to cover the engine compartment, and secondly, to cover the space between the body of the machine and the tower, the military calls the most vulnerable places of the armored vehicle. However, at the same time, he emphasizes, one should not lose such advantages of the tank as speed, maneuverability and the ability to fire in any direction due to the rotation of the turret. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible to abuse -burning- by building real -sheds-, -barbecues- or -garages- on the tank, like the Russians. — If it is done correctly, and not as the butchers do it. They will wind around the tank there so that the tank can just drive straight and shoot straight. And our equipment is so -boiled- that the tank moves and the tank turret rotates 360 degrees, it can fire in any direction. The enemy doesn't do that, the officer explains. Currently, the enemy uses tanks primarily as a vehicle to deliver infantry as close as possible to the battle line during assault operations. This makes enemy armored vehicles ineffective and vulnerable on the battlefield. The officer reminds that protective grilles are by no means the latest invention for the protection of armored vehicles. Installation of them on armored vehicles was resorted to already in the days of ATO/OOS, but then they were intended to counter rocket-propelled grenade launchers. — This appeared for the first time, probably back in 2014, when armored personnel carriers and BMPs were -boiled- with these -barbecues-, let's call them that, so that when the enemy's grenade launchers inflicted fire damage with RPG cumulative shells, the cumulative would work earlier. That's why it started back in the 14th year, says Oleksandr Shaptala. With the proliferation of FPV drones, protective grids have also proven effective against a new weapon. After 2022, when kamikaze aerial drones and UAVs with dropouts first appeared, and then became widespread, the well-known -boiling- of armored vehicles was the first response that the military resorted to. — But it must be done so intelligently so that the equipment does not lose its combat capabilities, so that even in this form it can be used for its original purpose, the officer emphasizes. The Ukrainians succeed, he continues, but the Russians have reached a dead end in this regard. Their solutions to protect mostly obsolete armored vehicles are not effective on the battlefield, as they fail to protect armored vehicles and at the same time deprive it of important advantages in maneuverability and greatly limit its capabilities as a means of infantry fire support. However, the military officer notes, it is not necessary to underestimate the enemy, because in other spheres the occupiers manage to achieve an advantage, not so much thanks to innovative development, but due to the scaling and building up of ideas and solutions that they have spied on and borrowed from the Ukrainians. — All the products that were made by Ukrainians, inventions, innovative technologies - everything is completely picked up by the enemy and built up in itself. At the beginning of a full-scale invasion, he had the advantage in shells, the advantage in people. He still has an advantage in shells and people. But he realized that at the rate he was losing it, he needed to catch up with our innovations, the military man explains. At the beginning of a large-scale invasion, the enemy had practically none of the inventions that are now common on the battlefield - FPV drones, UAV-bombers with drops, electronic warfare equipment to protect equipment, etc. Now the Russians have made significant progress and have even begun to overtake the Ukrainians in certain issues. This applies, for example, to the appearance and mass distribution of FPV drones on fiber optics, against which EW devices are powerless. — The problem with optical fibers is that they do not work from a radio signal, and EW does not affect this. The signal is transmitted through an optical fiber and the drone flies as far as the coil can reach. It can be up to 6-10 kilometers, says the soldier. The already mentioned protective grids are capable of protecting against kamikaze drones on fiber optics. The Ukrainian military is also beginning to actively implement this innovation, so the enemy is quickly losing its advantage in this means of defeat. Returning to the topic of tanks, the officer tells about a unique evacuation operation, during which tankers broke through to the semi-circled positions of the Ukrainian military and rescued four soldiers, including a wounded company commander. — The tank, driving into the settlement, evacuated four people, including the company commander, who had a bullet wound. They effectively drove in, took people, left, covered themselves with smoke, provided help with artillery so that the enemy's artillery was also suppressed, - says the Chief of Staff. Therefore, Ukrainian tankers not only hit the enemy with direct fire in maneuver defense and offensive, but also can, if necessary, carry out evacuation measures and rescue fighters on the front line. - Our tank crews, I believe, are real rexes. They are going to the end and they have a lot of experience in the Zaporizhzhia direction, in the Pokrovsky direction, Oleksandr Shaptala notes. — So when was the decision made to evacuate by tank. The tank entered the firing line, inflicted fire damage on the enemy, drove right up to our guys, the guys picked up the company commander and three men directly on the tank, on the armor and left under the smoke. The evacuation took place at night under conditions of limited visibility and intense fire contact with the enemy, but thanks to careful planning and the extraordinary courage and skill of the tank crew, it was successful. Because in the hands of experienced professionals and under competent command, tanks can do almost anything on the battlefield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/28/117-brygada-nabrala-vagy-na-shho-spromozhni-tanky-na-suchasnomu-poli-boyu/	2024-12-27T20:48:42-08:00
MLRS is a priority: what are the latest missile systems ordered by the Republic of Korea army	As state the authors of the South Korean portal DealSite, the local defense corporation Hanwha Aerospace signed a contract for 342.3 billion won (approximately $245 million) with the Defense Acquisition Program Administration of the Republic of Korea (DAPA) for the third stage of mass production of the K239 Chunmoo missile complex, reports ArmyInform. The contract represents 3.7% of Hanwha's annual sales for the previous year and runs through 2026. This phase involves the production of Chunmoo launchers and ammunition vehicles to replace aging systems in the South Korean military, such as the American M270 MLRS delivered to Seoul in 1998, which are nearing the end of their service life. The K239 Chunmoo, designed to replace the K136 Guryong, is a self-propelled multiple rocket launcher, capable, as at one time noted our editorial, fire with different types of ammunition. Among them are 230 mm unguided missiles with a range of 45 kilometers and 239 mm guided missiles with a range of 80 kilometers. The system can also use larger missiles, such as a 400 mm model with a range of 200 kilometers and a 600 mm missile called the CTM290 capable of reaching targets 290 kilometers away. Guided munitions include cluster warheads for 300 bombs and high-explosive fragmentation warheads designed to penetrate bunkers. These functions provide flexibility in the operational use of projectiles. The Chunmoo launcher is mounted on an 8×8 wheeled chassis designed by Doosan Infracore. The vehicle has a 450 horsepower engine, Run-Flat tires and digital fire control systems. The combat platform is designed for mobility, allowing it to engage targets and quickly redeploy to avoid counter-battery fire. Reloading is facilitated by interchangeable missile blocks, which allows for a firing configuration of up to 12 missiles per launcher. The ammunition transport vehicle, which uses a single chassis, can carry up to four missile units, which simplifies logistics operations. The Ministry of Defense has not disclosed the exact number of K239 Chunmoo MLRS installed under the contract by South Korea. However, according to analysts of the defense portal Army Recognition, it is expected that 218 to 367 units will be purchased. As of 2024, South Korea's multiple rocket launcher (MSR) fleet includes approximately 40 K136 Guryongs equipped with 130 mm rockets, 58 M270 MLRS systems using 227 mm rockets (48 standard M270 units and 10 upgraded M270A1 ), and approximately 200 systems K239 Chunmoo configured for 239 mm rockets. The system has been in service with South Korea's military since 2015 and is part of its efforts to modernize its artillery capabilities. Each battalion operating Chunmoo systems has 18 launchers. The platform is integrated into South Korea's Kill Chain pre-emptive strike defense scheme, which is designed to counter potential threats. The Chunmoo fire control system includes GPS-assisted INS guidance, which provides a 15-meter circular error probability for guided missiles. Chunmoo is also exported. 12 systems and vehicles were delivered to the United Arab Emirates under a confidential agreement. Saudi Arabia also acquired the system, deploying it during Yemen's civil war, reportedly against Houthi positions. According to the 2022 agreement, Poland is to receive 290 systems localized as Homar-K, which combine Polish command systems and domestic chassis. These complexes are equipped with Korean guided missiles and tactical ballistic missiles. Development of the K-239 Chunmoo began in 2009, and the system entered service in 2015. It was developed as a replacement for the K136 Kooryong and incorporates technological advances such as electric cylinders for rapid response and reloading. The Chunmoo has been continuously upgraded, including extended-range guided missiles and tactical ballistic missiles aimed at further increasing range and versatility. This third production phase reflects ongoing efforts to modernize artillery units in South Korea and meet changing operational requirements. It also highlights Chunmoo's role in regional security and its growing presence in international defense markets. K239 Chunmoo MLRS installation.

In Russia, anti-aircraft fire shoots down Santa and an Azerbaijani plane: it seems that the propagan...	After that, the racist Santa Claus comments on this: -we don't need anything foreign.- The essence of this -masterpiece-, bordering on schizophrenia, is -let's hit damned Western values ​​(it's the same Santa Claus) with an anti-aircraft missile.- Although maybe it's not just about values? By a very strange coincidence, the appearance of the video coincided with the downing by Russian anti-aircraft defense of the Azerbaijan Airlines plane, which the Russians wanted to sink in the Caspian Sea, not giving permission for an emergency landing after the incident. Rosavia cynically stated that the plane was unable to land in Grozny due to fog, and the pilot allegedly refused to land at other nearby airports and allegedly made an independent decision to fly to Kazakhstan. And the users of Russian publics are frankly happy about what has happened: -less churk is more of a good thing-&#8230; Meanwhile, propaganda launched a version about the downing of the plane allegedly by a -Ukrainian drone-, trying to shift the responsibility for the actions of the Russian air defense to Ukraine. But while the Kremlin propaganda machine tries with all its might to justify itself with the help of -alternative facts- and pseudo-analytics, the world understands everything correctly. The Azerbaijani airline, whose plane failed to land in Grozny and crashed in Kazakhstan's Aktau, announced the suspension of flights to seven Russian cities from December 28: Mineralnye Vody, Sochi, Volgograd, Ufa, Samara, Grozny and Makhachkala. It also became known about the cancellation of the Qazaq Air flight on the Astana-Yekaterinburg route until the end of January 2025 for security reasons, and about the suspension of flights to Moscow by the Israeli airline El Al. It is difficult to think of a better advertisement for refusing to fly to Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/28/u-rosiyi-ppo-zbyvaye-santu-i-azerbajdzhanskyj-litak-zdayetsya-propagandysty-perestaralysya/	2024-12-27T20:12:55-08:00
6 tanks and BMP each — the defeat of a powerful assault by the Russians in the Klishchiivka area	The video of the battle was released on December 27 on the brigade's channel. Kholodnoyartsi, together with neighboring units, repelled one of the most large-scale assaults in recent times in the Bakhmut direction. One and a half dozen heavy vehicles and up to three platoons of attack aircraft - that's how the Russian occupiers went to the brigade's position in the area of ​​the village of Klishchiivka. The forces of the Cold War soldiers, in cooperation with their comrades from neighboring units, succeeded in defeating the enemy and holding their positions. The offensive took place in two directions at once. From heavy equipment, the enemy used BMP-2 and T-72 tanks. However, with the joint efforts of the crews of the Black Raven unmanned systems battalion, the 2nd and 3rd mechanized battalions, supported by artillery, the enemy was completely defeated. The result of the brilliant work of the Cold War soldiers, which lasted about four hours, was the destruction of 6 T-72 tanks and 6 BMP-2 tanks. Another tank was damaged. Enemy manpower losses are being refined. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the Black Raven 93 unit of the mechanized brigade -Cold Ravine- hit the occupiers, who were going to our positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/27/po-6-tankiv-ta-bmp-rozgrom-potuzhnogo-shturmu-rosiyan-v-rajoni-klishhiyivky/	2024-12-27T11:57:06-08:00

There may be several reasons for this. First, they tried to launch classic attacks: in columns, they created armored -fists-. They lost a lot of equipment, a lot. And after that, we don't see the technique anymore. Maybe they don't have it left, or maybe they realized that it's not worth attacking like that anymore,- said Serhiy Dibrov.

- The North Koreans kill their own so that they do not get captured - - the President	The President announced this in his address on December 27. -Donetsk directions are the toughest, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Kharkiv region. Details regarding Kurshchyna — battles with the participation of the North Korean military. They have many losses. Very. And we see that the Russian military and North Korean supervisors are not at all interested in the survival of these Koreans. Everything in them is done in such a way that it is impossible for us to capture the Koreans: they are killing their own people, there are such facts,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. According to him, the Russians send the North Koreans to the assaults so that they have a minimum of protection. -Today there were reports about several soldiers from North Korea. Our soldiers managed to capture them. But they were very badly injured, and they could not be resuscitated. This is one of the manifestations of the madness that dictatorships are capable of,- the President said. . In his opinion, the Korean people should not lose their people in the battles in Europe. -And this can be influenced, in particular, by Korea's neighbors, in particular China.

The head of the communications department of the 21st mechanized brigade, Captain Serhiy Dibrov, told on the ArmyTV stream about this. -Somehow people behave strangely. They walk one after the other, like in a kindergarten with a teacher. They follow each other in a chain, and move around. They are very afraid to be left alone. If they rest, they huddle together very tightly around a fire or a tent. This strange behavior is compounded by the fact that these people have never seen drones and do not know what to do if -Baba Yaga- is buzzing nearby. Russians quickly run away in such cases, and they just look at the sky in surprise,- said Serhiy Dibrov. According to him, on average, the new enemies are shorter than the Russians. These differences give reason to conclude that these are North Korean mercenaries of the Russians.

The occupiers force Ukrainian children to take an oath to Russia and prepare them to participate in ...	informs about this on December 27, the Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine for human rights, Dmytro Lubinets. According to him, in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, Russia continues to violate the rights of children, turning them into tools of propaganda and war. Children are forced to take an -oath of loyalty- to Russia, promise to -protect its interests- and -foster great patriotism.- After that, they are taught fire and tactical training, drone control. -These youth movements are used by Russia as a tool for violently re-educating Ukrainian children, depriving them of their national identity and preparing them to participate in a war against their own country. This is a gross violation of international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions!- - says the message. Dmytro Lubinets noted that, according to them, children are guaranteed protection from coercion, violence and involvement in military formations in the temporarily occupied territories. -I call on the international community to take decisive action: strengthen sanctions, intensify diplomatic pressure and draw attention to Russia's crimes! We will never stop fighting for the rights of children who have suffered from Russian aggression.

The Ministry of Defense explained how coalitions of partner states strengthen the Defense Forces of ...	About this reported on December 27 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. In September 2023, the format of providing international aid to Ukraine was transformed into the so-called -Ramstein 2.0-. This means that Ukraine's allies move to providing military aid mainly not on a bilateral basis, but in the activities of the respective coalitions. Their goal is to strengthen coordination, systematization and, as a result, increase the volume of international military aid. All needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in weapons, military equipment and personnel training are divided into 8 directions of coalitions:• aviation capabilities;• sea capabilities;• integrated air and missile defense;• artillery;• armored vehicles and maneuverability;• drones;• mining;• IT. Each coalition was headed by the leader countries that coordinate their work. At the same time, some allies assumed leading commitments in several coalitions at once. For example, the United States is the leader of the Air Capability Coalition and the Artillery Coalition, France - the Integrated Air Defense and Missile Defense Coalition and the Artillery Coalition, Germany - the Armored and Maneuverable Coalition and the Integrated Missile Defense and Missile Defense Coalition, Great Britain - the Maritime Capability Coalition and the Drone Coalition. Also, the leading countries in various coalitions became: Denmark, Estonia, Italy, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Poland. Priorities remain: The Drone Coalition has involved 16 countries working in the field of unmanned systems. The IT coalition, which provides communication tools, software solutions and computer equipment, has united 14 countries. The Demining Coalition has 21 countries that focus on military and humanitarian demining. Efforts to attract new countries to participate in coalitions are ongoing. France, in addition to chairing the aforementioned coalitions, joined 5 more initiatives. The Czech Republic and Spain also became members of 6 coalitions, in particular the Coalition of Integrated Air Defense and ABM. Denmark, Belgium and Sweden joined 5 coalitions, including the Air Capability Coalition. The ultimate goal of all coalitions is to provide the fighters of the defense forces of Ukraine on the front line with Western equipment and weapons. In addition, working in coalitions involves strengthening interoperability with NATO, which brings us closer to membership in the Alliance. As reported by ArmyInform, the IT coalition for Ukraine accumulated 482 million euros in 2024.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/27/u-minoborony-poyasnyly-yak-koalicziyi-derzhav-partneriv-posylyuyut-syly-oborony-ukrayiny/	2024-12-27T04:03:41-08:00

Transferred from a tractor to a tank -Nadyukha-: how a mechanic-driver who grew champignons -tamed- ...	ArmyInform spoke with the serviceman when the brigade was taken out for recovery after more than a year in the active combat zone. In December 2022, he joined the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. He first mastered work on the T-72 tank, and then went to study in Germany, where he got to know the Leopard 1A5 tanks. Originally from Cherkassy. 48 years old. He had military service behind him. -I learned about technology in civilian life - that's how I switched from a tractor to a tank,- the interlocutor says with a smile. But, recalling his civilian life, he notes with nostalgia: — And he also grew champignons in boxes for sale. That was my main income, I had about 20 thousand every month, - Stepan shares. Studying in Germany lasted one and a half months. Understanding with foreign instructors and the teaching level is at a high level, the interlocutor states and adds: - Before that, we traveled on the -72s-. And when they switched to Leopard, it was as if they switched to a foreign car! I liked it. Better in operation. Worked comfortably. There was nothing complicated. After training in Germany, immediately to the area of ​​combat missions, to the Kupyan direction, it was September 2023. The most difficult thing, Stepan recalls, was when the positions were shelled with a 120-caliber mortar: - We went to work, we worked. Only the dugouts were approached - and they began to cover us. Not far away, two meters away, there were 20 parishes. You are sitting, your heart is pounding, the dugout is shaking. Stepan continues to share his memories: — Once, when we were leaving for the position, we were heavily covered. It was in the summer of 2024. We exchanged -Nadyukha- in the Kupyansk direction. Mostly they worked from closed positions. The sky was almost clear. But as soon as they left, -Lancet- immediately arrived. Everything worked out. But from half past five in the morning to 4:30 p.m., we crawled along the landing. A total of 12 hours, - says Stepan about one of the difficult departures. And the most delicious practice against the enemy was on November 7, 2024 - they repelled an enemy counterattack. — From 5:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., six units worked, one after the other. We didn't even have time to serve the -zucchini-. But they fought back. And they did not go further. Then, during two weeks, the total consumption of ammunition was 222 shells. It is a lot, very much&#8230; Fortunately, there were no losses to the crew of the tank with which Stepan works. I ask what is the secret of such survivability of the crew. The military man answers succinctly: - We understand each other, we work harmoniously. Or maybe it's just flattered&#8230; After a year and two months of rotation in the area of ​​combat missions, the brigade is on a well-deserved rest, assigned to recovery. Stepan calls it succinctly: -you are going to fresh land.- The military man managed to spend a few days at home, in his native Cherkasy region. — Most of all during the war, I wanted to see my family&#8230; My youngest child turns four on January 3. Daughter Ulya, - Stepan says warmly. Meanwhile, I realize that this man joined the Defense Forces when the child was only a year old. Stepan is the father of three children. He has two sons — 28-year-old Volodymyr and 13-year-old Oleksandr. -And there's Alina, I'm already a grandfather,- the serviceman smiles. Traditionally, we ask what a serviceman would advise civilians who, for various reasons, did not join the ranks of the Defense Forces. He answers as follows: -If everyone left now, as we left then, instead of hiding in bars, then we would have already won this war,- the army man says with sadness in his voice, but states that the army needs both people and equipment . In the end, the military man recalls the most difficult and the most frightening sortie, his first sortie in the Svativ region: - The order came to work out the enemy's position, which was in the shape of the letter Z. They dug in there - we had to cover them. They drove in, covered up, drove back. And then it was very scary. I can't stand it and ask: - And what helped you fight, in the end, with this fear? — -Our Father.- I read the prayer and drove on. - he says with a smile.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/27/peresiv-z-traktora-na-tank-nadyuha-yak-mehanik-vodij-yakyj-vyroshhuvav-shampinjony-pryruchyv-leopard/	2024-12-26T20:55:56-08:00
The weapon of victory. What is known about BBM -Dozor-: about the evolution of domestic armored vehi...	Currently, the fleet of specialized special vehicles of the Defense Forces of Ukraine includes armored vehicles of both foreign and domestic production. About the history of the creation of two of them - the Dozor BBM family and the updated version of the Oncilla armored personnel carrier, which was recently codified and put into operation by the Ministry of Defense, about which reported ArmyInform, the correspondent asked a researcher of military equipment and weapons, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the department of humanitarian sciences of the National Academy of Ground Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny Andrii Haruk. — Indeed, Andrii Ivanovich, it seems paradoxical to a certain extent, but while producing powerful tanks and the world's largest aircraft, the Ukrainian SSR could not boast of mass production of wheeled vehicles for the Soviet army. Well, we can only recall the LuAZ-967M amphibious vehicles manufactured at the Lutsk Automobile Plant, a kind of relatives of the civilian -Volyn girls-, which in the Soviet army witty jokers called -BMW- - -Volyn combat vehicles-. - The situation began to change after the collapse of the USSR and the restoration of Ukraine's independence. Already in the 90s, using the technical documentation of the BTR-80 wheeled armored personnel carrier, improved BTR-94 and BTR-3 armored personnel carriers were created. But the development of light wheeled armored vehicles had to be started from scratch. The state of affairs was simplified by the presence of a powerful design center in Ukraine — the Kharkiv Design Bureau of Mechanical Engineering named after O.O. Morozova (HKBM). Here, in the early 2000s, the design of a family of special-purpose vehicles for both the military and civilian sectors began. At the same time, two options were created: a multi-purpose non-armored vehicle for dual purposes for civilian and military use (-Dozor-A-) and a military armored vehicle (-Dozor-B-). — And how much time passed from the design idea to the presentation of the prototype? How original were they? — The first demonstration samples of Dozor-A and Dozor-B were first demonstrated in Kyiv at the exhibition -Weapons and Security - 2004- in October 2004. Parts of the BTR-80 suspension were used in their design, but in all other respects the machines were completely original. -Dozor-A- was demonstrated as a pick-up truck with a four-door cabin designed for 5 people and a cargo platform that could carry 2 tons of cargo or 6 people. In the roof of the cabin there was a hatch on which a machine gun could be installed. The curb weight of the equipped car was 3.5 tons. Three engine options were offered — diesels with a power of 122, 136 and 197 hp. The maximum speed of the four-wheel drive car reached 120 km/h. On the Dozor-A base, it was proposed to create a whole series of special purpose vehicles - police, collector, sanitary, technical assistance vehicle, etc., as well as trucks with a carrying capacity from 2 to 6 tons. But Dozor-A never found buyers. But -Dozor-B- developed further, and its evolution before the start of production lasted 10 years. — And in what, Professor, did it consist? Reveal the details. — From a technical point of view, Dozor-B is a two-axle all-wheel drive armored car with a hood layout. Its body is divided into two compartments: engine and transmission and crew. The motor-transmission compartment is located in the front part of the case. It houses the engine with its service systems, the transmission, the main steering elements, the braking system, as well as elements of the air conditioning and heating systems of the crew compartment. The crew compartment occupies the central and aft parts of the hull. In front of it are the driver's and commander's workplaces, behind them - the gunner's workplace, and in the stern - a landing compartment designed for 6 people. The hull has two side doors (for the driver and commander. — Ed.) and one aft door (for the landing party. — Ed.). In the front wall of the hull there are windows made of armored glass, and in the sides of the landing compartment there are six embrasures for firing from small arms. Airborne soldiers have periscopes to observe the battlefield. - And how did the designers take care of the protection of the crew and paratroopers? - The Dozoru-B hull is made of Polish-made Armstall 500 armor steel. It protects against armor-piercing small arms bullets fired from a distance of 30 m, as well as fragments of a 152-mm high-explosive projectile from a distance of 50 m. From the inside, the armored case is additionally reinforced with several layers of Kevlar. Armored window glass provides the same level of protection as the body. The bottom of the case has a rounded shape, which increases protection in the event of a mine detonation. However, in general, the level of anti-mine protection of -Dozor-B- does not fully meet modern requirements. The armored car is equipped with a filter ventilation unit, air conditioning and a heating system. - Now it's logical to move on to the propulsion system. What engine is installed on this BBM? - The engine is a four-stroke four-cylinder liquid-cooled Deutz BF 4M 1013 FC 190 hp diesel. The gearbox is a hydromechanical five-speed automatic Allison LCT 1000. Problems with the supply of engines from the German company Deutz led to the search for alternative options for the power plant. Five engine options were considered, but in the end, all manufactured Dozor-B armored cars were equipped with Deutz diesels. The armored car was equipped with a R-173M radio station, an AVSK-1 intercom, and SN-3003 -Basalt- satellite navigation equipment. — You already mentioned above that the evolution of these transport platforms continued for a decade. What did it consist of? - The first version of Dozor-B, known as the -B1320 package-, appeared in 2004. In 2007, it was displayed at the IDEX-2007 exhibition in Abu Dhabi. The armored car was actively offered for export, but no buyers were found. In 2014-2015, -Dozor-B- was created in the second version - -B1320-1/B1320А assembly-. It is distinguished by a rearranged landing compartment (the capacity of the machine has increased from 9 to 10 people), a more powerful winch (6800 kg instead of 4100 kg), the presence of boxes for tools, spare parts and personal belongings of the crew on the sides of the body, increased from 146 to 180 l fuel tank capacity , the presence of a smoke curtain installation system, an automatic fire extinguishing system, an updated satellite system CH-3003M navigation system, Polish-made radio station and other improvements. —A combat vehicle cannot be unarmed. What options were offered to potential customers? — For Dozor-B, about ten weapon options were offered, some of which were actually tested, and some of which existed only on paper. The variant with a remote-controlled installation with a 12.7-mm NSVT-12.7 machine gun (or its Ukrainian -clone- KT-12.7), created on the basis of the commander's turret of the T-64A tank, was considered basic. The device has a PZU-7 periscopic monocular sight. The range of vertical aiming angles of the machine gun is from −3 to 68°. The ammunition includes 450 bullets (three tapes of 150 bullets). A simpler alternative was the installation of a 30-mm automatic grenade launcher KBA-117 (Ukrainian copy of AGS-17) on the turret. Two variants of remote-controlled Blik modules were tested on Dozor-B. At the ADEX-2014 exhibition, which took place in September 2014 in Baku, an armored car with the Blik-2 module armed with a 12.7-mm machine gun, a 30-mm automatic grenade launcher and 81-mm smoke grenade launchers was demonstrated. And in the spring of 2016, at the SOFEX-2016 exhibition in Amman, Dozor-B was shown with the Blik-2M module, which, in addition to the machine gun and automatic grenade launcher, also has the Korsar ATGM launcher. Another version of the remote-controlled module was the Cyborg ABM with a 12.7-mm machine gun and a 40-mm UAG-40 automatic grenade launcher. — As far as I know, the developers of these machines offered quite interesting and original solutions for their weapons. What did they consist of? — A rather interesting weapon option proposed for Dozor-B was the Viy module with a 23-mm twin-barreled GSH-23L aviation cannon (ammunition set of 250 shells) and an optical television sight OTS- 20.01. In February 2021, there were reports of the design of a tank destroyer based on the -Dozoru-B- base. It was supposed to be armed with the -Bar'er- ATGM (unified by the RK-2S and RK-2OF missiles with the portable -Stugna- ATGM). The ammunition of ten missiles was located in two drums. The drums were recharged through hatches in the sides of the machine. The two-charge launcher in the firing position was placed inside the hull, and in the combat position it was raised through a hatch in the roof. As far as is known, this tank destroyer did not leave the project stage. Instead, another missile system based on Dozor-B was embodied in metal. In the summer of 2021, a prototype of the -Speka- light jet flamethrower system was demonstrated. It uses rockets with a thermobaric warhead, and the principle of operation is similar to the Russian -Buratino- and -Solntsepek- systems, but it is much lighter than them. RS-122TB projectiles were created by the State Joint Stock Holding Company -Artem-. This 122 mm caliber projectile is 1450 mm long, has a starting mass of 28.5 kg (the warhead weighs 11.5 kg) and a firing range of 7 km. The State Enterprise -Shepetiv Repair Plant- became the integrator of the system. In the -Dozoru-B- building, which has no roof, a swivel cabinet with a package of guides for 10 RS-122TB shells was installed. A large hatch was made in the rear wall of the case, through which rockets are loaded and powder gases are released during firing. Under the aft part of the hull, two outriggers are added, which ensure the stability of the machine in the firing position. Potentially, the Dozoru-B chassis could also be used for other special purpose vehicles. In particular, in 2021, it was considered as a base for placing elements of the Obolon-A artillery battery (division) automated control complex.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/27/zbroya-peremogy-shho-vidomo-pro-bbm-dozor-pro-evolyucziyu-vitchyznyanyh-avtopanczernykiv/	2024-12-26T20:38:39-08:00
Destroys historical monuments, but blames Ukraine: a fake Russian video from UNESCO is circulating o...	However, UNESCO did not publish such a video on its official resources. And Mehtilda Ressler, who is no longer the director of the World Heritage Center, has never made such a statement. As it turned out, the video was created from content from open sources, which tells about something completely different. In addition, the acting governor of the Kursk region Khinshtein said that on December 22, as a result of rocket attacks in Rylsk, 17 objects of cultural heritage were damaged, accusing the Armed Forces of Ukraine. However, the extent of the damage that Hinstein says is actually minimal, and the circumstances of its occurrence remain unconfirmed. Contrary to these statements, Russia is actively destroying Ukrainian cultural heritage. As of December 2024, 1,222 damaged monuments in 18 regions were recorded in Ukraine. In November, Russia carried out 43 new attacks on historical and cultural monuments, in particular in Zaporizhzhia, Odesa and Khmelnytskyi regions. In the Kharkiv region, for example, the enemy damaged 322 such objects, in the Kyiv region and the city of Kyiv — 81. The most recent case was the shelling of the Mykolaiv Church in Kyiv on December 20. Ukraine insists on an international investigation of these acts of cultural vandalism, which is a violation of international law. Russia spreads this kind of misinformation for several reasons. First, in this way, the aggressor country is trying to shift the focus from the destruction it is causing to Ukrainian cultural heritage, to blaming Ukraine. This helps create the illusion of moral equality between the aggressor and the victim. Hostile propaganda appeals to emotions, using themes of cultural and spiritual heritage to mobilize support among its own population. Such disinformation justifies Russia's aggressive actions as -protection- of its historical and spiritual heritage. With such messages, Agitprop also wants to raise doubts in the international community about the credibility of Ukrainian accusations of war crimes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/27/rujnuye-pamyatky-istoriyi-ale-zvynuvachuye-ukrayinu-v-merezhi-gulyaye-rosijske-fejkove-video-vid-yunesko/	2024-12-26T20:19:18-08:00

The enemy is planning a propaganda campaign on the anniversary of the Yalta Conference	This is reported by a> Center of national resistance. For this purpose, the Russians plan to involve their agents of influence in the world, who, by their presence at these actions, should shape the image of the Russian Federation as a country that is the main fighter against Nazism. In such a narrative, the current fascist Russian Federation itself can determine who is a -Nazi- in the world, and this allegedly gives it the right to invade other sovereign states. In February, the Russians are planning a telecast in honor of the anniversary of the conference in Yalta. The telebridge should take place between the studios and Simferopol and the studios in Great Britain, France and the USA. On it, the occupiers plan to spread messages about Nazism in Ukraine and that the modern world order is outdated.

At the same time, the police were presented with a plan, which is 10% of all detainees in the region. It is in this way that the enemy plans to carry out the plan for mobilization on the TOT, because at the moment the plans have failed due to the reluctance of the locals to serve in the army of the occupier.

In this way, Moscow wants to increase the Russian Federation's competitiveness in order to expand sales markets and minimize the impact of Western sanctions. And by lowering the prices of goods, the Kremlin is trying to increase the dependence of African countries on Russian imports. Russia resorts to similar methods when it helps some countries of the continent to implement nuclear programs, turning these projects into a long-term dependence on Moscow's help. Subsidies can become part of broader agreements, which will include logistics investments, trade development, etc. Most likely, it is about countries that already have close ties with the Russian Federation due to the long-term presence of Russian mercenaries (CAR, Mali, Burkina Faso), and about states with respect to which the Russian Federation is taking another step towards rapprochement (Algeria, South Africa, Egypt and others).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/stalo-vidomo-dlya-chogo-rf-zaprovadzhuye-pilgy-dlya-pereviznykiv-produkcziyi-v-afryku/	2024-12-26T08:33:07-08:00

The investigation established numerous facts of the senior lieutenant's use of non-statutory measures of influence over his subordinates. In particular, in the last days of February 2024 in Dnipro Oblast, he beat a soldier because he was intoxicated. Having been kicked in the face, the officer did not calm down and ordered his subordinates to bring the drunken soldier into the room and strip him to humiliate him. -After that, the officer continued to beat the subordinate. A month later, while already in Avdiivka of the Donetsk region, the senior lieutenant beat the same soldier again and ordered the servicemen to lift the beaten man from the ground, place him on a wooden structure in the form of a cross, and tie his hands to it,- the SBI said. The latter was in this position for about four hours. Another case of a soldier being beaten was also recorded. This happened in February 2024 in Dnipro Oblast. The officer had a dispute with one of his subordinates due to the publication on the Internet of a video recording in which another soldier of this brigade talked about their improper living conditions. -After that, the senior lieutenant deliberately hit him in the face. Also, in May 2024 in Kharkiv Oblast, he beat another of his subordinates due to dissatisfaction with the form of addressing him as -you,- the report says. The investigation continues to establish other facts of violence against soldiers in the brigade. The senior lieutenant is suspected of the use of violence by a military official against a subordinate, committed under martial law conditions and of voluntarily leaving the unit (Part 5 of Article 426-1, Article 407 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). Currently, the officer is hiding from the investigation, after his arrest the investigators will forgive the court to send him to custody.

The latest development for the Armed Forces: The Ministry of Defense is testing the control point of...	About informs December 26 MoU. Among the requirements of the Ministry of Defense for the control center is maximum autonomy, equipping with modern means of communication and EW. The new model of equipment should provide control of units of unmanned systems under any weather conditions, both in stationary conditions and during movement. -The checkpoint cabin will be equipped with automated workplaces with an interactive panel. The commander will have the opportunity to quickly analyze the situation and promptly make decisions during the management of the units, which will increase the effectiveness of their use,- the statement said. The basis for this innovative development is planned to be a specialized vehicle with increased cross-country ability. An all-wheel drive car must solve the task of sufficient maneuverability and movement of the off-road control point. The stages of project implementation are supported by the Main Department of Defense Innovations of the Ministry of Defense. -Unmanned units have scaled up significantly and require specialized means of combat control. Domestic gunsmiths offered a technical solution to this request,- said the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Ivan Havryliuk. According to him, the new model of equipment will be tested and will be evaluated by commanders of combat units. -If the development meets the requirements, we will codify it and it will be able to go into serial production.

A cynical diversion scheme: the violators disguised themselves as a funeral cortege of a fallen sold...	This was reported by Western Regional Office of the State Border Service of Ukraine. The ferrying scheme was planned by two Transcarpathians living in the border region. For a monetary reward of $18,000, they undertook to deliver two residents of Uzhhorod to the border. The crossing of the state border was planned in the area of ​​Knyaginya settlement of Uzhhorod district. In order to transport the -clients- through the checkpoints, the shippers resorted to the most cynical plan. They pretended to be on their way as part of a funeral cortege that accompanied the body of a fallen soldier to the burial place. Offenders even hung a national flag from the window of the car in which the border violators were being transported. However, the tricks of the shippers were exposed. The operatives waited until the procession ended and began to arrest the offenders. During it, one of the smugglers did not comply with the legal demands of the law enforcement officers to stop and made an attempt to run into the border outfit. The -clients- of the dealer were thrown out of the car and ordered to run away. The response team, together with operatives, apprehended the fugitives and their smugglers and brought them to the border unit. In the actions of the shippers, they see signs of a criminal offense under Part 3 of Article 332 of the Criminal Code -Illegal transportation of persons across the state border of Ukraine.- The corresponding message was sent to the address of the Uzhhorod District Department of the National Police. They were also prosecuted under Article 185-10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure -Malicious disobedience to a lawful order or demand of a serviceman or an employee of the State Border Service of Ukraine or a member of a public organization for the protection of public order and the state border.- Both -clients- will have to answer to the law for attempting to illegally cross the state border. The court will make a decision in their case.

In the Russian Federation, inflationary processes are accelerating	reports this Service of foreign intelligence of Ukraine. Annual inflation is expected to peak in April 2025. We will remind that the October forecast of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation predicted inflation in 2024 in the range of 8–8.5%. At the same time, there is currently no inflation forecast from the regulator for 2025. Representatives of the Russian banking sector state that today the Russian economy is -developing in not quite normal conditions-: -We have large budget expenditures for defense, at least 30%, as well as a huge number of sanctions.- They also admit that the restrictions on the Russian Federation -complicate and make payments more expensive-, and the acceleration of inflation is associated with both the presence of a large money supply and the -increase in tariffs of natural monopolies-. Inflation rates (real inflation in Russia — 25–30%), as well as the lack of reaction of Russian banks to the decision of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation to maintain the discount rate, indicate a high probability of strengthening monetary policy by the Russian regulator as early as January 2025. However, any actions of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation will not save the Russian economy, since there are no more correct moves left. We remind you, employees of the State Bureau of Investigation reported about the suspicion of the director of an enterprise from Kryvyi Rih, which in 2023 supplied one of the military units with 20,000 sleeping bags of low quality.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/u-rf-pryskoryuyutsya-inflyaczijni-proczesy/	2024-12-26T01:52:27-08:00

Defense procurement from the Ministry of Defense: how the DOT-Chain system is changing the provision...	This is stated in messages MOU. In particular, significant work has been done to overcome the so-called -paper army- — redundant bureaucracy that takes away time and energy from the military. For this, the DOT IT department developed and implemented the DOT-Chain system from scratch. Currently, it operates in the field of providing the Armed Forces with food products. DOT-Chain has significantly accelerated and simplified processes for suppliers and the military, in particular: The system has a confirmation of compliance with the security level of KSZI. In addition, DOT is in the final stage of obtaining the ISO/IEC 27001 international information security certificate. -Digitalization does not just simplify processes — it radically changes approaches to the provision of our military. Thanks to modern technologies, such as the DOT-Chain system, we are already seeing concrete results today: reducing bureaucracy and improving the quality of service to the military. This allows the army to focus on the main thing - the defense of our state. Every hryvnia directed to the Armed Forces should work for our victory, and digital solutions are becoming our reliable ally in this direction,- said Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. Among the important achievements of the IT team, it is possible to single out the implementation of various accounting and document management systems, on the basis of which DOT is developing its own ERP system, as well as the development of infrastructure and information security systems. An important step was the implementation of ICS MOU SAP, which, together with other achievements, significantly improved the internal processes of DOT.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/oboronni-zakupivli-vid-minoborony-yak-systema-dot-chain-zminyuye-zabezpechennya-zsu/	2024-12-26T01:07:32-08:00

However, he notes the good professional level of work of their -politicians-. -They talk about the fact that Ukrainian captivity is the most terrible thing that can happen. About alleged torture and everything else. That is why it is very difficult to take prisoners,- said the spokesman of the Third Assault Brigade. Increasing the exchange fund is very difficult, he admits. Enemy infantry, fearing capture, often simply settle accounts with their lives. -Russian servicemen sometimes undermine themselves. That is, the internal propaganda work works for them. It is taken very seriously. Prisoners talk about it too. They tell how they are taught, how they are explained. Everything was done in order to minimize the number of prisoners on their side,- said Oleksandr Borodin. As reported ArmyInform, soldiers of the 80th Airborne Assault Brigade of the DSHV of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were captured four Russian soldiers in Kurshchyna, who shared their impressions of the Juche fighters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/profesijni-pozhyrachi-mizkiv-politruky-zhenut-rosiyan-v-ataky-i-zmushuyut-do-samogubstv/	2024-12-26T00:52:30-08:00

About this on the air of the TV channel -We are Ukraine- spoke the spokesman of the Military Captain of the 3rd rank of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Dmytro Pletenchuk. According to him, the enemy used at least two units from the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, which produced -Caliber-. -It is impossible to say that it came as a surprise. Because when ships go out to sea, you have to look at the sky. And given that you could see the preparations for the strike, it was logical that the ships would also be used in this case. We were ready for this,- Dmytro Pletenchuk assured. He said that the occupiers operate according to a similar scheme. They leave the base point in order to strike, and immediately turn back, under the cover of their air defense on the shore. -We should not forget about this danger. However, so far I have not seen any information about the successful use of Calibers. And I haven't seen her for a long time. Which, in principle, confirms the thesis that the main purpose of using this tool is to load Ukrainian air defense and nothing more,- summed up the spokesperson of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. How reported ArmyInform, as of the morning of December 26, there is one enemy ship in the Black Sea, which is a carrier of cruise missiles Caliber with a total salvo of up to 4 missiles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/u-vms-zsu-rozpovily-pro-taktyku-strilyaj-i-tikaj-rosijskogo-flotu-v-chornomu-mori/	2024-12-26T00:00:08-08:00

The video of the combat operation was released on December 26 on the channel of the 28th OMBr brigade. After unsuccessful attacks by small groups, the enemy changed tactics and decided to advance in groups of up to 20 people. But the only thing that has changed is the number of losses.

Live bait and shelters from artillery: the SSO told about the tactics of the North Koreans in Kurshc...	About this told in the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The next part of the records of Private Gyeong Hong Jong reveals quite interesting methods of combating Ukrainian drones and artillery used by the North Korean military. In the notebook of the North Korean special forces officer killed in Kurshchyna, he describes how to shoot down a Ukrainian drone alive. In his notebook, when he was still alive before the meeting with the SSO operators, private Hyong Hong Jong wrote down tactics for shooting down a UAV and hiding places from Ukrainian artillery. It is currently unknown whether this is an authentic North Korean tactic, or the Russians taught them that way. But this tactic uses live bait. The SSO presented a full transcript of another entry from the trophy notebook. The recording is completed with illustrations from a soldier of the SSO of the DPRK: How to eliminate a drone When detecting a drone, you need to create a trio (3 people), at the same time, the one who lures the drone keeps a distance of 7 meters, and those who shoot - 10-12 meters. If the one who is baiting stands, the drone will also stop its movement. At this moment, the one who shoots — eliminates (the drone). How to avoid the zone of artillery fire In case of getting into the zone of fire, after appointing the point of the next meeting (group), you need to diverge small groups and get out of the firing zone. Another way: since the artillery does not fire at the same point, you can hide at the point of (previous) hit, and then get out of the shelling zone. -35-naslidky-rankovogo-masovanogo-obstrilu-harkivshhyny/-> in the first part of the deciphered notebook, author — Hyong Hong Jong — wishes another soldier Song Ji Myung (or Yong) a happy birthday.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/zhyva-prymanka-i-hovanky-vid-artyleriyi-u-sso-rozpovily-pro-taktyku-pivnichnokorejcziv-na-kurshhyni/	2024-12-25T22:41:20-08:00

I will say that these systems are far from Bogdana in terms of firing accuracy. Weight - 28 tons, range on the highway - 800 km, cross-country - 300 km. The car is quite lively: on the highway - 80 km/h, on the field, of course, the speed is a little lower. When working at the positions on the self-propelled guns, it is mandatory to install the REBs. To counter the operation of enemy FPV drones. There are special mobile fire teams that are armed with anti-drone guns and -shooting guns-. Artobsluga also with small arms. And of course, camouflage and anti-lance nets. Somehow an unpleasant situation happened. Bogdana was attacked by more than 5 enemy kamikaze drones. The armored cabin of the ACS took the hits. The armor survived, the guys inside, of course, were contused, but they will remain alive. Our -SAUShka- withstands even an explosion on an anti-tank mine. Everything was fine with the crew that day, just an injury. In war, different things can happen, you have to be ready for everything. -Bohdana- is really very well protected by reservation. Katsap 203 mm -Peonies- inflicted fire damage on us with cluster shells. Yes, the car was cut into pieces, but nothing critical. Guys are alive and that's the main thing. How does a typical working day of a -Bohdana- ACS service ideally go? The coordinates of the target are received, the combat mission is recognized. The crew practices deploying to a firing position, aiming, firing, adjusting fire, firing, firing again if necessary, and then quickly collapsing and moving to a -hideout- or to another position. This is a clear algorithm of actions. These skills are extremely necessary for the calculations of self-propelled guns, because after shooting you need not to come under enemy counter-battery fire and safely leave the area of ​​the combat mission. The safety of the crew and the preservation of the -Bogdana- in a combat-ready condition is a priority. It usually takes two to three minutes for the crew to practice one combat mission and the artillery makes the first shot. Gunners assure that they can do it even faster. In general, the speed of the ACS is also its big advantage. In one incomplete year of combat work, the -Bohdana- self-propelled guns, near which gunners worked, fired more than 3,000 shots. At other installations, the number has already exceeded 2,000 in some parts. Like any other equipment, -Bohdana- can break down. The crew is not allowed to do any repair and restoration work. After all, self-propelled guns are covered by the manufacturer's certification guarantee. Therefore, all -repair manipulations- are carried out by the manufacturer's representatives in a safe and designated place. The crew only delivers the car from the positions. Again, so that no one knew about it, let alone saw it. One of the common technical malfunctions of the -Bohdana- is the wedge of the engine and the replacement of the operational rings on the gun. Electronics hangs sometimes. But the factory workers promptly repair everything so that the machine can return to combat work as soon as possible. Recruitment for the brigade is also currently underway. Therefore, every Ukrainian can join the team and work on a modern Ukrainian-made artillery installation. -The situation with replenishment of personnel is not simple. But recently we managed to attract several talented people to our battery. This became possible thanks to changes in the legislation. Since the fall, conscripts and volunteer reservists can choose a military unit for service without going to the territorial recruitment and social support centers. It certainly helped,- says Dmytro. — We are looking for purposeful people who can learn quickly. Here, on the spot, we will teach them the specifics of working on the -Bohdana- air defense system, there are training centers where the military will receive professional training.

Alone at the position for 36 hours in a row, he repelled enemy assaults: the story of a soldier of t...	How Dmytro single-handedly repelled enemy assaults for 36 hours in a row? But how does he assess the enemy's infantry? The soldier told our correspondent about this: &#8220;Before the army, I worked at a metallurgical plant in the Zaporizhzhia region. Since 2021, he served in the 79th Brigade. Participated in the OOS. And he also met a large-scale invasion in the composition of the 79s. At that time, our unit in the area of ​​the city of Shchastya was performing tasks. I was a MANPADS anti-aircraft gunner and a unit commander. By the way, a soldier from our branch shot down an enemy Su-25 after the start of the invasion. In 2024, I transferred to the Third Assault Brigade. &#8230;There was a case when our department was in position for almost three days. And it so happened that on the first day, the enemy fired at us continuously from barrel artillery, and everyone in the unit was wounded, except for me. One fighter, although he was badly injured, helped me jam enemy drones. And before those who were supposed to replace us came to the position, I had to run to the position myself. Simply put, you do not sleep or eat for 36 hours in a row. You are constantly told which way the enemy is coming from, and you move there, take a firing position and shoot back. The enemy did not stop firing artillery even as their assault group approached. So the katsaps also helped me kill their people. We also had enemy crews with droppers and FPVs working against us. And, of course, enemy infantry stormed us. During that time, they had seven 200s. Some of them managed to run up to a distance of 20 meters to our position. And the last hours before we were changed were very difficult. Already once at night, the batteries on the electronic devices ran out. But they were not fully discharged. &#8230;Artillery fire was coming at us continuously, about every minute a plane arrived. And all this for 3-4 hours, then it fell silent for half an hour and then again. They stopped at night. In principle, we are already used to artillery fire, but we are still adjusting to such a huge number of enemy drones. And their infantry began to storm us from dawn. That is, they accumulated at night, and at dawn they began to climb. That opponent was not too prepared. He had a lot of firearms, but he was just drafted, fresh, literally 2-3 weeks in the service. Their whole tactic was that they would get lost in a bunch and go to the position, hoping that we were all already dead. Those who stormed us were mostly 35-40 years old. &#8230;I will say this to Ukrainian men who are not yet in the army. This is the same reason why you can't roll away from a position. You can't, because the enemy will kill you in the back. So here: these men can come. Only no longer TCC, but Katsaps.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/sam-na-pozycziyi-36-godyn-pospil-vidbyvav-vorozhi-shturmy-istoriya-voyina-tretoyi-shturmovoyi-brygady/	2024-12-25T20:48:52-08:00
-Sea Tiger- sharpens its claws: the German Navy bets on the newest NH90 Sea Tiger helicopter	The phase included various operational scenarios and tests of the aircraft's mission system, including sonar, electro-optical surveillance and targeting systems, as well as weapons. -A total of over 140 flight hours have been logged over the past 11 months and all the helicopter's capabilities have been validated- - Airbus explained Helicopters regarding the course of the tests. According to data by the authors of Defense Post, in 2020, Germany ordered 31 NH90 Sea Tiger helicopters. The value of the contract was €2.7 billion ($2.89 billion). The ordered helicopters will be based on German Navy frigates, thereby replacing the Sea Lynx Mk88A, which entered service in 1981. Currently, the German Navy already operates 18 NH90 Sea Lion military transport helicopters, which were delivered from 2019 to 2023. Sea Tiger is the newest version of NATO's carrier-based helicopter, designed specifically for the needs of the German Navy. The helicopter is designed to fight enemy submarines and surface ships. Distinctive features of the machine are a new electro-optical system and -enhanced electronic support measures-, as well as a submersible sonar, sonar buoys and armament represented by missiles and torpedoes. In addition to combating submarines, additional tasks of the NH90 Sea Tiger helicopters include reconnaissance, search and rescue, as well as the transportation of personnel and cargo. Experts of the defense portal Army Recognition reminded that the NH90, which is also detailed told in one of his publications by our agency, is a twin-engine multi-role medium-sized military helicopter designed in accordance with NATO's requirements for universal and a modern helicopter. It is produced by NHIndustries, a consortium of Airbus Helicopters, Leonardo Helicopters and Fokker Aerostructures. Designed for both land and sea operations, the NH90 is available in two main variants: a tactical transport helicopter (TTH) designed for Army missions such as troop and equipment transport, medical evacuation and utility missions, and a NATO frigate helicopter ( NFH), optimized for naval applications including anti-submarine and anti-sea warfare, search and rescue as well as maritime surveillance. A defining feature of the NH90 is its all-wire flight control system, the first of its kind on a production helicopter. This technology improves flight stability and reduces pilot stress. The airframe is built with extensive use of composite materials, providing a lighter and stronger structure with a reduced radar signature. Its spacious cabin can accommodate up to 20 fully equipped soldiers or 12 medical evacuation stretchers. Since entering service in 2007, the NH90 has been adopted in many countries, including Belgium, Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands. By the beginning of 2023, more than 500 units of aircraft with a flight of more than 400,000 were delivered. hours Despite the advanced design, the helicopter development program faced some challenges, including technical issues and concerns about maintenance and operating costs. In response, NHIndustries has implemented modernization programs to improve the helicopter's performance and reliability. A recent €600 million contract with the NATO Helicopter Management Agency highlights ongoing efforts to modernize the NH90 and extend its service life.

One of the leading actors is blogger Denis Khamov, known for his scandalous videos, including the -Nudist Manifesto- with the requirement to allow the publication of content with naked bodies. In 2022, he also appeared in a propaganda video urging Russians to join the army. Earlier ArmyInform reported about fake Santa Clauses from TCC in Odessa. The propagandists seemed to like this idea. The new video is also an example of how the Kremlin tries to manipulate public opinion through absurd productions and fictional plots.

-Apikhatinka of the Armed Forces of Ukraine free of charge-: until Christmas and at all times, Ukrai...	Before Christmas, ArmiyaInform also visited the extraordinary homestead of Christian volunteers who take care of the souls of Ukrainian defenders while taking care of their bodies. A bathhouse, a laundry room with washing machines, a room with folding dryers and a line with clothes just outside - the volunteer manor meets us in the midst of daily work. Someone from the military goes to the bathhouse, someone puts in the laundry or picks up washed clothes, another soldier drinks coffee while waiting for his turn. Volunteers are constantly moving between them - they put dirty clothes in washing machines, hang up washed clothes, take them off and put dry things in bags. There are only three volunteers at the site now - the married couple Serhiy and Elena, as well as a very young girl, Polina. They have to be in time everywhere, so they talk about the initiative to help the military almost constantly. — We have been working in this format for the second year, since November 2023. They saw that the boys needed somewhere to wash, wash their clothes, rest a little - and they organized it, says Serhiy Severyn. Resting here now are only bees that fall asleep for the winter. So the apikhatinka — a special house for bee therapy — is temporarily closed until spring. Despite this, it still smells pleasantly of honey and wax. The God's Couriers volunteer initiative has been active since the beginning of the large-scale invasion. At first, it focused mainly on helping the local civilians of Donetsk region, delivering them food, water and other necessary things, as well as organizing evacuation. Their name is connected with the story of the biblical prophet Elijah, who was fed by ravens during his stay in the desert at the Lord's command: -And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the stream.- (Third Kings 17:6). — That is why our chevron features a raven and the slogan: -At the right time, in the right place.- Because we are the messengers, the couriers who deliver to people what they need most - bread, food, water and everything they need for life, Serhiy explains. Together with Olena and Polina, he mentions dozens of people from all corners of our country who in one way or another joined the volunteer initiative - either by handing over necessary things or by coming to the east of Ukraine and helping here with their work. Pastor Andrii Malov from the -Light of Resurrection- Church, who stood at the very beginnings of this volunteer initiative and is the coordinator of the -Light in the East- mission, is most often mentioned. It was he who, from the very beginning, found things people needed and delivered them to Donetsk region. As soon as the volunteers saw the urgent need of the military in the organization of life, they immediately reacted to it as well. As early as the fall of 2023, they organized a bathhouse and a laundry for servicemen in one of the estates in the front-line town. Initially, it was a mobile -Chaplain's Bath- on wheels near the house, and within a year, thanks to the support of dozens of caring people and associations, a capital stationary building was built. It can accommodate more than 100 people per day. - This is a joint Christian initiative, because Christians cannot be indifferent. God teaches us to bear one another's burdens and to care for those in need. This is how unity between people is formed, because the enemy seeks to divide and, thanks to this, rule over us, instead, the Lord calls us to unity, says Serhiy. A volunteer explains how important community support is to the military. Therefore, this volunteer initiative is needed not only to meet their purely physical needs, but also to provide spiritual support to Ukrainian defenders. — We want boys to understand that they are not alone, that they are not alone. That ordinary people appreciate what they do for them at the front, that ordinary people sympathize with them and want to help. And when there is such a relationship, it becomes easier for the boys, the volunteer emphasizes. The military will find out about the bathhouse and laundry thanks to a billboard placed near the road with an announcement and personal communication, so the initiative does not need special advertising. The complex is already working at the limit of its capacity - about a hundred servicemen visit it every day. It is necessary to wash the things left behind mainly at night, because water and electricity may run out for everything at the same time. In order to dry the washed clothes in the autumn and winter period, the manor has a heated drying room. Everything is organized in such a way as to make the defenders' stay as comfortable as possible. - These are simple, elementary things, but defenders really need them. We have a lounge - you can drink tea or coffee, eat goodies. We don't have time to cook, but the -Volunteers from God- organization from the Church -Design of Christ- helps us, Serhii says. While we are talking, he himself, as well as Olena and Polina manage to put wood in the stove that heats the bathhouse, pour coffee for the guys, take off and hang the washed clothes, put new loads of laundry in several washing machines. The work does not stop even for a moment. A little later, more workers are added - Serhiy's daughter arrives with her husband and several other people. Their work is difficult, but grateful - a tired smile and a kind word of thanks from the defenders are extremely inspiring to work further. By Holy Evening and Christmas, the mood in the manor is particularly high. Volunteers strive to bring to the soldiers a portion of the warmth and kindness of the bright holiday of the incarnation of the Lord. - In the sorrowful time of war, it is a great joy to share the joy of the holiday with your loved ones. And it is a great happiness to be useful, to be God's hands and God's messengers for our defenders, says Serhii. He compares the sacrificial feat of Ukrainian soldiers with Christ's atoning sacrifice. After all, becoming defenders of good and light from the attack of evil and darkness, warriors are likened to the One who came to protect people, taking upon themselves all their faults. - The Lord was born in a simple barn, because there was no other place for Him then. Now our defenders also live in dugouts and dugouts, in which there is no comfort. But we can make them feel our love, our care and make sure that their sacrifice is important to us and that they are not alone in their wanderings, the volunteer emphasizes. Together with all his like-minded people and associates, he is sure of the presence of God in the midst of those who take upon themselves the burden of their neighbor and ease his suffering. For where two are gathered together in His Name, there He is in the midst of them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/25/apihatynka-zsu-bezkoshtovno-do-rizdva-i-povsyakchas-pro-ukrayinskyh-zahysnykiv-dbayut-bozhi-kuryery/	2024-12-25T01:44:37-08:00

According to him, during the month they observed a different picture - unprepared infantry was advancing on Ukrainian positions. -We mostly saw this kind of, you know, chaos.

Each of them had disposable grenade launchers, they had night vision devices, they had small assault backpacks with them,- shared the impressions of the chief sergeant of the 47th separate mechanized brigade company. According to Oleg Chaus, during the attack on our positions, one group was neutralized, and two groups were entrenched in front of our positions. -Maybe it's some new unit, or maybe it's some support coming to level some of their front lines. And it is very good that our drones, scouts, they noticed in time. And if one of those three groups had not been destroyed, they would have continued their movement,- Oleg Chaus summarized. As reported by > ArmyInform, fighters of the 17th heavy mechanized brigade with the support of other units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine repelled a powerful assault on Kurshchyna, the result of which was the burning of enemy equipment and the stacked bodies of soldiers of the DPRK.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/25/haosytiv-zminyuyut-profi-na-kurshhyni-pochaly-atakuvaty-dobre-pidgotovleni-shturmovyky/	2024-12-25T00:57:14-08:00

The data of a war criminal from -gru- annexed Crimea was received	This is reported by Center of National Resistance. Despite all efforts to hide his activities as much as possible and cover his tracks, it is known that Mr. Sadovnik has a military engineering and technical education, he signed his first contract with the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation on August 27, 1999, and at the beginning of 2014 he was transferred to military unit 43292 ( Moscow region, Solnechnogorsk, village of Redino) to the position of senior diving specialist of the group tests A morbid mania to prove his importance to the whole world already in 2016 led him to the special operations forces of the Russian Federation and later to the game of the Russian Federation. The data of the gardener are highlighted in the list of military unit 00317 (317th special operations center (marine), which is located in the city of Sevastopol, Crimea). It is from this time that the psychopathic gardener draws legends for himself, and even in the description drawn up of him by the commander of military unit 43292, a certain Colonel Fufurin appears as the year of birth -1979-, not 1980 as in the passport. It is also worth paying attention to the nationality -Ukrainian- specified in the document. Despite everything, it is worth noting that the captain-lieutenant of the 3rd rank of the gardener has special feelings for the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces. The man keeps a whole gallery of photos with the emblem of the SSO of Ukraine in his phone. Moreover, in 2016, a non-hero gets a werewolf tattoo. We have several volumes of compromising materials for the gardener at our disposal (weapons, numerous mistresses, fraud with funds, -work- with children in the combat sambo federation of the Russian Federation). However, the personal -complexes- of the gardener have no meaning for us and we will leave them for justice. It is important that this person takes a direct part in the so-called svo. This is confirmed by a letter of appeal addressed to the general director of JSC -Northern Press- Kruglikova V.Ya. In it, the gardener asks the mentioned comrade to help equip his unit with drones, which is participating in the war against Ukraine and signs himself as the company commander of military unit 00317, captain of the 3rd rank, I. Sadovnik. It is known that the 317th special operations center of the Russian Federation is involved in the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Moscow's participation in the Syrian conflict in 2015-2017, and a large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The servicemen of this unit are still shelling Ukrainian cities and villages with the help of missile and bomb weapons, which are based on the sea, in aviation and on the ground. In addition, they continue to carry out sabotage, intelligence and subversive operations, both in the real world and in cyberspace. We remind you, 266 combat clashes were recorded during the past 24 hours. The situation at the front remains difficult.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/25/otrymano-dani-voyennogo-zlochynczya-iz-gru-aneksovanogo-krymu/	2024-12-24T22:57:30-08:00

A gift for Christmas: what the Brazilian padre of the International Legion prays for	Before Christmas, he told ArmiyaInform about his service to Christ, comrades-in-arms and the Ukrainian people, and also told about his most desired Christmas present. Like many volunteers from Latin American countries, Father Makariy came to Ukraine following the call of his heart. He speaks Ukrainian well on everyday topics and confidently recites the Lord's Prayer and the Creed also in Ukrainian translation during joint prayer. This is not surprising, because the priest knew a lot about our people even before arriving in Ukraine, as he communicated a lot with representatives of the Ukrainian community in the south of Brazil. It was this good knowledge of Ukrainian culture and history that prompted him to serve as a military chaplain in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. — I grew up among Ukrainians, I know the history of Ukraine and feel the culture and spirit of Ukrainians. I know what evil the Soviet Union brought to your people - the Holodomor of 1932-1933. The archbishop who ordained me to the priesthood was from Poltava, and on the day of my ordination I promised to serve the Lord God, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and I also mentioned serving Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, says Father Makarii. So now the chaplain not only instructs and strengthens the Christian faith of the fighters of the 2nd International Legion from different countries of the world, but also tells them about Ukraine and Ukrainians, introduces them more deeply to the culture and history of our people. -I have a Ukrainian soul,- he smiles. The priest wanted to come to Ukraine back in 2014, but then the position of his parents, who were very worried about his son, prevented him. However, having stopped him from traveling then, they could not stop him now, because the priest felt that he should be here together with Christians from Latin American countries who came to help the Ukrainian people. — I knew that my place was here, that I should be in Ukraine. When I turned to the archbishop with a request to bless me for my journey and ministry, he gladly did so because he shared my sincere support for the Ukrainian people, says the holy father. However, the future military chaplain did not immediately dare to tell his parents about the decision and informed about it already during his stay in Ukraine. He is moved to show his vow and the response of his mother, an Arab Christian from Syria, who supported her son's decision. Over time, the strict father - a serviceman of the Brazilian army - softened. The priest arrived in Ukraine in May, after which he underwent training and training together with all foreign volunteers. Padre Makariy says that he wanted to become a military chaplain, but already in Ukraine he learned that foreigners do not have such an opportunity, so he was ready to continue his service as a medic, saving the lives of soldiers. - I decided that if I can't be a chaplain, I will become a paramedic, and in my spare time I will serve as a priest to everyone who needs it. Therefore, after training, I put on a cassock and served together with other soldiers, says the chaplain. This was noticed by one of the Ukrainian officers who introduced Father Makaria to the Orthodox priest. Together, they helped a padre from Brazil realize his desire to become an official military chaplain of the 2nd International Defense Legion of Ukraine. - It was like receiving a gift from heaven from the Lord himself, Father Makarii says emotionally. — When I was told that I was now a military chaplain of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and could officially serve Christ and my brothers, tears came to my eyes. It was one of the best days of my life. — I was born in Brazil, but for me Ukraine is also my country. When the war is over, I don't want to leave. I want to continue to be in Ukraine, to serve God and the Ukrainian people, because after the war we will have a lot of work, says Father Makarii. Now he instructs and strengthens the Christian faith of the fighters of the 2nd International Legion. Padre Makariy combines priestly service with a vocation to serve the Ukrainian people and does everything possible to convey his love for Ukraine to all soldiers. — We treat Ukrainians as brothers. We protect Ukraine with Christian love, because we love this land as sincerely as our own homeland. If someone thinks that this is just to make money, then they are deeply mistaken. We are going to war and are forced to fight for love and peace, the chaplain explains. After the coming of peace, he is convinced, everyone will have jobs, because it will be necessary to heal the wounds caused by the war. The priest will have his own special role in this, for which you should prepare now. - Now I am preparing the soldiers for the Christmas celebration. Often we can't be together because of combat and training, but every day I call or write to them, reaching out with a sermon and a prayer. This is very important for them, because no one yearns for peace more than a soldier, says the padre. He notes that not only the body of a soldier suffers from war, but also his psyche and soul. And together with him, his family and relatives also suffer, because they know in what danger their loved one is in. Therefore, the chaplain's task is to help and pray for everyone in need, even when they don't know it. Padre Macarius does this all the time, because he knows that a priest does not have days off - every day of his life should be dedicated to serving the Lord. - When Jesus Christ was born, His land was captured by foreigners. However, He came to us to bring us eternal salvation, no matter what. Therefore, it is very important that regardless of where we are, in this case at war, that we have love for God inside us, - Padre Makariy emphasizes. - When we celebrate our birthday, we get presents. When Christ is born, we ask for gifts and receive gifts. And the most important, the most precious gift today, when this terrible bloody war is going on, the gift for which I pray all the time, is peace! - the military chaplain from Brazil does not hold back his emotions. He calls on all people of goodwill all over the world to pray for this together, because, he is convinced, sincere prayer with true love from every heart is capable of creating a great Christmas miracle: - I ask everyone to pray for Christmas so that this war ends. That the Russians go away from Ukraine to their own country and stay there, that they leave the land of Ukraine forever. Because this is not their land and they should not seek it. Therefore, let's forget about our own selfishness and don't ask for any material gifts for ourselves. Let's pray together for peace in Ukraine and in the whole world. And according to our faith, we will definitely receive this most valuable gift from Our Lord Jesus Christ.

How to become an officer in 40 days as a medic	There is currently a retraining program for tactical-level medical officers in Ukraine. And according to the head of the training department of the headquarters of the Medical Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, medical service colonel Yaroslava Semirunchyk, this allows filling medical positions. The training and retraining of medical service officers for the needs of the Defense Forces is carried out by the Ukrainian Military Medical Academy. span> Military servicemen serving as non-commissioned officers and having a higher medical education must write a report to the name the commander that they wish to undergo additional training under this training program. Documents must be sent to the email address of the Ukrainian Military Medical Academy. The training lasts 40 days. The first block - 22 days takes place online and is completed with credits. After the successful completion of the first block, an invitation is given for an 18-day offline assembly. -These people pass the position in the military units that they hugged They are assigned to the position of an officer in the same military unit and arrive at the military medical academy. Enrolled as cadets. They study for 18 days. After completing training and passing exams, they receive the primary officer rank of junior lieutenant of the medical service,- &#8211; said Yaroslava Semirunchyk. Currently, the 12th recruitment for such a course is underway at the Military Medical Academy. In total, 251 servicemen have already been retrained. This made it possible to fill a significant number of medical positions. As ArmyInform reported, civilian doctors also have the opportunity get the rank of officer. But it will take them 4 months. In particular, doctors fit for service who do not have a military education can apply to military departments of medical higher education institutions. In four months of training, they can obtain the rank of officer for further service in the Armed Forces in positions of their own profile.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/25/yak-medyku-staty-oficzerom-za-40-dniv/	2024-12-24T20:46:14-08:00
Faster, higher, as far as possible: France and Italy created a new version of the Aster 30 missile, ...	Designed to provide advanced defense against sophisticated air threats, including ballistic missiles, this missile was presented as an important element of the European defense strategy. During a recent real-time demonstration at the Biscarross test site, the Aster 30 B1NT successfully handled complex threat simulations, demonstrating its capabilities in high-intensity scenarios. Portal Defense network disclosed some technical data of the newest charge. Designed for use with both the ground-based SAMP/T-NG system and naval systems such as PAAMS, the Aster 30 B1NT missile is capable of intercepting high-speed targets at ranges of over 150 kilometers and altitudes of up to 25 kilometers. Equipped with a high-precision Ka-band radar, this missile is capable of engaging both ballistic and hypersonic missiles. This capability positions the Aster 30 B1NT as a credible European alternative to comparable systems such as the US Patriot, which until recently was widely regarded as the world's leading anti-missile defense option. -Aster 30 B1 NT will be equipped with units of the armed forces of France and Italy, which will operate ground-based air defense systems of the new generation SAMP-T, which are planned to be put into service by 2026. This system is capable of intercepting hypersonic missiles, countering threats in 360 degrees and doing it in a multi-layered way,- emphasized the Minister of Defense of the French Republic Sebastien Lecornu, who was present at the first tests of the warhead. The comments of the Army Recognition site received from European experts indicate that while American Patriot, widely used by NATO armed forces and well known for its effectiveness against short-range ballistic and cruise missiles, the Aster 30 B1NT has greater versatility and intercept medium-range ballistic missiles and high-altitude targets including hypersonic missiles. Most of all, the SAMP/T-NG system, which can be deployed both autonomously and in addition to other NATO defense systems, provides increased flexibility in terms of interoperability and rapid response. Countries such as Belgium, which recently expressed interest in acquiring the SAMP/T-NG system, underline the appeal of the Aster 30 B1NT in Europe. By opting for a European system rather than an American one, Belgium intends to move to greater strategic autonomy while facilitating the integration of its defense capabilities with those of France and Italy, which are currently users of the system. In Brussels, it is emphasized that the adoption of the Aster 30 B1NT would also allow Europe to improve its defense capabilities and optimize the resources of the European military-industrial complex within the framework of the EU with the support of expanded cooperation programs. By participating in the development of the Aster 30 B1NT, the European companies MBDA and Thales demonstrate their ability to compete with the American leaders of such products, contributing to the technological sovereignty of Europe and promoting autonomous defense solutions. Thus, as emphasize European media, this missile meets Europe's goal of reducing dependence on American anti-missile systems by maintaining a high level of protection against complex threats. European commentary notes that as other European countries may soon join France and Italy in deploying the Aster 30 B1NT, this missile could become a cornerstone of European air defenses, strengthening the continent's security against various threats. As reported by ArmyInform , the government of the French Republic attached Aster 30 missiles to aid packages to Ukraine. Aster 30 B1NT rocket test launches.

Why did the Russian Federation launch the IPSO on the exchange of prisoners	In addition, propaganda telegram channels continue to spread fake news that Ukraine is allegedly disrupting the exchange of prisoners of war, citing fake lists of mobilized people who previously had no relation to the army. These are all fakes. First, the Institute for the Study of War did not publish this video on its resources. The video was edited from publicly available materials. In particular, the propagandists took the footage of the released commanders who led the defense of Azovstal from their first video statement after returning from Russian captivity in September 2022. And the footage of the return of the Ukrainian military from captivity was taken by fakers from a video published on October 19, 2024 on the official Telegram channel of Volodymyr Zelenskyi. Alan Scheinwald, who allegedly says that the Ukrainian authorities prefer soldiers of the so-called -nationalist battalions-, because they are more ideologically motivated, not a military expert, but an American investor. In addition, the footage where he seems to be commenting on the strategy of the Ukrainian authorities in exchanging prisoners of war is taken from a video from August 2019. In it, Sheinwald talks about his career as an investor, the company he founded, what services he provides, etc. And, of course, the divisions were incorrectly named in the fake. -Azov- is not a battalion, but a brigade, and -Kraken- is a special unit of the Main Directorate of Intelligence. With such fakes, Russian propaganda tries to discredit Ukraine and the prisoner exchange process. In particular, it is Russia that purposefully does not exchange captured defenders of Mariupol. However, Ukraine consistently advocates the exchange of prisoners, and President Zelenskyi's proposal to exchange -all for all- is ignored by Russia itself. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets noted that her statements about Ukraine's rejection of exchanges are part of an information and psychological operation (IPSO).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/25/dlya-chogo-rf-zapustyla-ipso-pro-obmin-polonenymy/	2024-12-24T20:09:11-08:00

Tourers will work in cultural centers and libraries. It is mostly about villages and towns. At the same time, there are not many people willing to move to TOT, despite the payment, because the Russians understand. that here they are enemies and their career may not be long.

Export volumes of Russian electricity are decreasing	reports this Service of foreign intelligence of Ukraine. During the winter, deliveries to China may stop altogether.

By 2030, the energy deficit in the Far East will reach 10 billion kWh and 3 GW of capacity, because the Kremlin does not have enough money to support the relevant infrastructure, and instead of developing its own country, it continues the war against Ukraine.

Colonel Oleksiy Dudka, one of the developers of the mentioned standard and the chief specialist of the Department of the Central Department of Military Education and Science of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told the ArmiyaInform correspondent in more detail about this. -According to the current legislation, we must keep military records in every enterprise. There are more than a million enterprises in Ukraine, and there are still no specialists who know exactly what to do in this position. This standard, as a document, will from now on be a beacon to which you can orient yourself: what should a person in such a position do in all enterprises of Ukraine where military records are kept. And now it is everywhere,- noted Oleksiy Dudka. According to him, the professional standard -Military Accounting Inspector-, which was registered on December 19, is a national document: -Now, any company that plans to hire a specialist - a military accounting inspector - having read this, will know what kind of person needs to be hired, so that they have a military record, so that they have there were no fines. Because the state has taken this issue quite seriously.- The officer emphasized that before the large-scale intrusion into the military records, they did not receive as much attention as they do now. -Now, when the issue of mobilization and the availability of personnel is on the agenda, the state has seriously begun to think about it, and there are no real experts on this issue. The mentioned standard organizes these issues, both for employers who hire these specialists, and for ordinary citizens, conscripts, who work in all enterprises of our country. At the very least, the specialist who will occupy this position will be able to tell how to comply with the laws of Ukraine in the performance of his military duty, how to avoid fines from the TCC and SP, what needs to be done for this, and how to properly perform this duty before the state,- added Oleksiy Dudka. He emphasized that this standard is a guide for all people who, as of now, know too little to finally solve the mobilization issues in our country: -The first thing businesses that will familiarize themselves with this standard should do is send their specialist to training . Currently, about two dozen educational institutions conduct advanced training courses where this science is taught to one degree or another. And after completing such courses, a specialist from the enterprise will meet this standard. And then the quality of mobilization work, starting with a small enterprise and ending with the scale of the state, will increase significantly, and in a geometric progression&#8230; And, talking about the work on this standard, I can't help but mention that it was also born thanks to the fact that I, as one of the developers, was actively helped by my colleagues. This is the ideologue of the -Oberig- system, Colonel Oleksandr Pravdyvets and Colonel Oleg Pavlovsky, who has been taking care of military accounting issues in the country for many years. And in general, the standard is the result of the work of a working group with representatives from the Ministry of Defense, the General Staff and the scientific community, because the group included 3 doctors of science and 2 candidates for doctors of science.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/24/v-ukrayini-zareyestrovano-profesijnyj-standart-inspektor-z-vijskovogo-obliku/	2024-12-24T09:53:59-08:00

The occupiers' base in Luhansk was exposed thanks to the imprudence of a Russian colonel	About this reports Center of National Resistance. Among the entire array of data, the Defense Forces received lists of Russian Guard personnel who participated in the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.

In addition, Machkur revealed the location of the Russian occupation forces in the temporarily occupied Luhansk.

More than half of Russians dream of the return of the death penalty	About this reports the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Such a high level of support for the death penalty indicates the accumulation of aggression in Russian society. Residents of small towns and villages speak -for- - 58%. In large and medium-sized cities, 49% support the death penalty. 55% of men and 50% of women support the reinstatement of the execution. The biggest opponents of this initiative are persons under the age of 29 (61%). With age, the number of supporters increases — among people aged 60 and over, 65% support the death penalty. In support of the return of the highest degree of punishment, people without higher education are also more likely to express their support - 60%. Among respondents with a higher education, there are equal numbers of supporters and opponents (47% each). The purpose of updating the issue of the death penalty in the Russian Federation is the desire to strengthen the government's control over the population through intimidation and pressure, as well as the Kremlin's demonstration of its -activity- in the fight against terrorism and crime. We remind you that in the temporarily occupied territories, the Russians continue to organize lectures on -their heroes - for teenagers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/24/bilshe-polovyny-rosiyan-mriyut-pro-povernennya-smertnoyi-kary/	2024-12-24T05:32:59-08:00

It should also be noted that these repairmen do not pay anything for a temporary stay in someone else's apartment. Utility bills are issued to the owners. The result is debts, lack of things and, in the best case, replacement of radiators with similar ones. Individuals in Lysychansk are allowed to conduct business prohibited for others. For example, for 25 thousand rubles, wealthier citizens are offered equipment for using the Internet, which is turned off by the Russians in the front-line zone. The option is unreliable, without a provider and guarantees. But the occupiers are unable to offer anything better than buying an antenna, and with it the opportunity to steal.

Now, according to Anastasia Bobovnikova, difficult battles are going on for the Tsentralna mine. The combat features constant changes in the urban landscape.

Because the banal house that serves as a reference may no longer exist. Nevertheless, we are doing the impossible to evacuate the wounded, and medics are literally saving the lives of soldiers under bullets,- Anastasia Bobovnikova said. Any seizure of a house, and even more so a street, is given to the occupiers with a huge amount of blood, Bobovnikova notes. They lose a mechanized battalion of personnel in a week, and in fact a brigade in a month. -Contractors are the basis of the reserves they raise. These are poorly trained military personnel. But they still conduct some kind of training, they are taught to hold a machine gun, put on a body armor and a helmet.

Defense forces destroyed a column of Russian armored vehicles in the Vremivsk direction	This was notified in the -Khortytsia- OSU. The other day, near Novy Komar, the occupiers attacked the positions of 110 OMBr with a column of armored vehicles - three tanks and BMP with infantry. Such insolent mechanized raids by the occupiers in the zone of responsibility of the soldiers of this brigade are regular, so our defenders had time to develop a countermeasure scheme. The unit's FPV drones quickly took off to intercept the enemy's armored vehicles. Thanks to the skill and accuracy of drone operators, both enemy equipment and personnel were destroyed. -Because, as you know, driving an armored vehicle through someone else's land is scary, painful, and won't work for a long time,- the Khortytsya Military Police emphasized.

The Russian IPSO sings a rap about dodgers	His video and audio are used in social networks to create a negative image of TCC employees and military personnel involved in the mobilization. This, in the opinion of the Center for Combating Disinformation, indicates the activation of another disinformation campaign aimed at disrupting mobilization and discrediting the military and political leadership of Ukraine. By discrediting the mobilization, the Russian Federation is trying to incite hatred and create tension among Ukrainians. Russia is not the first to use the TikTok social network to achieve its strategic goals in the information war against Ukraine. Back in April of this year, the enemy launched the information campaign -Ukhlyant- aimed at disrupting the mobilization. And in July, a large number of captioned videos circulated about the -intolerability- of life in Ukraine in the context of war and blackouts, with calls to leave for other countries. It is worth noting that the main feature of all such videos is the accusation of the Ukrainian authorities, not the Russian Federation, which is waging a terrorist war against our state. The creation and distribution of such destructive materials plays into Russian propaganda and fits into the Russian strategy of undermining Ukraine's defense capabilities, in which the enemy has invested large resources since the very beginning of a full-scale invasion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/24/rosijske-ipso-spivaye-rep-pro-uhylyantiv/	2024-12-23T20:46:14-08:00
-Sniper- on tracks: how the British AS-90 self-propelled guns tear apart the enemy in the Pokrovsky ...	ArmiyaInform correspondents visited one of the firing positions of the second artillery battery of the self-propelled artillery division of the brigade and talked with the crew of the British AS-90 installation. The guys talked about the combat capabilities of the artillery system, its advantages in the battle against Soviet installations, the destroyed -fat- Russian targets, how they work in the conditions of the enemy's UAVs and why the Russians are mad and can't get our gunners. We leave in the morning in full gear, we move in two cars. We quickly leave settlements where peaceful residents live. Further on, there is no asphalt, we drive along broken country roads for quite a long time. -Now hold on, this section of the road must be skipped as soon as possible. Enemy UAVs are operating,- says the commander of the second self-propelled artillery battery to the Patron fighter jet that accompanies us to the position. We do not drive through, but -fly over- this road and break into a destroyed settlement, many of which were destroyed by the enemy in Donetsk region. Cars in shelter, and get to know the gunners themselves. We look around. A typical village in the steppe part of the Donetsk region, simple Ukrainians once lived here. Now there are completely ransacked residential buildings, burned cars in yards, broken fences, and farmsteads torn by shrapnel from projectiles. In a word, the Rashists did not leave a living place, just an -ideal picture- of the post-apocalypse, from some horror movie. Enemy positions are no more than 7 km. Battery commander Yevgeny with the call sign -Patron- says: the British artillery has excellent combat capabilities and during fire missions shows itself only from a positive side. Advantages of the AS-90: very fast targeting and firing, armored protection and mobility. The effective firing range is up to 24 km, and the maximum range with active-reactive projectiles is up to 30 km. Compared to the Soviet -Gvozdika- and -Akatsia- artillery installations, the British AS-90 has a great advantage in both accuracy and range. The installation weighs 45 tons, armed with a 155 mm cannon. The machine is equipped with an autonomous navigation system and automatic gun aiming. The gun is loaded thanks to the delivery system, and the installation of an additional tray allows for quick loading after each shot. In addition, there is an opportunity to load the gun manually in case of a malfunction. The tower rotates 360 degrees. This is very important in battle. Each gun is equipped with a radar to measure the initial velocity of the projectile. Crew of 5: Gun Commander, Gunner, Service Number Master, Service Number and Driver Mechanic. -From the moment of receiving the coordinates of the targets, setting the firing task, preparing and leaving the self-propelled guns to the firing positions (100-150 m from the -hideout-), targeting a specific target and practicing strikes on the enemy, it takes 4.5 minutes. In modern conditions of warfare, this is an extremely powerful indicator. We are very satisfied with this artillery system,- says Combatant Patron. By the way, the gun's rate of fire is up to 6 shots per minute. The guys call the AS-90 a -tracked sniper- for a reason. Enemy targets destroyed by gunners are diverse: command and observation points (control points), field warehouses with ammunition, self-propelled artillery installations, rocket salvo fire systems -Grady- and -Hurricanes-, tanks, BMPs, armored personnel carriers, some shelters and other defensive structures of the Rashits . Hitting enemy manpower counts as a very small target for gunners. -They recently performed a combat mission. Our UAV-reconnaissance units reported to us: they discovered the KSP of the Rashist battalion. The video showed that it was camouflaged and well fortified. So, with the very first -target- projectile, we definitely hit the -top ten-. The success was confirmed with the second projectile, completely dismantling the enemy's anti-tank missile system. Later it was found out that it was a fat target: the combatant and many invaders were destroyed. Obviously, this was their headquarters,- says the gun commander Yaroslav. The boys no longer keep any statistics of Russian military targets hit. They say there are so many that they simply don't keep track of what was destroyed. -Even in the first month, when we were transferred here to the Pokrovsky direction, I counted every hit target. Now it's simply banal that there isn't enough strength and time to do it,- adds the -Patron- combatant. Our gunners work powerfully within the limits of counter-battery struggle. These are tens, if not hundreds, of various enemy artillery systems affected. Therefore, for the enemy, artillery calculation and AS-90 self-propelled guns are a priority target. Right during the recording of the interview with the Patron battery commander, enemy UAVs attacked the AS-90 self-propelled guns. At that time, we were very close by in a ruined house. There was an explosion. As it turned out, the Russian ZALA drone was working in the sky above us, which is designed to conduct reconnaissance at any time of the day with real-time video transmission. He adjusted the -Lancet- barrage ammunition to our artillery installation. But it didn't hit, it exploded nearby. Fortunately, the guys camouflaged our -SAUSHKA- well, so it's not so easy to detect it, even from the air, it's another -quest-task-. Let's go to the AS-90 installation for a second, everything is fine with it. Nearby we see smoke from the impact. The command -Into shelter- sounds. Threat of re-strike from the air. We quickly run to the basement of the house. We'll hack it below. -The enemy is flying around here. There is no safe place. It is necessary to always be -on track-. There are days when up to 15 UAVs of different types are in the sky at the same time. A few days ago, we destroyed their Hrads, we heard their interceptions: they are in shock and furious, and we are in high spirits,- the gunner boys say. Not even a few minutes pass - there is an explosion again. The battery commander is informed: enemy FPV drones are operating. We hear the blow again! They sat in the shelter for more than two hours. During this time, katsaps attacked the broken buildings of the former village about ten times. I ask: what about the self-propelled guns? Will it withstand direct hits from kamikaze drones? -It will last: the gunners affirmatively say. Ours in Kurshchyna were performing tasks, up to 9 FPV drones were hit by AS-90s and the armor could not withstand anything, the crew remained alive, only the good one was concussed,- the gunners answer. -In the Pokrovsky direction, the enemy is now using FPV drones that work on optical fiber. Therefore, it is not possible to suppress them with EW means. And this is a big problem for us. For the most part, our mobile fire groups work on such drones, we use anti-drone rifles and small arms,- ​​explains Yulia, head of the communications department of the 117th separate heavy mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. By the way, Yulia was also in the shelter with us during the air strikes of the Russian Federation. And at the same time, she made a video inclusion in the telethon about the operational situation in the Pokrovsky direction. It's good that the guys had Starlink, there were no problems with communication. -This is our job. The information front, as well as combat operations, is not stopped by anyone, so we have to work in Spartan combat conditions,- says Yulia and adds: it is much more difficult for our gunners here. We continue to communicate with the guys in the basement. The British self-propelled gunners of the brigade received for armament more than a year ago. Before that, the entire personnel of the self-propelled artillery division studied at the Royal School of Artillery in Great Britain. Intensive preparation lasted more than a month. They studied the tactical and technical characteristics, equipment and combat capabilities of the equipment. Mastered not difficult -repair operations- on the self-propelled guns. Exams were taken at the training grounds of Misty Albion. -The first combat use of AS-90 in Ukraine was in the Bakhmut direction, then in Zaporizhzhia in the Rabotyno region. With the beginning of the offensive operation of the Ukrainian Defense Forces, a battery of British self-propelled guns was used in the Kursk region. They piled on the Rashists on their own territory. The intensity of combat tasks was extremely high. It happened that more than 100 shells were launched in a day. Now -British female snipers- are successfully working in the Pokrovsky direction,- says the -Patron- combatant. In combat calculations, people of different age categories, from different regions of Ukraine. All are called up for mobilization. People are motivated and energized. Battery Commander Yevgeny, nicknamed Patron, is a 2023 graduate of the Missile Forces and Artillery Department of the National Army Academy. He is from Chernivtsi. Immediately after graduation, he got the position of senior officer of a self-propelled battery in the 117th brigade. Very soon he was promoted to battery commander. Patron is a leader, you can feel it right away. Guys respect him. He is for the battery gunner team as a playmaker on the football field or as they say in football -classic ten-. Only here on the battlefield, this is not a football game, but a real war. Every -tactical combination-, every pass of -tens-, every order to a subordinate is valuable here! Yuliya, head of the communications department of the 117th brigade, told ArmiyaInform about the situation in the Pokrovsky direction: -The main task of the artillery is to destroy the enemy's forces and means by fire. This is a tremendous help for our infantry who are on the front line. Our defenders from artillery installations are literally tearing apart the occupiers and holding back the enemy's onslaught in Donetsk region. Ammunition is provided to us in sufficient quantity. This is help from our foreign partners. Overall, the situation is difficult but under control. The guys are doing their heroic work on the front lines every day. Regarding countering enemy UAVs. Our team includes pilots of unmanned systems that fly to the same altitude as the Russian UAVs -Lancet- and -Zala-. And the boys manage to knock them down. How they do it, let's leave it a secret.- Yulia also said that the enemy has already started using North Korean-made remote mining systems: -These are cluster munitions. How it works is that sub-munitions are -poured out- from the cartridge, which explode instantly on the terrain or are timed and then go off on command when the enemy needs it. &#8230; -We do not observe air means of defeating the enemy.- -Zala- to 1 km from us- - came the report of the -Patron- combatant. It's getting dark outside. The guys say: the -window of opportunity- has arrived, you can leave the positions while the katsaps charge the next FPV drones.

Army fashion for parallelograms: a European consortium has developed a barrage munition with a diamo...	As French engineers indicate in the presentation release, the drone with diamond-shaped wing is equipped with a pyrotechnic payload suitable for hitting different types of targets, such as vehicles with different armor protection. Analyzing the reasons for such innovation from, first of all, specialists of the leading European developer and manufacturer of missile systems, which is MBDA, experts of the defense portal Army Recognition concluded that this new addition to the MBDA arsenal is a strategic entry into the munitions market, for which international demand is increasing due to recent conflicts, including long war in Ukraine. Raijin's RD-120 combines innovative Fly-R technology with MBDA's operational expertise, offering the military a flexible, powerful solution for engaging enemy forces in dynamic battlefield conditions. The RD-120 Raijin ammunition is designed with an emphasis on flexibility, power and accuracy. Equipped with a high-performance day/night camera, it can detect, identify and engage targets in a variety of lighting conditions. The munition contains a tunable pyrotechnic charge that adapts to the armor level of various targets, from light vehicles to heavily armored vehicles, maximizing mission effectiveness. When folded, the RD-120 Raijin is 250mm wide, 255mm high and 1195mm long, allowing for compact storage and transport. When deployed, its wings automatically deploy to a deployed size of 1,215mm wide, 225mm high and 1,070mm long. With a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of 5 kg and a payload capacity of up to 1.5 kg, the Raijin is compact yet powerful. The propulsion system of this munition is driven by an electric motor, which provides a wide operational speed range from 95 km/h to 200 km/h, depending on mission requirements. Raijin's RD-120 is launched from a portable tube launcher, reaching an initial speed of 95 km/h, which it can quickly increase to a cruising speed of 110 km/h. After entering the attack phase, the Raijin accelerates to an impressive dive speed of 270 km/h, delivering a quick and powerful strike to the target. It has a range of up to 50 km, with an endurance of 45 minutes at cruising speed, making it well-suited for long missions and wide battlefield coverage. Raijin is capable of working at an altitude of up to 3,000 meters. meters, which gives it an advantage on various and difficult terrains. One of the defining characteristics of the RD-120 Raijin is its diamond-shaped wing configuration. This unique design improves maneuverability and reduces wingspan and overall weight by about a third, providing a high lift coefficient and greater stability in flight. This design allows the Raijin to perform fast, precise maneuvers while maintaining flight stability even at high speeds, and to approach targets at steep angles, ideal for sudden and precise strikes. Designed for rapid deployment, the RD-120 Raijin can be launched directly from a reusable shipping container. Its autonomous flight mode can be overridden by a ground operator who verifies target identification and gives the final engagement order. Advanced targeting algorithms developed by Fly-R guarantee precise positioning, providing exceptional accuracy on both stationary and moving targets. In the attack phase, the diamond-shaped wing design further improves the drone's visual, acoustic and thermal stealth, making it difficult for adversaries to detect or intercept. With a take-off weight of 5 kg, including 1.5 kg of payload, the RD-120 Raijin offers a substantial combination of power and efficiency. Its adaptability and various attack parameters allow it to meet operational needs in various combat scenarios, from precision strikes on high-value targets to group operations with other drones. The Raijin's efficiency, maneuverability and tactical flexibility make it an attractive choice for countries looking to expand their capabilities with advanced munitions. By bringing the RD-120 Raijin to the defense market, MBDA and Fly-R aim to capitalize on growing demand, positioning the Raijin as an important asset for militaries seeking to enhance their precision strike capabilities.

Destroyed three tanks in one shift: the story of the operator of ATGM Vitaly	Vitaly was born in 1968, from Chernihiv Oblast. What does a soldier who has destroyed three enemy tanks in one turn feel? But what happened when he hit the sledge on which the enemy was transporting ammunition? The soldier told our correspondent about this. -In 2022, the Katsapas advanced through our village to Nizhyn. For more than a month, while I was in the village, I counted and recorded how many and what kind of enemy equipment passed by us. And he passed it on to guys he knew from TrO. Thanks to this, a lot of Katsapa equipment was destroyed at that time. My backpack was already packed from the first day. I knew I was going to fight. And after the liberation of our village, I went to the TCC. And in 2023, my son also went to fight. Currently, he performs tasks in the Kupyansk direction. &#8230;For me, the best ATGM is Stugna. Because there is an opportunity to observe, bring to the target and see an accurate hit, be sure that the target is destroyed. There was an interesting episode in winter. I saw that the enemy on sleds was bringing ammunition and food to the forest strip where their positions were. My commander gave the go-ahead to destroy the enemy with a high-explosive fragmentation projectile. Well, I hit the target. You could see how everything was flying around there, how pieces were flying from them. They had -two hundred-, -three hundred-. Therefore, the enemy did not receive either ammunition or food. I also had a day when I destroyed three tanks. Then in the morning, around 8 o'clock, the enemy began to storm our positions. Three of their tanks left. And before that, our boys had already beaten up their other cars a little. And new tanks were hiding behind them, firing at our positions. They were driving, there was a lot of dust and smoke. So I had to be guided and guess a little by the shots, by the flashes&#8230; I brought it to the target, fired and the hit was recorded. Sometime after lunch, around two o'clock in the afternoon, the commander relayed on the radio that there was movement of enemy equipment. I noticed that there was dust behind the forest strip. I looked closely at where that tank could be hit. Found a gap in the forest strip where there are no trees. I went there in advance and waited for the tank to drive there. He just drove in, and I immediately conducted a rocket launch on him. And this tank did not even have time to fire a single shot. And was destroyed. The commander also told us about the third tank. We started watching, found this car. It was a little more difficult, because the tank was far away and hiding behind the trees. I came up, fired a shot. The rocket had to be raised a little to hit the target, because the trees there were a little in the way. Well, he still hit, the tank was destroyed. The adrenaline that day was good, I wanted to beat them again and again. I remember another case&#8230; Once an enemy tank and two BMPs drove out of the forest strip. And they were moving, they wanted to break through to our infantry. But we reacted in time. I was not yet an operator at that time, but simply helped, changed rockets, observed. We then had only high-explosive fragmentation missiles. But we still fired shots. The tank was hit, but it was shrapnel: we did not hit it. But he got scared and ran away. Similarly, BMP had a hit. She went beyond the forest line and caught fire there. And the third BMP&#8230; also just ran away. And this is how we helped our infantry units: the katsaps did not harm them.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/24/znyshhyv-try-tanky-za-odne-cherguvannya-istoriya-operatora-ptrk-vitaliya/	2024-12-23T20:05:37-08:00

To be near and take care of the spirit of the Ukrainian soldier: graduation of military chaplains of...	The unit's military chaplain is the one they turn to for comfort and support. In his ministry, he must always remain so strong in faith as to be an unshakable support for every human soul that needs the attention of a pastor. This strength requires the military chaplain to keep his personal sincere prayer to God, who is the source of all our strength and blessings. In the walls of the majestic church of Saint Sophia of the Wisdom of God, which is the cradle of Kyiv spirituality, statehood and culture, chaplains were blessed by representatives of Christian denominations who underwent eight-week training under a special training program for military chaplain officers. The welcoming speech was given by: Metropolitan Ioan (Yaremenko) from the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, Bishop Andriy (Khimiak) from the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Bishop Pavlo (Honcharuk) from the Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine, Pastor Anatoly Raichynets from the Ukrainian Evangelical Church, Pastor Volodymyr Condor from the All-Ukrainian Union of Evangelical Christian-Baptist Churches, pastor Vyacheslav Kohut from the Ukrainian Church of Christians of the Evangelical Faith, Bishop Andrii Tyshchenko from the Ukrainian Christian Church -New Generation- and Bishop Anatoly Kalyuzhny from the Council of Independent Churches of Ukraine. The main mission of a military chaplain is to be near and take care of the spirit of a Ukrainian soldier. This care is carried out on three levels: the Military Chaplain's Code in St. Sophia of Kyiv was solemnly read by Chaplain Service Lieutenant Nazarii Zasanskyi, and the Military Chaplain's Prayer by Chaplain Service Lieutenant Andrii Borkovskyi. The prayers -Our Father- and -God, great, one- were performed by the choir of the KPBA of OCU together with the graduates. The coordinator of cooperation with religious communities of the State Service of Ukraine for Ethnopolitics and Freedom of Conscience Vyacheslav Horshkov, the deputy head of the Military Institute for educational work, Colonel Anatoliy Loyshyn, and the deputy head of the Military Chaplaincy Service of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Anatoliy Loyshyn, addressed the graduates with a welcome speech before handing over the certificates of graduation.

Oleksandr Vovkotecha, told ArmyInform that 237 military chaplains have already been trained at the educational institution. After the order on military chaplaincy was issued in 2022, the training of military chaplains began already in January 2023. -Courses are held throughout the year. Four training courses for military chaplains are planned for next year 2025. Also, not only military chaplains, but also their assistants take courses here. Military chaplain assistants are just as important as chaplains. They are, first of all, guards and assistants of our military chaplains, who are always close to them in the army and take care of their safety. We will also have another course, a higher level. This is a training course for officers of the Military Chaplaincy Service,- said Oleksandr Vovkotecha. And the deputy head of the Military Chaplaincy Service of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Lubomyr Yakibchuk, said that the Military Institute of Taras Shevchenko Kyiv National University is the only educational institution in which military chaplains of the Armed Forces are trained under a special training program in accordance with the requirements of the Law of Ukraine -On Military Chaplaincy Service- of Ukraine. -The program was jointly developed by the Military Chaplaincy Service in accordance with the requirements set by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine regarding, in fact, the training of tactical-level officers. And in parallel, this is cooperation with religious organizations to combine two directions: military and religious. A military chaplain is a combination of two models of the state - an officer's honor and a priest. A combination of two people trusted by the majority of Ukrainians. The main task of this course is to form this unity of the military and the priest, a unique combination in their ministry,- Lyubomyr Yakibchuk noted.

Assaults -with live mines-: the occupiers have come to love the tactics of jihadists	The spokesman of the operational and strategic group of troops -Khortytsia- lieutenant colonel Nazar Voloshyn. According to Nazar Voloshyn, the occupiers abandoned the tactics of head-on assaults on populated areas. Now they are trying to block transport arteries and cut off logistics from our defenders. And they liked to use kamikaze. -In the Kurakhiv direction, in particular in Kurakhiv, the occupiers use such tactics. They find suicide bombers who take tank mines with them. Trying to break through the fire of our defenders, these mines are thrown into the building. In this way, they are destroying urban buildings,- Nazar Voloshyn said. As reported by ArmyInform , on the eastern front, the enemy works in combination, changing the tactics of assaults and using equipment in a measured manner.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/23/shturmy-zhyvymy-minamy-okupanty-polyubyly-taktyku-dzhyhadystiv/	2024-12-23T02:11:39-08:00

The Russian crew is trying to fix the problem and is drifting in the open sea near Portugal. Meanwhile, the remnants of the Russian contingent in Syria have finished withdrawing from remote areas and are in only two places - the air base in Khmeimim and the naval base in Tartus. Russia began to transfer some of its weapons and equipment from the port of Tartusa by sea to Libya. Also, the Russian military in Syria is actively discussing the alleged demand of the new authorities of the Arab republic to Moscow to completely withdraw its military contingent from the Syrian territory, in particular from the bases in Khmeimim and Tartus, no later than February 20, 2025. This move is allegedly related to the desire of the new government in Damascus to achieve the lifting of international sanctions.

The high technology of modern warfare, -Oreshnik- and the elections in the USA: an interview with Ol...	Oleksandr Zavitnevich, head of the Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence, gave the answers to these questions to ArmyInform. —Recently, we passed the 1,000-day mark of the beginning of the great Russian war against Ukraine. You are the head of the committee, which in terms of subjects takes a leading place in strengthening the country's defense capabilities. By request, you are one of the most informed officials about the realities on the front line, the capabilities of our defense forces and the enemy. Based on all this, what are your main conclusions from the specified period of the great war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine? — To list and reveal all the conclusions, a separate interview will be required, but if we talk very briefly about the main thing, then they boil down to this: the first — all of us, who have the opportunity for working days, owe an gratuitous debt to our Heroes, who gave their lives in the fight against the Rashists, and by those who are currently in the ranks of the defense forces protecting us from missile terror, restraining the Russian onslaught, protecting Ukraine and the entire civilized world from Russian evil. This awareness should be perceived not just as an element of politeness, but as the main motivator of our further resistance and indomitability, stability and even revenge against the enemy for all the troubles and misfortunes that he brought to our land, for the death of our sisters and brothers. We should also be grateful to all those who prioritized helping the front, helping the veterans of this war, and the families of fallen soldiers as the main priority of their lives; the second is that we are a nation of invincibles. So it was and will be! But the harsh realities of war are that we will be supported and helped as long as we demonstrate unity, as long as we ourselves believe and fight, as long as we are unyielding and unceasing in our pursuit of Victory and a just peace; the third - high technology has become the main feature of modern war, its importance will continue to grow. The enemy greatly exceeds us in numbers and resources, and we will not be able to compete with him in this matter. This means that we are doomed to defeat it technologically, with new models of OIT, advanced methods of warfare. We have to be more mobile, unreachable for the enemy in terms of creativity and ingenuity. Only the national defense industry, which is able to meet the needs of the Armed Forces to the maximum, is a reliable guarantee of maintaining their combat capability both in peacetime and during war. Our stability, successful defense and victory directly depends on the growth of the Ukrainian defense industry. — In your opinion, what are the strengths of the enemy, why is he still able to continue the creeping occupation, increase the production of military equipment, including those recently used against Ukraine as the Oreshnik missile? — Summarizing all factors , we can say this—the strength of the Russian Federation lies in the weakness of the measures taken to force the Russian Federation to a just peace. The Russian Federation is successful only because it feels impunity, indecisiveness in making decisions that Ukraine offers in order for the enemy to realize the futility of continuing the war, so that every day, every hour he feels the exorbitant price he has to pay for every millimeter of success. In addition, the rhetoric and consciousness of a certain part of the Western political community is dominated by the thesis that security assistance to Ukraine is only to contain the Russian Federation. But our President, Ukrainian diplomacy and the deputies are trying to convey that this is an extremely narrow perception of war. We call for aid and international support for Ukraine to be part of the general Euro-analytical strategy of forcing Putin to a just peace on the basis of the UN, recognition of the territorial integrity of Ukraine. The components of this strategy are the invitation of Ukraine to NATO, the closing of the Ukrainian skies by the Alliance forces, the removal of any restrictions on strikes deep into the territory of the Russian Federation, the filling of the security system with such types of IPT that will affect the ability of the Russian Federation to wage war. All this is clearly stated in the doctrinal documents presented by President Zelensky. Their implementation directly depends on the political will of the leadership of European states and the leadership of the United States. As for -Oreshnik- and other modified samples of the enemy's OiVT, this is a direct consequence of the ineffectiveness of sanctions against the Russian Federation. Visible proof of this is that the lethal weapons used by the enemy against the civilian population contain between 60 and 80 percent foreign components. Other reasons are that Ukraine has so far received all the necessary samples of long-range weapons, and we do not have the right to use those in the arsenal deep into the Russian Federation against the enemy's military-industrial capabilities. —The appearance of North Korean servicemen on the battlefield as part of the occupying forces. Someone says that this is an indicator of the weakness of the Russian Federation, the inability to independently achieve the goal of the so-called SVO. Other analysts say, on the contrary, that the indicator of power, the power to unite evil. What opinion do you hold? - Each of the following statements contains truth. Our unprecedented national resistance dispelled the myths about the greatness of the Russian Federation, its armed forces, which were ranked third in the world. Yes, the enemy is insidious, capable of getting stronger, but, as the Ukrainians proved, he is not invincible. Yes, the enemy has significant resources and power, but they are vulnerable to Ukrainian cotton, and therefore the enemy is not invincible. It became obvious to everyone, even Putin and his henchmen, that the Russian Federation alone is incapable of occupying Ukraine and continuing the war. The fragile economy, the defense industry is facing a number of serious problems, its entire sectors are on the verge of bankruptcy. These are eloquent indicators of Russia's weakness and the main reasons for Russia's vassal dependence on China in the supply of energy resources, receiving military aid from North Korea, Iran. But the open participation of the North Korean military in the war against Ukraine should not only be perceived as a real factor in strengthening the enemy. This is also a danger of a strategic, global scale. Moscow is multiplying the subjectivity of the North Korean regime, which until recently was on the outskirts of major politics. The Kremlin seeks to strengthen its global subjectivity, to apply the tactics of the good cop and the bad cop. That is, he wants to frighten the world with the strengthening of North Korea, show his ability to influence Pyongyang and, against this background, look attractive for negotiations and compromises taking into account his own vested interests. —In the context of the difficulties faced by the enemy, it is worth mentioning that from the end of 2023, most analysts recognize a significant depletion of resources for the continuation of the war. This became almost the main reason why the struggle for the vision of its completion came to the fore in the information space. How can you comment on this? - War really requires colossal resources, its duration is known to all without exception to its participants. Today, the capabilities of our defense forces are heavily dependent on the security assistance and leadership of the United States, which in turn is derived, as you said, from the vision of ending the war. the kremlin daily produces tons of disinformation, grossly exaggerating its capabilities, distorts reality in every possible way, cynically and mercilessly manipulates the burdens of war. Moscow seems to offer a simple and quick solution to their end — pacification of its aggressive plans at the expense of Ukraine. The enemy's aspirations are obvious—to weaken the unity of partners, to convince them of the futility of supporting Ukraine. As for the Ukrainians, the effort is aimed at undermining national resistance from within through a destructive influence on Ukrainians' thoughts, attitudes, beliefs, attitudes towards the government, and perception of its decisions. - Can the restoration of the functioning of the Committee's page on the Facebook social network be considered as a countermeasure to the Russian information offensive? - Partly with this too. We consider the committee's Facebook page as another reliable source of information, its materials should contribute to increasing the media literacy of Ukrainians, their resistance to fakes and hostile IPSO. We aspire to ensure that the information on the committee's website does not give the enemy any chance of success in manipulating Ukrainian society on issues related to the committee. — What can Ukrainians expect from the results of the elections in the USA and the vision of the newly elected US President Trump and his team for the further course of the war? — First of all, let us recognize that the activities of the President, Ukrainian diplomacy, and parliamentarians ensure bicameral support for Ukraine. This is an extremely important factor for our defense capability. Yes, US President Trump really declared his intention to end the war in the shortest possible time. This completely coincides with the aspiration of Ukraine, but only with a significant addition - a fair conclusion. Today, the mass media is full of all kinds of statements and retelling of rumours. Some predict considerable support for Ukraine, others, on the contrary, the strengthening of Putin. I believe that it is necessary to wait for the official statement of the US leader. Kyiv and Washington maintain a working constructive dialogue, which, for obvious reasons, requires confidentiality. Therefore, it is unlikely that there is reliable information in the media. These are the thoughts of analysts, experts. But what I said above remains unchanged—we will be helped as long as we fight, as long as we are steadfast, persistent, unyielding in our pursuit of a just peace. —What legislation and committee decisions were most impactful to national defense and intelligence security in 2024?—Primarily, the mobilization bill. It was an urgent response to the security situation that developed on the front line and ensured a real strengthening of the defense forces. According to the information of representatives of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff, after the law came into force, the number of mobilized men improved dramatically, military registration data through the TCC and the -Reserve+- application were updated for millions of conscripted men. The list of positive changes can be continued. However, this does not mean that the law will not be amended. Everything will depend on the development of the situation on the battlefield, in the defense sector, the initiatives of the Ministry of Defense, the General Assembly and the people's elected officials. There is no law that remains unchanged, frozen at the time of its creation. In the same context, I can mention the relevant changes to the laws regarding the following: In addition, a significant part of our work was devoted to the national defense industry. — This is about the national defense industry. How do you assess its capabilities and prospects for further development? - Our stability, successful defense and victory directly depend on the growth of the Ukrainian defense industry. Therefore, we not only hold cabinet meetings with the participation of representatives of ministries, defense industry institutions. The practice of business trips to relevant enterprises and institutions is widespread. At each of them, in a business-like, frank, acute and principled way, the challenges and opportunities of production processes in wartime conditions, ways of increasing capacity are discussed. Committee members also constantly visit exhibitions where the latest examples of OiVT are presented, economic forums. At such events, the priority is to attract foreign and domestic investments in the defense industry. We present convincing indicators that the national defense industry is increasingly establishing itself as a locomotive of the national economy, as an investment-attractive sector of the economy, in which more than 40 foreign companies are already actively operating. To a large extent, this is due to the global trends of relentless growth in defense spending in the world's leading countries, NATO, overall defense spending, and the prospects that these trends open for both the national defense industry and its investors. I would like to emphasize that we are not talking about abstract prospects, but about specific areas of investor participation in the strengthening of the defense industry. — The development of the defense industry can significantly contribute to the return of Ukrainians and keep specialists from emigrating. — I completely agree with you. Personally, I am a supporter of investment packages and not just in one or a few objects of the defense industry, but in the creation of a complete ecosystem, a defense industry hub on the basis of a system of industrial parks as a successful model of job creation, transfer of relevant skills and technologies, attraction of foreign direct investment and development of industry. In order to implement the above, great attention should be paid to the system of training specialists for defense industry enterprises, the formation of powerful ambitious national production forces, scientific and engineering potential with a market mindset, as they say, sharpened to self-realization in Ukraine and for the sake of Ukraine, achievements in competitive conditions. This is the future technical intelligentsia, which over time will determine the business card of Ukraine as a dynamic industrial country. Only by joint efforts will we turn challenges and difficulties into our capabilities. - As the Chairman of the committee, you have a number of meetings with your colleagues. What are the main directions of inter-parliamentary activity? All inter-parliamentary activity takes place in the fairway of the tasks set by the President of Ukraine for Ukrainian diplomacy. It is about the promotion of Ukrainian interests, international support for the Ukrainian Victory strategy presented by our President. One of the main tasks is to facilitate the receipt of security assistance in the volume and composition required by our defense forces. We constantly remind and convince our partners that the unprovoked large-scale aggression of the Russian Federation is not only about geography. This is primarily about a mixture of ethnocide and genocide against Ukrainians, and later Europeans. Intercommittee relations with colleagues from foreign countries are being developed so that Ukraine does not disappear from the radars of legislators' attention, so that there is their support for Ukrainian foreign policy initiatives and needs. It has become a good tradition that individual representatives of parliaments consider it an honor to visit the front line personally, accompanied by members of the committee, to meet with the Defenders. Such trips are accompanied by significant mini-packages of aid to specific units, which significantly strengthen Ukraine's informational position in certain countries. During such trips, our colleagues can see for themselves what their cities will look like if they do not help Ukraine, if it does not stand up. A separate direction of interparliamentary interaction is the support of the national defense industry, creating conditions for scaling up the experience of foreign companies that invest in the Ukrainian defense industry and open their own production facilities in Ukraine. We are making efforts to allocate funds by partners for the purchase of products of Ukrainian OiVT manufacturers on the principle of -buy from us for us-. The priority is the production of Ukrainian missiles, drones for various purposes, ground robotic complexes to support operations on the battlefield, electronic warfare systems. —How categorical are the partners for Ukraine to lower the mobilization age to 18? What is your point of view on this issue? - Referring to my experience and the experience of my colleagues on the committee, I can say that there was never any categoricalness or even a discussion on this matter. Yes, sometimes parterres showed interest in whether there is a reduction in the mobilization age in our plans. But this never determined the nature of our conversations in the discussion of security assistance to Ukraine. In my opinion, at the present time, Ukraine, first of all, needs an appropriate number and types of OiVT within the framework of security assistance, compliance by partners with the agreed terms and volumes of their supply. The priority is the full armament of all formed units. In general, if we talk about equipping the defense forces with the required number of mobilized personnel, then this should be considered not only in the context of lowering the mobilization age. Reserves should be used to improve the system of incentives for the contractual form of joining the army, improve the recruiting company both at the level of the Ministry of Defense, the General Staff, and the units themselves, as well as the conditions of military service. — In conclusion, would you like to wish our readers and everyone who fights or works for Victory? — First of all, great gratitude to everyone who fights or works for Victory, their families and relatives for the family supporting their sustainability. Peace, respect, independence are not inherited and are not guaranteed for the future. Each generation faces extremely difficult challenges and threats, finding ways to neutralize them. We do not have the right to make a mistake, on the contrary, our generation is obliged to correct the historical mistake of the past. And we will all achieve this together.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/23/vysokotehnologichnist-suchasnoyi-vijny-oryeshnik-ta-vybory-u-ssha-intervyu-oleksandra-zavitnevycha/	2024-12-23T00:52:17-08:00

This was reported on the Espresso broadcast by a representative of the communications service by the public of the -Charter- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev. According to Degtyarev, in the area where the -Charter- stands, the main enemy tactic is the infiltration of small groups. Such attacks resumed for one reason - during enemy mechanized assaults, the Defense Forces burned the equipment and destroyed many paratroopers. -Small groups are literally two, three, four people moving around on foot during the main day. Because we see that they lack night vision. They use the fog and bad weather to catch the -windows- when there may not be surveillance drones of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the air,- said Volodymyr Degtyarev.

-Meat- and on stolen -Zhigulya-: a scout -KPD- told how the enemy attacks near Pokrovsk	Senior sergeant Vyacheslav Vishnevsky with the call sign -KPD-, who currently holds the position of platoon commander, told ArmyInform about his combat path from the very beginning of repelling the Russian aggression against Ukraine in 2014, the modern tactics of the Russian occupiers near Pokrovsk and the importance of the commander's example for motivating soldiers reconnaissance of the 117th separate heavy mechanized brigade. Vyacheslav received his call sign -KPD- during the Revolution of Dignity, in which he participated from the very beginning of the events at the end of November - in December 2013. Then the future scout, like the vast majority of Ukrainians, felt that the country was going in the wrong direction. — It was December 2013. I just couldn't stay away when I saw what was happening in our country. The course of Ukraine is definitely not with the Russians, because they are hungry people who are unable to restore order in their own country. Historical examples perfectly demonstrate with whom, how and in which direction to move - with the civilized world or with the world of dictatorship, - he recalls. The military man is convinced that even then Russia was on the way to entering the category of the most disgusting totalitarian regimes in the world. He mentions the example of North and South Korea, which now belong to different worlds, and notes who Putin was ultimately forced to choose as allies. — During the Maidan, I got to know guys from the Right Sector. Then there was such an -infectious- atmosphere among these people who had an ideological attitude to their work that I wanted to stand on an equal footing with them. And I did all the tasks that were assigned to me with maximum efficiency, showed the maximum efficiency ratio (in Russian - -coefficient of useful performance - KPD- - ed.), - he continues Vyacheslav, explaining where the call sign came from. He wanted to get to the -Right Sector- from the very beginning, but he was afraid that he would not reach the level of requirements and training, so he joined the Maidan Hundred of Self-Defense. However, fate soon decided everything for him. — After a few days, the hundred was integrated into the ranks of the -Right Sector-, which I was very happy about later. This allowed me to be filled spiritually, to meet extraordinary people who were examples of a strong life, says the scout. Then, together with his brothers, Vyacheslav went to the East of Ukraine to defend our state from Russian aggression. — First of all, we went through, so to speak, the course of a young fighter, now we would say — BZVP. We had to learn from scratch, most of us had no military experience. I will never forget that atmosphere, because I tried my best to reach the level. There were not enough weapons, they were issued only to the best or to those who already had experience, says the senior sergeant. Among the senior comrades and experienced fighters, he recalls, there were many who had already opposed Russian imperialism during the struggle for the freedom of Ichkeria in the 1990s and the repulsion of Russian aggression against Georgia in 2008. -You had to shorten the distance to their level very quickly, literally in a month-and-a-half, so that you, too, were entrusted to participate in combat missions, so that you were given such an honor,- says the soldier. It fell to the future scout to begin his military career in the Pokrovsk region, which was then still called Krasnoarmiisk. By a coincidence of fate, he is now fighting in the Pokrovsky direction. The date of his combat baptism - May 11, 2014 - was forever engraved in the soldier's memory. — It was May 11, the very day of the pro-Russian obscurantism — a pseudo-referendum against Ukraine. The Armed Forces did not control Krasnoarmiysk at that time, roadblocks stood only on the outskirts of the city. We were assigned the task of taking control of administrative buildings and stopping pro-Russian speeches, - the military man recalls. Since then, on this day, he remembers his fallen brothers, reflects on the path he has traveled and ponders the future. After all, the soldier is convinced, reflection on such dates is important in order to understand the context of the events of one's own life and to remember fallen comrades. The scout remembers the further battle route in dotted lines - Karlivka, Pisky, Avdiivka, Krasnohorivka, the famous raid, Amvrosiivka, Savur-mohyla&#8230; — We were constantly sent to assault groups. Together with the Armed Forces, we liberated settlements in Donetsk region. After that, I spent about three weeks at the Donetsk airport together with the 79th air mobile brigade, I also met very worthy people there, Vyacheslav recalls. And then the war changed, he says. After the Minsk agreements, the artillery stopped working and the distance between the Ukrainian defenders and the enemy rapidly decreased not even to hundreds, but to tens of meters. — The distance between infantry units has sometimes decreased to 50 meters. It was a time to quickly occupy the gray areas, of which there were many. I had to work in Marinka and occupy gray areas. Together with the infantry of the Armed Forces, they stormed the Avdiyiv industrial zone, he recalls. The industrial zone directly faced the Yasynuvat junction, which played the role of a key transport artery for the supply of Donetsk. So cutting her was an extremely important task. Vyacheslav joined the Armed Forces of Ukraine on his own, dedicating four years of his life to the volunteer movement. With respect, he remembers Dmytro Kotsyubail and the company in which he served with him, but he decided to join the Armed Forces regardless of the organization. — Integration is very difficult. Sometimes commanders and ordinary volunteers are not very ready to command military formations and serve as part of them in the ranks of the Armed Forces, because they do not understand the order of what and how happens in the army, he explains. There are some successful exceptions of the integration of entire units, Vyacheslav notes, but it was the servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who took an active part in the development of these military organizations, who directed the volunteers in the necessary direction. Therefore, he considers joining the army to be a good option. - I felt the beginning of a full-scale war half a year before February 2022 - I began to write poems on this topic, memories of hostilities flared up very strongly. At that time, I was in a relationship with a girl, she lived in Mariupol, where all my combat equipment was located. So I asked in advance to send everything to me, - recalls the scout. With the beginning of the -wide-scale- Vyacheslav was invited to the 6th separate rifle battalion, which was formed from volunteers. Many of the men had no military training, but were extremely motivated. - Not a single line-up was complete without someone leaving the formation with the commander's permission and asking when we were going to go to reclaim our land. -I saw a mass of charged people who were almost without equipment, with weapons that were many times inferior to the enemy, and were ready to tear the enemy with their hands,- the scout recalls. Comparing the modern war with the previous combat experience, the scout notes that now the fighting is changing extremely rapidly. — Since 2014, the war has changed on average about once a year. At first, it was strongly influenced by the Minsk agreements, then reconnaissance drones became more widespread. But from the beginning of the full-scale invasion to the present day, the war has already changed many times and has a very different character depending on the shade of the battle line, says the intelligence officer. Now, according to Vyacheslav, the nature of hostilities changes approximately once every three months or once every six months, depending on the section of the front. This is influenced by both technological innovations and a change in the tactics of actions of both the Ukrainian defenders and the Russian occupiers. — Now the vast majority of fellows with whom I have to perform the most difficult operations are those who have recently joined the military. We carry out operations with high dynamics, high intensity of combat operations, carry out counter-offensive actions - all this is successfully carried out by people who have not previously been in the military, Vyacheslav says. The main ones, in his opinion, are motivation, training and the example of a commander who is able to give fighters self-confidence by his own actions and example, to give them a charge that will allow them to go into battle and win it. — Commanders are divided into two types: the one who says -let's attack!- and the one who says -follow me!-. For me, all people are motivated, we just need a clear framework, an ideological component is needed, people need to know why, for what, for whom they are here - and there will be no problems with motivation. We motivated all the people who came to this level. When they saw that they were able to effectively carry out combat tasks, then there was no stopping them, he says. — Now in the Pokrovsky direction we encountered a change in enemy tactics. If he does not succeed in the directions of the main attack, then he changes his tactics - they either stupidly and rudely push forward, not sparing personnel, then somewhere they connect more artillery, and somewhere they conduct a -creeping- war, trying to throw a group to our rear, - says Master Sgt. However, most often the occupiers resort to the infamous -meat- assaults, first used en masse by the -Wagnerians- in Bahmut. The fighter says that sometimes his unit and his comrades destroyed up to a company of the enemy in a day, and the Russians relentlessly pressed into battle. - Their tactics are quite primitive - they send infantry without artillery training and we destroy them. The next day they send the same number of infantry and they are routed again. On the third day, they send twice as many infantry and eliminate them again, the scout says. However, having scouted the firing positions of the Defense Forces due to such actions, the Russians then throw infantrymen on high-mobility vehicles into the assault with the goal of shortening the distance as much as possible and proceeding to assault actions. — They send people to storm on stolen Zhiguli from Selidovoy, on any other civilian vehicles not equipped with any protection for combat missions. Their goal is to shorten the distance as much as possible so that they are not destroyed on the approaches, explains the senior sergeant. Sometimes fire contact with enemy infantrymen took place at a distance of 5 meters, but Vyacheslav proudly claims that the battalion in which he is fighting in the Pokrovsky direction has not lost a single direct battle. During the conversation, one can feel how Vyacheslav has changed over the decade of war - from a civilian lad, he has gone through the path of becoming not only a courageous professional soldier, but also a responsible and skillful commander. The scout not only resolutely goes into battle himself, but also confidently leads fighters who will not hesitate to follow an experienced commander and a trusted comrade. From Krasnoarmiisk to Pokrovsk, scout Vyacheslav's -efficiency- as a professional soldier increased enormously.

-Lost-, but did not lose strength: the Czech Republic developed a lightweight model of a machine gun	According to the developers of the new weapon, its key features are a quick-change barrel and a trigger selection of fire, which allows you to conduct single shots. A 30% reduction in weight compared to other light machine guns of the same category allows each operator to carry more ammunition or other necessary materials, ArmyInform notes. According to the experts of the defense market, who shared their findings with the authors of the defense portal Army Recognition, thanks to the easy, but of rugged construction, the PZD Mk24 minimizes recoil, allowing machine gunners to target distant threats with precision and control. The machine gun is chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO and these models are available with 16-inch or 14-inch barrels, providing weapon lengths of 919-1001mm and 868-950mm, respectively. Weighing only 5.2 kilograms, this machine gun reflects the desire of the DSS engineers for mobility without compromising on performance. The launch of this model of weapons into the series marks progress in the DSS range, which already includes the widely presented PZD 556 model, which is also used by the Ukrainian Defense Forces. In particular, as declared the official portal of the domestic defense department, in February of this year The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine issued registration certificates for another 20 samples of foreign-made small arms. Among them, as reported by the Deputy Minister of Defense, Lieutenant General Ivan Gavryliuk, there is also a PZD 556 machine gun. Meanwhile, with the PZD Mk24 machine gun, DSS gunsmiths seek to revise the balance between firepower, portability and ergonomic design in modern weapons. This new weapon resembles the FN Evolys produced by FN Herstal from Belgium, about which in one of its previous materials told our editors. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that this new Czech light machine gun is designed to compete with the Evolys. One of the main advantages of the PZD Mk24 is a 30% weight reduction compared to other light machine guns in this category. This lightweight design allows soldiers to carry additional ammunition or critical equipment, increasing their operational endurance and flexibility. Despite the reduced weight, the PZD Mk24 does not compromise on durability or functionality, as it has a quick-change barrel and a trigger with a selectable fire that allows for both single and burst fire. DSS has also developed a minimalist feed mechanism for the PZD Mk24, which ensures that accessories such as optics and other equipment mounted on the Picatinny rail remain securely in place and maintain their accuracy even during prolonged firing. A free-floating Picatinny rail system in combination with a one-piece receiver improves heat dissipation along the barrel, maintaining performance during extended engagements. This machine gun features a four-position adjustable gas regulator based on a long-stroke piston mechanism that allows operators to adapt to specific operational needs. With a maximum firing range of 1,200 meters and an effective firing range of 600 meters, the PZD Mk24 is a versatile weapon capable of meeting the demands of a wide range of combat operations. Finally, the PZD Mk24 includes integrated folding sights for quick and practical use in the field. DSS's attention to weight reduction, durability and performance underscores the company's commitment to innovation in the defense sector, offering highly effective and maneuverable weapons for soldiers in today's challenging combat environments. With the introduction of the PZD Mk24, DSS reinforces its commitment to advancing firearms technology through innovative design. Addressing the critical operational challenges facing today's soldiers, such as fire, recoil and heat management, DSS aims to create a new standard for light machine guns adapted to today's combat scenarios.

In Ukraine, no one announced a reduction in the cost of prosthetics for the military: Moscow distort...	-People lost their limbs not because of the state, but because they were just unlucky. Therefore, there can be no claims against the state,- fake users cite a fictional -quote- from the minister. In fact, no one in Ukraine has announced the government's plans to reduce spending on prosthetics and military rehabilitation. Viktor Lyashko's quote, as well as the information about reducing the cost of prosthetics, is nothing but a fake. Neither on the official website of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, nor in the media, nor on Minister Lyashko's personal pages in social networks are there any quotes or news that are at least slightly similar to the above-mentioned -reduction plans- from the state. On the contrary, it turned out that next year Ukraine will allocate even more funds for prosthetics and rehabilitation of civilians and military personnel. According to the budget, in 2024, 4.3 billion UAH were allocated for primary prosthetics and means of rehabilitation, which is 40% more than last year. In 2025, this amount will increase to UAH 4.6 billion. UAH 1.1 billion is also provided for high-tech prosthetics. 5.7 billion hryvnias were allocated in the budget for rehabilitation services, and they remain free for military and civilians. Russian propagandists spread such fakes in order to deepen Ukrainian society's distrust of the state and its social programs. Such disinformation is aimed at discrediting the Ukrainian authorities, accusing them of alleged indifference to the injured military, spreading panic and disillusionment among the military and their families. This fake is also used to divert attention from the real problems of the Russian side.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/23/v-ukrayini-nihto-ne-zayavlyav-pro-skorochennya-vytrat-na-protezuvannya-vijskovyh-moskva-perekruchuye-fakty/	2024-12-22T20:20:17-08:00

The empire of lies - the Russians write North Koreans as Tuvans in their documents	This was reported on December 22 by the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to the decrypted data, the real names of the destroyed North Koreans are Bang Guk Jin, Lee Dae Hyuk and Cho Cheol Ho. According to Russian documents, they are Kim Kang Solat Albertavich, Dongnk Dzhan Suropovich and Belek Aganak Kap-oolovich. SSO operators continue to destroy the enemy, in particular, three more soldiers from the DPRK in Kurshchyna and took possession of their documents. -These military tickets do not have all stamps, photos, patronymics are given in the Russian manner, and the place of birth is signed as the Republic of Tuva - the homeland of the war criminal Shoigu. But the most interesting thing is the signatures of the owners. They are made in Korean, which shows the real origin of these soldiers. This case once again confirms that Russia resorts to any methods to hide its losses on the battlefield and to hide the foreign presence,- the SSO said in a statement. SSO fighters continue to track down and destroy mercenary units, disrupting the enemy's plans.

The enemy does not pay wages to porters	This is reported by the Center of National Resistance. While Russian propaganda talks about -improvement- with the arrival of the invaders, the reality is somewhat different. The humanitarian crisis continues in the region, which makes residents increasingly dependent on the Kremlin's policies. Yes, port workers in Berdyansk do not receive salaries. It is worth noting that the port itself, like the neighboring port of Mariupol, is actually standing. From time to time, the ports take out the looted grain, but the total cargo turnover is hundreds of thousands of tons per year, which is a pittance with millions by 2022. These figures speak of the true economic situation at TOT. Russians destroy everything they touch, exporting only lies to the whole world. We remind you, invaders are recruiting Ukrainian schoolchildren to Russian universities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/22/vorog-ne-platyt-zarplatu-portovykam/	2024-12-22T08:54:23-08:00

About this he announced on his official website. -To be the ambassador of Ukraine, to be a Ukrainian diplomat, is to be a person who can answer absolutely specifically the question of what exactly you did to bring peace closer, to protect the interests of Ukraine and Ukrainians. The next year will be crucial in terms of this task. We must do everything to make 2025 a year of peace for Ukraine,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi emphasized. The President called for building relations with key partners - the USA and European countries, responding to changes in the internal balance of forces and moods in the Middle East, the Gulf region, North Africa, the Sahel, and Latin America, promoting the interests of Ukraine in relations with China, India, and other countries Asia, develop a real partnership with Japan and more meaningful relations with Korea. -There are hundreds of directions of relations in the world in which Ukraine needs a real, concrete, tangible result. And this is exactly your job: to be in all the necessary offices, to be in the media, to be in communication with all the people necessary for Ukraine, to be understood so that Ukraine has the necessary result,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. Separate directions are the European Union and everything necessary for full membership and content of work with NATO. -Partners should know what Ukraine can give to the Alliance, why it will be better for everyone and how it will stabilize global relations. An alliance for Ukraine is achievable, but it is achievable only when we fight for this decision at all the necessary levels,- the Head of State emphasized. Another key task for the next year is to establish systematic work on all aspects of peace justice for Ukraine. It is about Russia's responsibility for the war, sanctions against the Russian Federation and the search for those Russian assets that have not yet been frozen. -Also, your task is to work as much as possible with all partners who are already investing or may become investors in our domestic Ukrainian arms production, in our joint reconstruction projects,- added the President.

The Gvozdika self-propelled gun can hit the enemy at a distance of up to 16.6 km. But even such a powerful technique requires taking into account a number of factors - from the quality of the charge to weather conditions. Four fighters are currently working in the ACS crew. The command ensures their interaction with infantry units that are on the front line. Among the memorable combat episodes, Shvydkiy recalls the case when his -Carnation- destroyed a cluster of occupiers. -There were specific goals, and we had to work very quickly on manpower and equipment.

Keeping the discount rate will accelerate the destruction of the Russian economy	This is reported by /a> Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The decision to raise the rate may be taken at the next meeting in February 2025 in the event of continued -overheating- of the Russian economy. In fact, the preservation of the discount rate has a political nature and was adopted under the pressure of some representatives of political circles, as well as Putin himself, who during the -direct line- publicly stated that he hoped for a -considered decision- by the Central Bank. Currently, inflation indicators in the Russian Federation are much higher than those observed before the previous increases. Against this background, deepening of crisis phenomena in the Russian economy and more destructive consequences than in the case of an increase in the discount rate are predicted. Putin's policy is leading the aggressor country to economic collapse. We remind you that the G7 countries are discussing the possibility of a complete ban on processing of Russian oil.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/22/zberezhennya-oblikovoyi-stavky-pryshvydshyt-rujnacziyu-rosijskoyi-ekonomiky/	2024-12-22T01:36:08-08:00

All business entities, so to speak, are in the -state- ownership of the so-called -LNR-, but not paying bills is in their blood. After 9.5 years of waiting for funds and the impossibility of issuing a pension, they decided to turn to the Russians for a subsidy. Multimillion-dollar debts remain to the miners of other enterprises of the occupied Luhansk region. Before the invaders had time to introduce new, minute-by-minute pricing conditions for the residents of the front-line settlements, the signal deteriorated where they went to call dozens of kilometers from home. For example, residents of Siversko-Donetsk used to actively travel 15 km to Smolyaninovoy and could make the necessary call from there. Now and there the connection has almost disappeared.

The adversary continues the forced passporting of the population of the TOT of Ukraine	This is reported by Center of national resistance. Enemies of Ukraine refer to such a process as -care for the local population-, but in fact such measures are a criminal instrument of subjugation, control and destruction of the national identity of Ukrainians. Thus, according to the norms of international law, the forcible imposition of citizenship is a violation of the Geneva Conventions. However, the occupation authorities ignore these principles, resorting to intimidation, discrimination, and blackmail to force TOT residents to accept Russian passports. However, for those who do not want to receive a Russian passport, the occupation authorities are trying to limit people's basic rights. This applies to a number of restrictions on receiving medical services, social benefits, etc. Also, without a Russian passport, citizens lose their movable and immovable property. In addition, the enemy is actively working on the young population, forcing them to accept Russian citizenship. Therefore, the occupation goals are the usurpation of power and the destruction of identity. Thanks to passporting, the enemy -legitimizes- the occupation, and presents the residents of TOT as -citizens of the Russian Federation- in order to justify their crimes in this way. Along with this, through passporting, the occupiers get access to the personal data of residents, which allows them to better control them and suppress the resistance of the Ukrainian underground, which continues to work effectively under the temporary occupation. Despite the difficult circumstances in the TOT, the occupying power, which is involved in forced passporting and other crimes, will be brought to justice. The Ukrainian state, together with international partners, collects evidence of human rights violations at the International Criminal Court, so that everyone involved receives a fair punishment. We remind you, invaders are recruiting Ukrainian schoolchildren to Russian universities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/22/protyvnyk-prodovzhuye-prymusovu-pasportyzacziyu-naselennya-tot-ukrayiny/	2024-12-22T00:23:28-08:00

An attempt to save and hide the enemy's combat equipment failed, which led to its destruction by drone strikes. First, the enemy lost an infantry fighting vehicle, and then a tank was finished. Both units were completely destroyed beyond recovery. Due to the loss of equipment, the enemy's personnel, who were thrown into battle, could not conduct maneuvers and attack. He tried to hide in a forest strip, where a significant part of him was also eliminated by drone strikes. We remind you, during the past day, 186 combat clashes were recorded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/22/minusnuly-bronetankovu-grupu-na-kupyanskomu-napryamku-syly-oborony-pokazaly-uspishne-vidbyttya-shturmu/	2024-12-21T23:49:20-08:00
The G7 countries are discussing the possibility of a complete ban on the processing of Russian oil	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The goal is to reduce Moscow's ability to finance the Russian-Ukrainian war. Among the initiatives is a complete ban on the processing of Russian oil and a reduction in the price limit from the current 60 to about 40 dollars. USA. The readiness for such actions is connected with forecasts of an oil surplus on the world market in 2025. According to the estimates of the International Energy Agency (IEA), if the OPEC+ countries maintain the current level of production, in 2025 the supply surplus will amount to 950,000 barrels. barrels per day. If OPEC+ begins to reverse voluntary cuts from the end of March 2025, the surplus will increase to 1.4 million barrels per day. At the same time, according to JP Morgan forecasts, the growth of global oil demand will slow down from 1.3 million barrels per day in 2024 to 1.1 million barrels per day in 2025. We remind you, combat operations in Ukraine and the Middle East demonstrate the growing role of UAVs in modern armed conflicts. This has led to a sharp increase in demand for technologies that can effectively detect and neutralize such threats.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/22/krayiny-g7-obgovoryuyut-mozhlyvist-povnoyi-zaborony-obrobky-rosijskoyi-nafty/	2024-12-21T23:32:57-08:00
The invaders are recruiting Ukrainian schoolchildren to Russian universities	This is reported by Center of national resistance. In particular, the enemy is actively recruiting schoolchildren from the temporarily occupied territories to enter the Ural State University in Yekaterinburg. Traditionally, there are no benefits for schoolchildren from TOT. In this way, the Russians use any mechanisms aimed at the resettlement of peoples within the empire in order to assimilate them in the future. On the other hand, tourists from the Russian Federation continue to arrive at TOT, and the demographic composition of the population is changing.

A smart weapon with a specific name: an American company with the involvement of a Ukrainian present...	The Bullfrog Gun Turret robotic system, designed for effective detection, identification and destruction of drones of classes 1-3, combines advanced machine learning algorithms, modern sensors and proven kinetic technologies. The Bullfrog system includes a 7.62 mm M240 machine gun, the operation of which is integrated with advanced technologies such as computer vision and AI. This system is designed to effectively and economically neutralize enemy drones and is positioned as an alternative to more expensive anti-aircraft missile systems. -Recent advances in drone technology have made them more resistant to RF jamming. The only reliable way to disable them is to inflict kinetic damage that physically damages or destroys the UAV,- the developer's website says. The system is equipped with innovative sensors and Linux-based software that supports integration with various radars and control systems (C2). This ensures: The system's open architecture allows you to easily adapt to unique requirements and quickly update functionality. A key advantage of the Bullfrog Gun Turret is its intelligent threat detection system. It uses a large database trained on millions of annotated images, which ensures a false positive rate of less than 2% and identification accuracy even in challenging conditions such as poor visibility or obstacles. Autonomous modes of operation are complemented by the -man-in-circuit- function, which prevents unauthorized actions and ensures maximum security. Thanks to shot prediction, the system guarantees a high probability of successfully hitting the target with a minimum amount of ammunition. The Bullfrog Gun Turret is a compact and lightweight system, making it ideal for mobile operations or defense of mission-critical facilities. Operation from a standard 24V DC power supply allows for easy integration of equipment with vehicles. In addition, the system can operate in a passive mode, reducing the likelihood of detection during deployment. Bullfrog can operate in both autonomous and semi-autonomous modes, targeting UAVs weighing up to 600 kg, with a flight range of less than 180 meters and a speed of less than 250 knots. This development underscores the need for military forces to adapt to a new generation of threats, including low-cost but highly effective drones. The Bullfrog Gun Turret is an example of how modern technologies, including artificial intelligence, can significantly improve the efficiency and safety of military operations. It should be noted separately that a specialist from Ukraine is directly related to the presentation of this development. After all, it was computer artist Artem Pokutniy from Sumy worked on video for the American defense company Allen Control Systems, which created this robotic anti-drone turret. And among the enemy UAVs in this video, Russian kamikaze drones Geran-2 (Shahed) are quite easily recognizable. Autonomous machine gun system Bullfrog Gun Turret for destroying UAVs.

How models of military equipment are created: the manufacturer's story	The representative of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Yuriy Ignat, at one time noted that -models are also combat units maintained by humans. Their main task is to confuse the enemy. The enemy spends up to 4 million dollars to launch one Iskander missile. The model costs up to 25 thousand dollars, which is much cheaper than one Iskander. If we talk about -Kinzhal-, then a missile of this type costs up to 500 million hryvnias. Patriotic domestic companies joined the production of OVT models almost immediately from the beginning of the war. In particular, a number of enterprises have established the production of engineering structures that completely replicate the appearance of radar stations and artillery installations. So, how mock-ups mislead the enemy and force him to use expensive high-precision ammunition, ArmiyaInform asked Mr. Oleg, a representative of one of the companies that specializes in the production of anti-aircraft mock-ups: -One of the mock-ups we make can cost 100,000 hryvnias. And the real unit of military equipment, which we want to replace with this model, costs 5-7 million hryvnias. Therefore, our goal is to inflict material losses on the enemy. The cost of one -lancet-, for example, can be about 30 thousand dollars. And if this drone hits a model that costs 2-3 thousand, then the score will be in our favor. And in addition, this reduces the amount of ammunition the enemy has - this is a double benefit. The layout should not just resemble the contours of combat equipment, it should be very similar to it. If you were not able to mislead the enemy, that is, he recognized that this is not a real unit of equipment, then you will not achieve your goal, these are just wasted resources: both money and time. Therefore, the layout should be very, very similar, even have, if necessary, thermal radiation: for example, the engine should glow in the infrared range after application. But here it is necessary to observe the golden mean. That is, it is also not worth making mock-ups so similar that even from a distance of 5 meters it is not possible to recognize that it is a mock-up. Because the enemy, as a rule, now looks at all this through the eyes of reconnaissance drones from a height of about 300-500 meters. Therefore, in this case, unnecessary detailing is not necessary. Because it will lead to unnecessary expenditure of time, money and materials. Models are made from wooden shields, sheathed with existing equipment that fits the dimensions, made of plastic, and even inflatable. Each species has its pros and cons, and the balance between them is not always maintained. The layout should be easy to carry. Must stand alone, without constant maintenance. The enemy should not have time to notice the assembly process, so the layout must be assembled very quickly by the forces of the unit (crew). The crew of, for example, a self-propelled artillery installation (ASG) can load a disassembled model onto their self-propelled gun, drive to a certain point, unload the model and assemble the frame in a few minutes by pulling a cover over it. Track tracks will lead to this mock-up, the enemy will see not only the self-propelled gun mock-up, but also accompanying signs of unmasking, and will most likely strike this mock-up, and will not look for a real gun. For example, our enterprise, in order to make a high-quality mock-up, first makes a 3D model of a combat unit. The designer then passes this on to a builder who models the collapsible metal frame. The next step is for the 3D designer to overlay the surface texture of the equipment on the frame model. At this stage, we can choose the color or type of camouflage. Its surface will also show all the details of this machine, that is, tracks, rollers, hatches, exhaust pipes, scratches, peeling paint and dirt. We even have a print of the beret there, it is also printed. After agreeing on the design option, we translate these surface textures into a 2D dimension and divide them into fragments for printing on a plotter. Then the printed pieces are used to make a cover for this layout. Photo-realistic printing of the cover with the smallest details provides such detail that, being stretched on the frame, at 50 meters you can no longer distinguish this product from real equipment. About 20-30 units of such models can be produced per month. For example, the collapsible frame of the Gvozdika 2C1 ACS model will weigh about 200 kilograms, and the awning will weigh another 10-15 kilograms. All this will easily fit into any pickup truck. And it can be quickly transported to the right place. &#8230;So when the enemy hits mockups but doesn't hit our equipment, we save money on repairing or restoring that equipment. Or we don't buy new equipment abroad. And most importantly, the trained crew remains alive. Which will then harm the enemy.

the Russians wanted to return the St. George tapes to Ukraine through the court: what happened	About written by specialists of the StopFake project. They found out that, in fact, in the case -Borzykh v. Ukraine- (No. 11575/24), in which the applicant complained on the basis of various provisions of the Convention against the ban on wearing the -Georgian ribbon- in public places, the ECtHR decided that the ban on the use of the -Georgian ribbon- tapes- is justified and does not contradict the article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The decision emphasizes that the ribbon acquired a symbolic meaning associated with the aggressor in the context of the Russian-Ukrainian war. The ban was partial, allowing use in awards until 1991. The applicant, Yurii Borzykh, a former military man, claimed that he wanted to wear the ribbon on May 9. He was not able to prove that the ban significantly affected his life or caused psychological suffering. The ECtHR recognized the actions of Ukraine as lying within the state's discretion aimed at protecting national security during wartime. Therefore, the statement that the ECtHR recognized the banning of the -Georgian Tape- as a violation of freedom of expression is not true. This is an attempt by Russian propaganda to create a disinformation effect and discredit Ukraine's measures to combat symbols associated with enemy aggression.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/22/rosiyany-cherez-sud-hotily-povernuty-georgiyivski-strichky-v-ukrayinu-shho-z-togo-vyjshlo/	2024-12-21T20:22:33-08:00
The UAV platoon hit 15 pieces of equipment and almost half a hundred Russians. The story of Yakov, a...	Currently, the military man is successfully performing tasks in the area of ​​hostilities on one of the difficult front lines in the ranks of the 66th separate mechanized brigade named after Prince Mstislav the Brave. ArmyInform asked an army man about his combat routine, training, motivation, the way to the army, the destroyed enemy and more. Yakov joined the army in 2022, leaving his civilian life and the automobile business. He is 32 years old, originally from Sumy. He recalls that a few months after the beginning of the large-scale invasion, he went to the Military Commissariat and the very next day he went to training: -BZVP lasted more than a month (artillery specialty - ed.). There was both a theoretical and a practical part. At the training, the instructors provided a lot of really useful information and shared their own experience. And all this - in the shortest possible time.- The most vivid memory from BZVP, he recalls, is the practical part. -In particular, firing from different types of weapons. Some of them are a first for me. It was interesting and useful. But it would be good to extend the training period for new recruits, as well as update some disciplines for the modern realities of war. Perhaps this was implemented over the years, because my experience of the BZVP dates back to 2022,- says the military man. Subsequently, Yakov took an active part in the creation of a UAV platoon. -Our workflow went through certain stages of evolution and naturally grew into a full-fledged platoon. Therefore, its creation, let's say, was ripe and gave us an impetus for development. It is very good that the command supported us both at the stage of development and in the creation of a platoon. The complexity of our business creates a critical need for constant movement and improvement, and we are no exception. Every day the enemy tries to hinder work, it is necessary to constantly change, develop technical means, develop and implement new work methods, train people. This is the main difficulty,- the officer thinks. And at one time, it was under the leadership of the senior lieutenant that about 15 units of weapons and military equipment were hit, as well as 42 people of the enemy's manpower. -This was achieved thanks to our talented bombers and FPV operators in the first place. Of course, the best practice was during the winter and autumn active operations of the enemy. Here you can recall the BMP, full of paratroopers, which was hit even at the entrance. Or the burned and abandoned -Tiger-, abandoned by the Russian special forces. Or massive attempts to approach our positions by groups of infantry with further damage to them,- he says casually and succinctly about his work. We ask whether officers and commanders are afraid during combat sorties, and if so, how do they deal with it. -At first, everyone is afraid, but with experience and understanding of certain processes, fear recedes into the background. I will say this, the infantry in the positions is many times more difficult, and a lot depends on us to provide them with eyes and firepower. When clarifying what you, a military man, would like to advise civilians who, for various reasons, have not yet joined the Defense Forces, Yakov emphasizes that this is happening, in particular, including because of fear. -I will say that uncertainty and the unknown are more frightening. Therefore, you need to prepare and train to reduce the impact of these factors.- And we traditionally ask what a victory in the Russian-Ukrainian war will be for the military: -To have stable peace and confidence in a bright future for our children in a free democratic country.- Photo from Yakov's personal archive &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/22/vzvod-bpla-urazyv-15-odynycz-tehniky-ta-majzhe-piv-sotni-rosiyan-istoriya-yakova-zahysnyka-z-66-ombr/	2024-12-21T20:14:34-08:00

Oleksandr Shirshin, commander of the 47th mechanized brigade battalion, told on the ArmyTV stream about this. -The enemy began to use equipment, there were already several rolls. They are trying to conduct classic offensive actions. Before that, the Russians worked purely in groups on foot. Mostly they accumulated and then in small groups tried to storm and seize positions. But in the last few days, vehicles have started arriving, such as tanks, BMPs and armored personnel carriers,- Oleksandr Shirshin said. According to him, the intensity of the fighting has increased several times. At the same time, the Russians use well-trained units: marines and paratroopers. As reported by ArmiyaInform, fighters of the fire support company of the 47th mechanized brigade with the support of the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle uspih-shturmu/->conducted an assault, knocking out the enemy who was holed up in the house.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/21/pihota-zakinchuyetsya-vorog-pochav-kydaty-v-bij-na-kurshhyni-bagato-bronetehniky/	2024-12-21T11:14:53-08:00

Western SAM operators are not sent to the infantry — the Air Force	About this in his post on December 21 public relations officer of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Yuriy Ignat. -All types and branches of the Armed Forces send people to units and units of the Ground Forces, including the Air Force - the second largest type of the Armed Forces. This is a well-known fact. In addition, I would like to remind you that for more than a year the Air Force has been sending people to reinforce the front from the Combined Rifle Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, at the base of which servicemen first undergo training, and then, as part of units, are sent to difficult areas of combat operations,- he wrote Yuriy Ignat. He acknowledged that the transfer to the infantry creates personnel issues within the Air Force. -There are not enough people and this is also a well-known fact! But why talk about the ineffectiveness of anti-aircraft defense and that they began to shoot down less? After all, air defense is not only the Air Force! Air defense is a system of air defense of the state, which includes units of all the Defense Forces capable of firing at air targets, and infantry, and sailors, and helicopters... They are shot down, as they were shot down. The effectiveness of air defense against enemy UAVs remains at the level of 95 percent, taking into account those shot down and those that fall by themselves or under the influence of EW, the so-called -locationally lost-. For missiles, of course, the percentage is lower, taking into account the growth in the use of ballistics,- Yuriy Ignat explained. He stated that he checked with the personnel center. -And there they assured that no one has ever sent servicemen who were trained abroad on Patriot, Nasams or Iris-T to the infantry (there was one such case, and that was due to certain circumstances)...-, Yuriy Ignat said. He reminded that the Air Force is a high-tech type of the Armed Forces, in which there are really many people with unique specialties, with extensive work experience, and no one will replace them. -Therefore, the transfer to the -land route- is quite a painful process for the PS, this applies to both combat brigades and support units,- noted Yuriy Ignat and urged to avoid manipulation and distortion of facts. As reported by ArmyInform, the General Staff of the Armed Forces commented the statement that is spreading on the network about the -transfer of air defense to the infantry- and stated that they are unreliable and incorrect. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/21/operatoriv-zahidnyh-zrk-ne-vidpravlyayut-u-pihotu-povitryani-syly/	2024-12-21T09:42:00-08:00

Married, but living in parallel worlds: two pseudo-spouses were exposed at the border	About informs December 21 State Border Service of Ukraine. On the border with Poland, at the -Grushiv- checkpoint, border guards of the 7th Carpathian border detachment discovered a 33-year-old native of the city of Poltava and a 39-year-old young woman from the Poltava region. The DPSU noted that they got married, probably without the intention of creating a real family. -Because a woman has a disability, it gives her husband the right to cross the border. The pseudo-spouse allegedly went to Austria to visit her husband's friend. In communication with the border guards, the -family couple- could not answer a number of logical questions,- the border guards said. In addition, at the checkpoint -Krakivets- they exposed a 38-year-old native of Ivano-Frankivsk region and a 33-year-old native of Khmelnytskyi region, who also has a group of disabilities. According to legend, the newlyweds were on their way to visit their mother-in-law. -However, both of them told the border guards completely different stories from their married life, including dating and living. Border guards did not let the men across the border. The sincerity of feelings and the real motives for the marriage will currently be investigated by law enforcement agencies,- said the DPSU.

- When we jumped out, she shouted: - Help!--: the Russians shelled Slavyansk with anti-aircraft guns	The consequences of enemy shelling were recorded by ArmyInform. The occupiers hit the Cherevkivka microdistrict located on the outskirts of the city with two aerial bombs. The shelling took place around 16:50. The ammunition exploded at intervals of a few seconds in the neighboring streets. -One house was completely destroyed, dozens were damaged. Cars were also damaged,- succinctly informed about the consequences of the shelling by Chief Slav Yansk city military administration Vadim Lyakh. — Two KABs arrived. One on that street, after a minute there was a break, and one here. Shortly before five in the evening, says local resident Serhii, who was in his own homestead, located just 15 meters from the site of one of the hits. He helped rescue an elderly woman whose house was completely destroyed by an explosion. She miraculously survived and was quickly helped by local residents, but after the terrible explosion, the condition of the victim is serious. — When we jumped out, she shouted: -Help!-. At first there was no one there but us. Here she was, right near the pit, next to this log. She was sitting facing her, Serhii points to a deep ravine next to a completely destroyed house. There were children in houses near the hit sites who were under acute stress and in need of help. The youngest child is about 2.5 years old, she was with her parents at the time of the explosion. However, there are also older children who were struck at home alone and were helped by neighbors. Several nearby buildings near the epicenter of the explosion were also almost completely destroyed - their roofs were not only destroyed, doors and windows were knocked out, but also the load-bearing walls were moved. Obviously, some of them are not recoverable. The force of the explosions and the scattering of debris were such that windows and roofs were broken in dozens of buildings located a few dozen or even tens of meters away from the places of impact, and in those closer to them, strong outer doors and gates to yards were even torn off and bent. On a neighboring street, a bomb hit an open area near the houses, but the few closest ones were of little help, missing windows and parts of their roofs. — It is necessary to close the roof and keep the windows. It will rain, snow&#8230; Everything will be now&#8230; -We still can't get to the roof,- says a local resident. Her trouble is shared by all the neighbors, three dozen of whom the street gathers from. People are waiting for building materials from local authorities and charitable funds, with the help of which it will be possible to somehow temporarily patch up housing. There is no real repair yet - to begin with, at least the broken windows and doors must be closed, and the roofs covered.

The enemy did not spare his men before, he literally threw them to the slaughter. It is possible that these are North Korean mercenaries.

The soldiers of the 95th brigade of the DSHV have repeatedly watched how enemy attack aircraft calmly try to shoot down Ukrainian UAVs with assault rifles, and when the paratroopers begin to destroy them with rocket launchers, only then do they understand that these are not just reconnaissance drones. Convinced with their own eyes that the aircraft are dangerous, they start to fuss and try to hide. -Let's emphasize that we still have no confirmation that these soldiers are from North Korea. We will be able to confirm that these are Koreans when we capture them or find the relevant documents. -So far, we have received passports that state that these mercenaries are from the Republic of Tuva, which is a subject of the Russian Federation,- the report says.

They promise to silence -In the times of communism-: the US space force is preparing to deploy a sys...	According to the article, posted on the portal of the Bloomberg news agency, the system was developed by the American company L3Harris Technologies Inc. The latest equipment, which is declared under the name Meadowlands (-Meadows-, or in another version of the translation -Times of Communism- - Ukrainian), is a lightweight and mobile version of the existing -Counter Communications System-, which was officially put into operation in 2020. Meadowlands can receive software updates and is able to jam a wider range of frequencies, which makes its application more flexible. However, according to Bloomberg reporters, it will be delivered to the troops more than two years later than planned. The reason for the postponement is technical problems, which the manufacturing company did not disclose. Currently, according to representatives of the Space Force, -Meadowlands- has passed all the necessary system tests and is ready for delivery. This -jammer- is designed to interfere with spacecraft communication systems and acts directly on satellites. And unlike most similar stations, including the Russian 14Ц227 -Tobol-, which jams GPS in Europe, it is made on a mobile chassis. While bringing the Meadowlands EW station to combat-ready samples continued, their developer, the American giant L3Harris, managed to produce as many as five such complexes. They will be transferred to the electronic warfare unit of the US space force Space Delta 3, which specializes in protecting US space systems from profile threats. Specialists of IKK Defense Express noted that Meadowlands is the result of system development , which is known as CCS (Counter Communications System) 10 and its implementation in the Block 10.2 version, the contract for the development of which L3Harris received back in 2014. At the same time, the CCS Block 10.0 launch version was first deployed in 2004 in the number of three systems. Its upgraded Block 10.1 version had seven systems. At the same time, initially Block 10.2 was planned in the amount of 16 units, but apparently the order was doubled. And thanks to the mobility, as well as the number of such systems, which means the possibility of rapid deployment of Meadowlands in certain areas and the formation of continuous zones where the enemy will not have access to their spacecraft, the United States plans to gain a significant advantage over the enemy. In particular, leave it without satellite communication or navigation systems. After all, even in a publication in a Western publication, it is clearly stated that the main targets of this system are satellite groups of the Russian Federation and China. In particular, we are talking about military satellite communication equipment, which in the Russian Federation is represented by a fairly significant number of spacecraft, in particular, the Rodnyk-S series (similar to the civilian Gonets-M), Meridian-M relay satellites, etc. In addition, such systems as Meadowlands should also affect satellite navigation. In the period from January to March 2025, the Space Force will assess the readiness of the first five of the planned 32 units of the system for operational use. Coincidentally, the authors of the Bloomberg portal said that China now uses more than 300 remote sensing satellites with different sensors, -improving the Chinese military's ability to monitor US aircraft carriers, expeditionary strike groups and deployed air units,- the United States Space Force said in its next review of space threats. -Despite the fact that Russia has some of the most powerful remote sensing satellites in the world, their number in the Kremlin is limited compared to the United States and China,- the Pentagon said. &nbsp; Suppression systems for hostile satellite radio signals for the US Space Force from the L3Harris company.

There are no -unknown soldiers- in Israel: about the experience of the IDF in identifying the bodies...	— What is the algorithm of identification, collection of primary information for further identification of the bodies of dead soldiers in Israel? — Identification of the dead is based on four biometric features. These are the testimonies of friends, fingerprints, teeth and DNA. There are several situations where people die. For example, when a fighter died on the battlefield. He is alone or there are several of them, but they died, say from bullet wounds or something near them was torn apart, and the bodies remained intact. In this case, the recognition algorithm is as follows. There must be two people who will say that this soldier's name is so-and-so, and another is called so-and-so. Then they will be able to sign a special identification form. This happens if there are comrades or commanders with them who can recognize them. Then the testimony of two people can replace one of the biometric methods of identification, but in reality this is very rarely the case. - Why does this happen occasionally? - Simply because the dead are usually taken somewhere outside the battlefield. For example, if they are in Gaza, they are taken over the fence to Israel. There is a casualty collection station and other people working there who already have the appropriate forms and all the necessary equipment to do all the necessary procedures. And on the battlefield they simply prefer not to linger, and therefore such recognition happens infrequently. The evacuation of both the wounded and the dead is carried out by special teams whose main task is evacuation. Their task is to load the wounded into a vehicle as quickly as possible and take them to a safe place. This is usually any place where a helicopter can land, where it will fly in a few minutes and take the soldier to the hospital. This is the same -golden hour- for evacuation, which is well known all over the world. If it is the body of a dead soldier, it is taken to a collection point for the dead in the territory of Israel, and there the people from the Rabbinate take on further transportation. This is done only by the Military Rabbinate, because it is this institution in our country that is responsible for burials and for providing religious services to other religions as well. In addition, people who work at such a point have special devices that they carry with them, and they can take fingerprints for the first stage of biometric recognition right on the spot. These devices are connected to the service phone and the victim's fingerprints in electronic form are immediately sent to the database, and usually within, well, literally half an hour, an answer is received about the probable identity of the victim. - Why likely? - Two methods are required for definitive identification. When conscripts go to the army for the first time or to a reservist meeting, they are required to give their fingerprints. They must also have a panoramic photo of their teeth, photos of both jaws, and a blood test for DNA. Due to the fact that many of our citizens were once in the army, even civilians are in the army database. - What happens after that? - Fingerprints have been used for initial identification. And with some probability they found out that this is the same fighter. And as soon as a suspect is identified, officers are usually sent to the victim's family to inform them that this has happened. At the same time, the body of the deceased is transported to the military morgue and immediately informed that such and such a soldier, with such and such a personal number, is heading to you and is already on his way. This is done so that it is possible to already look in the military database, what information is available about these soldiers regarding, firstly, the teeth, and, secondly, to get from the database a DNA sample that this soldier once gave. When soldiers donate blood for DNA, nothing is done with these samples immediately, they are simply archived. they are analyzed only when there is a need for it. Analyzing a DNA sample takes several hours and is the slowest method of detection. By the time a soldier arrives at the morgue, we, that is, the identification team — dentists, doctors — already roughly understand what awaits us. We know if we have pictures, if we can even try to identify from the teeth or pictures, if there are none at all, and we don't even have to look at the teeth first, but immediately take DNA and things like that. Or at all they tell us that his friends have identified him, there are fingerprints and everything, and you just have to examine the corpse, record all the injuries and everything, and you can send it to the funeral team. That is, the task is actually quite difficult, because according to the Jewish religion it is very important to bury the deceased as soon as possible. This, of course, depends on the wishes of the family, sometimes there are relatives abroad who need to come. But there were cases when a soldier died during the day and the family expressed a desire to bury the same night. And we left for the funeral at night, at 23:00-00:00. — Vladislav, one more question. Let's say it's a person who has suffered a landmine blast injury. The face is distorted, the jaws are broken, a fragment flew into the face. That is, it is impossible to take a picture of the teeth. Fillings were mixed up there, part of the teeth were lost, a piece of the jaw was lost. How do they do it in such a case? - First, when we receive casualties after explosions, usually if there is a fragment of the jaw, I, as a dentist, can recognize by the anatomy of the teeth which teeth they are. Even if there is one human tooth lying in front of me, I may not know who it belongs to, but I know what tooth it is by number. By the way, an individual tooth can also be sent for DNA analysis. If we are talking about explosive injuries, then we have a different problem, because according to the Jewish religion, all the pieces of a person must be buried together. And so it's usually about doing a lot of DNA samples from different tissues and then matching them with the initial DNA sample of this or that soldier and deciding that it's his, and maybe it's not his, but it's his. a friend This happens when a crew dies or when several soldiers die nearby. We had an explosion of an armored personnel carrier in which there were 10 people. Unfortunately, no one could be identified by their teeth, and a lot of samples were compared for DNA with the sole purpose of burying each one in his own grave.

How -Sovietness- and -Star Wars-: Sergeant -Lucas- about BZVP a quarter of a century ago and today	The sergeant-instructor of the 199th training center of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the call sign -Lukas- shared his experience and thoughts on the training of new recruits from ArmiyaInform. -Lukas- began his military career with his military service in 2000 - he served in the 95th separate airborne assault brigade. After completing the -term-, he signed a contract with the State Border Service, later also worked in a department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Despite peacetime, from a review of the specifics of the service, even before 2014, he gained serious combat experience. — in 2014, as part of the unified unit of the Zhytomyr region, he participated in the anti-terrorist operation, working then in the Shchastya district, Stanytsia Luhansk. And in 2017, he transferred to the newly formed 148th Artillery Division to the position of commander of the fire support department, the military man recalls. -Lukas- says that already at that time, the division began to turn to the use of UAVs, formed a platoon of unmanned aerial systems. After leading this unit, the military man of 2019 received training on working with UAVs at one of the training centers. At that time, it was about reconnaissance drones of the -wing- type, while drones of the copter type appeared much later - already after the beginning of a large-scale invasion. — We do not stand still. Even those complexes that have been in service since 2019 are being updated - manufacturers are improving the software, eliminating flaws. Even when we were in the OOS, they came to us on the front line, worked together with us. We took off and they watched, everything is going well, what are the problems in the application of the complex, says the instructor. He is convinced that the experience of using UAVs during the anti-terrorist operation and anti-terrorist operation became an important basis for the widespread use of drones after the beginning of a large-scale invasion: - I think that if there was no experience, it would be much more difficult. Those people who worked on the UAV in 2014-2015 taught us in 2019, and later we passed on our experience to the next ones. — Since 2019, my path as an aerial scout began. In 2021, we entered the zone of the Joint Forces Operation, and a large-scale invasion was met by the crew of reconnaissance UAVs at positions near Shchast. Then they fought for two months in the Severodonetsk region, says -Lukas-. Over time, the military man had to fly both large Ukrainian-made Furia UAVs and small Maviks and Autels. In the Zaporozhye region, he fought as a platoon commander of unmanned aerial systems of the artillery reconnaissance unit. After being wounded, VLK decided to leave the service in the Armed Forces, but decided that his knowledge and experience could be useful to new recruits. He is convinced that this can be done in the best possible way in the 199th educational center of the DSHV, because the most favorable conditions have been created for this. — We try to teach everything we know ourselves, we give more than is required according to the papers. As soon as there is some free time, we try to conduct additional classes. Everyone gives 100%, we pay a lot of attention to fire, tactical, engineering training, we study tactical medicine, says the instructor. Considerable attention is paid to combating enemy UAVs - bombers and kamikazes, because now a lot of enemy -birds- are regularly circling over the combat engagement line. -Lukas- is convinced that it is not enough to theoretically explain to the soldiers what should be done during a meeting with a Russian drone - the soldiers must automatically, without trying, perform the worked-out algorithm: - Everything must be practiced to the point of reflexes. A fighter does not have to stand and remember what he should do, what the instructor told him. He must first do, survive and remain intact, and then in a calm environment to think and understand what and why he did exactly what saved his life. — I have an older son, he is 17 years old. Therefore, recruits who come to us are like children to me. We want to give them everything they need to be able to save their lives during the fight, know and be able to know as much as possible - not only what is written in the program, but also everything that we know ourselves, -Lukas- emphasizes. The instructor is convinced that it is not age that is important in the attitude towards new recruits, but their perception not only as soldiers, but also as people who must not only protect Ukraine, but also return from the war alive. - This is one of the most important, in my opinion, elements of training - we must protect our boys. For this, they should be prepared with the highest possible quality. We are able to do this because all our instructors have combat experience, he assures. For some of the cadets over 40 years old, Lukas says, it can be difficult to get through the purely physical part of the training. Then it is necessary to facilitate something, to simplify the task a little. However, he is sure that the psychological adjustment and motivation of the fighters are more important than physical endurance. — Everything depends on desire, on attentiveness. If a fighter comes and prepares with the right attitude, age will not be an obstacle for him. If there is no mood, then nothing will help a young person, no matter how physically healthy he is, he says. In view of this, one of the tasks of the instructors is the psychological preparation of recruits, the heart of their will. To train a real fighter, the instructor must be not only a deep professional in his field, but also a psychologist and a teacher. Speaking about the changes in the Armed Forces, -Lukas- notes a significant improvement in material support, food, medical drugs, and the availability of the latest Western-made weapons. Comparing military service a quarter of a century ago with training today is like comparing the Soviet Union with Star Wars. — There are many changes for the better. It is enough to look at the provision of military personnel. When I served in 2000, there was almost no such provision. Now, a recruit has everything he needs, and if it's not the most expensive brands, it's still very high-quality, solid,- says the instructor, pointing to the line of cadets who are passing by us. He sees the same positive developments in the plan of training cadets. Now, says -Lukas-, there is no shortage of ammunition or other consumables during training - the fighters have everything they need to get quality training.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/21/yak-radyanshhyna-i-zoryani-vijny-serzhant-lukas-pro-bzvp-chvert-stolittya-tomu-i-sogodni/	2024-12-20T20:25:24-08:00
A fake about Santa Clauses from the TCC in Odesa: the quilters can't take it	First, what are Santa Clauses? This Soviet rudiment has long gone out of fashion. It is attended only by children from particularly wealthy families. Summons should be handed out in the costumes of St. Nicholas - this would be our way! It turned out that, in fact, this video has nothing to do with the work of the territorial picking centers. The recording shows volunteers who were conducting another charity event. Such fakes are used to undermine trust in the TCC and SP, create a negative impression of mobilization, and spread panic among the population. Propagandists often use similar manipulative techniques to distort real events and discredit the Ukrainian authorities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/21/fejk-pro-didiv-moroziv-z-tczk-v-odesi-vatnykam-ne-jmetsya/	2024-12-20T20:10:23-08:00

We see the activation of the occupier in the Kherson direction — the President	About this President said on December 20 during an evening address. He also said that today he listened to the report of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrsky, about the situation in Donetsk region and the Zaporizhia region. -Special attention is paid to the fighting in Kurshchyna: more and more North Korean soldiers have been killed there. And this shows that Russia is trying to pass off these North Korean soldiers as representatives of national communities living on the territory of Russia itself. This is Moscow's complete contempt for the indigenous peoples and for the Koreans themselves as well,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. He reminded that the Russian missile strike in the morning, which resulted in one death, damaged houses, the Church of St. Nicholas, as well as 6 diplomatic missions at once. -Obviously, such Russian madness should not be taken for granted by the world — everyday terror deserves ever-increasing pressure on the terrorist. Russia must answer, and even if they are led by a completely inadequate person, the Russian state, thanks to the pressure on it, must feel what reality is and how reality can punish international criminals. Greater sanctions against Russia are needed,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. He thanked all Ukraine's partners, who are responding to this and other Russian attacks by being ready to provide more air defense systems, more weapons that can protect against terrorists. -We have now returned from Brussels with new agreements on air defense. Also, Germany has already handed over an additional IRIS-T system — thank you,- the President said. He also informed about the meeting of the governments of Ukraine and Lithuania. -The new Lithuanian government is in full force in Ukraine for the first time immediately after the appointment, and this is a clear priority of Lithuania for the alliance between our countries; we in Ukraine appreciate it very much,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He announced that he had approved the list of new Ukrainian ambassadors. -I agreed to more than 30 decisions. Among them Nariman Dzhelyal - to Turkey, Alyona Hetmanchuk - representative of Ukraine in NATO, Andriy Melnyk - representative of Ukraine in the UN and others. These and other decrees will be issued soon, according to diplomatic procedures,- the President noted. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine discussed with a Czech colleague the training of Ukrainian brigades and the strengthening of air defense.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/20/bachymo-aktyvizacziyu-okupanta-na-hersonskomu-napryamku-prezydent/	2024-12-20T11:50:40-08:00
They take off and wait - the enemy has developed a special tactic for its fiber-optic drones	The head of the public relations service of the 110th mechanized brigade named after General Khorunzhy told on the ArmyTV stream Mark Bezruchka Major Ivan Sekach. -We missed this moment with optical fiber and, frankly, we don't know how to deal with it,- said Ivan Sekach. According to him, recently our BMP was hit, which was equipped with EW, but it is powerless against optical fiber. The enemy drone was hanging at a height of 2-3 meters and was just waiting for our equipment. The fighters managed to hear him, opened fire, but the drone was on the side of the sun, so they could not hit him. As a result, the BMP was burned together with the electronic bomb. Now the 110th brigade is fighting in the area of ​​Velika Novosilka in the south of Donetsk region. As reported by ArmyInform, the battalion of unmanned systems of the 110th separate mechanized brigade named after Colonel-General Mark Bezruchka greeted commemorating the Day of the Land Forces of Ukraine by destroying several units of the enemy's light vehicles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/20/vylitayut-i-chekayut-protyvnyk-rozrobyv-speczialnu-taktyku-dlya-svoyih-droniv-na-optovolokni/	2024-12-20T11:36:17-08:00

He came under fire, fainted, took the prisoner and went out to his people! — the incredible story of...	The post about the fighter was published on December 20 on the brigade channel. -We drive up to the trenches - they start working on us in batches. I jump out of the car and see a flash in front of me, another flash and darkness. Lost consciousness. Came to my senses. A fragment flew into the jaw below the ear and cut the right hand. I look around - but there is no one around. Probably, the Evac didn't notice me in the dark,- -Grandfather- said. According to him, the man had never had such fear. -The point was squeezed in such a way that words cannot convey it. When KABs, hailstones, and tanks are moving, it's all scary, but not so when you're left alone. This is the worst thing that can happen in war. Got to an empty dugout. Found cigarettes and water. Suddenly I hear a voice: -Is there anyone?-. I say: -Yes, yes! In the West!-. And I remove the fuse... And he shouts: -I'm a Russian, I've come from a dealer.- Fuck your mother, I was born in a shirt!-, -Grandpa- still violently experiences those events. It turned out that the Russian was a prisoner. -That's all, I think, Khan - I'll blink for a second and my neck will twist. But he was also wounded and contused. He says they don't have food or water there - he couldn't stand it, he chose captivity. We went to ours. That Muscovite was holding me back a lot - he was walking slowly, he hadn't even heard a scream yet, so he was constantly shouting. I say: -Shut up!-. And I'm thinking - now I'll quietly shoot him and that's it. He seemed to feel it, began to beg: -Don't shoot! I'm begging you, don't shoot.- And I could not It's not so easy to shoot a living person when you see him in front of you, even without a weapon,- -Grandfather- explains. On the way, they were met by an evacuation vehicle. -The doctors immediately recognized me and rushed to the Muscovite. I say that he is a prisoner. So they all went crazy there! It was then that I lost my point&#8230; I thought my heart would jump out. Feeling as if it was all a terrible dream, and now it's some kind of fairy tale.

The SBU exposed the involvement of Russian hackers in the cyber attack on the registers of the Minis...	About this announced t.v.o. Volodymyr Karastelov, head of the Cyber ​​Security Department of the SBU, during a briefing with the participation of the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, Minister of Justice Olga Stefanyshyn. -From the first minutes of the attack, specialists of the Cyber ​​Security Department of the SBU arrived on the scene and joined the work to localize the incident. The investigation is focused on three directions: repelling the attack, restoring the infrastructure and documenting this war crime,- said Volodymyr Karastelov. The SBU suspects that Russian special services, in particular GRU hackers, are behind the attack. Proceedings were opened under Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (violation of the laws and customs of war). Olha Stefanishyna reported that the activity of the registers was temporarily suspended, but all data were saved and will be restored.

The Central VLK told how many servicemen with limited fitness have already passed the review	He reminded that after the changes in the legislation, the term -limited fitness- no longer exists. And citizens who received this status by February 5, 2025 must undergo a review. This applies to both active servicemen and conscripted citizens. -After making the changes, we worked out a plan within the Armed Forces, counted all these people, distributed them evenly over periods and organized such a review. As of now, among active servicemen, more than 83 percent have already passed this review. We still have December and January. So we have to finish it by February 5,- Dmytro Miroshnychenko emphasized. As for the review of conscripts, i.e. civilians who received the status of -limited suitability- in a certain period, the numbers are somewhat smaller. But this comes with a lot more people to look at. -The number of people there is much larger. They must be reviewed by commissions of TCCs and joint ventures. Given that mobilization does not stop for a single day in our country and the commissions work with those who are mobilizing, the review procedure of limited conscripts is stretched over time. Therefore, the numbers there are somewhat smaller. But the process is ongoing,- noted Dmytro Miroshnychenko. As a reminder, the legislation currently provides for up to 5 statuses: — suitable for military service; — suitable for service in the TCC and SP, higher military educational institutions, logistics units, communications medical units, etc.; — temporarily unfit who need treatment or vacation; — not applicable with revision after 6-12 months; — unfit for military service As reported by ArmyInform, conscripts will be able to receive an electronic referral for passing the VLC through the Reserve+ application without the need to visit territorial recruitment centers.

Thanks to the repeated clarification of data, users will have the opportunity to change their personal data in the Auberig registry. Namely: phone number, e-mail address and residential address. -The law requires Ukrainians to notify the TCC every time there are changes in their data within a week. For example, residential address or phone number. This simple action took a lot of time, because you have to stand in line for several hours. With this service, we will save time for people and employees of the TCC,- said Deputy Minister of Defense for Digitalization Kateryna Chernogorenko. According to her, it will be possible to re-verify the data an unlimited number of times, but not more often than once every 7 days.

A new data protection method was added to Army+ and repeated authorizations were removed	About this reported on December 20 the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Already 500,000 servicemen use Army+. To protect data, the application periodically deletes user information and asks for re-authorization and confirmation of military service. This is a safeguard that prevents attackers from accessing the information in the application. In the new version, the data has cryptographic encryption, which strengthens the security of the application. Active users who log into Army+ at least once a month do not need to re-authorize. Eventually, the application will also save information for electronic reports, in particular, the Army ID of the commander or the title of the position, so that you do not have to enter them every time when submitting documents. -We received many comments and comments on the need for constant in-app authorization from our users. Thanks to cryptography technology, we have strengthened data security. And we no longer need to require re-authorizations for active users. Digital services from the state should be as convenient as possible,-, said Deputy Minister of Defense for Digitalization Kateryna Chernogorenko. A new criterion was also added to Army+, according to which the system will automatically check the status of a serviceman and allow entry into the application. This will speed up data processing and reduce the burden on operators. The number of successfully processed authorization requests will now automatically increase. -Make sure your app is version 2.0.5 or higher. Download Army+ only from Play Market and App Store. Links are also available on the official page of the application: https://aplus.mod.gov.ua/- , the Ministry of Defense said in a statement.

Ruined cities and high tariffs: the new reality of the occupied Luhansk region	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, head of the Luhansk OVA. According to information, in 2025 the occupying -Ministry of Construction and Housing and Communal Services- plans to create a capital repair fund. To do this, they will develop a legal framework and establish a minimum cost of the overhaul tariff.

According to the decision of the occupation authorities, mobile communications were turned off in these settlements. Residents are forced to travel 30-50 km from their homes to make calls. At the same time, one of the telecommunications operators introduced per-minute pricing, which significantly increases the cost of services. Mobile Internet costs 12 kopecks per megabyte, 1.8 rubles per minute to landline numbers, and 3 rubles to other Russian operators. For example, two or three hours of active use of a smartphone can be much more expensive than the previous subscription fee. The occupation administration continues to create artificial difficulties for the residents of the temporarily occupied territories, depriving them of basic services.

North Korean solitaire: an expert told whether the Kimchens are really so formidable	What threats does it pose? But are the soldiers of this country really as terrible as they are depicted in propaganda? Military expert Petro Chernyk said: &#8220;The defense forces of Ukraine cannot, of course, ignore the 11,000-strong corps (of North Korea - ed.), but along with that, as it turns out, North Korean soldiers can also die. Why is this important? Because Russian propaganda before the introduction of this corps raised the level of tonality to such an extent that, they say, these are some kind of soldiers who don't take a few bullets. If you look carefully at the video, where there is a direct fact of their deaths and injuries - by the way, quite high figures in the range of at least 500 people - then their equipment raises very, very huge doubts. And there is no need to talk about preparation at all. Why? Because the Russians used a classic infantry shaft without providing these units with almost any equipment. Several armored personnel carriers and trucks, as well as buggies, are not considered full support. The general conclusion in the combat component: does not affect this contingent on any very solid combat schedule. However, there is one dangerous thing about this North Korean solitaire. What does it consist of? Sources that I personally trust say that the North Koreans can deliver a whole range of mortars to the battlefield. Let me remind you that North Korea is the largest operator of 60 mm, 82 mm, 120 mm mortars. And they have a rather interesting Chinese development called the Type 63, a caliber of 107 mm: a kind of rocket-propelled volley fire system in a mortar version, which can inflict damage at a range of up to 8.5 km. There are fragmentation projectiles that fragment into more than 1200 fragments. This is quite a dangerous weapon, and if you understand that there are 12 guides, then they can hit, conventionally, an area the size of a football field. Summarizing the military component, I repeat my opinion once again: at this moment, the soldiers of North Korea have not demonstrated any special type of combat and have not become a serious decisive force. True, there is another serious geopolitical cut here. It is truly serious, fundamental and historic. In general - and we do not question this - North Korea has entered into a de facto war with Ukraine. I emphasize, not de jure, but de facto. That is, the so-called tyrannies continue to challenge world democracies, and only our allies can give a full answer to this question. Although my personal point of view: there will not be any global, comprehensive answer yet. The only thing we can count on is an increase in funding and perhaps a slight increase in the flow of weapons, especially in this segment, because it is necessary to respond symmetrically. Our allies also have a whole nomenclature of a wide variety of mortars of various types. The bottom line: It did happen. So, to some extent, the phenomenon that I keep talking about as an expert—the growing potential for our conflict to escalate into a Great World War—has indeed begun. We are still in the conventional October of 1939.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/20/pivnichno-korejskyj-pasyans-ekspert-rozpoviv-chy-dijsno-kimchenynivczi-taki-grizni/	2024-12-19T21:07:22-08:00

On the F-16 - in Romanian: why training Ukrainian pilots in the east of NATO is beneficial for every...	ArmyInform tells about the context of the creation of the European F-16 Training Center in Romania and its significance for the training of Ukrainian pilots. In Ukraine, the creation and activities of the European F-16 Training Center in Romania are considered mainly in the context of the -F-16 Coalition- - an international association designed to ensure the supply of F-16 fighters to the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the training of pilots, technicians and personnel for maintenance of these aircraft. This is quite justified, because it was the need to help Ukraine repel a large-scale Russian invasion that really played a significant role in the establishment of the training center in Romania. However, the Ukrainian factor became a catalyst rather than the root cause of the establishment of a special training center for the training of F-16 pilots in Eastern Europe. The primary reasons for the creation of the F-16 training center in Romania lie in the need for new users of the -Fighting Falcons- to train their own pilots, technicians and support personnel to maintain these fighters in the face of a significant reduction in training programs by those countries that are switching to the F-35 Lightning II. For example, in August 2022, the Netherlands closed its F-16 pilot training center in Tucson (Arizona, USA). This center, which has existed since the 1980s, has lost its relevance since the Royal Netherlands Air Force retired the F-16 fighters and eventually switched to the F-35. The reduction of training programs for F-16 pilots and technicians in a number of countries of the world coincided with the emergence and growth of demand for the training of these specialists on the part of those states that became users of the -Combat Falcons- relatively recently - first Poland, then Romania, Slovakia and Bulgaria. After a large-scale attack by the Russian Federation, Ukraine also joined this club of states — new F-16 operators. In the context of repelling Russian aggression, the Ukrainian request for Fighting Falcons and trained pilots and personnel for them opened a window of opportunity for both former and new users of Fighting Falcons. The less prosperous countries of the NATO bloc benefited primarily from the current situation, which were able to take advantage of the context of assistance to Ukraine from the richer states of the North Atlantic Alliance. The opening of the European F-16 Training Center in Romania fits this logic as well as possible. Romania began the transition to the Combat Falcons from the aging MiG-21s in 2016-2017, acquiring 12 modernized F-16AM/BMs from Portugal. In 2020-2021, the Romanians purchased 5 more Portuguese Fighting Falcons, and in 2022 they concluded an agreement to purchase 32 more fighters from Norway. The purchase of so many fighter jets and the associated costs for their basing, maintenance and training of pilots and personnel became a very expensive pleasure for Romania. For example, the value of the agreement concluded in November 2022 for the purchase of Norwegian F-16s amounted to 454 million euros. In this context, basing the European F-16 Training Center on the territory of Romania has become very beneficial for the country. After all, the Netherlands, having taken the initiative /a> created the cell, provided it with its own aircraft and equipment, and ensured the coordination of efforts to support it on the part of all members of the -F-16 Coalition-. The first five Dutch F-16 fighters ->arrived in Romania at the beginning of November 2023. -Together with Denmark and with the support of the United States, the Netherlands is responsible for coordinating European efforts to create an F-16 capability for Ukraine,- the Dutch Ministry of Defense said in a statement on this matter. November 13 the official opening of the European F-16 Training Center at the 86th Air Force Base took place Air Force Lieutenant Gheorghe Mochornice of the Air Force of Romania, located near the town of Fetești in the Borča commune of the Celeraş county in the south of the country. Romanian pilots were the first to start training. The media assumed that the Ukrainians would join the Romanian aviators by the end of 2023, but in practice it happened later. It is officially a fact that Ukrainian pilots are training in Romania z-ministrom-oborony-rumuniyi/->testified the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov based on the results of the telephone conversation with Romanian counterpart Angel Tilvar on September 12, 2024. -The number of F-16s in Ukrainian skies will also increase: a group of our pilots is already undergoing training in Romania,- the head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry noted at the time. Rustem Umyerov thanked his Romanian colleague, the people and the government of his country for supporting and strengthening Ukrainian air defense. Shortly afterwards, at the end of September, the French armed forces notified that the first group of Ukrainian pilots completed training on Alphajet jet training aircraft and will go to training center in Romania to master F-16, since France does not have these aircraft. Therefore, Ukrainian pilots began training at the European F-16 training center from the fall of 2024. Romania is providing a training base, supplies and logistics, the Netherlands is providing aircraft, machinery and equipment, and F-16 manufacturer Lockheed Martin is sending instructors. As reports The Ministry of Defense of Romania, December 12, the Minister of Defense of Romania Angel Tilvar and the Minister of Defense of the Netherlands Ruben Breckelmans signed a Letter of Intent in The Hague, in which the commitment of the two states to strengthening and deepening cooperation within the scope of the European F-16 Training Center was confirmed. Therefore, the opening of the European F-16 Training Center is beneficial to Romania primarily because it allows the country to modernize its own Air Force. For the Netherlands, supporting Romania and Ukraine is strengthening NATO's eastern borders in the face of the Russian threat. How much the Ukrainians benefited from the creation of the European F-16 training center in Romania with the decisive support of the Netherlands is unnecessary to explain. We can only thank the Romanians and the Dutch, because during almost three years of large-scale invasion, these two nations have supported Ukraine most consistently and effectively.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/20/na-f-16-po-rumunsky-chomu-navchaty-ukrayinskyh-pilotiv-na-shodi-nato-vygidno-vsim/	2024-12-19T20:53:01-08:00
Will fly 10 thousand km: the Hungarians boasted of the development of a giant drone with the abiliti...	As informs the MSN portal, the aircraft is extremely durable, capable of performing a wide range of tasks and boasts an impressive flight range of up to 9,980 kilometers, notes ArmyInform. In turn, the researchers of the defense site Army Recognition, who investigated the drone developed by engineers from Budapest stated that in the background with the rapid development of aeronautics, PHANTOM becomes a stealthy and effective option for complex missions. Designed to push the boundaries of what drones can do, it combines advanced technology and adaptability, setting new standards in aviation, particularly with its range. The technical characteristics of this UAV from the Hungarian UAVIATOR Drones Ltd make it a promising player in the field of drones, capable of meeting a variety of needs, from surveillance to critical logistics missions. With a structural weight of 600 kg, the PHANTOM is designed to carry a significant payload of up to 500 kg. This significant capacity allows for a wide range of operations, from the transportation of specialized equipment to the delivery of essential goods. The total take-off weight of the drone reaches 1,100 kg, which is a testament to its robust construction and optimized design for long-range missions. Its 14-meter wingspan provides excellent stability in flight, ensuring reliable maneuverability even in difficult weather conditions. PHANTOM also stands out for its high-altitude capabilities, reaching a maximum flight height of 6,000 feet. meters At this altitude, it can cover impressive distances with a range of up to 10,000 km, making it suitable for large-scale international operations. A slip ratio of 52:1 provides optimal efficiency, reducing energy consumption and maximizing gliding efficiency. These qualities make the PHANTOM a valuable tool for operations that require both caution and endurance. The introduction of stealth technology further enhances its potential in sensitive environments where avoiding detection is critical. -PHANTOM's ability to blend in with the horizon while remaining undetectable by traditional detection systems provides a strategic advantage for users. For surveillance, reconnaissance or logistical support, PHANTOM provides efficient operations while maintaining a low profile.- — emphasize Hungarian engineers from UAVIATOR Drones Ltd. In addition, PHANTOM is designed with modularity in mind, allowing the configuration to be easily adjusted to meet specific mission requirements. The ability to equip or remove non-essential components makes it an extremely versatile drone suitable for a wide range of operational applications. The integration of LEDs and modular components also supports night missions and low-visibility operations. Presentation of unmanned aerial vehicles from the Hungarian manufacturer Uaviator.

Vampire hexacopter on the front lines: how a fast and long-range heavyweight drone works	ArmyInform learned about this after attending a demonstration and training flight of the heavy night UAV Vampire in the 25th separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade. The crew of the Vampire aircraft complex consists of three people - the crew commander and at the same time the first pilot, second pilot and engineer. Now they are preparing their rather large nocturnal -bird- for flight. The goal is to practice the mechanics of ammunition drops and demonstrate the capabilities of a powerful UAV. — In combat conditions, we wait for an indication of the target and process the data, that is, we look at the horizon, the wind, how much to fly, how much -batka- we will spend - we take everything into account. Depending on the target, we select the BC to hit it - -shrapnel-, -cumulum- or something needs to be burned, - says the crew commander of the heavy night drone Bohdan with the call sign -Rambo-. The distance to the target, the battery charge (battery), weather conditions, the weight of fragmentation (-fragments-) or cumulative (-cumulus-) ammunition - all this must be carefully taken into account for the effective performance of a combat mission. Only after that, the crew advances to a pre-selected position and begins combat work. The weight of the entire Vampire unmanned aircraft complex is more than 30 kg, and a heavy-duty UAV is capable of lifting a 15-kilogram load into the air. However, these are -passport- data that may vary depending on actual conditions. - In combat conditions, he carries 20 kilograms - and he is fine. The main thing is to take into account the costs of the -batka- so that it is enough depending on the temperature, humidity, and wind. I personally flew 12 kilometers in favorable weather conditions at good altitudes and carried 6 kilograms. We then hit the target, says Rambo. However, he recalls, one of his brothers already managed to break this record - he flew 14 kilometers and successfully bombed and returned. As the crew chief talks, the co-pilot and the engineer secure the munitions, this time two of them: a home-made FAB and a hand grenade equipped with a special release shank. -Now there is a self-made 8.5-kilogram Ukrainian-made FAB and a manual cumulative grenade of 1980 production, which the infantrymen were supposed to throw manually according to the technique,- explains the pilot. Ammunition for drones is made by specialists, they do not do it themselves. But to attach two landing gear of different weight to the UAV, balancing the weight accordingly, is already the task of the engineer and the pilots. — The bird does not like sudden movements, because it all makes the -father- sit down. If you fly such long distances, you must fly very gently, be very careful with it, so as not to waste the -batka- for nothing. And don't spin - it rose and popped at the working height, explains the drone commander. The altitude at which the Vampire operates depends on the terrain and the combat environment. Changing it arbitrarily is not worth it, because it drains the battery and destabilizes the drone once more. — If I am at the top, then in order not to spend the -batka- as much as possible, I will rise to 30 meters and swim at this height. If there are any obstacles or obstacles on the way, or I know that the EW station is standing, then I go up 150 meters and bypass the dangerous area, says -Rambo-. He says that sometimes even enemy snipers hunt for a combat drone. The invaders call the Vampire UAV -Baba Yaga-, -Staraya-, -Kostlyavaya- - that's how scary and deadly it is for the invaders. — The speed of the drone can reach 80 kilometers per hour, if there is no wind. If the wind blows at my back, it will go 100 kilometers or even faster. It is more difficult to fly against the wind, but according to the passport, the drone can overcome the wind at a speed of 12 m/s, and in reality even 15-17 m/s, says the pilot. Today, the combat hexacopter was previously developed as a peaceful agricultural UAV, which was supposed to spray fertilizers or poison against agricultural pests over the fields. Now it has been improved and it destroys the Russian invaders just as effectively. Due to its original purpose, the drone -jumps- a little after the bombing, because while spraying fertilizers, it was released from its weight gradually, and the ammunition is dropped -with a jerk-. However, thanks to the improvements of the engineers, the drone quickly stabilizes. In general, in order to turn a civilian -bird- into a military drone, it had to be significantly improved - more powerful engines were installed, mounts for dropping four ammunitions were installed, and other features were used, which are not worth talking about in general. -Vampires- engineers monitor the progress of the war and constantly improve the drone, says -Rambo- and assures that these changes are quite noticeable in combat conditions. In addition to home-made FABs and grenades, the -Vampire- crew had to drop 16-kilogram 120-caliber mortar mines and install 10-kilogram PTMK and TM-62 anti-tank mines. — We pass in the same way. We bring in anti-tank mines at night and place them on the road. Then enemy equipment comes, runs over and blows up, says -Rambo-. Also, the drone performs logistical tasks, delivering everything necessary to the fighters to the forward positions. — We deliver water, provisions, cartridges, medicines, candies. We drop everything the guys need, says the pilot. While we were talking, the co-pilot and engineer finished preparing the UAV for takeoff and the Vampire was taking off. In a few minutes, the drone moves to a safe distance and the first powerful explosion is heard, followed by the next one. Having completed the task, the hexacopter royally proudly and solemnly returns from a successful mission, and -Rambo- tells that in civilian life he worked as a prospector in a mine and never thought that he would deal with the sky and flights. However, he loves his current job. - You need to carefully prepare BC, love -Vampire-, take care of him - and then everything will work. Because it is very unfortunate when you make an accurate drop - right into the hatch, and there is no explosion. This, unfortunately, happened, says the pilot. He has been working with the Vampire UAV for about a year. During this time, we had to work on the enemy's manpower, shelters, and armored vehicles. At first, 4-5 sorties were made per night, but when the intensity of hostilities increased, the number of combat missions could increase significantly. — The most we made was 35 flights per day. Back in a circle after that, says Rambo. However, the crew survived even this extremely intensive combat work, and the Vampire proved its reliability and efficiency. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/20/geksakopter-vampire-na-peredovij-yak-praczyuye-shvydkisnyj-i-dalekosyazhnyj-dron-vazhkovagovyk/	2024-12-19T20:25:21-08:00

Within the framework of these guarantees, Ukraine supports France's initiative regarding the military contingent in our country and calls on other partners to join it. -Europe and America are capable of bringing an end to the war, a just and reliable peace. However, in order for the United States to apply maximum pressure, Europe must take a clear position,- the Head of State added. Among the steps that will force Russia to recognize the need for peace, the President first named geopolitical certainty for Ukraine and Europe, which means inviting Ukraine to join NATO.

The government has made it easier for soldiers, sergeants and non-commissioned officers to change th...	About informs December 19 Ministry of Defense. Corresponding changes to Resolution No. 1291, initiated by the Ministry of Defense, were approved at the Government meeting. From now on, when changing the place of service, the military position will not be indicated in the transfer order. Only his name, rank, part number and tax payer card number will be shown. The designation of the position itself allowed military units to create obstacles to transfer in individual cases. For example, a serviceman was transferred to another position within the unit. This made it possible to refuse to change the place of service, since the positions in the order and the staff list did not match. The resolution adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers will change this. Also, this resolution ensures a more accurate distribution of powers in the process of preparation and signing of transfer documents. -We are gradually improving the process of changing the place of service. Initially, this service was launched in Armiya+, which removed several bureaucratic obstacles. Further, we continue to improve it and pay attention to all the details that can be manipulated and not to the benefit of the defender,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense for Digitalization. According to her, the Ministry of Defense strives for the service of the Ukrainian military to be effective and not held back by artificial restrictions. As reported by ArmyInform, the Verhovna Rada approved creation of an electronic state register of military personnel.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/19/uryad-sprostyv-zminu-misczya-sluzhby-dlya-soldativ-serzhantiv-ta-starshyn/	2024-12-19T06:58:33-08:00

Corporate bankruptcies await Russia	This is reported by the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. In 2025, they may cover more than 12% of companies, which will account for about 20% of revenue. The problems will mostly concern the spheres of transport, communication, construction, coal industry and trade. In addition, the high rate has already exceeded the profitability of working capital, which makes it difficult to attract investments and leads to the reduction of development programs even in state monopolies. Further growth of the discount rate also increases the probability of a crisis in the banking sector. This is caused by such factors as: The probable bankruptcy of companies that generate almost a fifth of the income of the Russian Federation will have a significant negative impact on the economic stability of Russia. Among the consequences of a long-term increase in the accounting rate is a decrease in production capacity, an increase in unemployment, and a decrease in tax revenues. This will lead to a chain reaction that will intensify the economic crisis in the Russian Federation. We remind you, GUR published the losses of mobilized Russians according to the occupiers' calculations since September 2022.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/19/rf-ochikuyut-korporatyvni-bankrutstva/	2024-12-19T04:37:53-08:00

About the turn of the war at sea, new corvettes and the elite club of missile manufacturers. Intervi...	The war at sea has now reached a completely new level, and this is exactly what the Commander of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Vice Admiral Oleksiy Neizhpapa, told in an interview with ArmyInform. - How it was possible to deprive Russia of dominance in the Black Sea for 2022 - 2024? - In general, this is a fruitful work of all the Defense Forces of Ukraine. The first such successful experience was the use of the Neptune missile complex. And later, during a joint operation of the Navy and the SBU, we used kamikaze naval drones that entered the Sevastopol Bay. At the time, it was a sensation, because no one had done this before. It is interesting that on October 29, 1914, even at the same time, the so-called -Sevastopol Awakening- was taking place, when Turkish ships approached the city and attacked it with ship guns&#8230; A century has passed, and we attacked the enemy in our Sevastopol with naval drones. In addition, it is worth highlighting the strikes of our Air Force with missiles from partners -Storm Shadow- and -Scalp-. This is quite fruitful, multi-stage cooperation with the involvement of absolutely all Defense Forces of Ukraine, which made it possible to first deprive the ships of the Russian fleet of the opportunity to operate in the western part of the Black Sea, and then we forced them to withdraw from the bays of occupied Sevastopol to Novorossiysk. We also made the Sea of ​​Azov dangerous for maneuvers. — How do naval drones affect the course of war now? Will modern technologies allow us to change tactics? — Maritime drones are a revolutionary path, but not a panacea for war at sea. Of course, they are a danger to the enemy, but they are also preparing something similar to strike at us. The enemy already has some developments, but as the war continues, we are also improving our technology. Of course, it was the creation and use of naval drones that changed the course of the war, because even now they are not just kamikaze drones, they are real platforms for other drones or types of weapons. - How does the modification of the Neptune missile complex take place? - We have entered the elite club that produces cruise missiles. After we sunk -Moscow-, the Navy of the Armed Forces even won the championship in this club. I head the state commission for accepting these missiles. In fact, all modifications take place in front of my eyes. We are working diligently and are in constant contact with the Hero of Ukraine Oleg Korostelev, who is constantly inventing new modifications that will increase the missile's range and improve accuracy. Unfortunately, I cannot reveal all the secrets and new characteristics, because this may play into the hands of the enemy, but I can definitely assure you that the Neptunes of 2022 and 2024 are already different missiles. - Can we involve partners from NATO countries in the future for demining the waters of the Black Sea? - In general, we approach this issue very gradually. The first stage is demining without the involvement of partners. The second is to build up mine countermeasures capabilities with the help of partners. Yes, in 2023 we were given two mine countermeasures ships (Great Britain), in 2025 we will receive three more ships (two from the Netherlands and one from Belgium) and three boats. Then, at the end of 2025, we will have a full division of 5 battleships and three boats, which are completely renovated, equipped with modern anti-mine systems, with a trained crew, but the most important thing is that we will have a headquarters, because arms and legs do not work without a head. This is one of the directions we are currently taking in the conduct of hostilities. Of course, complete demining is possible only in peacetime, because now we search for mines, including -drifting- ones, and carry out demining under the enemy's sight. As for our partners, the NATO countries that have access to the Black Sea, which are Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania, have created a tripartite Mine Action Task Force, which began its operations focusing on -drifting- mines in the waters of these countries. We have common views, and with their help we can do it even faster. I personally met with the naval commanders of these countries, and we discussed the direction we should move. Of course, partners can help to conduct a large-scale demining operation, and then demining will be faster, but if we have all these means, then we ourselves demine the Ukrainian waters of the Black Sea, just not as fast. —How is the training of mine countermeasures experts carried out?—Currently, the main training takes place abroad in Great Britain, Denmark, and Germany. Our divers, specialists without crewed anti-mine systems, crews of ships that will be handed over to us already next year are trained there. Our mine countermeasures ships -Cherkasy- and -Chernigiv-, their crews have completed a full training course. Next year, they will undergo a full evaluation according to NATO standards and will be able to conduct searches not only for demining the Black Sea, but also as part of NATO mine countermeasures naval tactical groups. This is quite a serious step that we are taking for our future, because we have to become members of NATO. The training of ship crews for future actions is carried out with the help of partners both in training centers and on ships of NATO countries. Rehearsing of joint actions together with the ships of partner countries and certification of our ships according to NATO standards takes place at the -Sea Vreeze- exercises. These are Ukrainian-American studies, they are open to other countries. Due to the full-scale aggression of Russia, these exercises are being held for the second year in a row not in Ukrainian waters, but in the waters of Great Britain, Romania and Bulgaria. — What is the role and place of application of ADA type corvettes in the system of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine? — We started this project back in 2021 by the decision of the President of Ukraine. Our first corvette -Ivan Mazepa- is currently undergoing trials and will soon be included in the composition of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the second - -Ivan Vyhovskyi- - was launched this year. As I said earlier, not all problems can be solved by maritime drones alone, even air defense issues. To protect civilian ships at sea following sea routes far from the coast, you need to have a fairly powerful air defense system, and it is very large and heavy. Our corvettes are already equipped with powerful weapons for reconnaissance and air defense. These ships also have missile strike weapons, which will be used at a long distance to strike coastal targets. In addition, we are considering corvettes for participation in NATO and EU operations (missions), because the Armed Forces Navy must contribute to international security not only in the Black Sea, but also, for example, in the Mediterranean. Our ships will be involved in NATO's maritime tactical groups. In addition, corvettes are platforms for unmanned and unmanned systems, they are equipped with torpedoes, as you can already understand, they have a lot of functions and purposes, which is why they are called multi-purpose. Today, there is a trend in absolutely all navies of the world to create such corvettes that will be equipped with such powerful weapons. - Ensuring the operation of the -sea grain corridor- is one of the key tasks of the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. What can you tell us about it? - One of the key moments for the opening of the sea corridor, which provides civil shipping, was the sinking of -Moscow- and the liberation of Zmiiny Island. In August 2023, we opened an alternative grain corridor without the Russian side, because before that the so-called -Grain Agreement- was in effect with the participation of the UN, Turkey and Russia. Colossal work was then carried out on demining organized corridors, formation of convoys and their support. We started then with one such a day, and now we have them functioning both during the day and at night. Civil shipping is extremely important, because it is our economy and geopolitics. There are many countries that primarily need wheat, so it is hard work around the clock for our sailors, UAV pilots, scouts and divers. It should be taken into account that the territory may be mined, hostile DRG groups may make attempts, so this is all a big job. Moreover, the enemy uses new technologies during the installation of mine barriers, and we are actively fighting this. We managed to destroy more than 1,000 mines and ensure, from August 2023 to today, the passage of more than six thousand civilian ships through the combat zone to the ports of -Great Odesa- and vice versa, which made it possible to export more than 82 million different cargoes to 45 countries of the world. And we are talking about the fact that this is not all our capabilities yet, because we are only moving further. The adversary also understood that he was losing his possible dividends, and just then, in the summer of 2023, he increased the number of missile strikes and kamikaze drone strikes specifically on the port infrastructure, but we coped with it. — How can you comment on strengthening the capabilities of the national fleet at the expense of international military and technical assistance from partner countries, namely in terms of ship and boat crews, naval aviation, marine infantry units and coastal missile artillery units? — If we talk now, for example, about the marines, then we used to have two full-fledged brigades. We have now tripled that number. The guys showed themselves in battles in absolutely all directions: Eastern, Northern, Southern, and now even in Kurshchyna they continue to repel the enemy. Our marines have more than 20,000 destroyed Russian soldiers, more than 400 tanks, 900 artillery systems and more than 1,500 destroyed vehicles. Also, Navy fighters from air defense units and mobile fire groups destroyed several warehouses with Shaheds. In total, they have more than 400 destroyed aircraft: they are Shaheds, cruise missiles, and even airplanes. Our pilots were the first to use -Bayraktar- against surface targets, and even successfully destroyed a helicopter that had just landed on Zmiiny Island. When the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi was still in the position of the commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces, he proposed to create a river flotilla, because such support from the river was necessary, and therefore it was implemented. Thanks to our partners, we already have two divisions of modern boats, which are equipped with appropriate weapons and are actively used on the Dnipro River and other areas. —How did the naval coalition affect the development of the Armed Forces Navy?—In general, the Naval Capabilities Coalition was created on December 11 a year ago on the initiative of Great Britain, Norway and, of course, Ukraine. Currently, the Coalition, together with Ukraine, includes 19 countries. The maritime coalition is actually one of the largest in terms of the number of participating countries and areas of effort. We are waiting for other countries to join us, because, as I emphasized earlier, the sea is economics and geopolitics, and everyone is interested in being a part of such a great moment. During this period, we managed to fully form a river flotilla, equip it with ships, we received Sea King helicopters, we are increasing our anti-mine, amphibious capabilities, we are working on marine equipment and watercraft. The coalition is working very well according to the working map, I cannot tell you the details. It is worth understanding that a fleet requires a lot of money and time, because a good ship is built from 2 to 5 years, and then another year is needed for the crew to acquire capabilities. Therefore, in order to have a powerful and strong fleet in 2035, we must build ships today, as well as platforms and other activities. We are conducting three key phases and are emphasizing priority needs: EW and EPP, firepower, intelligence, marine weapons, and aviation. Partners also understand the importance of providing us with the necessary equipment on time, and I am personally impressed by the systematicity of our coalition's work. —Recently, gas production platforms near Crimea, where the occupiers installed surveillance systems, were struck. How long has this operation been planned? - This is not a one-day operation, and it will be extended. We cannot allow the enemy to have awareness at sea, we cannot allow our civilian or military ships to be followed, and we cannot understand the situation at all. We work on those towers not only with our naval drones, but also with other types of weapons. We know that the enemy has left special forces there, but they are limited logistically, so they only have air support with the involvement of helicopters. We will continue to work on such towers. - Will the destruction of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation make it possible to de-occupy Crimea and the south of Ukraine in general? - The destruction of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, if we talk about complete destruction, will be a strategic blow to Russia and will really have huge consequences for the war. The events that the whole world has now observed in Syria prove that the enemy will behave as cautiously as possible, because the fleet that they drove to Novorossiysk actually remained the only base closest to the Mediterranean Sea. Especially since they are constantly expecting us to hit. - Can we talk to you about anti-aircraft defense? - It is worth noting right away that it is controlled by the ground commander. Yes, we saw with the naked eye Russian ships near Odessa, but then we did not have the kind of weapons we have today. The amphibious landing was possible only under the condition that the enemy passed Voznesensk and entered the Odesa-Kyiv route. In fact, then Odesa would be semi-encircled and it would be possible to land an amphibious assault from the sea. The 80th DSHV brigade did not allow passage to Voznesensk, and other units, together with the marines, were ready to act in case of need. In general, the enemy tried to conduct only demonstrative actions such as: -We will land now-, but this was impossible to implement. Moreover, our -Neptunes- and, in the future, other striking means were ready to hit enemy ships. That is, no commander will send people if he understands that they are far from our coast, and a cruise missile is already coming at them, that's why they retreated.

Tactics -small infantry corps- and assault tanks: the CEO of the company - an FPV pilot told about t...	ArmyInform asked Roman about how the crew of FPV drones manages to extinguish small assault groups of Russians in the Pokrovsky direction, how many enemy military targets are destroyed by our defenders in one day of combat duty, what is the most difficult thing in the work of operators, and why did the general director of a large company become a simple FPV pilot? -The shift starts early in the morning. At night, we go to positions, change guys, debrief and set tasks, and then there is heavy, as we call it, operational work. The crew arranges a workplace underground, because the Russians spare neither effort nor means to find and destroy our pilots. Ideally, reconnaissance of the front edge of the enemy is first carried out, the locations of enemy forces and assets are determined. Coordinates of priority targets are transmitted. We are FPV drone pilots, fast combat missions. The objectives are different: they are manpower, dugouts, some shelters, weapons and military equipment. In short, we destroy everything we see. Our job is simple - kill the invaders, do everything to make them less. We work day and night mainly at a distance of up to 5-6 km deep into the enemy's battle formations. We can fly up to 20 km, depending on the technical components of the drones. Usually we use fragmentation projectiles for enemy manpower, and high-explosive drops for other purposes. Everything depends on the combat mission and the characteristics of the targets to be hit. The drone can carry up to 3.5 kg of explosives, and a heavier warhead has also been attached. In the Pokrovsky direction, the Rashists use the tactics of -small infantry corps-. The novel tells: Russian attack aircraft come in small groups of 5-6 people, try to advance on our positions, make landings, probe for weak spots in the defense, but suffer losses. We eliminate them, of course, this does not stop the enemy, he then sends the next assault group, which already attacks the bodies of -his comrades-. Photo: Natalia Kravchuk / ArmiyaInform In some places, katsaps come forward to attack on armored vehicles, but recently they use motorcycles, buggies, and even some self-propelled wheelbarrows. Here they concentrate groups of 10-12 people. Enemy EW that the enemy installs on their vehicles almost always works, but we try to quickly change frequencies and inflict fire damage. the Rashists have set up the work of trench EWs quite effectively and it is not always possible to hit the targets. But we are working. I will say this from my own experience: now in some places we even use the frequencies on which all drones flew a year ago. Then the enemy began to actively press them, which forced the FPV crews to switch to other frequencies. What is interesting: we have less losses from controlling drones on those, let's say, -ancient- frequencies than the rest. They may have been forgotten, but this is a fact. What is the logic of the Rashists? First come those who are not sorry. Next, the more professional military of the Russian Federation, who are supposed to gain a foothold in the locality, are pulled over the corpses. There were days when the -meat attacks- of the Russians continued without stopping. And we simply did not have time to destroy them all. The crews of FPV drones of the unmanned systems battalion -Predators of Heights- of the 59th brigade destroy more than 100 occupants in just one day of work in the designated area of ​​responsibility in the Pokrovsky direction. And this is confirmed data. We eliminate more than half of the rashes immediately, the rest are serious injuries. the Russians do not spare their own, no one takes the wounded from the battlefield. Plus about 15-20 more occupiers, whom we cannot clearly establish: whether they were killed or wounded. Because among the racist corpses it is generally difficult to determine what is wrong with them there. One solid flesh and torn bodies all around. And there is no time to do it. There are many tasks, because small infantry groups are still climbing. That's right, we work in this mode. To say that we are tired is to say nothing. If you count the losses of the Russians for a week, then the enemy loses an entire battalion-tactical group only in our area of ​​work. Is it a lot? I think so. We work for three or four days on combat duty, then we are replaced. A great desire to learn is required. And constant training. Not everyone is good at flying FPV right away. You have to learn to be an integral part of the team: look for targets, record hits and help the operator navigate in space. But the most important thing is the experience of piloting and hitting targets. It is difficult to control the drone in bad weather conditions, such as rain or snow. Electronics can fail. I will be 50 in half a year. I remember: 6 people were selected for drone piloting courses. Only two people successfully completed the training and received certificates. The key is practice, you need to keep practicing FPV control. Thoroughly know the technical component, be able to repair drones as needed. Where you need to rearrange the details yourself. Sometimes the drones that come to us require inspection, they are not always 100% technically sound. Again, all the information you need is on the Internet, everything is available. Another very important point is a normal working atmosphere in the team. The crew consists of a pilot, a gunner and an engineer who prepares the warhead and loads the drones with ammunition. Roman is a successful businessman from Odesa region. General director of one of the leading companies supplying agricultural machinery to Ukraine. His company delivered agricultural machinery and precision farming equipment from the USA, Canada, and France to Ukrainian farmers. Both for small companies and for holdings that are among the top 5 leading agricultural companies of our country. -When Russia launched a large-scale offensive against Ukraine, I realized that I had to go to the army and defend our country with weapons in my hands. But before going to the army, it was necessary to implement and successfully close all multimillion-dollar contracts with our partners and legally fulfill all obligations. I will tell you a story. Night of February 24, 2022. Belarusian-Ukrainian border in Chernihiv Oblast. Columns of Russian equipment are already there and are invading the territory of Ukraine. And we have $4 million worth of foreign equipment under contract. I still don't understand how, but we managed to deliver this equipment to Lithuania, and then, of course, to Ukraine. At first, I wanted to join a tank unit with my friend, who was the first from our company to be mobilized. But they were all over the state at that time. Then he got to know the guys from the 59th brigade. I say: -I want to see you.- They told me: -not yet, wait, we will call you. And for now, help the units of the brigade financially.- And then, after some time, it was already in 2023, I received a call: -we are creating a new battalion, we will fight on UAVs, come!- Next moved on to FPV. My motivation is simple: I must go to defend my country, my home, my family. And to destroy the Russians who came to kill Ukrainians. Russia purposefully wants to destroy the Ukrainian people. Not to capture any economic or human resources, but rather to destroy Ukrainians as a people or to make as many people as possible leave the territory of Ukraine. That's why I'm here in the Armed Forces, everything is simple!-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/19/taktyka-malyh-pihotnyh-trupiv-ta-shturmovi-tachanky-gendyrektor-kompaniyi-pilot-fpv-rozpoviv-pro-taktyku-voroga/	2024-12-18T20:44:06-08:00
-Tomahawks- came in handy again: the US army introduced a new surface-to-surface missile system	According to the message, the text of which is posted on the defense portal Army Recognition, this advanced surface-to-surface missile system boasts a maximum firing range of 1,500 km, which attracted considerable interest from industry leaders, defense officials and international delegations who wanted to learn more about its complex capabilities, ArmyInform notes. The MRC consists of launchers, missiles, and a battery operations center designed to counter ground-based threats. It is part of a major modernization priority for the U.S. military to develop and deploy new long-range precision fire capabilities. -Our collaboration with the U.S. military has given us a deeper understanding of its most critical needs,- said Joe DePietro, general manager and vice president of Lockheed Martin. -This partnership has allowed us to leverage technologies across our ships, launchers and combat systems programs to design, develop, integrate and rapidly deliver a solution that meets the Army's requirements. We have created new opportunities through the integration of existing and newly created technologies so that our fighters are ready at the front for any challenge.- The Medium Range Weapon System (MRC), or Typhon Weapon System, is aimed at enhancing the US Army's precision strike capability at a medium range of approximately 500 to 1,500 km. km As part of the US military's modernization drive, the MRC system serves to counter a range of critical threats, including enemy naval ships, air defenses, and land targets. Bridging the gap between shorter-range missile systems and long-range hypersonic assets, the MRC provides flexible and effective options for deterring enemy forces in a variety of scenarios. Its key objectives are deterrence and defense, operational flexibility and increased strike accuracy, enabling the Army to respond to new threats in complex, contested environments. The MRC system has a number of advanced features and combat capabilities. Her two main missiles, the Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) and Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM), provide significant versatility. The SM-6 offers multi-role capabilities, engaging both air and surface targets, making it suitable for air defense and anti-ship roles. Anti-aircraft, cruise and ballistic missile capabilities enhance the combat capabilities of the United States' Joint Air and Missile Defense Forces. In turn, the Tomahawk missiles, optimized for long-range precision strikes, allow the MRC to target critical land-based targets, such as command centers and critical infrastructure. In addition, the system supports rapid redeployment and strike flexibility, allowing it to adapt to different scenarios on the battlefield, including access-locked environments and restricted areas (A2/AD). Designed for mobility and adaptability, the MRC battery includes multiple launchers, a battery control center (BCC), prime movers and modified trailers. The TSR acts as a command center, coordinating the engagement of targets and controlling the launch process. Each launcher is configured to carry and deploy a combination of SM-6 and Tomahawk missiles, maximizing the battery's strike capabilities. The system's modular structure facilitates integration into existing army units, increasing the interoperability of joint forces and allowing them to coordinate with other large-scale assets. As informed the experts of the IKK Defense Express portal, work on this system started in 2019 immediately after its release Russian Federation under the agreement of the CISG. In 2023, the SM-6 anti-aircraft missile was first launched from the Typhon launcher, and later the Tomahawk cruise missile. Lockheed Martin has showcased the MRC system as a promising future asset for European armed forces, highlighting its potential to support NATO's integrated deterrence strategies and enhance the capabilities of partner nations. As adversaries increasingly advance access prevention and restricted area (A2/AD) strategies, the MRC offers a critical solution that enables allied forces to deliver precise, powerful strikes while remaining adaptable to new threats. The MRC system is one element of the U.S. Army's broader effort to modernize its artillery and missile forces, meeting the needs of various capabilities to keep pace with new threats. Lockheed Martin's partnership with the US Army reflects a commitment to expanding long-range precision fire and medium-range strike capabilities, consistent with a broader vision of multi-domain military operations where joint forces are coordinated on land, sea and in the air.

Discrediting Ukraine in the West with the help of AI: how the Kremlin is fighting for the minds of t...	The researchers found that several videos were actually voiced by real people. This was determined by a noticeable Russian accent. The -Agency of Social Design- - a Russian structure under US sanctions - is behind the organization of the campaign. ArmiyaInform has already mentioned her more than once. Yes, in the summer of last year during a similar campaign of the ASP prepared a series of provocative materials which, according to the authors' intention, had transfer responsibility for undermining the Kakhovskaya HPP dam to Ukraine and create the preconditions for a political crisis. And in September, the current media received leak of internal documents of ASP with information about almost 40,000 units of fake content. The target audience of these materials is citizens of Ukraine's partner countries, but its activities are mainly focused on the information field of four countries: Germany, France, the USA, and Israel. In a video presentation of ASP, which reached journalists as part of a September leak and was apparently not public, they include among their assets: After a thorough description of the disinformation -achievements- of ASP, a voiceover says: -The battlefield is the minds of the inhabitants of planet Earth.- So Russia has long been openly waging war against the entire civilized world, or even the entire planet.

Currently, electricity is supplied to the population and state institutions only for three hours during daylight hours. Under these circumstances, the majority of educational and medical institutions do not function. The official explanation for the shortage of electricity is a significant drop in the water level in the reservoir of the Ingur HPP. However, the real reason is the destructive influence of Russia, which stopped subsidies to Abkhazia. The goal is to demonstrate to the local population and -political elites- the complete economic dependence of the quasi-formation on the Russian Federation. We will remind that on September 1, Russia partially stopped subsidies to the region (including subsidies for energy resources) due to Sukhumi's failure to fulfill its obligations under -intergovernmental- agreements. At the same time, on December 3, under pressure from the public and the opposition, the -parliament- of Abkhazia refused to ratify the investment agreement with the Russian Federation, which caused a complete halt in Moscow's financing and its coverage of the electricity deficit in the region. In this way, the Kremlin creates the conditions for the guaranteed election of the most loyal candidate to Moscow during the early -presidential elections- scheduled for February 15, 2025. The search for a compromise solution with the Russian Federation is significantly complicated by the different positions of the parties. Abkhazia believes that Russia is obliged to ensure the proper level of the socio-economic situation in the region in order to preserve the political autonomy of Sukhumi. In contrast, the Kremlin believes that Abkhazia must unconditionally agree to any terms of economic cooperation, even those that completely ignore the interests of local residents. The collapse of the economy and infrastructure, energy crises, political instability and the impoverishment of the population are the direct consequences of the rule of the -Russian peace- not only in Abkhazia, but also in all territories temporarily occupied by Russia. Abkhazia is a vivid example of what any territory in which the -Russian measure- will be established will be. We remind you that the Russian shadow fleet at sea is equal to an ecological disaster.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/18/energetychna-kryza-v-okupovanij-abhaziyi-pryami-naslidky-panuvannya-ruskogo-mira/	2024-12-18T10:41:10-08:00

In the Russian Federation, the volume of freight transportation by railway is decreasing	informs about this Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The volume of cargo transportation will decrease by 6.5% from the plan and by 4% compared to 2023, and will amount to 1.18 billion tons. Revenues from cargo transportation will decrease by 6.7% to 22.12 billion dollars. USA. Given the fact that in the Far East priority was given to the transportation of coal, and other cargoes were transported in smaller volumes. Because of this, the company has already suffered losses in the amount of 186.5 million dollars. USA. The largest reductions are expected in the transportation of construction materials (–32 million tons), coal (–28 million tons), ore (–14.9 million tons), ferrous metals (–6.3 million tons) and petroleum products (–4.4 million tons) t). The reasons for the decrease in transportation are the postponement of the deadlines for the implementation of government road projects, a decrease in the export of coal through the OTEKO terminal in Taman (Krasnodar Krai), unsatisfactory work of the locomotive service, sanctions, a decrease in investment in the oil and gas industries, as well as regulatory restrictions on the export of gasoline and import of grain. At the same time, additional expenses increased by 17% to 14.3 billion dollars. the USA, in particular due to the costs of moving the head office of -Rzhd- to the -Moscow-Sity- business center.

Swept away with a bad broom: an expert on the unique successes of the Defense Forces in the Black Se...	Why did this happen? Military expert Petro Chernyk said: -Ukraine actually achieved several very important results. Here I must emphasize that we, a state that does not have a full-fledged navy, were able to achieve parity with the Russian Federation, and in some cases even prevail. The first moment: the northern part of the Black Sea water area - to be more precise, the northwestern part - was able to be closed with the help of missile superiority. First of all, I have in mind the Ukrainian R-360 Neptune complexes and the wonderful American Harpoon missile. Our complexes have a strike range of up to 300 km, Harpoon is also somewhere within the limits of 300 km. And it is one of the most massive and successful American missiles of this type. Let me remind you that it was with the help of R-360 Neptune missiles, as well as very cool American targeting, that in April 2022 we managed to sink the enemy flagship, the Moscow cruiser. This is a unique phenomenon from a historical point of view. Nothing like this had happened since World War II, when the Japanese super-heavy battleship Yamato was sunk, as well as the German super-heavy battleship Tirpitz. This is a truly historic combat success. Next moment. As of this minute, we have managed to damage and destroy up to 28 surface ships. Landing class ships are especially valuable. Why? Crimea is a peninsula, it needs endless support, the bridge itself and the railway thread are not enough, especially since the bridge will be destroyed sooner or later. And the fact that out of 15 ships of this type 10 were damaged or sunk is a colossal success. I must remind you that the Russian Federation is unable to build ships of this type any more. The next big success was that we managed to expel the fleet of the Russian Federation from Crimea. How has this goal been achieved? First and foremost is also rocket parity. There is confirmed information that Storm Shadow/SCALP EG cruise missiles have hit their targets in the bays, especially in the south. And such a unique phenomenon as the destruction of an underwater diesel-electric boat of the -Varshavyanka- class took place. Let me remind you that Crimea is 250 km from north to south, 300 km from east to west. And the Storm Shadow/SCALP EG missile in the best configuration has a range of up to 500 km. That's why we have such a really, really serious success. The next point is the application of our unmanned systems such as Magura 5 and Sea Baby. At most, even large-caliber machine guns of 12.7 caliber were able to be integrated into these systems. There is confirmed information that it was even possible to damage enemy helicopters that went hunting for these means. Why is it a great success that we expelled almost the entire naval flotilla of the Russian Federation from Crimea? Only Crimea had all the necessary equipment to load the Kalibr missile onto a carrier. It is actually a very complex technological procedure to load these rockets. These are special cranes and special equipment. Only in Crimea were they of sufficient quality. At the new base, which is in Abkhazia and Novorossiysk, this equipment is not of such high quality and good quality. At the same time, the enemy should not be underestimated. The Russians still have up to 20 Kalibr cruise missile carriers in service. Let me remind you that the range of their strikes is about two and a half thousand kilometers. There is a so-called Volgodon Basin in the Russian Federation. That is, between the Sea of ​​Azov and the Caspian Sea there is a network of channels through which these relatively small vessels can move, and they can and will strike from the Caspian Sea. So, let's summarize. the Russian Federation, which had a very powerful fleet, seven military bases, one of them in Syria, 89 ships is a lot. In less than three years, it loses a third of its potential. And this really speaks of two things: about the highly intelligent organization of a battle at sea by a country that does not have a full-fledged fleet. I mean us, Ukrainians. And it will continue. We understand that the Russians can no longer deliver really heavy frigate-type ships to the Black Sea. Why? The Montreux Doctrine of 1936, signed in Switzerland as a result of the First World War, where all the players in the world at the time agreed that if any hostilities began in the Black Sea, Turkey would close the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. So, in the future, the Russian fleet is doomed. Well, if not to complete destruction, but to its significant reduction. I have no doubt that in the next ten years the Russian Federation will completely lose its status as a dominant party in the Black Sea. Turkey is already intercepting it. We understand that sooner or later we will have to rebuild our fleet. The good news is that we have ordered at least two Ada-type corvettes from Turkey. And one of them is undergoing technical tests at sea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/18/pognaly-poganym-vinykom-ekspert-pro-unikalni-uspihy-syl-oborony-u-chornomu-mori/	2024-12-17T21:03:39-08:00
Vacation or money: who will receive compensation for -unused- days	Do these vacation days -burn-, says ArmyInform. Unused vacation days of military personnel do not disappear anywhere. Yes, it will not work to walk them in the next year. But they can be used upon dismissal from service, or receive compensation for them. This is provided for by the Law of Ukraine -About social and legal protection of servicemen and members of their families-, as well as Order of the Ministry of Internal Affairs No. 260 -About approval of the Procedure for payment of monetary support to servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and some other persons-. In particular, servicemen who are released from military service, at their request, are granted leave with the following exclusion from the personnel lists of the military unit for a duration determined in proportion to the time served in the year of release for each full month of service. A cash allowance is paid during such leave. Or servicemen upon dismissal can receive compensation for all unused days of annual basic leave, as well as days of additional leave, including for previous years. The calculation of monetary support or compensation for all unused vacation days is carried out on the basis of official salary, salary according to military rank, seniority allowance and monthly additional types of monetary support, taking into account the change in years of service and the norms of monetary support that the serviceman received at his last full-time position. At the same time, the one-day amount of cash support is determined by dividing the monthly amount of cash support by 30 calendar days. An important point - compensation can be provided for unused days not only of annual basic leave, but also additional. These include, for example, leave of up to 14 days for combatants. It is not provided during martial law, but compensation can be obtained for it. Upon dismissal, a report must be submitted to the commander of the military unit with a request to compensate for unused vacation days. The report must state the reason and date of dismissal, the number of days of unused additional leave and the law providing for such compensation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/18/vidpustka-chy-groshi-hto-otrymaye-kompensacziyu-za-nevykorystani-dni/	2024-12-17T20:52:30-08:00
Survive yourself - and save a friend: at Interflex in Britain they teach takmed	Instructors bring the cadets' skills to automaticity, sparing no effort and consumables, because their lives depend on how well a fighter masters the algorithm of helping himself or a wounded comrade. The correspondent of ArmiyaInform tells about how Ukrainian military personnel are trained in tactical medicine during the BZVP as part of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. Late evening of another hard long day. After long trainings, we were lined up for the final task. We are standing in front of a hangar capable of accommodating the An-225 -Mriya-. The main gate is now closed, so the instructors enter and exit through a door almost invisible against the background of the huge structure. Inside, something is happening - plumes of smoke are coming out of the ajar doors and cracks under the gates, the muffled sounds of explosions and the ringing -gunfire- can be heard. It is clear that this is an audio recording played through powerful speakers, but the feeling is still unpleasant - it seems that a real battle is going on somewhere nearby. Our task is to provide first aid to the wounded under conditions simulating combat. To do this, you need to find a fighter in the hangar who needs help, find out what kind of injury he has and work out according to a well-learned algorithm. We were intensively taught what and how to do it for several days beforehand. At first, classes were held in classrooms and on training grounds in the camp, then in field conditions in the middle of the forest. During this time, we all helped ourselves and our brothers several times - learned the algorithm and practiced applying tourniquets and bandages. Under calm conditions, each of us will confidently perform the MARСH algorithm without getting confused in the sequence of actions, because the number and duration of training were more than sufficient to bring our actions to automaticity. However, what seems simple in a bright, quiet, comfortable training hall becomes much more difficult in the midst of danger, dirt, and the roar of battle. Already during field training, we were able to feel how difficult it is to work out the usual aid algorithm in conditions when it is necessary to evacuate a wounded person from under conventional fire in the -red- zone. In real combat, it will be even more difficult to do this, so with each subsequent training, the instructors try to bring us as close as possible to real combat conditions. Training in the hangar is another stage on this path of increasing the complexity of tasks. We know that there is a mock battle going on outside the door and there are wounded people, but other than that we don't know anything. From a calm line-up, we will be thrown into the thick of hostilities and it will be necessary to orient ourselves on the spot, what and how to do. The first unit has already started training and we are watching closely as the instructors briefly instruct each fighter before literally throwing them inside the building. The instructor is particularly emotional, and she clearly determines which of the fighters catches the gaw and pulls him out of line. Receiving an assignment is even more unexpected for such a cadet than for others, so when our unit starts training, we try not to lose our vigilance, carefully follow the queue and maintain eye contact. I am the weak link - it was enough to be distracted for a hundredth of a second and the instructor pulled me out. The briefing is short and clear: a group of fighters has been covered by -arty-, there are dead and wounded. I need to get to them as soon as possible under fire in an unfamiliar area, find the 300th, give him first aid and prepare for evacuation. I listen not to the translator, but to the instructor - this always gives me a few seconds head start. -Are you ready? Are you ready? Go, go, go!- she shouts, grabs me by my shoulders and literally throws me into the hangar. It is dark, noisy and stuffy behind the door - the sounds of explosions and gunshots are much louder than outside, and it becomes noticeably harder to breathe in the smoke. The next ten minutes pass like a moment - everything has to be done so quickly that only after the fact you realize what and how it happened. I act instinctively and automatically - exactly as I was taught during previous classes and training. The most difficult part of the task turns out to be to get to the wounded man - more than a quarter of the hangar has to be crawled in a narrow tunnel, constantly encountering some obstacles. Then, through piles of construction debris and branches, I finally get to a tentative position and start looking for the -wounded-. The search takes several seconds - in the darkness, among a pile of dirty rags, I notice the outline of a human body, which is barely perceptibly moving. Artificial blood from the -torn off- hand splashes into the face, thickly filling the glasses, so you have to apply the tourniquet and work out the entire MARCH algorithm almost by touch. I note with horror that the -wounded- person really does not have an arm - an artificial bone and pieces of meat have been fitted to a real giggle. I shout to the wounded man, he answers something indecipherably in English so that I can only hear: -Hand, hand!- However, I have already noticed the detached arm and applied a tourniquet - we must move on. At some point, when it comes to the thermal blanket, the instructor stops me and talks to the -injured-. It turns out that he was not yelling about my arm, but hers - I tightened the tourniquet too much and he asked me to loosen it. The instructor checks and removes the tourniquet - this completes the training. We go out into the fresh air and I listen to comments and wishes for improvement. Two main points - I did not use disposable medical gloves and applied my own tourniquet instead of finding a -casualty- tourniquet. -He was bleeding, and I didn't see anything, so I had to do as it turned out,- I briefly explain the reasons for the mistakes. -Well done, 'in real life' he would have survived,- she says and puts me back in position to rest while the other cadets continue their training. The comrades are joking about how the instructor once again slipped out of the outfit of the next biggest gap. After training, we are approached by a man who played the role of a wounded man. It turns out that he is a professional actor who lost his limbs in a car accident. Now he joined the Interflex training mission as a volunteer to help the Ukrainian military. The man emphasizes that he is proud of us and that he can help Ukrainians prepare for the defense of their native country and repel Russian aggression. He says that we did a good job and jokes that he felt on his own body that we take training very seriously. The instructors also praise us, but note that in the following days, intensive training with takmed will continue, because only practice is the key to perfection.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/18/sam-vyzhyvaj-i-tovarysha-vyruchaj-na-interflex-u-brytaniyi-vchat-takmedu/	2024-12-17T20:33:08-08:00
German songbirds in the sky of Ukraine: which reconnaissance drones are transferred to the Defense F...	As stated in the official release, posted on the portal of the German government, similar UAVs were previously included in the list of weapons supplied to the Defense Forces, ArmiyaInform reports. In total, Germandrones, a manufacturer of unmanned aerial systems with headquarters in Berlin, has developed three versions of the Songbird drone: Songbird 60, Songbird 100 and Songbird 150. The Songbird system (-Singing bird- - Ukrainian. - Ed.) is the result of years of testing and improvement from German engineers and designers. The combination of the advantages of traditional aircraft and multi-rotor drones creates a new class of unmanned aerial vehicles with advanced capabilities. Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) eliminates the need for a runway while retaining all the advantages of a fixed-wing aircraft (high speed, long range). Songbird's modular concept allows for versatile use of the various cameras and sensors installed on it. Specialists of the Defense Industry Portal Europe believes that the Songbird 150 model offers the best performance among versions of the entire Germandrones family of aircraft. Specifically, it can carry a maximum payload of 4.4 kg. The range of these drones is up to 110 km. The Songbird 150 can reach an altitude of 5,000 m. meters Thanks to its high aerodynamic properties and uncompromising lightweight design, Songbird achieves a flight time of up to two hours, which is approximately twice as long as similar systems. Depending on the payload, one flight can fly up to 25 km². The designers installed a highly developed autopilot in the drone with the possibility of programming for fully automatic takeoff and landing. This program allows you to use Songbird with just one operator, and no lengthy pilot training is required. Together with the significant flight time and tool-free assembly of the UAV, this ensures a high return on investment. A large payload allows the use of very powerful batteries, multiple cameras or highly specialized sensors such as LIDAR scanners or real-time mapping devices. The maximum allowable take-off weight remains less than 10 kg. Songbird has been tested in extreme climates - from the African desert to the tropical jungle - and can operate in winds of up to 19 m/s, as well as in extreme heat, cold or light rain. The UAV is equipped with a 20x zoom video camera and a 2x zoom thermal imager. Video communication with the ground station is carried out in LTE/5G standards within a radius of up to 10 kilometers. In the absence of communication, Songbird stores the collected information on the built-in media. The device is transported in a strong aluminum box. The time of assembly and preparation for work is no more than 10 minutes. Authors of the profile portal for UAV specialists DroneXL note that the supply of Songbird unmanned aerial vehicles to Ukraine by Germany shows a strong commitment to maintaining its security and sovereignty. By strengthening Ukraine's intelligence capabilities, Germany is contributing to a strategic advantage that could become key to the current challenges the country faces. -This cooperation between nations underscores the importance of technological progress in modern warfare and defense strategies.

Fake pages and disposable phones: fraudsters prey on relatives of prisoners of war and missing perso...	informs about this Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security. Relatives of prisoners of war and missing persons are of increased interest to fraudsters, criminals and enemy special services. Criminals take advantage of the vulnerable emotional state of these persons, manipulate their desire to get at least some information about their loved one and return them home. Fraudsters are trying to establish contact with relatives of Ukrainian servicemen who were captured or are considered missing, and to seize their funds. Often, Ukrainians unknowingly help fraudsters and turn them on themselves by posting information about their relatives and requests for help on social networks. This provides fraudsters with initial information about the missing person and the relative's contact information. The victim can be contacted both directly on the social network where the ad is posted, and by phone or via messenger. Fraudsters create fake pages in social networks and use -disposable- numbers. Offer of a -list for exchange- service. Fraudsters contact relatives of captives and offer assistance in speeding up the process of releasing the person from captivity. Relatives of a missing serviceman may be told that he is in captivity. Fraudsters can pose as representatives of official structures (SBU, GUR, counterintelligence, etc.) or as persons with connections in these structures. The victim can be shown a list from the -database- of persons who are allegedly planned to be exchanged in the near future. And offer to include their relative in this list. For this -service-, fraudsters ask to transfer funds to a private or even -official- bank account. After receiving money, fraudsters usually stop contacting the victim. However, relapses are also possible: an attempt to re-take possession of the funds of the defrauded person with the assurance that -this time everything will definitely work out-, or the -explanation- that -tariffs have increased-. Scheme -your relative is in hospital.- Fraudsters have adapted the old scheme -your relative is in need- to the realities of wartime. It applies mainly to people who have posted an ad about the disappearance of a missing relative. The fraudster makes contact and claims that this person is in some remote hospital or hospital after a serious injury and urgently needs funds for his treatment. The attacker can pretend to be a fellow soldier (especially if the unit is listed in the ad), a volunteer or just an acquaintance, a doctor, etc. During the contact, the fraudster puts pressure on the victim, claiming that a person's life literally depends on the urgent transfer of funds, without giving time for additional verification of information. Extortion of non-existent debts. Criminals call relatives of a serviceman, usually his wife or mother, and demand the return of some debt, intimidate and threaten. Other members of the criminal group, who may pose as comrades in arms, offer to help -solve the matter.- Getting access to a bank account. Another old scam used on military relatives. Under various pretexts, fraudsters try to obtain the number and CVV code of the card to which payments are received. Or gain access to the Internet banking account by issuing a virtual duplicate of the victim's SIM card. For this, they can ask to turn off the phone for some time so that the real card is not online. Having gained access to the account, fraudsters withdraw funds from it. The Coordinating Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War takes care of assistance to relatives of prisoners, missing military personnel and civilians. You can contact the Coordination Headquarters in Kyiv directly (in particular, the hotline 0 800 300 529), and consultative centers in Kharkiv, Lviv, Mykolaiv, and Vinnytsia. Employees of the Coordination Headquarters provide relatives of captured and missing persons with detailed instructions on all necessary actions. The road map of actions in case your relative disappeared or was captured is published on the official website of the Coordination Headquarters. It is also worth remembering that: According to the materials of the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/18/fejkovi-storinky-i-odnorazovi-telefony-shahrayi-polyuyut-na-rodychiv-vijskovopolonenyh-i-znyklyh-bezvisty/	2024-12-17T20:08:07-08:00

This was stated the representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Vadym Skibitsky during the conference -European Defense Industry: Prospects of cooperation with the Ukrainian defense industry-, which was organized by the analytical center We Build Ukraine. -The first step that must be taken is the strengthening of international sanctions.

Twelve friends of Putin — a group of F-16 hunters was exposed	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on December 17. Military counterintelligence of the Security Service neutralized a large-scale agent network of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces (known as the game). Criminals spied on the Defense Forces in five regions of Ukraine at once. As a result of the special operation, 12 Russian agents and their informants were exposed. Some of them are deserters who voluntarily left units of the Armed Forces, and when they were hiding from justice, they were recruited by the Russian special service. The members of the enemy cell acted separately from each other and focused on the resident (head) of the agent group, who was in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. He used fake -cover documents- such as fake -volunteer ID- and -anti-corruption activist- for the conspiracy. To cooperate with the aggressor, he involved accomplices from Zaporizhzhia, as well as Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv, and Odesa regions. In these regions, the perpetrators scouted the firing positions of Ukrainian air defense, tried to identify the locations of secret military airfields where, according to the Rashists, F-16 aircraft could be based. A separate task of the enemy agents was to establish the addresses of companies involved in the production of means of radio-electronic warfare against Russian drones. In order to obtain intelligence, those involved -undercover- used their acquaintances, in particular, Ukrainian military personnel who were in the front-line regions of Ukraine. In the case of receiving preliminary information, agents went to the area to conduct reconnaissance near potential targets. At first, the members of the agent group -reported- to the resident, and then he passed the information on to his Russian curator. Military counter-intelligence of the Security Service exposed the entire enemy cell in advance, detained its organizer and four key accomplices. During the searches, mobile phones, flash drives, military documents and fake identity cards were seized from them. The SBU investigators informed the detainees of the suspicion (according to the crimes committed) under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: — ch. 2 Art. 111 (treason committed under martial law); — ch. 2 Art. 114-2 (unauthorized dissemination of information about the movement, movement or location of the Armed Forces).

Strong Twardy nuts from Poland: how -Caesar-, -Foreman- and -just Vanya- destroy the enemy in Donets...	ArmiyaInform told ArmyInform about training and an armored combat vehicle from Poland, the tasks of each crew member and the power of the 125 caliber, the role of tanks in modern warfare, the greatest dangers and protection against them. Intensive training on modernized PT-91 Twardy tanks in Poland is remembered with gratitude by fellow crew members. They say that they taught conscientiously, trying to prepare Ukrainian tankers as well as possible for real combat operations. — The Poles tried very hard to explain and teach us everything. They are great guys, to be honest. They wanted to explain to us in a human way - so that it was both elementary and understandable. Not for the proforma, not to hand in the papers, but precisely so that we can then actually fight on this tank, says the commander of the -Foreman- tank. However, he immediately adds, then he had to learn a lot on his own, because in a few weeks of study in Poland, you can manage to master only the minimally necessary basic knowledge. Tankers acquired real skills already in Ukraine, including during intensive combat operations in Zaporizhzhia. Tankers also speak positively about their combat vehicle, a modification of the tank based on the T-72M1 improved by the Poles. Her engine is powerful and reliable, her defenses are improved and strengthened, and her fire control system and sights allow for extremely accurate fire. — The car itself, if in good condition, is very nice. If good equipment is well repaired, it will show itself well. If there is something wrong with it, then it is not a technique anymore. It can only stand for repairs and nothing more. The car must be ready to leave, everything must work perfectly, -Caesar- emphasizes. Tankers explain that it is especially dangerous to detect a malfunction already during a battle. They recall a case when they came up close to the enemy - at a distance of about 100 meters - and after the first shot they had to quickly retreat, because the armored car broke down. This should not happen, they emphasize. As we speak, several mechanics are inspecting, testing and repairing the Twardy. In a few minutes, they start the powerful engine of the armored car - the environment is filled with a loud growl. The task of their team is to ensure what the commander talks about - the full serviceability and reliable reliability of the tank in battle. — If something doesn't work even a little bit, that's it. When we went to battle with the overhaul, it was the best. Then, confident in the car, you leave and don't worry that something might break in your car. You're not afraid that something might get stuck somewhere in you, - the gunner -Foreman- picks up the commander's words. In difficult situations, the tankers are saved by the coordinated work of the team, first of all, the least talkative member of the crew - Mechvod Ivan, who is called -just Vanya- by his comrades without a call sign. It is he who is responsible for the speed and maneuverability of the battleship and, ultimately, for the safety of the crew. — Everything depends on the driver. Maneuverability must be at a height so that he can quickly bring you in and then take you out even faster when we roll away. Therefore, a serviceable car and a good mechanic are the foundation, more than half of the task depends on them, the tank commander emphasizes. Mehvod Ivan modestly smiles and notes that his job is simple - to follow the road and react to the situation, to follow the commander's orders. However, he immediately adds that in a combat environment, one also has to make decisions independently, without waiting for a direct order. -If the commander is busy, then you yourself decide where and how to maneuver, where to go,- he says. - Then you choose the path yourself and react to the situation, because there is no time to wait for orders - you need to make decisions yourself. The gunner continues that his task is to be able to feel the maneuvers of the combat vehicle and take it into account when firing. He emphasizes that shooting from a tank while moving requires completely different skills and abilities than when shooting from stationary closed positions. - You need to feel the car - when it is moving, you need to turn the turret and catch the sight on the move, take prejudices, take into account the movement. When I hear that he (nods at the mechvod Ivan) is turning, I immediately take it into account when aiming, explains the gunner -Foreman-. The tank commander smiles and says that with experienced comrades, his tasks are the easiest - to give instructions to whom and what to do. And if the crew is experienced, then this is not necessary either - they will do everything themselves. However, all jokes aside, the role of the commander is important in battle, because thanks to the information from the headquarters and what he sees with his own eyes, he is the one who best navigates the combat situation and makes the most well-considered decision. — You talk to your crew and keep in touch with headquarters. They correct us from the -bird's eye-, but they can't see everything that we see from above, so we have to decide for ourselves how to carry out the order. For example, they cannot see from above that there are bushes in front of the tank, but we take this into account and act at our own discretion, - explains -Caesar-. Speaking about the effectiveness of tanks in modern warfare, fighters speak highly of the combat qualities of powerful tanks and the tasks they are capable of performing. Enemy armored vehicles, accumulations of infantry and enemy shelters - everything that can be reached by the direct fire of the -long arm- of the tank gun is guaranteed to be destroyed. — 125 caliber can do serious wonders with direct aim. Imagine that the tank is 300, 200 meters away from the enemy shelter and -dismantles- it - how will the enemy feel? The tank is a terrible machine and it will do a job that no one else can do - neither mortars nor artillery, says the commander of -Tvardogo-. He explains that the kinetic energy of an armor-piercing cartridge alone is enough to completely destroy the enemy's position in any structure in which he tried to entrench himself. Enemy infantrymen are destroyed by the very fragments of the walls, which fly in all directions after being hit by a tank shell. Realizing the danger of tanks, the Russians are intensively hunting Ukrainian armored fortresses on tracks. Tankers consider FPV drones, the Lancet barrage munition and the Kornet anti-tank missile to be the most dangerous threats. Anti-tank mines are also dangerous. In addition to the PT-91 Twardy's composite armor and explosive dynamic protection, EW and protective shields help defend against these threats. They appeared, the tankers recall, at about the same time. Back in the summer of 2023, there were no REBs or protective screens on the tanks, but already about a year ago, in the fall - at the beginning of winter, they began to spread more and more. At first, screens were self-made, later also factory ones appeared. Now every tank is protected by them, because they have proven their high efficiency, saving the lives of Ukrainian tankers many times. Thanks to these innovations and improvements, the already strong Twardy nut from Poland has become even harder. And the combat crew of the tank - -Caesar-, -Foreman- and -just Vanya- - pose an even greater danger to the enemy thanks to the experience gained in previous battles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/17/miczni-gorishky-twardy-z-polshhi-yak-czezar-prorab-ta-prosto-vanya-nyshhat-voroga-na-donechchyni/	2024-12-16T21:02:08-08:00
At first glance - a business jet: the US Army will acquire a high-tech spy plane	As informs the defense portal Army Recognition, the US Department of Defense (DoD) has released a new image of the ATHENA army platform (ATHEN - Ukrainian), an advanced intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, which is closely related to the capabilities of a modern reconnaissance aircraft, ArmiyaInform notes. Experts of the publication say that it is a modified Bombardier Global 6500 jet equipped with advanced sensors and communication systems, which underlines the army's transition to advanced ISR technology based on jet-powered aircraft. The U.S. Army's ATHENA A-ISR reconnaissance aircraft is designed to perform stealthy multi-domain reconnaissance missions across large operational areas, strengthening the Army's strategic and tactical advantage through real-time data collection and improved situational awareness. Aviationist website TheAviationist said that in December 2023 the Pentagon signed a contract with Bombardier for the first Global 6500, which will become the HADES prototype, with options delivery of two more boards of this model. It is planned to create an air fleet of 14 aircraft, which should replace the entire fleet of manned ISR aircraft of the previous generation in the US Army. A-ISR stands for Air Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance. The term refers to military operations and technologies that use aerial vehicles such as drones, helicopters, or airplanes to gather information about enemy troop movements, terrain, and other operational data from the air. The ATHENA aircraft is to be equipped with state-of-the-art technology designed for both tactical and strategic missions, providing the Army with an important intelligence advantage. Among its extensive mission capabilities, ATHENA stands out for its high-resolution imaging capability, using advanced optical and infrared cameras to capture detailed images from high altitudes. This capability is necessary for monitoring large areas, identifying enemy formations, and tracking movement in difficult terrain. In addition to image processing, ATHENA will be able to boast powerful signals intelligence (SIGINT) capabilities. Sensors installed on the aircraft will be able to intercept and analyze electronic communications and signals emitted by the devices of a potential adversary, which allows finding, identifying and characterizing these signals for threat assessment and support in electronic warfare. The ATHENA platform should also include sophisticated electronic warfare (EW) systems that can disrupt, confuse or disable enemy communications and radar systems, thereby providing tactical support to US forces on the ground and in the air. In addition, ATHENA's high-altitude capabilities will facilitate large-scale observations over large operational areas in a single mission. Thanks to the increased endurance and range, the aircraft will be able to stay in the air for a long time, which makes it very effective for missions that require constant surveillance. ATHENA's main goal is to replace aging ISR rotorcraft with faster and more efficient jet platforms capable of operational deployment around the world within 24 hours. With improved speed, range and altitude, ATHENA will be able to operate above enemy air defenses, increasing survivability while providing constant reconnaissance coverage. The program unites the future army fleet of aircraft of the program HADES (High Precision Detection and Exploitation System), a planned ISR platform expected to be operational by 2035. The data collected by ATHENA will play an important role in the HADES program, enabling the next generation of ISR aircraft to meet the operational requirements of today's multi-domain conflicts. The Pentagon has already made significant progress on the ATHENA project this year, awarding contracts to defense firms such as MAG Aerospace, L3Harris and Sierra Nevada Corporation. Each contractor is working on specialized versions of ATHENA aircraft, ranging from operational platforms to research-oriented variants designed to test sensor performance and mission adaptability. As the US Army modernizes its ISR capabilities, the ATHENA aircraft offers a sophisticated solution to meet growing intelligence requirements. With rapid deployment capabilities, advanced sensing technology, and high-altitude operational advantages, ATHENA is poised to provide information dominance for the Army in current and future theaters of operations.

How to defeat the enemy at sea: the expert talked about the new Maritime Security Strategy	What is its uniqueness, how its implementation will contribute to the strengthening of the naval capabilities of Ukraine in the Azov-Black Sea region in the confrontation with the Russian Federation, and what will the national fleet look like in the medium term, a military expert, a retired captain of the 1st rank, told in an interview with ArmiyaInform. candidate of military sciences, associate professor Stepan Yakymyak. - Is such a strategy timely, or is it worth it was to focus efforts on its finalization right now? After all, work on it began even before the full-scale military invasion of the Russian Federation, right? What is the relevance of the Maritime Security Strategy of Ukraine, its necessity at the present time? — Do we now need -some kind of strategy on paper-, if every second it is necessary to make situational decisions, strike at the enemy and withdraw our forces from under attack? Such a pessimistic thesis, I think, could be heard from anyone today, taking into account the situation in the war. Maybe this Strategy is really out of date? There is an unequivocal answer to this or similar questions: yes, it is necessary! After all, the actual presence of strategies is the key to victory, because in any struggle there must be clearly formulated goals and tasks that must be achieved. Only then is it possible to allocate available resources in time and space rationally, judiciously and reasonably. In the conditions of the war, in particular, as a result of the enemy's capture of Crimea, parts of other coastal regions, the loss of socio-economic facilities and Ukraine's access to the Sea of ​​Azov, issues of maritime security have become critical. After all, this is a loss of economic and other resources. They significantly reduce the opportunities of the Ukrainian nation and its descendants in the future. Therefore, at sea, Ukraine is fighting for the return of maritime spaces. There have been great successes, but the matter is not over yet: Crimea, the Ukrainian part of the Azov and Black Seas, and the adjacent coastal parts of the territory of Ukraine have not been liberated. — If we are talking about the national security of Ukraine at sea, how can we characterize its state today? — Everyone knows that, despite forcing the enemy’s forces to withdraw to the eastern part of the Black Sea, significant -gray areas- remain area of ​​the national maritime space of Ukraine in the Azov-Black Sea region. These water areas, which cover the uncontrolled part of the territorial sea, internal sea waters and the exclusive economic zone of Ukraine in the Black Sea and Ukrainian internal waters of the Sea of ​​Azov, total more than 123,000 sq.km or about 96.9% of their total volume of over 127,000 sq. km And this is only a one-sided and formal quantitative assessment of the state of security of our main national interests at sea. Therefore, the emergence of this Strategy is more relevant than ever. — What is the uniqueness of the new Ukrainian Strategy? — The fact is that a similar strategy, which defines the goals and objectives of ensuring national security at sea (maritime security), is far from available in every leading maritime country in the world. First developed in 2021, it was adopted in February 2022. But the start of a full-scale military invasion delayed its implementation for more than two years. The maritime security strategy of Ukraine is the latest and unique in its construction and development approaches. It can be classified as one of the best global standards, because the latest similar strategic documents of the world's leading states were used during its creation. For example, during the development of the Strategy, the National Maritime Security Strategy of Great Britain 2022, the National Maritime Security Strategy of Spain 2013, the Strategic Concept of Maritime Security of the Republic of Poland were studied. strong> of 2017 and others. The use of the best foreign models ensured a high level of quality of the Ukrainian Strategy. The uniqueness of the Strategy is also due to the fact that it was developed and implemented for the first time in the world in the conditions when the state is at war. On the one hand, it is not easy to develop a strategic document during permanent, 24/7 attacks by the enemy. On the other hand, its appearance takes into account the military experience that Ukraine has accumulated online during the war. It should also be noted that the Strategy is a medium-term planning document, so it takes into account not only current dangers and threats, primarily the danger of Ukraine's independence from the Russian Federation, but also other threats, including terrorism, piracy, illegal arms trade and migration, environmental threats and other. It is clear that at the present time these threats do not have priority relevance. — What should be understood by the maritime security of the state and what is the purpose of the Maritime Security Strategy of Ukraine? — A correct understanding of the subject of the Strategy is conditioned by a clear definition of the main concepts. The concept of maritime security of Ukraine refers to the protection of Ukraine's national interests at sea from existing and potential threats. In the conditions of the war, as a result of the actions of the enemy, in addition, there was a danger of the independence of Ukraine. That is, we need to use the term -danger-, including at sea, in relation to the loss of sovereignty and territorial integrity. Based on an overview of the fierce nature of the confrontation in the Russian war against Ukraine and its possible consequences, the main goals of ensuring maritime security in the Strategy include the de-occupation of temporarily occupied areas of the territorial sea, internal sea waters, the exclusive (maritime) economic zone, the continental shelf of Ukraine, as well as the provision of state sovereignty, sovereign and other rights in the maritime spaces of Ukraine. In addition, the Strategy defines other goals, the achievement of which ensures the development of Ukraine's capabilities. It is very valuable that the Strategy provides for the possibility of evaluating the effectiveness of its implementation. Although a generalized indicator for assessing the state of maritime security of the state is not given, it is noted that there are -quantitative (indicative) and qualitative indicators- provided for in the plan of measures for the implementation of the Strategy. Also, for independent experts, unfortunately, it remained unknown which indicators will be used to assess the operational capabilities of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Maritime Guard of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine. After all, it is these capabilities that should guarantee Ukraine's victory at sea at the present time. In order to coordinate actions and efforts in achieving the goals and fulfilling the tasks provided for in the Maritime Security Strategy of Ukraine, in November 2024, by order of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, a consultative and advisory body was created - an interdepartmental working group, and the provisions on it and its composition were approved. - I wonder what the main figures are in the action plan for the implementation of the Maritime Security Strategy? In your opinion, to what extent will they contribute to strengthening security and winning the war? - Given that success or failure on each day of the war can be decisive, strategy in war, especially at sea, must focus on measures and actions in the short term. Of course, both medium-term and long-term measures should be planned and implemented. However, what are the main measures envisaged in the Plan to complete their implementation already in 2024 and 2025? Among the measures envisaged in the Strategy implementation plan, the following are the most important: to ensure the Defense Forces' need for Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles with the creation of appropriate military, operational and strategic stocks; adopt high-speed patrol boats with striking capabilities into the Navy; conclude agreements with leading Western manufacturers and ensure joint production of sea unmanned and sea unmanned aircraft complexes of various purposes in accordance with identified needs. As we can see, the developers of the Strategy implementation plan relied on the experience of already conducted military operations at sea. It was realized and analyzed the superiority of Ukraine over the enemy thanks to the latest models of missile weapons, which include the Neptune missile complex, and maritime robotic systems, namely unmanned surface and unmanned aerial systems. Therefore, in the Strategy implementation plan, emphasis is placed on their development. Also during this period, it is planned to: increase the capabilities of the defense-industrial complex of Ukraine in the production of products to cover the needs of the Security and Defense Forces in naval weapons; implementation of measures provided for by the State Targeted Defense Program on the creation of a state integrated information system for covering the surface and underwater situation in the waters of the Black and Azov Seas and the basins of the Dnipro and Danube rivers, in particular, to deploy and ensure the sustainable functioning of the relevant information system on the basis of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine . Important measures should also include: holding consultations with the EU and NATO and making decisions regarding the earliest possible initiation of joint or coordinated security missions (sea patrols) in the Azov-Black Sea basin. During the period from 2024 to 2026, the plan envisages the implementation of the following main measures: signing a contract and starting the construction of two more corvettes for the Navy, probably referring to the ships of the Turkish Ada project and their acceptance into the Navy by 2030; implementation of 100% of the planned activities of the project -Building up the naval capabilities of Ukraine, sufficient to ensure the defense of the sea coast and the protection of national interests in the waters of the Black and Azov Seas and the Dnipro River-; implementation of the maritime situational awareness (MSA) system in the Navy and Maritime Guard of the State Border Service, as well as the exchange of relevant data with NATO. In the same period, the following is planned: the development and adoption of a draft law on the territorial sea of ​​Ukraine in the Sea of ​​Azov, the Kerch Strait and the northeastern part of the Black Sea, as well as the approval of a plan of measures for the demarcation of maritime spaces in the Black and Azov Seas and the Kerch Strait from the Russian Federation in accordance with norms of international law; concluding new agreements on cooperation in the field of security with the countries that joined the Joint Declaration on Support for Ukraine of July 12, 2023. in the city Vilnius, as well as the introduction of an initiative together with the leadership of the interested states to ensure the security of the Azov-Black Sea and Mediterranean regions, in particular the safety of navigation, the formation of the international platform -Safe Black Sea-. — And what, in your opinion, are the most important mid-term planning measures, i.e. for the period up to 2030, defined in the Action Plan for the Implementation of the Maritime Security Strategy of Ukraine? Maritime Guard of the State Border Service within the framework of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities. It is about the acquisition of capabilities by the Naval Forces in accordance with the future structure - Future Navy - 2035. Resolution of the issue of the construction in cooperation with Denmark of four multi-functional patrol ships of the MRPV type for the Navy and one for the maritime search - rescue service of the Ministry of Infrastructure. By 2028, it is planned to achieve the compatibility of the Navy and the Maritime Guard of the State Border Service with the naval forces and coast guard units of NATO and EU member states, ensuring readiness for joint use as part of international formations, species, interspecies and interagency groups. These measures will be carried out in accordance with the list of requirements for the interoperability of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, considered during the meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council of the NATO Summit in Washington. It is also envisaged to bring anti-ship capabilities into compliance with NATO standards, as well as the ability of the Navy and the Maritime Guard of the State Border Service to act in conditions of high-intensity operations, the implementation of cooperation in the joint management of integrated anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense. Also, during this period, it is planned to conclude international agreements on the temporary international military (naval) presence of NATO member states on the territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (after its de-occupation), demining the waters of the Black and Azov seas, internal waters of Ukraine with the assistance and participation of the countries -partners, NATO and the EU, to take measures to ensure environmental security, ensure development of the defense-industrial complex, in particular the shipbuilding industry, the development of the system of waterways and the creation and functioning of the Center for Situational Awareness on Inland Waterways. Ensuring Ukraine's permanent presence in international institutions on issues of maritime security and activities at sea and on international rivers will also be an important measure. The set of tasks to create a multi-level system of professional military education in accordance with NATO standards, the best domestic and foreign practices, and our own experience of conducting combat operations will be large in scope in the medium term. Thus, cooperation will be organized with numerous NATO centers of excellence dealing with issues of maritime security and maritime operations. The training of personnel of the Navy and the Maritime Guard of the State Border Service will also be expanded on the territory of European countries under the auspices of the European Union Assistance Mission to Ukraine. At the same time, by 2028, it is planned to complete the creation of the Naval Academy on the basis of the Institute of Naval Forces of the National University -Odesa Maritime Academy-, and the subordination of the academy to the Naval College for the Training of Senior Officers, the Naval Lyceum named after Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovany, the Diving Center training and survival at sea. The training sailing frigate -Druzhba- will be restored and put into active use for training cadets. In the interests of national and patriotic education, a modern museum of war at sea will be created during 2024-2030 on the basis of the Military and Historical Museum of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces (Odesa). An interactive branch of the museum will be introduced for all age groups with the use of gaming technologies for controlling unmanned (unmanned) systems and coastal missile systems. It is also planned to create the museum complex -Snake Island- as a branch of the museum. After the end of the hostilities at sea, the places where the ships of the Navy and the Maritime Guard of the DPS were killed will be established, measures will be taken to honor the memory of the fallen sailors and determine the historical and touristic places of resistance to the enemy on the island. Zmiiny, in the cities of Odesa, Ochakiv and others. —What are the risks and how will control over the implementation of the Strategy be carried out? — The biggest risk is the loss of the initiative at sea and the enemy’s attempt to overcome Ukraine’s technological and intellectual advantage in operations at sea. This requires already now, at the end of 2024 and at the beginning of 2025, to take all necessary measures to liberate Crimea, weaken the enemy's defenses in southern Ukraine, and thus create conditions for victory in other strategic directions. Therefore, if during the implementation of the Strategy there will not be a clear vision regarding the tasks and measures for the liberation of Crimea by military or other means, then the top leadership of the state and the military leaders of the Armed Forces and, in particular, the Navy will not have enough justifications regarding the expediency or possibility of conducting such an operation. Unlike -those ideas- offered by some independent experts. There are probably relevant data, facts, figures and calculations for this. As it is known, some experts offer options for carrying out a kind of -special military operation- to restore control over Crimea. This operation involves surprise raids from the sea to seize key logistics centers, military and government control points and critical military facilities after an intensive air operation to suppress all types of enemy defenses in Crimea. With regard to other risks and the implementation of control over the implementation of the Strategy, it is worth emphasizing that the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine must inform the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine about the results of the implementation of the plan every six months. In addition, the Government will make proposals to improve the effectiveness of activities to ensure the maritime security of the state. In its turn, the NSDC will make the necessary decisions regarding the protection of national interests and the defense of Ukraine at sea. It is important that the Strategy also provides for the implementation of democratic civil control over the activities of state bodies in relation to its implementation, as stipulated by the Law of Ukraine -On National Security of Ukraine-. Within this control, the media, independent experts and public associations will always play a decisive role. Summarizing, it is worth noting that the new Maritime Security Strategy of Ukraine is a clear sequence of steps leading to Ukraine's victory, particularly at sea. Yes, the Strategy does not unequivocally indicate in what way the Crimean Peninsula will be liberated - by diplomatic or military means. Because such information would be very useful to the enemy. Therefore, it should be in closed planning documents. For example, in the strategy of military operations of the Defense Forces of Ukraine at sea, which, I am sure, is already being developed and, most likely, is already being implemented.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/17/yak-peremogty-voroga-na-mori-ekspert-rozpoviv-pro-novu-strategiyu-morskoyi-bezpeky/	2024-12-16T20:39:06-08:00

Vitaly Syrlyak has been in the ranks of the Defense Forces since March 2022. He was a member of the ATO, spent some time in Austria. But with a large-scale invasion, the Russian Federation returned home. Took part in hostilities first in Zaporozhye and Kherson region, and from November 2022 - in Donetsk region. -At the beginning of 2022, there were not so many drones, it was easier to work. Now there are a lot of them, they monitor positions, you need to camouflage well, open fire only under certain weather conditions. The most difficult was in Donetsk region, especially in Soledar, to which we were transferred in September 2022. Then Bakhmut, Klishchiivka, Chasiv Yar,- the military man recalls. He is now a full Chevalier of the Order of Courage. Collected a -collection- of awards more than in a year. So, for bravery in the battles in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson Oblast, by the Decree of the President of Ukraine dated January 9, 2023, he was awarded the Order -For Courage- III degree. For heroism in the battles in the Bakhmut direction from November 2022 to December 2022 12 awarded in February 2024 Order -For Courage- II degree. The Order -For Courage- 1st degree was awarded for initiative, professionalism, personal courage and heroism, shown during the performance of military duty in conditions associated with the risk to life during the defense of Time Yar. -The award is nice. But I believe that this is the merit of my entire team, with whom I fought. We did it together,- commented Vitaly Sirlyak on receiving the award. Under his leadership, the brigade destroyed enemy guns and mortars, MLRS systems, enemy tanks and armored fighting vehicles, BC field depots, and a significant number of enemy manpower. On September 9 of this year, Vitaly was injured. He is currently undergoing rehabilitation in Lviv Oblast and is waiting for a hand prosthesis: -My wife supports me very much.

Chasiv Yar is stormed by an invasion of drones - the enemy uses new tactics	Andrii Polukhin, a serviceman of the 24th mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, told this on the ArmyTV stream. -Our drones are actively working, so are the enemy's drones. Sometimes they work with such density that it is almost impossible to leave the shelter. And taking advantage of this, small infantry groups of the enemy cross the canal,- Andriy Polukhin said. According to him, the enemy is trying to advance in the city with all its forces. -At this time, the front line is still fixed along the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas channel, but the enemy sometimes penetrates with small infantry groups to the rear of our positions and imposes battles there.

About this is distributed in a statement of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which December 16 General Staff Armed Forces Through such interrogations, the enemy tries to spread propaganda narratives, creating the illusion of -distrust- in the military-political leadership of the state, the Defense Forces of Ukraine, or the -surrender- of territories. It is also used to justify aggression by the enemy. Videos may contain statements taken out of context or inaccurate facts that can be interpreted in favor of the enemy. Thus, the aggressor tries to form false ideas about the situation at the front and the general mood in Ukrainian society. It should be remembered that captured military personnel may testify under physical or psychological pressure. In the conditions of interrogations carried out by the aggressor, they can be forced to voice what is imposed on them, without reflecting their true opinion or position. This is not evidence of betrayal or lack of patriotism, but rather the result of the difficult conditions of captivity. It is important to be careful and critical of videos that are distributed by the enemy. It is necessary to realize that these materials can be partially or completely falsified. -Let's remember that the informational struggle is an integral part of repelling armed aggression, and by joining forces, we can resist enemy propaganda!- the message says.

-We have our scores with the enemy-: the story of the Savchenko family, which lost two sons in the w...	Today, lieutenant colonel Serhiy Savchenko holds the post of chief of staff - first deputy commander of the voluntary formation of the Sumy urban territorial community. - Serhii, when and how did you learn about the enemy's invasion? From the TV news? — All decent Ukrainians knew that the liberators were about to visit us. After all, everything that Putin and his henchmen said on the eve of the invasion, the anti-Ukrainian hysteria that affected almost all Russians, the accumulation of troops and weapons in the immediate vicinity of the border indicated that war would inevitably knock on our door. Personally, I and my closest friends learned about the date of the invasion a day before it - February 23. From what sources - I will not say: the time has not yet come. - Weren't you stunned by such news? - No, but my soul became somehow anxious and even creepy. My friends and I, and these were mostly yesterday's soldiers, in particular, participants of the anti-terrorist operation, who at one time served in the special forces and had combat training, decided to act. We didn't have a single machine gun or even a pistol. But practically all of us were hunters, and had quite decent hunting carbines and rifles. It is about 20 kilometers from Sumy to the border with Moscow. So on the night of February 23-24, we advanced to him. Around five o'clock in the morning, they saw a small convoy of vehicles, which consisted of cars and an armored personnel carrier. In 30-40 minutes, some of them caught fire, and a few got to us as trophies. As well as small arms. Some -liberators- also fell into our hands, whom we soon handed over to the competent authorities, starting to fill the so-called exchange fund. Apparently, the stars aligned in the sky and the Lord God Himself favored us (smiles. — Ed.). And the factor of suddenness worked. Firstly, they hoped that they would be treated to vodka and dumplings here from the very morning, and secondly, the column consisted exclusively of conscript soldiers of the first year of service, led by a lieutenant who had graduated from a military school just a few months before the invasion and about the war knew from movies. True, one of our comrades died in a short skirmish. That's how, in short, my new stage of life began, which has been going on for almost three years now. In general, I will say that then, in the first hours of the invasion, many residents of Sumy Oblast resisted. And why, on the first day of the invasion, the occupiers found themselves on the outskirts of the regional center, not to mention the border villages, then, in my opinion, the factor of suddenness, their number, the amount of weapons also worked: according to these indicators, they outnumbered us many times. — After being discharged in 2006, 10 years later you returned to the army again, spending three years in the ATO/OO area. How did it happen? — During 30 years of service in officer positions, I gained experience. So, in 2016, he volunteered for the army, taking the position of chief of staff of the howitzer division in the 95th Airborne Assault Brigade. Three years later, he resigned and was appointed head of the district state administration of the Putivl district. After being released from this position, he engaged in military-patriotic education of youth. On public grounds. — What tasks are assigned to your voluntary formation? Who is part of it? — We are subordinate to the Sumy Territorial Defense Brigade. The main tasks are the protection of Sumy itself and important facilities located in the city, the fight against sabotage and reconnaissance groups, anti-aircraft warfare, as well as the destruction of enemy UAVs, i.e. -Shakheds-. For this purpose, we have several mobile groups armed with heavy machine guns. They already have 5 shot down Shaheds. Company strongholds have been set up, at which our fighters are on duty 24 hours a day, at which our fighters take turns holding the defense. There are also sapper units capable of demining and demining, erecting various defensive objects, etc. The average age of the boys is 50–52 years. All of them are different in age, profession, state of health, but they are able to hold weapons in their hands. Also, they love their land, are ready to protect their children, wives, and parents. Especially valued are people with combat experience who have undergone a -run-in- during ATO/OOS. Our formation is maintained at the expense of the Sumy territorial community. Financial support varies between 8-9 thousand hryvnias, we have some social benefits. But the absolute majority of guys joined the ranks of the formation not because of any material benefits: the driver of the same -route- receives much more. Many have their accounts with Muscovites. After all, among us there are those who lost their children, wives, parents, and ultimately their homes in this war. — The length of the Ukrainian-Russian border through the territory of the Sumy region reaches about 600 kilometers, and the regional center and Russia are separated by some 22 kilometers. Hence the question: do katsaps bother the countrymen a lot? — Already in the morning of February 24, Russian troops approached the city from the north-eastern direction, after which the fighting for it began. In some places, Muscovites managed to enter the city itself. Those were days filled with horror, the deaths of many people, including children, and the destruction of many buildings. Back in the summer of 2022, experts estimated that the Russians destroyed about two thousand buildings. Sumyshchyna is under constant rocket and artillery attacks: the distance that separates us from this devil allows him to strike from his territory. - Don't sabotage-intelligence groups give you peace either? - As my guys joke, they keep us in a constant state of tension, not allowing us to relax even for an hour. Today, our Sumyshchyna comes under fire dozens of times during the day, 5-7 DRGs penetrate our territory every day, trying not only to gather intelligence, but also to commit various acts of sabotage. These groups of up to 15 people are well prepared and armed to the teeth. I will not say that it was the volunteer formations that played and continue to play a decisive role in the confrontation with the enemy. After all, in addition to us, many units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, National Security Service of Ukraine, Security Service of Ukraine, National Police, State Security Service are concentrated here. We restrain and destroy the enemy by joint efforts. - I know that in the struggle with our eternal enemies you lost your two sons&#8230; - It hurts, it hurts to talk about it (he falls silent for a few minutes. - Ed.). The younger son Maksym died in 2014 while commanding the assault group 95 DShB. And it was his death that prompted me to go to the TCC and ask to join the army. The desire to avenge the death of my son, to protect my native land became the meaning of my life since then. On March 13, 2024, these creatures took the life of Denis's eldest son, who was serving in the 27th separate rocket artillery brigade. And if I were a little younger, had better health, I would be fighting -at zero- today. But, I think, here I am also useful. - What does lieutenant colonel Serhiy Savchenko dream about the most? - I used to fall asleep and wake up with only one dream - that my boys would return home alive and unharmed. Unfortunately, this dream was not destined to come true. So what can I dream about today? So that the Ukrainians as soon as possible defeat this wild tribe of creatures that came to kill, rape and rob. And I also dream that my grandchildren Arina, Sava and Ulyana will grow up to be worthy children of their parents, who gave their lives for their future. I am a Christian. But I will express a sinful desire that you cannot call a Christian desire. I want to see a bastard called poutine with a zashmorg around his neck. As well as his closest friends who bathe in our blood. This is my greatest desire, although I take sin upon myself with these words. But the one who lost a son or daughter in this cursed war, whose grandchildren these bastards made half-orphans, will understand me, I hope.

It is necessary to protect the Ukrainian population and infrastructure from the attacks of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. It is also important to protect the export of grain and other goods by sea, which provides an important income for Ukraine,- said Prime Minister Jonas Har Støre. He announced the new donation from the Norwegian Nansen program during a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Norway and Great Britain lead the Coalition of Maritime Capability of Ukraine, which was launched in December a year ago. A portion of the funds will go toward innovation and autonomy efforts in the Maritime Capabilities Coalition. Several specific innovative projects and development projects are working on strengthening safety at sea.

the authorities of the Russian Federation are unable to ensure the demand for currency in the countr...	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. This amount is not enough to cover the entire demand for foreign currency in the country and indicates the inability of the Russian Federation to ensure the specified level of imports at the expense of the available foreign exchange revenues. According to the preliminary assessment of the balance of payments (as of December 12), exports of the Russian Federation in September amounted to 39.1 billion dollars. USA, in October - 36.6 billion US dollars, and in November - 32.2 billion US dollars. Imports were $26.8 billion in September, $27.5 billion in October and $25.9 billion in November. The downward trend in exports is due to the drop in demand for Russian energy carriers, as well as increased competition on international markets. China's purchases of Russian coal from January to November decreased by 21% year-on-year — from $13.3 billion. USA up to 10.5 billion dollars. USA. In addition, India reduced the import of Russian coal - from January to September it was 26% less than in the same period last year. The total figure of Russian coal exports for 11 months decreased by 23% from 30.3 billion dollars. USA up to 23.3 billion dollars. USA. the Russian coal industry was on the verge of bankruptcy due to falling coal prices and high production costs. To support businesses, the Russian government canceled export duties on coking coal and extended a moratorium on other duties until the end of 2024. At the same time, China increased coal imports by 14.8% year-on-year to 490 million tons between January and November. However, this growth came at the expense of increased supplies from Mongolia and Australia. The decrease in foreign exchange earnings and the reduction of exports, which is directly related to the war against Ukraine, has a negative impact on the Russian economy, increasing financial instability. As a result, this leads to a further weakening of the ruble and a deepening of the budget deficit of the aggressor country. We remind you that while the transitional government of Syria under led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is consolidating power in the country, Russian troops continue to evacuate from the region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/vlada-rf-nezdatna-zabezpechyty-popyt-na-valyutu-v-krayini-deficzyt-byudzhetu-poglybytsya/	2024-12-16T05:54:22-08:00

Corpses in the pipes - under Chasov Yar, the enemy is crushed in the canal	The video of the combat work was published on the brigade's channel. -The occupiers are learning and improving their tactics every day — they use small assault group tactics instead of massive mechanized assaults. Enemy stormtroopers are trying to infiltrate our positions and gain a foothold. One of these -gathering points- in Chasovoy Yar is the canal pipes,- the brigade commented on the video. It is in those pipes that a significant number of occupants find their death. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the -Rarog- unmanned systems battalion of the 24th mechanized brigade named after King Danylo destroyed several units of enemy equipment, in particular the Russian MT-LB with the RBU-6000 -Smerch-2- naval bomb launcher installed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/trupy-u-trubah-pid-chasovym-yarom-voroga-nyshhat-u-kanali/	2024-12-16T05:11:28-08:00

In this regard, the Kremlin began to open -volunteer- centers, particularly in Donetsk. The task of the -volunteers- who arrived from the Russian Federation is to plan propaganda events until May 9. At the same time, all measures must be structured and carry a general narrative about the exclusive victory of the Russian Federation in this war. Downplaying the role of allies, denying the alliance between Stalin and Hitler at the beginning of the war and discrediting the role of Ukraine in this war. In particular, Ukrainians will be portrayed as collaborators, Nazis, and draw parallels between the present day. Occupying administrations will ensure attendance at the events by force. We remind you, in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk oblast, the Russian invaders want to legalize the so-called nationalization of apartments and houses that have been abandoned since 2014 year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/rosiyany-stvoryly-volonterski-czentry-pidgotovky-shabashiv-do-80-richchya-dnya-peremogy/	2024-12-16T04:57:01-08:00
the Russian Federation is unable to exert geopolitical influence on several fronts at the same time	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Large amphibious ships are urgently transferred to the Mediterranean Sea from the Baltic and North Seas to evacuate the occupation contingent. There are also chartered vessels under the flags of -convenient- countries for loading equipment near Tartus. Cargo planes are used to move troops from the Khmeimim air base. Negotiations with HTS regarding Russian bases are coming to a logical end - they have no place on the territory of Syria. From the rest of the strongholds in Syria, in particular in the areas of Manbij, Kobani and Qamishli, which were not specified in the agreement on bases in Latakia, Russian troops are moving in the direction of Tartus or Khmeimim. Minister of Defense of Turkey Ya. Güler supported the withdrawal of Russian troops to Khmeimim and Tartus, assuming that Turkey would act against other Russian bases. In general, the situation is a logical result of the aggressive foreign policy of the Russian Federation. After the fall of the Assad regime, the Russian presence in Syria has no prospects. Also, the defeat of one of Russia's closest allies undermines the reputation of the Kremlin in Africa, where many leaders considered Russia a guarantor of their regimes against internal and external threats. This is yet another confirmation that the Kremlin's war against Ukraine weakens Russia's position in other key regions, emphasizes its limited resources and inability to exert geopolitical influence on several fronts at the same time. We remind you, December 15, 2024 columns the troops of the aggressor state continued to withdraw from the interior of the country to the bases in Khmeimim and Tartus, control over which the Kremlin seeks and hopes save.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/rf-ne-v-zmozi-geopolitychno-vplyvaty-na-dekilkoh-frontah-odnochasno/	2024-12-16T04:41:27-08:00
An enemy general was suspected of ordering the use of chemical weapons against our soldiers	reported this on December 16 Security Service of Ukraine. The official is responsible for the mass use of prohibited chemical weapons by the Russian Federation against the Defense Forces on the eastern and southern fronts of Ukraine. By order of Kirillov, since the beginning of the full-scale war, more than 4,800 cases of enemy use of chemical weapons. In particular, we are talking about combat grenades -K-1-, which are equipped with poisonous substances of an irritating effect - CS and CN. Their use is prohibited by the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction dated January 13, 1993. During the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, more than 2,000 people were sent to military hospitals and other medical facilities in Ukraine. of the Defense Forces with various degrees of chemical poisoning. For the most part, the occupiers use ammunition with poisonous substances in the form of drops from FPV drones on the defense points of Ukrainian defenders. When grenades with a chemical charge are activated, their poisonous compounds affect the mucous membranes of a person, primarily the eyes and respiratory tract. In this way, the Rashists are trying to force Ukrainian soldiers to come out of the trenches under the direct fire of the occupiers. According to the investigation, the occupiers use dangerous chemicals mainly in the hottest areas of hostilities, where they try to hide the use of chemical agents under heavy artillery fire. The SBU identified Russian grenades with poisonous substances and corresponding soil samples on the battlefield and handed them over to the international Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in a procedural manner (chain-of-custody). Two laboratories of this institution, which operate separately from each other, confirmed the respective war crimes of Russia. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed Kirillov in absentia about the suspicion under part. 2 Art. 28, ch. 1 Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (a war crime committed by a group of persons based on a prior conspiracy). The pre-trial investigation continues to document other violations of international humanitarian law by the occupiers. As reported by ArmyInform, more than two thousand Ukrainian military were poisoned by the troops of the aggressor country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/vorozhyj-general-otrymav-pidozru-za-nakaz-zastosuvaty-himichnu-zbroyu-proty-nashyh-bijcziv/	2024-12-16T04:22:39-08:00

The Navy explained why the occupiers' ships are sinking in the Black Sea even without Ukrainian dron...	The spokesperson of the Naval Forces told about this on the air -Suspilne Novosti- Ukrainian Armed Forces captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. According to him, two tankers, which are actually river-class vessels, went out to sea without complying with shipping conditions. And the fact that they would go to the bottom was only a matter of time. -They are 50+ years old - each of them. Therefore, here, as always, the Russians violated everything they could violate. There is also information that they were detained at the anchorage longer than planned. But the captain of the ship had to take into account all these factors and, accordingly, calculate all the risks,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. However, as the spokesman of the Navy noted, the smooth operation of rusty oil tankers is vital for the Russian Federation. Therefore, they will be sent in any weather. -Transferring Russian oil or other fuels and lubricants is more important to them than complying with the requirements for the safety of civil shipping. This is not the only incident. This is also the permanent shutdown of the identification system, this is also non-compliance with the requirements regarding coastal warnings,- said the spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, the number of barges, which were supposed to protect the -illegal construction- in the Kerch Strait, decreased - only 18 remained.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/u-vms-rozpovily-chomu-sudna-okupantiv-tonut-v-chornomu-mori-navit-bez-ukrayinskyh-droniv/	2024-12-16T03:52:17-08:00

The Lector's record-breaking shot was noted by the head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov. -A masterpiece that will definitely go down in the history of our struggle for freedom. Hitting a moving target at such a distance is a huge achievement; evidence of high professionalism and concentration, which Ukrainian military intelligence snipers are famous for. We continue the fight to destroy even more Russian occupiers,- said Kyrylo Budanov. In civilian life, -Lecturer- worked as a hunter. He joined the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine together with his son.

During the full-scale invasion of the -Lektor- account, more than three dozen targets were already destroyed. According to the sniper, he selects a separate type of rifle for each task. The historic hit shot at 2,069 meters was made with the Sako M10. -But if I had to choose one rifle and one cartridge, I would take the Sadex Kraken and the .338LM caliber,- Lector noted. It is noted that the confirmed record for this caliber is held by a British sniper, Royal Blues and Royals Guards Corporal Craig Harrison. In November 2009, during the war in Afghanistan, he successfully hit two Taliban at a distance of 2,475 meters, and also damaged their machine gun. Harrison fired while lying down, in a significantly higher position than his targets. Accuracy, according to the corporal, was also helped by windless weather and clear visibility.

-Kunytsia- on tracks: marines in the Pokrovsky direction were reinforced by German Marder BMPs	The commander of the 38th brigade's amphibious assault company, Lieutenant Rostislav with the call sign -Shelby-, told ArmyInform correspondents about the combat capabilities of the German vehicle and how these BMPs will help the marines defend Donetsk region from the onslaught of Russian invaders. BMP Marder -in translation - -Marten-- is a German tracked infantry fighting vehicle manufactured by the Rheinmetall concern, which was the main combat vehicle of the Bundeswehr from the 1970s to the 2010s. The marines note the good booking of these BMPs. The Marder can protect the crew from bullets, 30mm shells and small shrapnel. It owes its protection to welded steel. There were cases when these BMPs during the Russian-Ukrainian war withstood hits even from 30-mm automatic guns in the frontal projection. The machine is easy to operate. It has an automatic gearbox and mechanics: three gears - three forward and three reverse. -Very practical and fairly mobile machine, able to cross different areas of the terrain thanks to the tracked base. Of course, the swamp will be much more difficult to pass, because its weight is about 30-35 tons. But what is important in combat missions is speed. On the highway - up to 65 km/h, on rough terrain - up to 45 km/h. The operational range of work is up to 600 km. Shelby says the Marder has better cross-country ability and armor than the Soviet BMP-1 and BMP-2 models. They are comfortable for the movement of military personnel. The crew is 3 people, the landing compartment is designed for six fighters in full equipment. -The seats for the staff are conveniently located in the car. Even when driving off-road and maneuvering an armored personnel carrier, the guys feel quite confident inside.- Regarding weapons. The Marder's main weapon is a 20mm cannon that can effectively engage lightly armored targets and enemy manpower. Its damage range is up to 2.5 km. In addition, the BMP has 7.62 mm machine guns. Cannon ammunition is 1250 rounds, machine gun 5000 rounds. The declared rate of fire of the gun is up to 1000 rounds per minute. There is also an anti-tank complex MILAN 2T with a firing range of 2 km. The Marder is additionally equipped with a deployable anti-drone net to counter Russian FPV drones. Komroty Rostyslav tells: after receiving the BMP, the units undergo practical training. Before that, driver mechanics and gunners underwent a 2-week training course on the operation and use of combat vehicles. Currently, they are already working directly on Marder. Vehicle commanders are still undergoing training and will soon join their crews. In general, the training includes BMP management techniques, technical maintenance features, providing guidance on the combat use of weapons. The crews train to target and shoot. The guys learn to repair equipment on the spot, it is very important to be able to troubleshoot during combat operations, so to speak, -repair from the wheels.- If you compare Marder with Viking amphibious all-terrain vehicles, -Shelby- emphasizes: -At one time, we worked on APC. In my opinion, Marder is more practical in operation and has a higher degree of armor protection and more powerful firepower this combat vehicle can be used for various purposes - both for the delivery of personnel to the positions and for evacuation from them armored capsule, even if the car is blown up, the personnel will remain unharmed and can continue to perform combat missions. He came across this BMP while studying at the Military Academy in Odessa, and then worked on it at the Training Center of the Military Academy. Therefore, I think the German car is somewhat better than the Viking. Although the amphibious armored personnel carrier is able to overcome water obstacles and operate in flooded areas, thanks to the wide rubber track. -I am from Odesa region. At the age of 15, he went to study at the Naval Lyceum named after Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovayn. After that, he entered the Faculty of Airborne Assault Troops and Marines at the Military Academy (Odesa). After graduation, he joined the 38th Marine Brigade, which, in fact, he wanted to join. I really wanted to be a combat officer, to manage personnel in combat conditions, in war. To work in difficult conditions. Management noticed. I was encouraged and given the opportunity to lead an assault company. Rostislav, commanding a company in battle, was wounded. But he says everything is ok. 3 days in the hospital and then returned to his unit. -We have a pretty great atmosphere in the unit, but it all starts with a personal example. In the mouth, the vast majority are men older than me, who are more than 30-40 years old. An individual approach to each. We are the Marines, we are one team. Brotherhood and trust are the foundation. The boys pick up Marine values ​​very quickly. I am very happy when I see how my subordinates learn and strive to become better. How the level of training of fighters increases, where there is a certain breakthrough in the knowledge of combat, weapons and technical equipment. We look at the potential of each and determine where it will be better to perform a combat task, so that the coefficient of useful action only increases, and does not stand still.- By the way, recently the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrsky, awarded Rostislav with the -Cross of the Brave- badge. The young company commander received the award for personal courage and heroism, demonstrated during combat missions to protect the state sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/kunyczya-na-gusenyczyah-morpihiv-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-posylyly-nimeczkymy-bmp-marder/	2024-12-15T21:01:57-08:00
Artificial intelligence is modernizing transport: NATO vehicles will be equipped with an operating s...	As experts from the Dutch Army Recognition portal emphasize, this system is designed to modernize existing vehicles by converting them into autonomous and interconnected units, while ensuring integration with current defense and commercial operations, ArmyInform notes. The platform is focused on enabling the military to increase mission flexibility and adaptability without the need to replace existing equipment. The Mithra OS includes the Legacy Autonomy Kit, an upgrade feature that equips conventional vehicles with AI-based capabilities. These upgrades include adaptive navigation, autonomous intelligence, and remote control, reducing the need for human intervention. The system supports both manned-unmanned and unmanned-unmanned command, which ensures increased safety and operational efficiency. Another feature, Interconnectivity &amp; Swarming Pilot allows vehicles to share real-time data and conduct synchronized operations, while the Situational Awareness Suite integrates sensors for real-time monitoring and data processing to improve battlefield intelligence. In the manned-unmanned group, unmanned units perform tasks such as reconnaissance, evacuation of wounded and intelligence sharing. In an unmanned joint, this facilitates the coordination of unmanned ground and aerial vehicles for tasks such as perimeter security and combined reconnaissance. In addition, Mithra OS enables autonomous missions, including reconnaissance in high-risk areas and demining operations aimed at reducing threats and increasing security for advancing forces. Mithra OS can also be used in a non-military context, offering tools to improve the productivity and flexibility of commercial operations. The platform's modular and scalable design allows it to be integrated into autonomous and connected systems in various sectors. ARX ​​​​Roboticsemphasizes that the system is compatible with legacy software and includes its capabilities update in radio mode. This ensures that existing fleets can adapt to new technologies, potentially extending their service life. The modular approach aims to enable operators to efficiently upgrade their fleets, addressing both current operational challenges and future requirements. According to Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Frank Leidenberger, BWI's CEO, upgrading legacy equipment is a practical solution to meet the evolving needs of the military within budget constraints. The development of operating systems based on artificial intelligence for military equipment reflects the global trend of modernization of the armed forces. Germany's Rheinmetall is working with American company Auterion to create standardized software for drones aimed at increasing interoperability between NATO allies. In the United States, Textron Systems and Kodiak Robotics are working on artificial intelligence-based autonomy for military ground vehicles, and Anduril Industries has developed the Lattice operating system to coordinate autonomous assets such as drones. Australian company BAE Systems introduced the ATLAS platform for integrating autonomy with existing military systems. These programs are focused on upgrading existing fleets rather than acquiring new platforms to address cost and operational efficiency issues. Several other systems have also been developed in recent years that turn military vehicles into remotely operated or autonomous units. Milrem Robotics has developed a set of intelligent features that give cars the ability to operate autonomously or with the help of remote control. The US Army has tested the Light Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV-L), a semi-autonomous system designed to improve mobility on the battlefield while reducing risks to personnel. Defense company ARX Robotics has unveiled ARX Mithra OS, which it describes as the first independent AI-based operating system for military vehicles.

Drone revolution: Ukrainians show fantastic results. The expert called the phenomenon of this war	What does this mean, ArmiyaInform asked military expert Petr Chernyk: -Drones of all classes, varieties and types are becoming a very serious strike force. True, one must understand that they will never really replace barrel artillery or aviation. These are the types of weapons that will always be appropriate and valid in any war. At the same time, the drone revolution did take place and we, Ukrainians, showed fantastic results in part of their application. Here are just a few words about the types and varieties of drones. All drones are divided into two categories: reconnaissance - those that collect information about the enemy and strike. This is if we are talking about the aerial component, because we understand that there are also ground drones and surface drones, but still aerial drones are the main mass. According to the method of technical use, there are drones -on the wing- and what we call -copters-, that is, small helicopters. Their combat load can vary from a few grams or kilograms of explosives (say, even TM-62 - an anti-tank mine is already integrated into drones) to 50 kg, or even up to 100 kg. The most popular drones currently in use on the front line are so-called FPV drones. Those controlled by a person at a distance of several hundred meters to, as a rule, 15-20 km. This is precisely the area of ​​operation of barrel artillery. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has provided our Armed Forces with up to a million drones over the past year. Is it a lot or a little? If you divide by 365 days, you get about 2,700 drones per day. That's pretty good. At the same time, understanding that we have 1,000 kilometers of demarcation line, that's roughly 2.7 drones, rounding up to three drones per kilometer. Let me remind you that 1.5 km is an oral reference point. It's not that much anymore. This is an average. That is, in order for drones to really change something in a part of the battlefield, their number must be seriously increased. Another million plus would be a colossal step forward. The Ukrainians have reached such a filigree work with drones that an FPV kamikaze drone can fly directly into the head of the occupier, or, say, into a tinted car. Plus, in this part, drones also need to be divided into two categories: this is a suicide drone that has explosives on it, and the drone dies when it explodes, and the so-called -resets-. -Drop- is an improvised explosive device, or, say, a fragmentation hand grenade of the F1 or RGT-5 type, or RGO, or RGN, which is dropped from a height of several meters and works very accurately primarily on manpower. Indeed, drones are a phenomenon in this war. One very specific example: during 90 days of fighting, 4,500 pieces of barrel artillery were destroyed in the summer part. This, if divided by 72, because that is how the artillery brigade is equipped, is more than 60 brigades. Half of it was destroyed precisely with the help of drones. Drones are our everything, so I appeal to the citizens of Ukraine: we will donate, donate and donate again for drones. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/revolyucziya-droniv-ukrayinczi-pokazuyut-fantastychni-rezultaty-ekspert-nazvav-fenomen-cziyeyi-vijny/	2024-12-15T20:26:17-08:00
From a TV presenter to a press officer for the Steelers: what Dina Wong will never forget	I joined the army because I felt that I should and could take responsibility for the future of the country, that I was ready to take decisive action to stop Russian aggression, that I would finally be able to do something valuable and meaningful in my life. Dina cooperates with ArmiyaInform, tells about the successes of the brigade at the front. It recently came out na-kurshhyni/-> author's material about the commander of the division of the rifle battalion with the call sign -Red-. During the interview, ArmyInform asked Dina Wong about the brigade in which she serves, about her brothers and sisters, memorable episodes of the war, and plans for the future after the Victory. - What kind of people do you have to serve with? What is interesting about your brigade? - I am currently serving in the 1st separate tank Siver brigade. The brigade was involved in a number of key operations during the ATO period, and continued to defend the country in the East during the Soviet Union. But for me, as a resident of Chernihiv, the participation of the steel workers in the defense of the city and Chernihiv region is especially valuable and significant. In fact, I owe my life to the servicemen of the 1st separate Siver tank brigade. People here are different. But equally steel. We have many divisions, so it is difficult to make any generalization. I just want to emphasize that our tankers are currently working at the limit of the impossible. If necessary, they go out for direct targeting and successfully destroy places of concentration of enemy personnel and their equipment. In the conditions of modern war, when the enemy can direct from 20 fpv and more to one tank, not counting other means, such work requires a steel character. Such as our tankers. Fighters of the rifle and mechanized battalions firmly hold their positions in the areas of our responsibility. For me, each of them is a Hero. I think if you have an idea of ​​how the infantry works, then you can not explain further. Our gunners do not like the phrase -Gods of War-, but I believe that this description is completely deserved for them. The way they destroy the enemy is truly divine. You can make sure of this if you look at the video of their work on our page. -Pegasus- - the fighters of the company of unmanned attack aircraft systems are particularly fond of destroying moving targets. This unit is made up of people who are constantly improving their skills. Our brigade is also a repair and restoration battalion, where specialists with truly golden hands serve. These are also fighters of the engineering and sapper company; scouts, REBivtsi. Everyone risks their lives during combat missions. That's why it's hard for me to single out one person, for me all our fighting guys are heroes. - Are there any episodes of the war that will never be forgotten? - It is difficult for me to answer this question. A lot has already happened. But the beginning of the large-scale invasion of Chernihiv Oblast is something I will definitely always remember. I was a civilian then, and because of what I experienced, I am now in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Because, first of all, I don't want the war to continue and be repeated again. Second, the enemy must answer for what he has done. - Tell us about the most difficult and happiest moments during the service. - The most difficult thing is, obviously, losing your brothers. War is war, people die in war, but it is still very difficult for me when people die from the battalion in which I started my service and from the brigade in which I am currently serving. Subjectively. The happiest is working with one of our tank units. I believe (and this is my personal opinion, not as a representative of the communications department, but simply as a person who serves in the army) that one of the tank battalions of the 1st Separate Tank Siver Brigade is the embodiment of what the Ukrainian army should really be. I have great respect for all of our divisions. I admire our infantrymen and artillerymen. It's just that if I abstract and say that what has strengthened my motivation and belief in victory the most is working with tankers. - How do friends, acquaintances who have remained civilians perceive that you serve? - They perceive. Everyone understood that this would be the case. At one time, I publicly voiced my position, so some things are absolutely obvious. - Can you tell us about the oldest and youngest fighter in the brigade, other interesting brothers and sisters? - I have already said that I cannot single out one person, because I believe that all our fighters are legends. But I don't think anyone will be offended if I tell you about our pseudo-demons. She was the commander of the BMP and the commander of the department. She is one of those who protected Chernihiv. She took part in quite difficult battles in the East of the country. The guys talk about her as a fair but strict commander. People from her battalion (mechanized battalion 1 of the separate Siver tank brigade) treat her with great respect. He is a very strong, strong-willed and competent person, I am honored that we serve in the same brigade. She has already done so much for the common victory. I understand that very often people are interested in the topic of women in the army. But our Demon is primarily about what a real effective leader, commander and warrior should be. She is a young and very beautiful girl. However, this did not prevent her from breaking all possible stereotypes about women in the army and gaining authority among her peers. I personally admire her. And I am grateful for Chernihiv. And also, from my own observations. There is a tendency in our tank battalions that both very young guys and older soldiers serve. There are quite a few tank commanders who are not yet 25. They signed contracts at the age of 18-19. There are also those who are over 50, for example. But these are very experienced tankers. And they perform their tasks at a very high level. Despite such a difference in age, the crews have a perfect understanding. Of course, tankers sometimes joke that they have boys commanding grandfathers, but this is no more than a joke. Everyone does their work with maximum dedication. Our crews are a symbol that the youth are ready to fight and are fighting for their country. And that the older generation is just as actively working to win. It's inspiring. - Do you feel on the same level as the boys? What is the attitude towards a woman in the unit? - In our brigade, you are treated first of all as a specialist, as a military serviceman. Regardless of your gender. - Is journalism at the front different from journalism before you joined the army? Tell us about your creative experience. - The work of a communications officer and the work of a journalist are fundamentally different things, so I don't think it's worth comparing them. Although there is something in common. I will only note that my experience in journalism contributes to my work as a representative of the brigade's communications department. —How do you motivate to join the team? Tell us about your recruiting experience. — In different battalions of our brigade there are people from Chernihiv region who joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine after the beginning of the large-scale invasion. They fundamentally wanted to join the 1st separate Siver tank brigade, because it was she who liberated their cities from occupation. This motivation completely coincides with my own, by the way. But. Our brigade is called a tank brigade, but we have many different units. In fact, here, a person can choose his path in the army - he can be a tank driver, an artilleryman, a medic, a scout, an infantryman; can repair equipment, can work on means of radio-electronic warfare. There are many paths to victory, and we suggest you choose your own and follow it as part of the 1st Separate Siver Tank Brigade. As for recruiting, now a person can call us directly and consult about the service. Her skills and competencies will be taken into account, of course, her wishes will be taken into account. In addition, our Recruiting Group officers will advise on returning from the SDF and on the possibility of transfer from another place of service. Let me remind you of our contact: 0688824156. - Do the brigade and you personally maintain contact with the families of the victims? - Of course, our officers from the civil-military cooperation department are constantly in contact with the families of the victims. Also, the siblings of our Heroes are constantly in touch with their loved ones. — What do you dream of doing after the Victory? Will you continue to be in the army or will you return to civilian life? - My main desire is to return to Chernihiv and live there peacefully and happily. This is a wish I am absolutely sure of. As for what I will be doing, it is still too early to talk about it. Above all, Victory. And Victory will grant the right to choose further.

45 -boys in panties- on organs: the enemy invents -atrocities- in Kurshchyna	In particular, a member of the Russian State Duma Nikolai Ivanov accuses the Ukrainian military of creating -death camps in the homes of civilians-, burning villages and destroying social infrastructure. The propagandists draw special attention to the -fate of 45 children- (-boys in panties-) who were allegedly -taken to Ukraine for organ trading-, which is why -the price of donor organs fell in the West-. It is also claimed about the alleged -stealing of livestock and grain-. the Russian MP did not provide any independent verifiable evidence of his claims. Similar statements are often spread by Russian propaganda for manipulation without a factual basis. The statement about -reducing prices for donor organs- is absurd and reinforces the already existing propaganda message about Ukraine as the -center of black transplantology.- Despite the fact that, in fact, the system of organ transplantation has high standards of verification of their origin and international monitoring. Such -throw-ins- are aimed at diverting attention from Russia's actions, in particular its aggression against Ukraine and crimes within its framework committed by the Russian military. These statements are part of an information and psychological war aimed at discrediting Ukraine and creating a distorted reality for the Russian audience. In addition, in this way, the Russians dream of demoralizing the opponent. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/45-malchikov-v-trusikah-na-organy-vorog-vygaduye-zvirstva-na-kurshhyni/	2024-12-15T20:01:06-08:00
The memory of the fallen actor and military serviceman Volodymyr Kucherenko was commemorated in Kyiv	The actor, known by the nickname -Boris-, died on December 6, 2024 during a combat mission. His image in the play -Ch.S.-, which premiered in 2021, became a symbolic reflection of the strength and vulnerability of the male soul. At the commemorative evening, the actors of the theater read a monologue dedicated to Boris, based on real events. Director Olena Vahrameeva projected an excerpt from the play in which Volodymyr played back in 2020 onto the wall of the stage. -Yesterday, we experienced a loss, we felt that Vovchik was with us,- said Olena Vahrameeva. The event was attended by family, relatives, brothers and friends of Boris, as well as fans of the work of -TOTEATR-. Donations gathered during the evening were sent to purchase an FPV drone, which comrades from Volodymyr's unit will send to the front in his honor. The play, which premiered on May 17, 2021, explores the strength and vulnerability of a man in his various guises: father, warrior, son, lover. -TOTEATR- is an independent body-oriented theater founded in 2021. The theater uses the poetics of speech and the minimalism of expressiveness, creating a therapeutic effect for the audience and revealing stored emotions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/u-kyyevi-vshanuvaly-pamyat-poleglogo-aktora-ta-vijskovosluzhbovczya-volodymyra-kucherenka/	2024-12-15T09:21:54-08:00

Among the losses of the enemy are three -Nivas- and -loaves-, two quadricycles and other vehicles. Also, our pilots destroyed the Russian BREM by conducting a control strike. During a night hunt, an enemy BMP-3 was hit. -The route of the buggies with the infantry was adjusted, sending the enemy to hell. There are the occupiers on a truck.

Storming Kurakhovo: the occupiers use DRG, disguising them as civilians	informs OSUV -Khortytsia- on its official Telegram channel -Khortytsky Wind-. Since the beginning of the day, there have been 10 combat clashes in the Kurakhovo region. Russian troops, having a numerical advantage in personnel and equipment, attack with the support of artillery and aviation. The enemy concentrated its efforts on the southeastern outskirts of Kurakhovo, trying to seize the road junction, the block of high-rise buildings in the southern part of the city, as well as important administrative and industrial facilities in the central part. The occupiers use sabotage and intelligence groups that act under the guise of civilians. In response, the Defense Forces of Ukraine conduct counter-sabotage measures to prevent such actions. The command takes all the necessary decisions to stabilize the situation in this direction. -We express great gratitude to our soldiers, sergeants and officers, who are heroically holding back the onslaught of the Russian occupiers,- the message reads. Separately, it is indicated that Russia continues to conduct a hybrid war, including the dissemination of distorted information about the situation in Kurakhovo for informational pressure and destabilization. As reported by ArmyInform, infantrymen of the 2nd battalion of the 12th -Azov- brigade captured five invaders during a combat mission on Toretsky direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/shturm-kurahovogo-okupanty-vykorystovuyut-drg-maskuyuchy-yih-pid-czyvilnyh/	2024-12-15T10:54:24-08:00
-I quickly assess the situation and the action-, - the sanitary instructor of NSU under the pseudony...	The story of the defender published by the National Guard of Ukraine. The desire to help the military through medicine became a key factor in her decision. The first trip to the ATO zone took place in 2016 to Mariupol. Then, for the first time, she encountered the realities of war, which significantly changed her outlook on life. Since September 2022, -Krokha- has been working on the front lines, performing its duties in the face of a full-scale invasion. Her story is an example of resilience, dedication and desire to help others despite all the hardships that war brings. We remind you, in the state application -Army+-: transfers are now possible for soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/shvydko-oczinyuyu-sytuacziyu-ta-diyu-sanitarnyj-instruktor-ngu-na-psevdo-kroha/	2024-12-15T10:39:53-08:00

Currently, at the first stage, transfers within the National Guard are open for National Guard soldiers, but there is a task to add the possibility of transfers between units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the National Guard. More units of our border guards will be added to -Army+- in the near future. As of today, there are already 3,607 positive decisions regarding transfers for our soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The team from the Ministry of Internal Affairs actively worked together with the Ministry of Defense to achieve results for our National Guardsmen. -Thank you! A concrete positive for soldiers and an opportunity to give people greater motivation,- the President emphasized. We remind you, situation on the frontline remains difficult. Defense forces of Ukraine direct efforts to disruption of the offensive plans of the Russian aggressor and destroy its personnel and equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/prezydent-u-armiya-teper-mozhlyvi-perevedennya-dlya-voyiniv-naczionalnoyi-gvardiyi-ukrayiny/	2024-12-15T10:10:07-08:00
The occupiers at the TOT of Donetsk region are opening centers for the promotion of the language	This is reported by a> Center of national resistance. So far, such propaganda centers have appeared in occupied Donetsk, Khartsyzk, Novoazovsk and Mangush, however, local collaborators were instructed to organize such centers in every library of the occupied region. These centers create the impression of -normalization- of life in the occupied regions, while at the same time trying to change the consciousness of local residents by imposing a -Russian- identity on them. As part of such activities, Russian language courses, propaganda lectures and -cultural- events are organized, which aim to force the local population to abandon their roots and adopt a foreign, imperial identity. Thus, the Russian authorities are trying not only to change the political landscape, but also to carry out cultural assimilation aimed at destroying the national identity of Ukrainians. This is especially true for the younger generation. We remind you, almost 2,000 multi-apartment buildings located in the Luhansk region's TOT have not been serviced by utility companies for years.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/okupanty-na-tot-donechchyny-vidkryvayut-czentry-populyaryzacziyi-yazyka/	2024-12-15T09:41:53-08:00

Orderly and experienced scouts resisted the Azovians for several days. As a result, the commander of the group was eliminated, and his wards chose life and surrendered. In captivity, the Russians talked about their -achievements- in the war and the command's constant orders to shoot both prisoners of war and civilians.

Gauleiter Pushylin turned off communication during a -direct line- with residents of TOT of Donetsk ...	This was reported by the Center of National Resistance. Only, unlike a bunker terrorist, they have no one to filter out uncomfortable questions. That is why, during the -direct line- of the Gauleiter Denys Pushylin, during the fractious -direct line- of the Gauleiter, the connection was suddenly cut off after a question about fraud with funds for the reconstruction of the housing of civilians in Donetsk region destroyed by Russia, a scheme to squeeze property through the -nationalization- of real estate and the settlement of occupied Ukrainian cities by representatives from the most remote regions of the Russian Federation . In general, the list of problems with which the civilian population has to live in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine is endless. And this is despite the fact that the Kremlin is making huge infusions into the Ukrainian land it destroyed. After all, this is not surprising because the local puppets of Moscow shamelessly steal them. We remind you, almost 2,000 multi-apartment buildings located in the Luhansk region's TOT have not been serviced by utility companies for years.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/gaulyajter-pushylin-vymknuv-zvyazok-pid-chas-pryamoyi-liniyi-iz-meshkanczyamy-tot-donechchyny/	2024-12-15T08:14:49-08:00

Residents did not pay the so-called -rental fee-, utility workers, in their turn, got rid of difficulties in servicing high-rise buildings in need of regular repairs. Urgent reregistration of an apartment under Russian legislation in the so-called -LNR- is not a panacea against the arbitrariness of the local occupation authorities. In particular, in Siverskodonetsk. In the case of a long-term absence of the owner in the city, the re-issued and registered housing is again, but unofficially, recognized as ownerless. Russian handymen, including builders, along with their families who decided to move from remote regions of the Russian Federation are settled there.

The enemy threatens to cancel the registration of the place of residence in the absence of a passpor...	About this reports Center of National Resistance. The low pace of passporting is the main problem for the occupation administrations in the temporarily occupied territories. It is this process that destroys the myth of Russian propaganda regarding the support of the -liberators- population. Trying to destroy Ukrainians, both physically and legally, the Kremlin resorts to coercion, but this does not work either. Currently, the enemy threatens to cancel the registration of the place of residence in case of refusal of the passport of the Russian Federation, which is mandatory for living in a totalitarian state. We remind you that the Kremlin left Russians without an important medical preparation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/vorog-pogrozhuye-skasuvaty-reyestracziyu-misczya-prozhyvannya-u-razi-vidsutnosti-pasporta-rf/	2024-12-15T07:31:45-08:00

A hit to the ground was recorded on the territory of the sports complex in the Kyiv district of the city. A 48-year-old woman was injured and taken to the hospital. Previously, the Russian army hit Kharkiv with an Iskander-M ballistic missile.

the Kremlin left Russians without an important medical drug	This is reported by Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. It has not been available in pharmacies for a long time, and in hospitals you have to wait for weeks for procedures that require saline solution. Against the backdrop of rising production and logistics costs, lack of equipment due to Western sanctions, pharmaceutical companies are refusing to release this cheap product. They cannot afford to operate at a loss under these conditions. And this is just one example. At the same time, doctors in various regions of the Russian Federation complain of a critical shortage of important drugs, in particular of foreign production, and the assortment of pharmacies has decreased by at least 20% during the full-scale war against Ukraine. At the same time, propaganda assures that there should be no shortage, and the government, instead of solving the problem, is engaged in the search for extremes. Thus, the health of Russians was once again under threat due to the aggressive ambitions of the Kremlin dictator Vladimir Putin. We remind you, December 14 in Ulyanovsk, Russia, an explosion destroyed a railway track - the military logistics of the occupation army of the Russian Federation suffered another complication.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/kreml-zalyshyv-rosiyan-bez-vazhlyvogo-medpreparatu/	2024-12-15T06:23:25-08:00

The explosion took place in the railway district of Ulyanovsk, on the line near the Sviaga River, a few kilometers from the local locomotive depot and the Ulyanovsk Motor Plant. It will be recalled that on December 13, a fire disabled three locomotives in the city of Krasnodar, and on December 11, two main locomotives of the aggressor state burned down in Bryansk. -The process of weakening logistics facilities that Russia uses to wage a genocidal war against Ukraine continues. There will be a fair retribution for every war crime!-, the GUR reminds.

Russia seeks to save Rosneft	This is reported by the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. In December, the Russian state oil company -Rosneft- and the Indian private oil refiner -Reliance- concluded an energy agreement for the supply of oil for ten years with the possibility of extension. Deliveries are planned to begin in January 2025. According to the agreement, Russia will supply India with almost 500,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Prices will be reviewed annually. In fact, the new contract will determine prices for almost a third of Rosneft's exports and50% of its maritime exports. Most of the supplies will be Russian -urals-, which will be sold at a discount of $3. US per barrel to Dubai quotes. At the same time, the indicated agreement, which covers about 0.5% of global oil supply, was concluded without taking into account the fact that the EU is preparing the 15th package of sanctions against the Russian Federation, which raises questions about the realism of such a project. We remind you, UAE banks are massively refusing to serve Russian businesses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/rf-pragne-vryatuvaty-rosneft/	2024-12-15T05:27:16-08:00
The occupiers conducted educational trainings for collaborators	This is reported by the Center of National resistance Up to 50 traitors were driven west.

Banks of the UAE are massively refusing to serve Russian businesses	About this informs the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. This caused delays and refusals in Russia's cross-border payments. The change in UAE policy actually supports similar moves by the Chinese authorities. The reason for the complication of financial operations for Russian business in the UAE was the US sanctions against Russian banks. The threat of secondary sanctions forces the financial institutions of the People's Republic of China and the UAE to revise the schemes of interaction with Russia, complicating its foreign economic activities. In addition, banks in the UAE began to refuse en masse transactions related to the purchase of electronics, server equipment, IT services and industrial equipment. Additional pressure is created by Chinese financial institutions, which have also stepped up checks on payments coming from the UAE, India and the special administrative region of the PRC - Hong Kong. The purpose of such inspections is to identify possible connections with the Russian Federation. We remind you, previously, the enemy hit the Kyiv district of the city with a rocket. According to available information, one person was injured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/banky-oae-masovo-vidmovlyayut-v-obslugovuvanni-rosijskomu-biznesu/	2024-12-15T04:11:18-08:00

Our defenders repelled 52 enemy attacks of varying intensity in the Pokrovsky direction in the areas of Myrolyubivka, Promin, Lysivka, Dachenske, Novy Trud, Sukhy Yar, Zelene, Pischane, Petrivka, Shevchenko, Novotroitske, Ukrainka and Novoolenivka. At the same time, the enemy struck with attack and bomber aircraft in the areas of Stara Mykolaivka, Nova Poltavka, and Grodivka settlements. Last day in the Kurakhivka direction the defense forces repelled enemy attacks in the areas of the settlements Sontsivka, Stari Terny, Zorya, Kurakhove, Lysivka, Elizavetivka, Hannivka and Uspenivka, where the occupiers, with the support of aviation, tried 50 times break through the defense of our troops. The enemy also actively used aviation in the Vremivsk direction, during which our defenders repelled 37 attacks by the occupiers in the areas of Trudove, Vesely Gay, Kostiantynopolske, Roszdolne, Novy Komar, Velyka Novosilka, Storozheve, Makarivka settlements and Novoandriivka. In the Gulyaipil direction the enemy launched airstrikes with unguided missiles in the Gulyai Pol area. Mala Tokmachka, Novopavlivka and Robotyne were hit by 15 aerial guided bombs in the Orichiv direction. The enemy launched airstrikes with unguided missiles on the Mykolaivka region in the Dnieper direction. In addition, he carried out three assaults on the positions of our defenders. There was no success. In the Kursk direction last day, 57 skirmishes took place, in addition, the enemy carried out 15 airstrikes, dropping 23 guided bombs, and launched 380 artillery strikes on populated areas and the positions of our defenders. On the Volyn and Poliske directions, the operational situation has not changed significantly. No signs of the formation of enemy offensive groups were detected. We will remind, last day Ukrainian defenders neutralized 1280 Russian invaders. The enemy also lost 12 tanks, 32 armored fighting vehicles, 26 artillery systems, 3 anti-aircraft guns, 2 air defense vehicles, 127 operational-tactical UAVs, 2 cruise missiles, 181 vehicles and 4 units of special equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/zsu-zupynyly-majzhe-300-rosijskyh-atak-za-dobu-protyvnyk-aktyvizuvav-nastup/	2024-12-14T22:57:05-08:00
Facebook War: How to Counter a Hostile AI-Generated Fake Epidemic	Software algorithms are increasingly spreading them in recommendation feeds, and this -epidemic- is only gaining momentum. From AI-generated images, -Ukrainian soldiers- call for liking, commenting and sharing. Most of such publications, at first glance, have a rather patriotic appearance. Ukrainian flags, embroidery, posts with a call to action (react) or to the manifestation of emotions (sympathize). Among the comments, between -our little girl- and -may God protect you-, there are many comments that such publications are a tool of Russian information and psychological operations. So there are a lot of calls not to like and not to comment (!) on such posts. Especially those responsible -complain- about them to the Facebook administration, but such publications only increase. So, are we dealing with an informational influence on Ukrainians, what can such communication be aimed at - this is discussed in the research of the content of a number of Facebook pages (until December 4, 2024 - ed.). I did not have to search for the accounts of the authors of the researched publications for a long time. After viewing several similar posts, Facebook immediately offered 44 pages with similar images generated by artificial intelligence in the feed. In fact, there are many more of them. Perhaps with a slightly different information content, but all of them are designed for a certain target audience. Obviously, in this case, the algorithms focus on a middle-aged Ukrainian who is Orthodox by faith, has a family and a certain interest in military issues. After a quick analysis of the titles, images and information content of the pages, it was possible to divide them into four conventional groups: patriotic-entertaining, -real people-, Orthodox and nonsense. Page titles are another interesting phenomenon. They seem to be as simple as possible and -not for sale-. However, these communities have a significant audience. Even taking into account that the subscription is -winded up- and there are many bots and -inactive- profiles among the readers, there are quite a few very real people visible in the comments under the posts. So, the authors of these -patriotic and entertaining posts- still manage to reach the hearts and minds of Ukrainians. -Almighty Ukrain- has 223 thousand readers, -I love Ukraine- liked by 221 thousand and read 222 thousand FB profiles. -Congratulations-has a more modest audience with 49,000 likes and 66,000 readers. Music 1 Ukrainian, Ukrainian written in Russian, and actually Russian itself. A certain trend is also visible in posts with generated images such as -it's my birthday today, congratulations.- There are also publications on culture, music and cinema. As for the military, it is dominated by neutral AI images of soldiers standing, sitting, hugging, smiling or crying. Until November of this year, there were many images of soldiers with amputations, cemeteries with Ukrainian flags and women in uniform. Also, the authors are often nostalgic for the Soviet past and the old Russian variety show. For example, -Almighty Ukraine- distributes collages with Nina Matviyenko, and also distributes posts about the death of a Ukrainian composer in Belarus (to find out details, the author suggests following the link). Along with the post about Andrii Danylko (Verka Serdyuchka), there are posts about the Russian actress Alika Smekhova. There is also a patriotic post about our Ptashka (Kateryna Polishchuk). At the end of November and the beginning of December, publications on political topics began to appear on these pages, some of which were provocative in relation to the state leadership. In the names of the studied communities, the names and surnames (may also happen in the patronymic - ed.) of seemingly real people are used in some places. Hypothetically, anyone can be familiar with suchChernetska Victoria, followed by 11 thousand FB users,Oksana Kostenko, whose page has 20 thousand tags Likesand 24kreaders,orTetyana Bondar, whose audience is 9.3 thousand subscribers. True, there are actually not so many pages with people's names. In the list of 44 communities offered by Facebook, their unit. Interestingly, there were no -men- among them. Apparently, in social networks, male names inspire less trust and have few associations with emotional content. At the same time, the filling of such profiles is quite specific. These are mostly AI-generated images on the topic of the military, religion, relationships with grandparents and children. -Chernetska Victoria- has been active since October 20, 2022. Since then, 3-4 posts appear on this page every day with a noticeable bias on the topic of Orthodoxy. On December 8, 2022, the first post about the -Ukrainian soldier- appeared. Since then, many generated images of children, -soldiers of the Armed Forces- and prayers to God have been published on the page. Posts with military personnel depict the difficult conditions of service in winter — soldiers sleep in the snow or eat in the cold. There are also -artificial- photos of children with amputations, elderly people in -grandmother's house- with embroidered towels, ovens with bread, or images of a married couple at a wedding. For reasons that are not yet clear, posts with people in uniform on this page have noticeably decreased in November. Instead, there was an increase in embroidery, birthday cakes, children, prayers and generated photos of mushrooms in the forest. Oksana Kostenko is much less -religious-. Prefers content in the style of -5 brothers-, -5 babies-, -5 teenagers-, -5 girls- or -5 grannies- in his posts. There are, of course, posts where two or three people are depicted. All images are generated by AI, and the texts encourage users to say hello in the comments. The first illustration with -Ukrainian military- appeared on September 14, 2024. From time to time, -Oksana Kostenko- publishes photographs of cemeteries or generated images of people with amputations, which are intended to evoke pity. At the same time, the author asks to -congratulate- them on a certain occasion. On October 11, apocalyptic images appeared: military equipment, planes and houses - everything is engulfed in fire. Tetyana Bondar prefers simpler content. More photos of the military and military equipment, less prayers. The first publications appeared on March 25, 2023, and on September 5, 2024, the first post with a -Ukrainian warrior-. There are many more Orthodox-oriented pages than those described above, but their content is not particularly diverse. Group -God is with us- liked by 11 thousand users, another 79 thousand profiles --God Loves You-, in-Happy Birthday (Jesus Christ Our Lord)-'s audience is 60 thousand profiles and almost as many - 59 thousand have-JESUS ​​LOVES YOU -. The content is mostly similar: 9 out of 10 posts are prayers and messages from God. The rest of the posts feature happy people (women, children, farmers, a couple 50 years ago and now), flowers and weddings. Military figures are often found among such images, most of which are smiling and happy. Although there are also sad ones - with the consequences of injuries. There is also -apocalyptic- content - AI generated explosions, tanks and planes during the battle. -God is with us- began to actively publish -Ukrainian soldiers- from September 26, 2024. The -JESUS ​​LOVES YOU- community has streamed content with -Military Armed Forces- since November 21, 2024. The situation is similar with the content of the pages -God Loves You- and -Happy Birthday (Jesus Christ Our Lord)-. Probably the most mysterious and illogical group of pages under investigation has the general name -nonsense-. These profiles cannot be attributed to the three previous groups either by photo or by information content. Who is this Luis Canuto is unknown, but this page has 53 thousand readers. - Masano's Machine-has an audience of 17 thousand,Trisec - 22 thousand readers and 29,000 profiles on the pageRichard . Luis Canuto has been publishing -patriotic- posts with Ukrainian soldiers - boys and girls - since June 2, 2023. These are both individual portraits and group images of soldiers. There may be children, babies in your arms, or pets - cats and dogs. At first, real photos were used, but over time, AI-generated images began to dominate. Interestingly, during the -promotion- of the page, preference was given to pictures with girls in uniforms and captions in the style of -looking for a partner-. After November 9, 2024, the content changed, with fewer girls. Instead, there was more politics, and the posts concerned the commanders of the Azov unit, Petro Poroshenko, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, Vasyl Malyuk, and Dmytro Yarosh. There are also generated images of soldiers with amputations and posts with Orthodox prayers. The feature of this profile is publications with calls for peace with Russia. There is also video content with opposition political scientists, clips with various conspiracy theories, and negativity regarding mobilization events (against the TCC and the police). The main communication message: the Russians will never end, because there are more of them; the police and the TCC catch people illegally; Ukraine's economy is collapsing; the last thing is taken away from the people through unjust taxes. Trisec began its activity on June 1, 2023 with the publication of neutral landscapes of nature, and the first photo with -Ukrainian military- appeared on April 30, 2024. The content is mostly warm and family: father with children; soldier with grandfather; daughter and father in military uniform; grandmothers with a grandson in their arms; veterans with medals; wedding of a military couple; a soldier with a newborn baby; bread; embroidered shirts; harvesting; soldier's friendship. This list is supplemented by a small number of AI-generated images of soldiers with amputations, photos of cemeteries and -prayer-. Among others, this profile features a small number of Soviet-era photos of children's friendship in the USSR, images from Soviet cartoons, and cover pages of birth certificates. Recent posts include birthday wishes. Among the celebrants are a pilot, a soldier, and a 5-year-old girl. There are also posts with videos. These posts are downright negative. For example, the outrageous communication of citizens with the TCC and the police. On the Richard page, among the AI-generated images, there are also publications about real units of the Armed Forces. The content is mostly neutral - clips collected from the Internet about the activities of the Armed Forces and many videos of domestic topics with girls of Asian appearance. Which posts appeared on the investigated pages for the first time and what is their communication direction? -Congratulations on the birthday (Jesus Christ Our Lord)- was created on April 5, 2022, the capital letter P on a colored background was published . -I love Ukraine- was created on May 26, 2022, capital letter Я was published on a colored background. Richard was created as Gedine on 17 June 2022, renamed to Meghan Markle History on 9 December 2023. Rihcart renamed on 19 Aug 2024, first published on 17 June 2022, this is a capital letter V on a colored background. JESUS ​​LOVES YOU - 16 Aug 2022, first published as a neutral illustration. -Chernetska Victoria- became just that August 22, 2024, and before that it was called -God is with us-, page created on October 20, 2022, published capital letter G on a colored background. Luis Canuto created on January 14, 2023, published capital letter L on a colored background background. -God Loves You- was created February 3, 2023, capital letter B on a colored background was published. -Tetyana Bondar- was created on March 25, 2023, capital letter H was published on a colored background. -Almighty Ukraine- was created on April 1 2023, capital letter B on colored background published. Music1 created March 30, 2023, the first post was a neutral image. Vitannyachko was created on April 8, 2023, the first post was a neutral image. Risec created on June 1, 2023, a capital letter T was published on a colored tli. -God is with us- was created on July 13 2023, a capital letter B on a colored background was published. Oksana Kostenko was created on August 22, 2024, a capital letter O was published on a colored background. The texts of the publications of all investigated pages have one common feature. To summarize, it is an -artificial- language. Obviously, online translators were used for this, which immediately catches the eye. On almost all pages, the first posts were made in Russian, and already today Ukrainian language dominates with signs of machine translation. Russian words and sentences sometimes appear in the texts. In -Oksana Kostenko-, in addition to Ukrainian and Russian, there are posts in English. A notable feature is also the fact that photos and text of publications may be repeated on different pages in different periods. It looks like a certain circulation of content. In their posts, the authors of the publications often encourage users to join the conversation in the messenger chats. Each page may have its own chat, but these calls are very similar. As a rule, these are dramatic illustrations with battle mutilations, apocalyptic images, as well as active text injection, followed by an offer to learn more. For example: why the war will not end or how to save your life. To find out, you need to join the chat. Posts are obviously written in a foreign language, and not necessarily in Russian, and then translated into Ukrainian through online translators or AI-chat. Considering the number of followers on each page, the vast majority of posts are unpopular. An average post collects 100-200 reactions, but there are also posts without a single like per day. Therefore, it can be assumed that the active audience is extremely small. For example, Luis Canuto publishes several posts every day, most of which have between 0 and 100 likes and comments. However, the recent publication -True friendship of Ukrainian soldiers- with an artificially generated image received 6 thousand reactions. Another post with an AI picture -This Ukrainian military man finally got married- has 2.3 thousand reactions and 166 comments. Obviously, such publications are popularized artificially by paying for advertising on Facebook. Among the investigated pages, -Almighty Ukraine- stands out. Individual posts in this community have garnered more than 10,000 reactions and hundreds of appreciative comments for Ukrainian soldiers from profiles that look like the pages of real people. Facebook provides the ability to check information about the main countries/regions of residence of the people who manage the pages. What is the geography of the administrators of groups that so actively get into the recommendation tape of Ukrainians. -Almighty Ukraine-: Armenia - 2 administrators; -I love Ukraine-: Armenia - 4 administrators; -Welcome-: Austria - 10 administrators; Italy - 2; Spain - 4; Music 1: Indonesia - 10; -Chernetska Victoria-: Spain - 10; Italy - 2; Indonesia is 1; Netherlands - 1; -Tetiana Tetiana Bondar-: Spain - 5; Czech Republic - 2; -Oksana Kostenko-: France - 9; Germany - 4; Spain - 3; Greece - 1; Hungary - 1; Italy - 1; -God Loves You-: Spain— 11; Netherlands - 5; Portugal - 3; Serbia - 1; -Happy Birthday (Jesus Christ Our Lord)-: Spain — 13; Netherlands - 1; JESUS ​​LOVES YOU: Spain - 12; Germany - 1; Greece - 1; Italy - 1; Ukraine - 1; Luis Canuto: Indonesia - 3; Trisec: Indonesia - 14; Richard: (listed address London street, London, United Kingdom, +44 7167 856765), Indonesia - 5; -Masano Machine-: Indonesia - 4. Military expert Petro Chernyk reflects on what goals are pursued by the activities of such groups, what Such content is dangerous and as evidenced by the geography of the administrators of these pages. -Unfortunately, we still have a rather large number of Ukrainian citizens who look at this war on the principle of- brother -in -law -. The overall numerical potential of such citizens is within 7-8 percent, which is a fairly fertile field for a potential -masked- Russophile political project. Social networks and the ROC religious sect are platforms for the potential promotion of the political project in the interests of Russia. The analysis of the presidents of the administrators mentioned by Facebook indicates that these are the countries where it has (small) branch and influence of Russia today. It is not necessary to mislead that, in a number of European countries, the mentioned resource is prohibited. The enemy has long entered their networks not only at the official level, but also through the giant network of various humanitarian organizations, etc. -. Petro Chernyk confirmed the conclusions made by the results of the general analysis of these pages. In fact, these communities only seem patriotic, and their true goal is to climb into the heads of Ukrainians and focus their attention on the topics required by the enemy to destroy the unity of Ukrainian society. Obviously, despite the geographical diversity of administrators, these pages are interconnected and have a common purpose. Who or what can unite administrators with Indonesia, Armenia, Spain or Denmark? It seems that the geographical center, like the decision -making center, is located in Russia. In favor of this version, certain trends are evidenced in the history of the communities under study. For example, the time of creation and activation of activity during the active phase of the Russian war against Ukraine. It is also noticeable to the synchronicity of publications for a certain communication purpose, similar to the design of profiles and the identity of content - both text and images from video. Together, all these signs indicate that Russia in the Ukrainian segment of social networks conducts a broad information operation of low intensity with a single coordination and a common plan. For example, warriors with amputations, cemeteries, poor conditions are psychologically associated with the futility of the struggle. Religious content and prayers subconsciously adjust to humility - the task of a person to pray, and God - a more visible winner in the war. Which fits into the general concept of hybrid war against Ukraine, when, in addition to measures of active influence, hostilities, information is used against Ukrainians. In the short term, the purpose of such an operation may be: poor quality of publications - both text and photo - designed for the basic level of society, as well as for sympathizers on religious, political or other characteristics. It is an effort to marginalize certain layers of society. These are -ideological sabotages-, and on social networks they were moved from real life. Such a technique was used in the USSR, and described it by the KGB agent under the cover of Yuri Bezmanov, who at one time worked in Delhi. The point is that ordinary people who are sorry for the -wounded- or want to -congratulate the warrior's birthday- are used as -useful idiots-. The ultimate goal is to influence people's views and, in the end, change them to the right ones. And if there were decades to achieve the goals earlier, then in the social networking era you can do it much faster. The activities of the communities under study are primarily aimed at deepening despair and contradiction among Ukrainians. And here on the hand of the enemy is played by both those who put liked in such groups, and those who call for it not to do it, because in this way there is already a split between them. Old good tactics -Do not feed the troll-: - skip the following recommendations to make them less in the news feed; - to put and comment on the posts of only those people who know personally, or confident in the reality of their existence; - Before reacting to the publication, event, or comment, ask yourself: to whom and in what benefit will my emotion and action be? - It is necessary to find a common language with those who have already hit the hook of the Russian IPSO and to be tolerant of communication, trying to explain that they unconsciously help the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/vijna-u-facebook-yak-protydiyaty-vorozhij-fejkoepidemiyi-zgenerovanij-shtuchnym-intelektom/	2024-12-14T22:08:25-08:00
Making troops invisible: France promotes new camouflage -nanofabric-	How declared experts of the defense portal Army Recognition, developed by the enterpriseKastinger and commercialized by PGM Précision HT4® technology, often referred to as -heat with an invisibility cloak,- opens up new opportunities for the armed forces, ArmiyaInform notes. The material produced by HT4® technology was approved by the French Defense Innovation Agency and selected by the Directorate General of Armaments (DGA). This development, also known as Poncho Infrarouge pour Kits de Survie (PIKS) (Infrared Poncho for Survival Kits, in Ukrainian), provides omnidirectional and adaptive thermal protection, effectively concealing even intense heat sources up to 1000°C, such as helicopter turbine. This technology works by absorbing and reflecting NIR, SWIR, MWIR, LWIR and FIR infrared radiation. Designed to protect personnel and equipment, the HT4® counters a wide range of anti-thermal threats, from monocular thermal devices to sensors mounted on drones and fighter jets. HT4® stands out for its flexibility and adaptability. Whether used in extreme climates or diverse environments, this innovative material can regulate temperature to provide near-total thermal invisibility. Its ability to hide not only soldiers, but also to cover large equipment such as vehicles and aircraft, making them invisible to thermal cameras even after landing, is an important asset for extreme military operations. HT4®'s signature anti infrared fabric is made in camouflage (tarp/poncho, etc.). This makes it possible to use its daytime masking effect on the one hand, and its absorption of thermal radiation on the other, guaranteeing maximum efficiency. Because of this, the following camo colors are available: Brown/Green, Desert, City/Rock, Snow. Its products are resistant to extreme temperatures: thanks to its excellent temperature regime, this fabric keeps you warm in cold periods and cool in hot weather. Thus, it provides excellent thermal protection for personnel working in extreme environmental conditions. This fabric is light, breathable and durable. The properties of this material allow you to equip personnel without causing discomfort, it has excellent resistance to abrasion. Products made of HT4® fabric are compact, which facilitates their transportation. The HT4® fabric has been tested by the DGA (French Directorate General of Armaments), which concluded that it provides -a real gain in reducing the infrared signature of the elements being defended-. In coordination with the DGA-CF2S campaign, the French Air Force Command also authorized the use of camouflage in flight crew survival kits. Numerous tests of various military devices using such camouflage have been conducted using a wide range of air-to-ground and ground-to-surface sensors (JIM LR2, Pod Rafale, C3ISTAR, Sophie Ultima, FLIR, Reaper, etc. ). PGM Précision emphasized the value of working with the DGA in implementing this technology, acknowledging the agency's expertise and support throughout the HT4® development process. This official recognition highlights HT4®'s potential to transform military camouflage, allowing armed forces to conduct operations more stealthily, even in areas controlled by advanced detection systems. The success of the HT4® also reflects the growing interest in advanced thermal camouflage solutions in the defense industry. While some countries are focusing on developing new detection technologies, others, such as France with HT4®, are promoting innovations that challenge these surveillance systems. This technology is compatible with a new generation of thermal camouflage that meets the challenges posed by state-of-the-art detection sensors. The future of military camouflage appears to be moving towards active camouflage solutions, the use of adaptive materials, nanotechnology and biomimicry to make the armed forces invisible even to AI-controlled devices. HT4®'s impact is likely to extend beyond military applications; this innovation can also inspire development in fields such as wildlife conservation and urban planning, where concealment or visual integration can be crucial. HT4® marks a significant step in this continuous evolution. With its ability to provide effective thermal invisibility in extreme environments, this innovation may well redefine stealth on the modern battlefield, prompting military forces to adopt new cloaking strategies to stay ahead of the technological race. How other countries and industries will respond to this advancement remains to be seen, but it is clear that HT4® is a turning point in the history of camouflage technology. Presentation of material produced by HT4® technology.

The enemy is dispersing fakes about -Ukrainian traces- in Syria and Georgia	At first, information began to spread in pro-Russian telegram channels that the fighters of the -Georgian Legion- due to the protests that broke out in Tbilisi were -abandoning Ukraine- and returning home to join the rallies. The press service of the legion categorically denied these accusations, calling them baseless. Also, the other day, the news spread in the Russian information space that in Ukraine, according to an announcement on the Work.ua platform, they are allegedly looking for -tough guys to participate in the protests in Georgia.- At the same time, activists are promised payment of UAH 2,000 per day, accommodation and food, as well as free border crossing. The foreign passport of a Ukrainian, which was allegedly found in Tbilisi on Rustaveli Avenue, is cited as -evidence-. By reverse image search of the Gwara project fact checker found ads about this lost passport from December 29, 2020. In fact, they lost it in the city of Uzhhorod at the bus station. The -Activist- vacancy in question was, of course, never posted on the Work.ua platform. This screenshot is fake. The head of the Work.ua moderation department notes that such fakes are usually created by editing the page code in the browser. This approach is technically simple, but it misleads users by creating the illusion of publication on the site. Propagandists also continue to reproduce myths about the -Ukrainian footprint- in Syria, in particular statements about the cooperation of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine with groups such as -Hayat Tahrir al-Sham-, adding them to their speeches in international organizations. Rospropaganda creates such fakes to discredit Ukrainians and Ukrainian authorities in the eyes of the international community. They are baseless and not supported by any evidence. Their goal is to divert attention from the actions of Russia and its war crimes. The strategy of discrediting Ukraine is also aimed at legitimizing Russian aggression, portraying it as an alleged fight against global terrorism. But this strategy exposes the contradictions in Russian propaganda, which falls into its own traps and is quite often unable to explain its many fabrications.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/vorog-rozganyaye-fejky-pro-ukrayinskyj-slid-u-syriyi-ta-gruziyi/	2024-12-14T20:45:59-08:00
The voice of the information war: about the enemy's Achilles heel, love through strength and the fai...	Correspondent ArmiyaInform asked Professor Pocheptsov at what stage Ukraine is now in the context of conducting an information war with the Russian Federation; what are the enemy's strengths and weaknesses in this context; whether the voice of our state sounds loud enough during a duel with the enemy in virtual space, and not only that. —In your opinion, has the methodology of conducting information warfare by the Russians changed in 10 years, since 2014? How? — The approach has become more differentiated for different audiences. In 2014, everything was more unified. Russia is actively entering the mass consciousness around the world with the help of fake sites that are perceived as its own. Because of this, she has a louder -voice- than we do. Although it is hidden in other people's performances&#8230; In general, propaganda is closer to art than to science. This is a kind of political poetry, not just a newspaper article. We are oriented more towards the Soviet variant of propaganda, when everyone is silent and listens to one voice. This will no longer be the case: instead of a monologue, propaganda becomes a dialogue. That's how the audience should feel about her. —In your book -Modern Information Wars- you introduced the concept of semantic warfare. As of December 2024, according to your observations, who is leading in the semantic war: Ukraine or the Russian Federation? Argue. - Everyone is fighting for their own audience, for those who can become their favorite. Everyone wins in their own audience. We cannot win in the minds of the Russian audience because we cannot be heard. We should work more actively with Russians who emigrated, because their voices and faces are familiar to the Russian audience. The audience always wants to hear something of their own, close to their ideas. And this is exactly the kind of channel we need. —The Russo-Ukrainian war seems to be an example of virtual reality giving rise to physical war. What do you think are the ways to end this war? What is the role of quality communication in establishing a just peace? - Unfortunately, the peace will not be very just, because everyone has different goals. Russia generally says that they included our territories in their constitution. And this is absurd, because in this way they can introduce, for example, Belgium, and then say: -It is in our constitution, what can we do.- —Which cases of strategic communication on the part of Ukraine during the large-scale invasion would you call a successful example in the conduct of information and semantic warfare? And what has our state failed in terms of communication? And what can we fix? - Ukraine has done the most important thing - the world's leading media, as well as countries, are on our side. Russia wants to bring love closer to itself by force, and this is a failed strategy. As a result, Russia simply took the old place of the USSR as an eternal enemy. - And what are the strengths and weaknesses of the enemy in this sense? - They know us well, this allows us to place the necessary emphasis everywhere. And the downside is that they are less aware of how we have changed since the beginning of the war. The downside of Russia is the large number of opposition websites abroad, as well as the huge number of politicians, writers, and cultural figures who emigrated. These are all familiar names and faces&#8230; And they are against it. Not because of our propaganda, but because of Russia's actions. Today we are very far from them, but we should -sing- together. We must talk to them based on their arguments. This is a big space that Russia simply cannot censor . And it will grow louder as the war wears on. - At one time you stated that -war is a reality check of the state.- In the third year of the large-scale — has, in your opinion, our state passed this test? — the war passed the test, but the creation of propaganda both for its own audience and for foreign ones did not pass. We have a very weak -voice-. Propagandists during this time were to become the most recognizable figures to the audience. It is difficult to believe in an abstract state voice, people believe in concrete figures. - According to you, the three pain points targeted by communications during wartime are your own population, enemy population, and neutrals. In your opinion, is Ukraine -working through- all these three pain points? As? And what can be improved? - The West does the work for us, talking to its own population and neutrals. And we have not yet learned to talk in such a way that people drop everything and go to the TV to listen to a specific person. Levitan only read other people's texts, and felt like a propagandist, because during the war there is always a lack of information. - To quote you: -Information warfare is a flute tune, propaganda is a brass band that is heard even when one does not want to.- In your opinion, how audible is the flute from Ukraine now? How good is this sound? - Our -flute- is weak. She has a vague idea of ​​what to emphasize. Relatively speaking: what is needed is not just the truth, but an accurate truth that cannot be stopped&#8230; —What advice would you give to Ukrainian civilians to strengthen their emotional resilience at this time? Any advice for every day, -how to preserve clarity of thinking and freedom of action- in the time of flooding with disinformation and hostile IPSO? - We must educate our own agitators and propagandists, whose speeches the population would expect every night. The population wants to hear honest words that at the same time carry positivity. And specific faces that are trusted. - You say that -human history is built on the history of dreams- and that -man lives in dreams-, even though it is about visual space. How would you advise Ukrainians to visualize their dreams, being in a country in a state of war, so that later there would be no disappointments, no pain? - It will definitely hurt, because a compromise is not a victory. Or is a temporary victory. But there is no other option. If we are in a war, we must win.

Good weather to die - Russians prefer to die in the sunlight	About this on the ArmyTV stream the officer of the public relations service of the 37th marine brigade, junior lieutenant Denys, told Bobkov. -The last few days, when the weather was bad, the number of enemy runs decreased. It's raining, wheeled machinery can hardly be used, heavy machinery as well. But as soon as the swamp froze, the number of assaults immediately increased from 2-3 to 7-8,- said Denys Bobkov. According to him, Russian assault groups always go with EW devices in shoulder bags. Drones are also actively used. -Enemy assault groups don't move just like that, they are always accompanied by FPV drones and drones with resets,- said Denis Bobkov. When using armored vehicles, a Russian tank is always at the head of the column, followed by an infantry fighting vehicle, and then less armored vehicles, such as BRDM or armored personnel carriers. There can be from 3 to 7 cars in a convoy. -The infantry is well equipped, it's not mobs. They know what they are doing, they are trained. The enemy is prepared,- said Denys Bobkov.

Good news from Kurshchyna - the people of Kimcheniv shot the people of Kadyrov	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on December 14. The aggressor state of Russia began to use North Korean soldiers in assault operations in the Kursk region, in particular, as part of combined units of the marines and airborne troops of the Soviet Union. The North Korean troops have already suffered the first sanitary and irreversible losses as a result of successful fire damage inflicted by soldiers of the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine. In particular, at one of the positions in the Kursk region, military personnel of the North Korean army were effectively -covered- with FPV drones. Estimated losses of units staffed by Russian and North Korean personnel as of December 14, 2024 amount to about 200 servicemen. In the process of using North Korean troops on the battlefield, the language barrier remains a difficult obstacle for management and coordination of actions. Due to this problem, North Korean soldiers opened -friendly fire- on the vehicles of the so-called -Ahmat- battalion. The result was eight killed -Kadyrivs-. We will remind you that there are about 11,000 servicemen of the North Korean army on the territory of Russia. In the places where they are stationed, the aggressor introduced a special counter-intelligence regime - for admission to areas where North Korean units are located, Russian soldiers and officers are checked by FSB officers, phones and other devices are seized. As reported by ArmyInform, President Volodymyr Zelensky declared that there are already preliminary data on the use of a significant number of soldiers from North Korea by the Russians in the assaults.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/blagi-zvistky-z-kurshhyny-kymcheninivczi-perestrilyaly-kadyrovcziv/	2024-12-14T10:15:39-08:00
- Major renovation - occupants: four houses in a year and dreams of water	This was reported by Artem Lysogor, head of the Luhansk OVA. For comparison, much more work was done in the rear settlements, not covered by hostilities, which underlines the negligent attitude of the occupiers to the frontline territories. The situation is even worse in neighboring Pryville. There is not even an attempt to restore basic communications. Electricity and centralized water supply have been missing for more than two and a half years. Local residents are forced to buy technical water, which is delivered from time to time. The price is one ruble per liter, which is unaffordable for many. According to Lysohor, the actions of the occupation administration confirm their complete inability to provide even the minimum conditions for life in the occupied territories. As reported by ArmyInform, in 77% of the settlements of the so-called LNR, namely in 714 out of 920, it is impossible to purchase medicine. Local residents have to travel dozens of kilometers to get essential medical supplies.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/velykyj-remont-okupantiv-chotyry-budynky-za-rik-i-mriyi-pro-vodu/	2024-12-14T10:01:05-08:00
He went to the front as a schoolboy, his mother did not know - the story of the youngest soldier of ...	The post about the fighter appeared on December 14 on the brigade channel. Mother did not know that Nikita went to war, and father went missing at the front. -If I was making good money and paying a lot of taxes, maybe I wouldn't have made such a decision. But at the moment I have nothing to give to the state except myself. My mother and my younger sister went abroad at the beginning of the war. When I joined the army, I just didn't say anything to her so she wouldn't worry. She thought I was in Mykolaiv until my brother told me,- says Nikita. His father was a volunteer, fighting since 2014. -In the summer, when I passed the BZVP, he went missing in the Pokrovsky direction. I don't want to entertain myself with vain hope. Therefore, he resigned himself to the thought that he would not return. And I had a desire to kill enemies,- shared Nikita. He is now a Mavik pilot. -I like everything here. Sometimes something flies in, but so far it's more fun than scary. In such stressful situations, on the contrary, I gather, I become more cheerful and confident,- said Nikita.

They send tanks at the head of the column and BMP with the landing party behind. Small groups consist of 1-3 people trying to approach our positions,- the officer noted. He also noted that Russians are rarely captured, mostly as a result of an unsuccessful assault or disorientation in the area, when they cannot find a way out. -Enemy activity has been recorded in Terna, Yampolivka, Dibrova areas, where due to adverse weather conditions - strong wind and snow - we are forced to use drones less,- Jackson added.

The Russians threw the North Koreans into attacks in Kurshchyna — the President	The President stated this in his address on December 14. -The Russians include them in combined units and use them in operations in the districts of the Kursk region. So far only there. But we have information that it can be used in other areas of the front as well. Losses among this category are already noticeable,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. He stated that, in fact, Moscow involved another state in this war, and involved it as much as possible. -And if this is not an escalation, then what is the escalation that many have been talking about? It is Putin who is taking steps that expand and continue this war. It is he who repels the possibility of peace. And he wants the world to have more problems in Asia as well. This is why the Russians are training North Korea in modern warfare,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. In his opinion, Moscow ignores the calls of all countries, from China and Brazil to many others, regarding the need to do everything for de-escalation. -If there is no strong reaction from the world, Russia is making the war worse. Always so. We will defend ourselves, including against these North Koreans. We will continue to act in coordination with all our partners to stop this war — to stop it reliably, with guaranteed peace,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He said that next week he will speak in Europe about joint work. -Sanctions against Russia, support for our defense, investments in Europe's common defense and strong diplomacy for the sake of peace - these are things that should be increased every week, so that next year, together with our partners, we will be able to achieve our main goal,- the President noted.

She was lucky - shards of glass got stuck in the door. However, it is urgent to fix the houses - windows and broken roofs - because it is cold outside and it may rain soon. A man from a parallel street shows the site of a hit by a combat element in a garden near the house and sadly jokes that a few potatoes missed during autumn harvest were found in the ditch.

Before the battle - only after the psychostrip: how to additionally prepare for the front line in -o...	Correspondents of ArmiyaInform saw with their own eyes how the instructors of the 115th separate mechanized brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine set up and pass a psychological test to assess its complexity before starting training with newly arrived fighters. The psycho lane is designed to prepare servicemen for actions in units on the front line. First of all, it is intended for those who come to the brigade from training centers after basic general military training. It enables newly arrived fighters to psychologically and physically enter the conditions of combat operations. -Psychosmuga adapts fighters to entering the area of ​​hostilities so that they do not experience shock, there is no difference in adaptation, so that they are ready for what happens directly on the battlefield,- explains Chief Sergeant Serhiy Korolev with the call sign -Funtik-. . Every fighter in the brigade has to pass the psycho lane. After BZVP in training centers, they have about a week to adapt, after which they go on combat missions. Then, with individual elements of the psycho lane, fighters also work during internal rotation within the brigade. — Here there are elements of tactics, elements of power loads, basic elements of combat operations. Next is directly the simulation of combat operations with the execution of shooting exercises. All this makes it possible to adapt the fighters to combat, so that newly arrived fighters do not feel the shock of entering combat directly, the instructor says about the psycho zone. Psychological adaptation is necessary first of all for newly arrived fighters, because those who come to the rotation have already been on the front lines. Therefore, they work primarily on improving tactics, taking into account the change in the situation on the front lines. - During the rotation, those who go out not only rest and put their weapons and clothes in order. They also go to the tactical field to practice some tactical elements of movement and combat work, taking into account the current situation on the front line, emphasizes the master sergeant. In order to accept the newly installed psycho lane and now demonstrate how its passage along its entire length, which is about half a kilometer, takes place, the instructors use the entire training arsenal for newcomers - explosions, smoke, overcoming absolutely all available obstacles, practicing assault actions in the trenches and shooting at three guns borders The start of the psycho lane is a steep rocky slope that the runner must overcome with the constant danger of landslides and rocks. To maintain balance, not to lose breath, not to lose speed - all this is not easy even for companions without weapons and BC. Fighters have to do it in full gear - and this is just the beginning. In the next stage, the soldiers are met with loud explosions, thick smoke and difficult obstacles to overcome. To overcome them, one should be physically hardy and psychologically prepared, able to control one's body and emotions, always be ready for unexpected changes and to perform difficult tasks in conditions of smoke, increased noise, and breathing problems. In the first few sections of the psycho lane, the fighters pass the so-called -crossroads- - automobile ramps laid out in two adjacent lanes. You should go through them with the maximum possible speed, jumping from one tire to another. To an outside observer, the task may seem quite simple and even somewhat amusing, but in reality it is quite tiring and at the same time important. Thanks to it, the fighter learns to subconsciously and automatically control the position of his body, to feel in advance where and how the leg will land, and how to compensate for the tilt with the movement of the whole body. - This allows a person to concentrate as much as possible on the conditions of movement, in the conditions of an uneven surface - stones, pits, whirlpools from explosions. When you need to move to your positions or go on the offensive, the ground will not be flat, it constantly has some potholes, some slopes, - explains the meaning of the -Funtik- exercise. Then the complexity of obstacles and tasks only increases. Barbed wire, a wobbly bridge over a stream, a forest clearing, a maze, overcoming a wall - all this is quickly overcome in thick smoke and amid explosions that ring out from both sides of the psycho lane. We barely have time to follow the instructors and manage to get a good shot of the training amid the smoke. Climbing the steep slope, we can only imagine how difficult it is for two fighters to lift an almost 30-kilogram box with ammunition. And in combat conditions, notes the senior sergeant, a situation may arise when BC will have to be delivered alone, so working in pairs is an even easier option. - This is the main element of the load, after which the fighter will experience discomfort and shock in breathing. Therefore, you should learn to breathe properly and move properly in such a way as to avoid injury, explains the chief sergeant and adds that simply climbing the BC up the slope is still far from the most difficult of the possible options. Finally, after passing through a maze, jumping over a wall, another rubble and logs on rivchakami, the fighters go to storm the trenches and dugouts. After a difficult race and overcoming obstacles, this difficult task becomes even more difficult, this is the only way to get as close as possible to real combat conditions. - This is already an element of the combat situation - enemy positions, trenches, dugouts. It already includes working out the tactics of assault actions - how to enter positions, how fighters cut corners when passing enemy trenches, how to enter dark dugouts. In a combat situation, all turns, all elements behind which the enemy can hide, are controlled, the instructor comments. It is this element of the psycho lane that is important for practice not only for beginners, but also for those who have already managed to get used to explosions, smoke and a space cluttered with rubble and debris while in combat positions. At the end of overcoming the psycho lane, we enter the firing lines. There are three of them, and on each of them we can see how exhausting the previous exercises were and how much they affected the shooting accuracy of the fighters. The first firing line is designed to practice moving around the battlefield using cover and shooting from awkward positions. In this exercise, there is also an element of tactics of moving in pairs in difficult terrain among the ruins and rubble of buildings. The next firing range is the trenches, from which the fighters practice firing at aerial targets. These can be -maviks- or FPV drones, bomber drones with drops or kamikaze drones. - The final score is shooting from three positions: standing, kneeling and prone. This happens after great physical and psychological stress, after a shock state of the body. It shows the real accuracy of a fighter's shooting in difficult combat conditions, Serhii Korolev explains. Shooting accuracy, he emphasizes, is the key to survival on the battlefield. If a soldier is aimed at an enemy, it destroys him and secures himself. On the other hand, in the case of low accuracy, the enemy's chances of hitting a Ukrainian fighter increase significantly. — When a serviceman sees that after loads he has a deterioration in shooting accuracy compared to performing the same exercises in a calm state, he understands that he needs to work to have a high level of survival in combat conditions. That is, there is both an element of preparation and an element of motivation here, emphasizes the chief sergeant. The accuracy of the instructors, despite the previous loads, is high, and they are generally satisfied with the psycho lane - for a soldier after passing the BZVP, it will be difficult, but surmountable. Passing such a psycho lane, the fighter will be able to feel himself in conditions as close as possible to combat and not only check, but also significantly improve his level of training.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/do-boyu-tilky-pislya-psyhosmugy-yak-dodatkovo-gotuyut-do-peredovoyi-v-suhoputczi-reportazh/	2024-12-13T21:19:30-08:00
Videos and deepfakes with alleged Ukrainian military appear on the network: why is this the enemy	-Military- first allegedly walked along the side of the highway for almost 500 kilometers in the direction of Lviv (which is physically almost impossible without rest, food and sleep), then for four hours he tried to stop his companion, but no one stopped him, until he -picked up - this civilian male driver. Actually, this video is a production. The dialogue between the civilian male driver and the alleged military man is filmed by a person sitting in the back seat of the car, to whom the -military man- for some reason does not pay any attention, even when the video is filmed from a very close angle. In turn, the driver reacts suspiciously calmly to the words of the -military man- about the alleged lack of money, at least for the bus; two years of captivity; about the fact that the -military- community during this time had already managed to -bury- him, erecting a monument to him, etc. In addition, the -military man- says that he has been fighting since 2013, although the Russian-Ukrainian war began only in 2014. In another video, which the enemy is spreading on social networks, a Ukrainian military man allegedly complains about arbitrariness employees of the TCC, the difficult situation at the front, the unprofessionalism of commanders, losses among personnel and calls on Ukrainian men not to go to war. However, in reality this the video was created with the help of artificial intelligence, report in the VoxCheck project. The original source of the video is an anonymous profile on Tiktok, where the author publishes videos with allegedly Ukrainian military personnel and prisoners of war. A check by the Hive Moderation AI tool revealed that the profile contained videos that were generated using a neural network. Accordingly, the tool showed that the appeal of a serviceman talking about the difficult situation at the front was also created with the help of AI. The purpose of such videos is to increase the gap between the military and civilians, as well as to misinform the Ukrainian society about the real situation on the front and disrupt mobilization. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/u-merezhi-zyavlyayutsya-video-ta-dipfejky-z-nibyto-ukrayinskymy-vijskovymy-nashho-cze-vorogu/	2024-12-13T20:42:28-08:00
A captured Mamley, enemy BK porters and 70 Muscovites in two hours: Sergeant - Horn - told about ene...	What are the biggest losses for the day for the Russians? But what is the scariest thing on the front now? The military man told our correspondents about this: -My best man and I were from the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the DFTG. And in 2023, they joined the ranks of the Armed Forces together. When I started serving in the brigade, I was initially appointed to the position of unit commander. And then the brigade sergeant major came, talked to our officers, and I was appointed deputy platoon leader. Since September 2023, I have already been in the combat zone in Donetsk region. Performed tasks at the KSP of the company as a chief sergeant. Our -birds- flew, watched, and I, accordingly, corrected the actions of our servicemen on the radio. My duties also included getting people in and out of positions. The enemy fired at us every day, assault groups attacked our positions every day. They could send one of their attack aircraft at us, they could send two, and they could send ten at once. We saw -birds- starting to climb. And our boys at the positions were already warned by radio station that traffic is coming at you from a certain direction, be ready. We fought back with the help of small arms, grenade launchers, mortars. It happens that at first their artillery -pours- on us, and then the infantry climbs up on us. And it just happens that they storm without artillery. Sometimes it even happened that our chances broke through. And our guys were already there then throwing grenades at them. As a rule, enemy soldiers are told that there is no one in our positions. They come, and there's -hello, we're here.- Their losses are huge. Somehow it happened that in a couple of hours we put about 70 occupants to death. It is a combination of wounded and killed. But their severely wounded do not return. And they are not evacuated, unless some officer. And if it is a lightly wounded person, then he must return himself. Sometimes they even come to us to surrender themselves as prisoners. Because there they can be shot by their own people. And these prisoners have one song: I didn't shoot, I was told to go forward, I was caught on the street, mobilized. Once we took the officer prisoner. Junior lieutenant. And then, thanks to him, we got access to their streams, with maps. This helped us a lot in planning later because we could see where their drones were flying. If we saw on their streams that an enemy -bird- was hanging over some place, then we did not go there. Well, now already in 2024, we observe this at the positions: if some experienced enemy stormtrooper is coming, then he is in body armor, a helmet, with a machine gun, and two porters are behind him, carrying BC in backpacks. And these porters are unarmed. &#8230;Our new recruits, who are just entering the position, need to be ready for everything. The most important thing is to listen, think and dig. To dig is to think about saving your life. The deeper you dig, the better. A shovel is your best friend. The scariest thing right now is FPV and drones with resets. Because you hear a mortar and understand that it will lie nearby somewhere, you understand by the sound. Therefore, the mortar, let's say, is not so scary now.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/polonenyj-mamlyej-vorozhi-nosylshhyky-bk-ta-70-moskaliv-za-dvi-godyny-serzhant-horn-rozpoviv-pro-vorozhi-shturmy/	2024-12-13T20:14:49-08:00

The Armed Forces outnumber the Russian artillery in some areas by three times	Nazar Voloshyn, the spokesman for the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, said this on the air of the telethon. -If at the beginning of the war the ratio was 5:1 in favor of Russia, now in certain areas of the front Ukrainian artillery prevails over the enemy with a coefficient of 1.5:1 or even 3:1,- Voloshyn noted. He added that Ukrainian artillery focuses on pinpoint strikes on specific targets, while the Russians often fire across large squares, which reduces their effectiveness.

Nafta gives Putin enough money to believe in impunity,- the President wrote. Volodymyr Zelenskyi emphasized that a strong world reaction is needed: a massive reaction to a massive strike. -This is the only way to stop terror. If leaders are afraid to react or become accustomed to terror, Putin takes this as permission to continue. -Patriots- are needed to shoot down these missiles and prove that terror will not reach its goal. It is necessary to strengthen sanctions against Russia for the war in order to really affect Russian missile production,- he said.

The F-16 window of opportunity will open wider: about the new -software- for the Ukrainian -Battle F...	-This proposed sale will improve Ukraine's ability to counter current and future threats by further equipping it for self-defense and regional security missions with more robust air defense capabilities. It will not be difficult for Ukraine to master this equipment and services in its own armed forces,- said in the press release. The package approved by the State Department includes consumables and equipment, spare parts for aircraft and their engines, support for repair, restoration and return of equipment, personnel training for training equipment, and a program to improve aircraft engine components. In addition, the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will receive a joint mission planning system for its F-16s, special devices for uploading flight mission data, as well as technical and logistical services. These last three components of the support package are no less important than the aircraft or the weapons, because they create the operational environment in which the effectiveness of the F-16 fighters can significantly increase. The Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) is a tool for automated task planning in the interaction of various units. The system consists of computer hardware and Joint Mission Planning Environment (JMPE) software. In the US Air Force, the Joint Mission Planning System has been fully implemented since 2008. Since then, every fighter, bomber, refueler and helicopter has switched to JMPS for training, refueling and combat missions. Currently, the US Air Force continues to use JMPS, but in the future plans to switch to JOMS Core Mission Planning, or JOMS CMP, a new joint mission planning tool that uses an open systems architecture based on cloud technologies. At the same time, the Joint Mission Planning System is constantly being modernized, responding to current challenges and user needs, progress in the field of computer hardware (-hard-, -hard-) and software improvements (-soft-). As announces the US Air Force Materiel Command, in October 2020, JMPS was successfully tested for the first time in a virtual mission planning environment with the help of CloudOne, registering a 75 percent faster reporting time and receiving instant feedback from multiple locations. The transition from the JMPS monolithic architecture to the JOMS microservices architecture is planned to be completed by 2027, while the upgraded Joint Mission Planning System remains the best joint mission planning solution available for the F-16 outside of the United States. The information component is of primary importance in modern warfare, so the ability to receive and transmit data provides a decisive tactical advantage in combat. The exchange of information improves situational awareness, ensures coordination of actions and quick decision-making. In the case of the F-16, this is achieved by integrating the fighter into networked combat environments, within which it can exchange information in real time with command centers, other aircraft and ground units. The ability to receive and transmit data from the battlefield allows F-16 pilots to work with up-to-date data, which significantly increases mission effectiveness. Therefore, obtaining the ability of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to use the Joint Mission Planning System is an extremely important achievement. Reliable exchange of information with the fighter's on-board computer will be provided by another component of the package approved by the US State Department - the AN/PYQ-10 Simple Key Loader (SKL) data loading device. It is a state-of-the-art cryptographic device that securely receives, stores, and transmits data between compatible cryptographic and communication equipment. The AN/PYQ-10 SKL distributes and stores communications security (COMSEC) keys, electronic security data, and signals operation instructions using encrypted keys or codes. It meets the US National Security Agency's information security certification requirements for optimized key management, is backward compatible with existing cryptographic systems, and is a versatile device for software administration and information exchange in the US military. Finally, it is worth mentioning the services of logistics and material and technical support for the operation of the F-16. The involvement of foreign, primarily American specialists in the maintenance of Ukrainian fighters will help Ukraine maintain and repair combat aircraft that require special technical expertise for maintenance. The contractors for Ukraine in the implementation of the support package will be the Belgian company Sabena and the American companies Lockheed Martin Aeronautics and Pratt &amp; Whitney. It is important to note that among their services is the deployment of field teams of ground technical support personnel. Presumably, this may indicate the possibility of involving American military contractors in the maintenance of F-16 fighters directly on the territory of Ukraine. The actual ban on this was lifted by the administration of US President Joseph Biden at the beginning of November.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/13/vikno-mozhlyvostej-f-16-vidkryyetsya-shyrshe-pro-novyj-soft-dlya-ukrayinskyh-bojovyh-sokoliv/	2024-12-12T21:55:08-08:00

Self-propelled gun from the Korean Kims: an expert told about the Koksan self-propelled gun from the...	Russian propagandists claimed that the movement of these self-propelled guns took place through the territory of the aggressor country. We should wait for definitive confirmation of whether those howitzers from dictator Kim's lair really got to the Kremlin army only after the defeat of those 170-mm North Korean Wunderwaffe -. However, the correspondent of ArmiyaInform decided to ask Andriy Kharuk, a researcher of military equipment and armaments, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaydachny, about the Koksany and other artillery of the DPRK. - Before proceeding to the technical -dissection- of the North Korean self-propelled guns with a rather non-standard caliber, tell our readers what you, Andrii Ivanovich, know about self-propelled artillery from this most closed country in the world? - Development of self-propelled artillery in The Korean People's Army (KPA), which is officially called the Kimov army, has a long history history During the Korean War, the KPA used approximately three hundred SU-76 self-propelled guns (by July 1953, only 127 such self-propelled guns remained in service). After the war, the KPA received a small amount of ISU-122 from China. SU-100 also appeared - according to some estimates, about a hundred. And in the late 1960s, the Koreans began their own development. At first, as they say, they molded self-propelled guns from what was available. This is how a number of self-propelled guns appeared that used the chassis of the ATS-59 tracked tractor and various variants of 130-mm and 152-mm guns. Western observers identify at least a dozen modifications of such self-propelled guns, and we will not go into all their diversity in this material. Let's turn to another art system, more well-known and well-studied. —So you mean the 170mm howitzer? What exactly became the starting point in its creation? — The specifics of the military-strategic position of the Republic of Korea is the vulnerable location of its capital — only half a hundred kilometers separate Seoul from the demilitarized zone (the actual border with the DPRK). Therefore, sooner or later, an idea had to arise among the leadership of the DPRK: why not build us a cannon capable of hitting the enemy's capital? The practical implementation of this idea began at the beginning of the 70s. The result of the efforts of North Korean engineers was a 170 mm self-propelled gun. The origin of such an unusual caliber is unknown. There is a version in Western publications that this weapon was created on the basis of the German 17-cm Kanone 18 in Mörserlafette - allegedly, several such trophy guns with a supply of shells were handed over to the North Koreans by the Soviet Union. However, no material or documentary confirmation of this version has yet been discovered. There is an assumption that the artillery part of the North Korean gun was created on the basis of the Japanese 15 cm (149 mm) siege gun -Type 96-. This weapon with a barrel length of almost 53 caliber had a firing range of 26.3 km. The Japanese produced only 30 such guns, which distinguished themselves in 1942 during the siege of Corregidor in the Philippines, and were later used in coastal defense and fortified areas of Manchuria. Several Type 96 guns reached the DPRK from among those defending the ports of Racine and Wonsan. The result of the efforts of North Korean specialists was a 170 mm caliber gun with a 50 caliber barrel (over 8 m) with a slotted muzzle brake. The cannon is split-loading, and the practical rate of fire is rated at two shots in five minutes. The firing range of a conventional high-explosive projectile reaches 43 km, and an active-reactive projectile - 54-60 km. — But a gun by itself, even with a serious range, is far from self-propelled. How did the DPRK solve the issue with the chassis? - From the very beginning, the new long-range gun was designed as self-propelled - in the trailer version, it would be too bulky and not very mobile. For self-propelled guns, a tank-type chassis borrowed from the Soviet T-54/55 medium tank or its Chinese -clone- - -type 59- was used. The gun is mounted in the open, and the mounting method itself is quite interesting. Rails are installed on the roof of the chassis, along which the artillery unit can move. In the initial position, it is located in the center of the machine - this ensures a more or less uniform distribution of mass on the support rollers. In the firing position, the gun moves aft. Thanks to this, it is easier to charge from the ground, and most importantly, the main part of the return energy is transferred not to the body, but to the soil (with the help of two coulters that are lowered by a hydraulic drive). —There is some confusion with the very name of this self-propelled gun. Please explain where its name comes from, which actually sounds Korean. - The first variant of the 170 mm self-propelled gun is known as the M1978. Like all other designations of North Korean military equipment, it is conditional and does not mean the year of adoption, but the year when the self-propelled gun first came into the view of Western experts. The names -Koksan- (a town halfway between Pyongyang and the demilitarized zone where this self-propelled gun was first spotted) and -Juche-po- (-Juche Cannon-) are also conventional. The actual designation of the ACS is currently unknown. Production of the M1978 is believed to have begun around 1973. The self-propelled gun was first shown publicly at the 1987 parade. —What versions of this art installation have the North Korean -Kulibins- developed? And how many soldiers does its service include? - In the first version, Koksan was a typical self-propelled carriage, and not a full-fledged self-propelled gun - ammunition was transported by additional vehicles. No special ammunition transporters were created - shells were transported by ordinary trucks, mainly -Sungri-58- and -Sungri-61- (North Korean -clones- of the GAZ-51 and GAZ-63). The calculation of the ACS is eight people - a driver-mechanic, a commander, a gunner and five loaders/carriers. Only the driver-mechanic and the commander are in the starting position on the self-propelled vehicle, the others move on escort vehicles. —Well, the North Korean military industry has never gone off the rails of the over-militarized economy of the DPRK. Especially for the support that the regime of Grandfather Kim and Father Kim received from the USSR. Therefore, it was natural to modernize this ACS. What did it consist of? — In 1989, an improved version of -Koksan- was spotted, which received the quite logical designation M1989 in the West. It is distinguished by a radically redesigned hull, reminiscent of the hull of the Soviet 2C7 -Pion- self-propelled gun - with a large front overhang and a forward-swept cockpit. The increased volume of the hull made it possible to place not two, but four combatants, and also organize a compartment for transporting 12 shells with charges. In addition, MANPADS are carried on the SAU. — And did the researchers manage to count these products, at least approximately? And what is the structure of the units with which they are armed? — The number of manufactured self-propelled guns -Koksan- is unknown. Western analysts estimate it at about half a thousand copies. The structure of units armed with these self-propelled guns has not been established exactly. It is believed that the -Koksans- are divided into three-battery divisions (four guns per battery). The number of personnel of the division is estimated at 150-190 people. In addition to a dozen guns, it has about 20 cars. If these analysts' calculations are correct, then the Coxans division has limited autonomy - the existing vehicle fleet is not capable of transporting a significant amount of ammunition. For their part, divisions are divided into regiments or brigades, numbering 36 self-propelled guns each. - It is known who exactly the Kim regime is going to use these self-propelled guns against in the first place. But how exactly? — As far as we can judge from the available information, the tactics of the KPA involve the massive use of heavy artillery. In particular, during exercises held on March 25, 2016 in the presence of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, about a hundred M1978 and M1989 self-propelled guns took up positions on the sea coast near Wonsan Airport. However, a completely reasonable question arises: isn't the concentration of such a large mass of artillery on a small area a common training ground show? After all, in the conditions of real hostilities, self-propelled guns crowded into positions can be easily hit by aircraft or counter-battery fire. - Voice of America analysts said that North Korea has successfully traded weapons and ammunition for decades that are in demand in the -poor- states of the world, these weapons are cheap, but at the same time effective, accessible in application and maintenance, and do not have restrictions on use, unlike the weapons supplied by the giants of the world market. And what is known about the sale of these self-propelled guns by the Pyongyang regime? - Indeed, international popularity of -Koksan- was brought by exports. After the start of the Iran-Iraq war, North Korea became one of the main suppliers of weapons to Tehran. First of all, weapons of Soviet and Chinese development, -cloned- in the DPRK, were sent there. Several dozen original M1978 self-propelled guns, delivered to Iran before the beginning of 1987, stood out against the general background. Their combat debut took place in January 1987 during the Karbala-5 operation in the Basra area. -Koksans- were involved in massive artillery raids, in particular with the use of active-reactive projectiles at the full firing range. As is known, the operation, which was supposed to ensure Iran's victory in the war, was defeated. Iraqi troops took numerous trophies, including several Koksans (there is even information about thirty captured self-propelled guns of this type). The surviving Koksans are still in service with the Iranian army. An interesting page in the history of this self-propelled gun is the episode with the Iraqi -Coxan-. Inspired by the trophies, the Iraqis tried to create a similar artillery system. The limitations of the country's industrial base did not allow copying the artillery part, so the Iraqis took a ready-made solution - the 180-mm S-23 gun. This Soviet-made gun had a 47-caliber barrel and provided a firing range of 30 km with a conventional high-explosive projectile and 44 km with an active-reactive one. The Iraqis used the East German-made BLG-60 tank bridgelayer as a chassis. The open arrangement of the artillery unit, the hydraulically driven coulters and other details of the Iraqi -Koksan- largely repeated the North Korean original. Apparently, the self-propelled gun was produced in a single copy captured by American troops in the city of Al-Anbar in 2003. And finally, I will summarize all of the above. The Koksan self-propelled artillery system, created in the 1970s, became the first sample of North Korean -strategic- weapons, a kind of -long arm- of the military-political leadership of the DPRK. Before the advent of missile weapons, these guns were the only means capable of hitting the key centers of the Republic of Korea - the capital Seoul and the port of Incheon - from the territory of North Korea. With the development of missile technology, the importance of Koksans as a strategic tool has decreased, but these self-propelled guns remain an important component of the Korean People's Army.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/13/samohidka-vid-korejcziv-kimiv-ekspert-rozpoviv-pro-sau-koksan-z-kndr-yaku-nachebto-pomityly-v-rosiyi/	2024-12-12T20:32:47-08:00
An imminent strike on Kiev and 25 missiles every month: new fakes about Putin	Emotions are exactly what a Russian woman feeds on. There will be a threat - there will be anxiety. Our people have long known what to do when there is a warning and alarm. And predicting the time/date/place of an attack is a thankless task, since no one can say exactly when and where the attack will be made.. Only -they-, that is, the Rashists, know. It can happen today / tomorrow / the day after tomorrow or in a week. The same applies to mass shelling. They have everything ready, but when - no one knows. Another loud statement - supposedly -Oreshnik- will improve Russia's nuclear doctrine.- This is what the dictator Putin told the propagandists. He said that the appearance of the Oreshnik missile system in service in Russia -minimizes the need to use nuclear weapons.- And on December 10, the Belarusian dictator Lukashenko announced the placement of these missiles on the territory of Belarus. In addition, numerous agents of the influence of the Russian Federation abroad make statements aimed at inciting hysteria and fear around this missile. Another -deza- spread by Russian telegram channels is that Russia can allegedly manufacture 25 missiles - Oreshnyk- every month, that is, 300 rockets every year. Actually, this information is not true. The production of such technological missiles as, for example, -Kinzhal-, is carried out in units. And -Oreshennik- &#8211; this is an even more technological cycle, so the information about the stamping of this missile is a deliberate fake. The coordination of these statements and media activity testify to the conduct of an informational and psychological operation. Its goal is to influence Western countries in order to reduce their military support for Ukraine. Note that the Kremlin activated this operation precisely after the meeting of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi with French President Emmanuel Macron and US President-elect Donald Trump in Paris on December 7. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/13/nemynuchyj-udar-po-kyyevu-i-25-raket-shhomisyaczya-novi-fejky-pro-oryeshnik-putina/	2024-12-12T20:11:58-08:00
Ukrainian military instructors will undergo training in Lithuania: cooperation with NATO is expandin...	This is reported by Ministry of Defense of Ukraine December 12. It is noted that Ukraine, with the support of international partners, continues to improve the system of combat training and training of military personnel. This was agreed upon during a meeting between Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General of Justice Serhii Melnyk and Stasis Paldunas, International Advisor on Professional Military Education from the Republic of Lithuania. -Improving military education and combat training is one of the key tasks for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We are grateful to our partners for their support, which allows us to integrate modern NATO standards into our training system,- emphasized Serhiy Melnyk. The first group of Ukrainian instructors, which will include 30 people, will undergo training in Lithuania. During the selection of candidates, special attention will be paid to non-commissioned officers of the Armed Forces with combat experience. After returning to Ukraine, these instructors will be able not only to implement new approaches in the training of military personnel, but also to share knowledge with their colleagues in domestic training centers. In addition, the parties discussed updating training programs on combat shooting. In 2025, on the basis of two educational institutions of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, it is planned to launch a pilot project for the training of shooting course instructors with the assistance of the Alliance. Within the framework of this project, two groups of teachers will be created who will master new teaching methods adapted to modern NATO standards. -Cooperation with the Alliance opens up new opportunities for us to improve not only training programs, but also the development of specialists who will be able to train servicemen in accordance with the best international practices,- noted Serhii Melnyk. The introduction of updated combat training and shooting programs from the next academic year will allow training methodologists and increase the level of professional training of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, at the NATO Edge 24 exhibition in the USA there was -edge-24/->presented digital innovations of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine that help our military personnel to effectively perform tasks on the battlefield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/12/ukrayinski-vijskovi-instruktory-projdut-navchannya-u-lytvi-spivpraczya-z-nato-rozshyryuyetsya/	2024-12-12T11:59:20-08:00

Volodymyr Zelenskyi told how HIMARS affect the course of hostilities	The head of state informs about this on December 12 in social networks. According to him, Ukrainian defenders are extremely grateful to the United States for their assistance. HIMARS is a vivid example of sophisticated, highly accurate, effective and reliable American weapons. -Without such long-range missiles, Russia would have killed hundreds of thousands more Ukrainians. The availability of means of protection against Russian terror is a matter of life and death for the Ukrainian people,- the President said. He assured that the HIMARS were critical to the defense of the Kherson region against the Russians, and also helped thwart the Russian offensive in the Sumy region earlier this year. Now these systems are helping to defend the most difficult areas of the Donetsk front against Russian attacks. -If we did not have these and other powerful long-range weapons, the Russians would capture and destroy many more Ukrainian cities and villages. Long-range capabilities prevent loss of life. It is one thing to lose ammunition and missiles to stop the invaders, and quite another to lose people due to the lack of such defense capabilities,- the head of state emphasized. Volodymyr Zelenskyi thanked the United States for its help in reducing Ukrainian casualties. -Strengthening positions is the key to guaranteeing peace. the Russian aggressors can only be restrained and forced to accept peace through force. And such a peace is quite achievable thanks to strength,- he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi is in Zaporizhzhia -zaporizhzhyu/->acquainted with the consequences of a missile strike, which the Russian troops were inflicted on the city on December 10.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/12/volodymyr-zelenskyj-rozpoviv-yak-himars-vplyvayut-na-perebig-bojovyh-dij/	2024-12-12T11:43:53-08:00
Marines turned more than 40 units of Russian equipment into burning scrap metal in 10 days	The video of combat work appeared on the page of the Armed Forces of the Navy Forces of Ukraine. It is noted that due to the high intensity of the enemy's attempts to suppress the marines, the occupiers are forced to use a large number of manpower and equipment, including tanks and other heavy armored vehicles. -All this turns into burning scrap metal, and the enemy's personnel remains fertilizer in the fields of the Donetsk region,- the message says. Since the beginning of December 2024, soldiers of the 37th separate brigade of marines and 505th separate battalion of marines have destroyed 4 tanks, 17 armored vehicles, 11 cars and motorcycles, 9 types of various weapons, warehouses and EW means of the enemy. -Behind all these numbers is the titanic work of each unit - from carefully thought-out minefields and well-established communications to accurate artillery shots and hits by drone operators and, of course, the lion-like courage of our infantrymen!- - noted in the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Earlier, ArmyInform showed how the assault group of the 1st battalion of the 37th separate brigade of marines captured and -kurahivskomu-napryamku/->clearedone of the enemy's positions in the Kurakhiv direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/12/morpihy-peretvoryly-ponad-40-odynycz-rosijskoyi-tehniky-na-palayuchyj-metalobruht-za-10-dniv/	2024-12-12T11:23:35-08:00
Drunkenness and looting: how the Russian military awaits evacuation from Syria	The Russian military contingent continues its evacuation from Syria, focusing on bases in Tartus and Khmeimim. According to the available information, those soldiers who have already arrived at the assembly points, waiting for their flight, often engage in looting and abuse alcohol. This is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Evacuation is carried out by daily flights of 4-5 military transport planes between the base in Khmeimim and Russian airfields. Russian ships, in particular -Ivan Gren- and -Alexander Otrakovsky-, are involved in the transportation of weapons and equipment to Tartus. These ships are currently in the Norwegian Sea and are due to pass through the English Channel in a few days. The dry cargo ships -Sparta- and -Sparta II-, which left Baltiysk and St. Petersburg, are also involved in the evacuation of equipment. The commander of the Russian contingent, Colonel-General Alexander Chaiko, ordered to restore the equipment being exported from Syria. The evacuation of troops and equipment demonstrates the gradual winding down of the Russian military presence in Syria against the backdrop of domestic and international challenges.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/12/pyyacztvo-ta-maroderstvo-yak-rosijski-vijskovi-chekayut-evakuacziyi-z-syriyi/	2024-12-12T11:09:29-08:00

the kremlin pays billions of dollars for perceived geopolitical greatness	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Last year, Russia issued loans to other states, a record since 1999, totaling more than 30 billion dollars. Belarusian Lukashenka received the most Russian money - 7.75 billion dollars. Also among the leaders are Bangladesh, India, Egypt and Vietnam. At the same time, the Kremlin is actively writing off the debts it issued earlier. Such -generosity- of Moscow is explained solely by an effort to play the role of a -great power- and maintain influence over its neighbors and countries of the Global South, despite the harm to its own citizens. After all, Russia itself has serious economic problems, the infrastructure of many regions is neglected, and people's living standards are decreasing due to the costs of war and geopolitical projects of the Kremlin. We remind you, a decrease in the export of agricultural products is recorded in the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/12/kreml-platyt-milyardy-dolariv-za-uyavnu-geopolitychnu-velych/	2024-12-12T10:41:01-08:00
Fictitious disability for $10,000: a corruption scheme was exposed in Prykarpattia	This is reported by the Office of the Prosecutor General. According to the investigation, doctors provided a full package of -services- for $10,000, which made it possible to avoid mobilization. They drew up fictitious documents, organized -treatment- in a hospital, and also advised how to correctly argue their diagnoses before medical commissions. A 58-year-old doctor was detained while receiving money. His son, who was also involved in the scheme, was detained separately. During searches of the premises and workplaces of the suspects, fake medical documents, mobile phones, more than $45,000, 230,000 hryvnias and 660 euros in cash, as well as several cars, were seized. Currently, the doctors have been taken into custody. Checks are ongoing regarding the involvement of other persons in the scheme, in particular the employees of the Bureau of Medical and Social Examination. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/12/fiktyvna-invalidnist-za-10-tysyach-na-prykarpatti-vykryly-korupczijnu-shemu/	2024-12-12T10:27:39-08:00

Russia's shadow fleet: how outdated tankers provide the aggressor with billions in revenue	About informs Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. According to the portal, this fleet includes more than 1,000 outdated vessels, often without proper insurance and with hidden owners. In 2023 alone, Russia earned $188 billion and Iran nearly $53 billion in oil exports using these tankers to circumvent G7+ restrictions. With the help of such vessels, oil is transported across the Black and Mediterranean Seas to Asian markets, in particular to China and India. It is known that Russia has spent about $10 billion to create its own shadow fleet, which includes vessels that have already participated in more than 50 incidents with the risk of environmental disasters. The new section of the portal includes data on 238 tankers that help deliver sanctioned oil. These vessels are also used for raid transshipment and violate the established price ceiling for Russian oil. The uniqueness of the section lies in the ability to sort tankers by operators that began operating in 2022-2023 and quickly became key players in the transportation of Russian oil. War &amp; Sanctions is a global resource that also highlights the use of Western components in Russian weapons, the illegal export of grain, the abduction of Ukrainian children, and other crimes related to Russian aggression. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Black and Azov seas there are no Russian ships.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/12/tinovyj-flot-rosiyi-yak-zastarili-tankery-zabezpechuyut-milyardni-dohody-agresora/	2024-12-12T09:38:52-08:00

The enemy -dehydrates- its human resources: the occupiers cover Chasiv Yar with their bodies	A representative of the press service of 24 separate Andriy Polukhin of the mechanized brigade named after King Danylo. According to him, every assault is accompanied by active artillery preparation. The enemy has enough ammunition. -They don't spare them, they don't just cover the target, but try to hit the square, clean such a square.

In the Russian Federation, a decrease in the export of agricultural products is recorded	This is reported by /a> Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. At the same time, the import of agricultural products increased by 4.9% to 30.6 billion US dollars. Despite Putin's goal of increasing exports to $55 billion by 2030. USA, the real volume of agricultural exports will most likely amount to 36.3 billion dollars. USA, which gives a decrease of 34%. A reduction in exports will reduce customs duties, which will negatively affect the financing of unprofitable industries such as breeding, genetics, dairy and poultry. With this in mind, Russia revised the forecast for the growth of agricultural production in 2024: 1.5% per year is expected, instead of 3%, as previously forecast. The decrease in the export of agricultural products and the decrease in the projected growth of agricultural production in the conditions of the war against Ukraine and Western sanctions indicate the difficulties of adapting the agricultural sector to new economic conditions. This will worsen the stability of domestic production and slow down the development of the agro-industrial complex in the Russian Federation.

Exploits of tankers — Heroes of Ukraine: one against a convoy, surrounded battles and a risky maneuv...	Despite the statement of some experts that with the advent of new anti-tank weapons, the life of a tank on the battlefield is a matter of minutes, to this day the tank remains the most protected and well-armed combat vehicle. Ukraine has become one of the few countries that develop and produce tanks - it is enough to mention that the best tank of the Second World War, the T-34, and the first main battle tank, the T-64, were developed in Kharkiv. During the war with Russia, Ukrainian tankers discovered and continue to discover your skill and heroism by destroying the enemy. Thousands of tankers were awarded orders and medals, individual servicemen became Heroes of Ukraine. ArmyInform reminds which of the tankers was awarded the highest state award. His brothers nicknamed him -Adam- because he was always the first to go into battle. He was one of the first to destroy Russian tanks in the defense of Donetsk Airport in the fall of 2014 year, each time fighting to break through to the terminals, where the defense was held by Ukrainian servicemen. Risking his life more than once and more than twice, Yevhen Mezhevikin applied many tactical innovations and became the first tanker to be awarded the Hero of Ukraine Golden Star. With the beginning of a large-scale invasion, he created and became the commander of a tactical group -Adam-. Then, in late February 2022, the volunteers who had been fighting under his leadership since the start of the war rallied around him. Adam repaired two training tanks, an infantry fighting vehicle and went into battle with them. Task Force Adam was created on 14 March 2022. There were battles for the Kyiv region (Irpin, Bucha), then the group worked in the Bakhmut direction, took part in the Kharkiv offensive operation. It also took part in combat operations in different directions - Balakleya, Liman, Bakhmut, Kreminna, Serebryansky Forest&#8230; Now he is the deputy head of the Main Department of Doctrine and Training of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is impossible not to mention the feat of Colonel Yevgeny Sydorenko, who drove alone against the Russian column in the battle near Ilovaisk on the T-72BV trophy tank. There are very few such cases in world history. And almost all of them were during World War II. Yevhen Sydorenko, after repelling the Russian attack on August 29, 2014, went in a convoy to break away from the encirclement. It is his tank led the breakthrough after the death of Colonel Oleksiy Hrachov. For that battle, he was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, Ukrainian tankers have repeatedly demonstrated their courage and heroism. So, one of the first titles of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to a 23-year-old platoon commander Yugen Palchenko with the call sign -Song- - in the first days of the large-scale invasion, he was under Kherson covered the exit of the brigade from the environment, saving the lives of his comrades. Having broken through the ring of Russians, three tanks under the command of Palchenko took up the defense near the Antonivsky bridge and enabled the brothers to break through. About two thousand Ukrainian soldiers and equipment came out of the encirclement. On March 2, 2022, Lieutenant Yevhen Palchenko was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine by Presidential Decree for personal courage and heroism. Captain's company Ponomarenka accepted the baptism of fire within a few hours after unloading near Barvinkovo, and since then tankers of the 3rd separate tank brigade of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces almost continuously defend Kharkiv Oblast from enemy attack. In one of these battles, Serhii won Ukraine's highest state award. That day, tankers together with paratroopers made an attempt to storm the village of Topolskyi, which was captured by the enemy, near Izyum. Six Ukrainian tanks approached the village from two directions, but it turned out that the Russians had more than two dozen tanks there. But the training and experience of Ponomarenko's subordinates turned out to be better: the destruction of nine Rashist tanks was confirmed. One of the Ukrainian T-72s was damaged by several hits at once. In order to save the crew, Captain Ponomarenko decided to break into the firing line again in his own tank, so as not to endanger others. The crew supported their company, and Ponomarenko's tank successfully performed a risky maneuver, suppressing the enemy's fire points with well-aimed shots, and then the brave men under fire took the wrecked car in tow and pulled it out of the battlefield. On April 2, 2022, Captain Serhii Ivanovich Ponomarenko was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine with the award of the Golden Star Order.

Why the infantry rules in this war: about 24 days at -zero-, a path in -petals- and rescuing the wou...	They walked, orienting themselves by the silhouettes of bushes, pits, rips from the arrivals. The eye was already used to the darkness, and the terrain was familiar - they had gone to these places on more than one combat sortie. Just then, in the velvet silence of the night, an explosion rang out. Ivan with the call sign -Lucky- is the chief sergeant of the company of the mechanized battalion of the 44th separate mechanized brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He is 30 years old, originally from Chernihiv Oblast. ArmyInform recorded the story of a serviceman - about people and equipment in the army; about our army and training in Britain; about own motivation and approach to subordinates; about the evacuation of the dead soldier, about 24 days in the positions and much more: -I well remember the dawn of February 24, 2022: I was on the route on the way to Kyiv. Worked at a gas station, went to work. Basically, I'm a builder - it's my hobby! Don't feed with bread, but let bricks be laid (laughs - ed.). Then, on February 24, I read the news: shelling of Odesa, Kyiv&#8230; And I went to the Military Commissariat. I was sent to territorial defense. Teroborona is mostly a routine, we've been testing people. They stood at checkpoints, drove closer to the border, worked in the forests. Various information was checked, including about suspicious people. It was interesting because I found a lot of new acquaintances. My previous military experience is a term of service in 2015-2016, but in the National Guard of Ukraine. Therefore, the ZSU as a structure was a little unclear to me at first, but after a few days it became like cheese in butter (smiling - ed.). Then, when the Russians were expelled from the Chernihiv region, I joined the ranks of the ZSU - in the 44th brigade. I have been in this brigade since March 2023. Came to the position of commander of the department - the commander of a combat vehicle. &#8230; Why did I then go to the Military Commissariat? I'm not going to beat myself up and say what a great patriot I am, but I understood what I had to do. And I left. And he did not regret his decision one bit. I went to study in Britain in the summer of 2023. I thought it would be hot, but it's 21 degrees maximum (laughs - ed.), it's cold! After training, he returned to the position of platoon chief sergeant, and in September he became company chief sergeant, and now, in addition, I temporarily perform the duties of a battalion sergeant. The British military has a wonderful attitude towards Ukrainian soldiers. They do their best to teach us something. The classes were very interesting, they arranged quests for us, we walked through the woods, and, like pirates, looked for treasures&#8230; It was interesting. But the British have their own vision of how the war should continue, it is radically different from what is happening in our country. We also advised and advised them. Personally, I took a lot of useful things, especially regarding work with personnel, organization of work with people (approach to everyone, manner of communication, system of incentives). How do I encourage personnel?... I'll let you in on a big secret: The best incentive for military personnel is to see family. Therefore, yes, when there is an opportunity, I always tried to make maximum efforts so that the person was allowed to go home at least for a day or two, I could take care of this in front of the commander, etc. Because neither money nor diplomas can compare with a trip to relatives. &#8230; I'm generally reserved, but I can raise my voice - there are cases when it is proved&#8230; But I don't -bark- at subordinates on a regular basis. But the best recipe for understanding people in the army is communication. People are all different: someone from the city, someone from the village, from different regions. All this should be taken into account. In principle, I have not yet had such cases when, whether at the front or when the unit was in the rear, it was not possible to solve any issue. You just need an individual approach to each person. Recently, we went on a recovery from the difficult Kupyansk-Svativsk direction. We went there at the beginning of July 2023, the task was carried out for almost a year and a half. What are the most difficult tasks during this time? Probably holding positions that were difficult to reach, to which there is no approach, and when the enemy is just around the corner. This was the most difficult. Because, even elementary: in order to provide people with water, it was necessary to connect drones that would drop water and food for people. Therefore, to enter or exit these front lines intact was another quest. Now is a drone war. I personally had a case when the guys got lost, and I was just at that moment in a position where there was communication and I had the opportunity to see the picture. I contacted the UAV and asked them to find these guys. He told the boys that now our bird will take them to follow her. So, with the help of drones, we took out two fighters who got lost at night. They came out by the sound. Somehow I spent the maximum 24 days in the leading positions. It was the first time for me and it was a difficult experience. Because until now they entered the positions only for evacuation, or for 2-3 days (to see the situation, tell the guys something, or something). And 24 days is my maximum. During that time, I realized the best thing: a shower of wet wipes is such a thing (laughing, thumbs up - ed.). What is the most delicious exercise on the enemy's personnel?... It was with the help of drones. The UAV calculated where the enemy BMP and three buggies were. It seems that they imported BC&#8230; And then, with the help of Browning, two drones with resets and one RPG, we just poured it in there! Detonated everything! There were fireworks! And it was the most effective of what I saw with my own eyes. Adrenaline surges every day when you perform combat missions. You won't feel like you're there. I remember how I had to lead two soldiers to a position, they didn't know the way back then. The night was dark. I had a specific path there that led to a position on the middle line. I have met them and I am leading them. It is not possible to shine, so I oriented myself in the space - a bush, a hole, a gap from the arrival - we are walking, so to speak, by the devices (laughs - ed.). And then I hear one of the soldiers who followed me blow up. I did not understand what happened, because the drone was not heard. I took out a red flashlight and shone it. The path was strewn with -petals-. All Stupidly stuffed. We carefully approached the military one, threw it on us, and for another 200 meters made our way along that path literally by a millimeter - so as not to be stepped on. Then the enemy drones began to direct artillery at us, it started to slurp-slurp-slurp (simulates falling shells - ed.). We have already put up tourniquets in the shelter&#8230; If we talk about my worst experience, it was last year, unfortunately, we had to evacuate one of our dead comrades, a soldier. It took a day, with stops and rests, because the movement in the forward positions takes place only in the dark or gray hours of the day. We drove in at night, it took us some time to reach the position, to him, by morning. They have already started to appear gray. The distance was up to 5 kilometers. We spent the whole night on it. But leaving it there is not an option. A group of volunteers gathered, I led it, the armor dropped us and we left. When I found out that the unit was going to rebuild?.. Oh, it was shock content (laughs - ed.), like a bolt from the blue. There was a meeting and the company commander proved it&#8230; He arrived with his eyes wide open and says, -You won't believe it, you STILL WON'T BELIEVE IT!-. We asked what the matter was. And he was frightened: -On the way, they are taking us out.- When the boys heard it, they almost ordered the orchestra! They could not decide what to take with them and what to leave. The team was prompt and we got together pretty quickly. Everyone was so happy, as if&#8230; the war is over. Everyone hoped that maybe it would be possible to go home for a day or two. What was the first thing I did when I found myself in the -civilian- world? I went to the supermarket, bought myself the most expensive sweet water and pizza. And came out, inhaled, and it was a cool feeling. Nothing buzzes or explodes overhead&#8230; Now there is an opportunity to communicate more with relatives, call friends, because there is no such opportunity. What will be the end of the war for me?.. At least information about the ceasefire that is coming from their side. And there are guarantees from the authorities that it will stop for now. It is also important for me to understand that all this was not in vain, that all my brothers died - not in vain. I want people in the frontline and frontline villages to start sleeping peacefully. Because there are villages where there are a few elderly people left and they simply do not have the opportunity to leave somewhere. They don't even have a store in the village. It's painful to watch. And when they start to sleep peacefully - yes, it would be happiness for me. The borders of 1991?.. I think it is unlikely and unrealistic now. I would, of course. But it is hard to believe. So even if the fire and bombing just stopped, that would be cool. I would really like that. Fear of war?.. Everyone is afraid. And I'm afraid. But when you're already in the team, it's all much easier to digest. And these fears simply become something commonplace. For me, the worst thing is, for example, to lose the opportunity to see even more loved ones&#8230; But all those who are afraid just need to understand that sooner or later this fear can become their joy if it comes to them (when they find themselves in the ranks of the Armed Forces - ed.). The more we unite now , the more of us there are, the easier it will be for us. Adaptation to the army is very fast. Therefore, there is no need to be afraid. Yes, everyone is afraid. But you need to understand that this fear will live with you forever and constantly. Sometimes, simply, something will go into the background, then some adrenaline appears, then there will be successes that will switch you. Why do infantry rule this war? Gosh, it's so simple. Infantry is the hardest. Infantry units are the most difficult because it is direct contact with the enemy. These can be weeks spent in positions. I'm not downplaying the achievements of other units, but infantry is the hardest. Even take into account the fact: you are going to the position and you need to take food, water, BC with you for a week. And it's easy to put it on the position. Only for this, I believe, people need to shake hands and hardly carry on their hands. Infantry are the ones without whom we would lose territory. Without infantry, it is impossible to maintain a defensive line. Yes, there are drones, there is technology. But it is people (infantry!) who enter the position, establish themselves and keep it. Without these people, we would simply crumble.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/12/chomu-pihota-rulyt-u-czij-vijni-pro-24-doby-na-nuli-stezhku-u-lyepestkah-ta-poryatunok-poranenogo-istoriya-laki/	2024-12-11T20:55:22-08:00
At the forefront of technology: the European manufacturer of anti-ship missiles presented a new vers...	As highlighted in the presentation release MBDA (Matra BAE Dynamics Aérospatiale), an industrial company in the aerospace and defense sectors, a European leader in the development of missiles and missile weapons, -the ability to successfully launch an anti-ship missile at any time of the day or night, in any weather, and regardless of electronic warfare conditions has always been vital to the Navy,- the ArmyInform document quotes. -In addition, the ability of surface ships to detect a submarine has increased significantly over the years due to technological improvements, which has led to the emergence of a new generation of anti-ship missiles,- state the manufacturers of the warhead. The ammunition, named SM40, was created in France and became the last representative of the Exocet family, writes the Defense News portal with a link on company representatives. The material says that the main differences of the new anti-ship missile from its predecessor, the SM39 missile, are the use of a new J-band radar, improved algorithms for working under conditions of high combat load, as well as a doubled radius of attack. According to Pierre-Marie Bellot, MBDA's Head of Strike Missile Development, the SM40 missile has a range of up to 120 km, which is made possible by a new turbojet engine. According to him, the significant increase in the damage radius is designed to increase the possibility of conducting a battle at a safe distance in the conditions of anti-submarine warfare. Bello also noted that the SM40 is designed exclusively for submarines produced by the French company Naval Group, which provides for the compatibility of the new missile with submarines used by a wide range of customers of the French shipbuilder on the international market. As Defense News writes, the predecessor of the new missile, the SM39 model, is already in service with the navies of several countries, including France and India. The new variant of the ammunition, in addition to effectively hitting well-protected warships and invisible targets, also has the ability to hit ground objects, which allows, for example, to attack ships in the port. According to the developer, the SM40 uses a launch method similar to the previous model: the missile is placed in a special underwater container with an engine that is controlled and accompanied during the underwater movement stage, and then ejects the missile to the surface, launching it. The new design's more compact airframe reduces fuel consumption compared to the MM40 Block 3/3c naval round. However, MBDA believes that the SM40 will still achieve its 120km range targets, which is double that of its predecessor. In addition, SM40 will retain the current launch area of ​​SM39, which includes the possibility of launches from the sea depths. Like the MM40 Block 3/3c, the new missile can hit coastal targets (such as moored ships inside a naval base). In addition, Naval News believes that the MBDA envisions additional sets of potential targets for the SM40. The SM40 has not yet been put into mass production, but, according to an MBDA representative, since it is built on the basis of already existing and proven technologies, the time to market will be minimal. Information: -Exocet- (fr. Exocet - flying fish) is a cruise anti-ship missile. Developed by the French company -Aérospatiale- in 1975. It is in the armed navies and air forces of more than 25 countries of the world. It is the most common PKR in the West. The missile has a traditional aerodynamic design with cross-shaped wings in the middle part of the body and the same rudders in the tail compartment. The rocket is launched from a sealed container. During launch, the distance to the enemy object and the bearing of the target are indicated. At a distance of 10 km to the target, the missile descends to a minimum height (8 m from the surface) and turns on the GOS radar. The warhead has contact and non-contact detonators. Exocet's main competitors are the American Harpoon, the Italian Otomat, the Israeli Gabriel-V, the Swedish RBS 15, and the Chinese Yingji series. Presentation of the SM40 Exocet cruise missile.

A new fraudulent scheme: Ukrainians are offered fake aid from UNICEF	To make the -dumping- look more believable, the swindlers even painted the categories of people to whom this aid is supposed to belong. But if you think about it, almost every Ukrainian falls under one of them. What is the point -people with a monthly income of less than 28 thousand hryvnias- worth? And this is in a country where the minimum wage is more than three times less than the specified amount. Obviously, this is being done to scam as many people as possible. The fraudulent scheme has already been warned on the official account of UNICEF Ukraine on Facebook: -We emphasize that we do not accept applications for such humanitarian kits. So be careful, do not go to third-party resources and do not share your personal data! According to the data of /a> of the -On the other side of the news- resource, fraudulent posts were spotted on the -Switch | Kyiv | Light- to which more than 100 thousand people subscribed. If you click on the link, you will be directed to the Unicef ​​Humanitarian Free Kit Telegram bot. Then you need to press -Start!-. As soon as you do this, you will be bombarded with dozens of messages. First, you will be asked to confirm your city. Whether you do this or not, you will then be threatened that you were -spotted on a Russian server 18 minutes 32 seconds ago.- Therefore, you will not be registered until you confirm your citizenship. And they write it in an ultimatum tone. However, even without this, you will receive an invitation to a -free humanitarian kit from our organization- (spelling correct). In short, you won't have time to blink an eye, and you will already be subscribed to a bunch of dubious Telegram channels. Specifically on -[substitute city] | Time-. This is a network of channels that covers all regional centers controlled by Ukraine. To understand the scope: only to the channel -Kyiv| 351,000 Ukrainians subscribed to Time! Actually, this is the main purpose of the scam scheme - to lure people to their channels. The more followers, the more advertising and money.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/12/nova-shahrajska-shema-ukrayinczyam-proponuyut-fejkovu-dopomogu-vid-unicef/	2024-12-11T20:26:47-08:00
About drones, EW and vacancies in a special battalion: combatant Kucher told how the enemy is having...	When will ground-based drones become commonplace on the frontline? What are the advantages of a separate special purpose battalion and what tasks does it perform? How to get into a special unit and what should be done to stay in the chosen position? Which branch of the special battalion of the presidential brigade is vacant? The commander of the 21st separate special purpose battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, Major Oleksiy Kucherenko with the call sign -Kucher-, told ArmyInform about this. - What is the difference between a separate special purpose battalion and a separate presidential brigade? - First of all, one should consider the advantages of a separate battalion as a whole over line battalions. This is greater autonomy, this is the availability of services - from cars to UAVs. This is the ability to independently carry out recruiting, the ability to make purchases, receive support from higher authorities not only from the brigade itself, but also directly. It is about the very benefits of an individual organism. A special purpose component allows us to perform various specific tasks. As of today, our tasks are closer to those of infantry — primarily to hold the line, destroy the enemy. But there are also quite specific tasks - for example, jump on a -Hummer- close to the enemy's positions and directly into the entrance to the house, throw -TM-ki- (anti-tank mines - ed.) into the dugout and watch , as the enemy flies into the air. There are different stories, extreme evacuation tasks, when there is no longer a walking route, and no access at all to that position. That is, there is a whole series of tasks with an increased level of risk that the special purpose battalion performs. - Not everyone can do such tasks. Who serves in the battalion, because the Armed Forces are, first of all, servicemen, people. Who serves in the battalion subordinate to you? How do you get to it - are there any special requirements? - Since the battalion was formed in March 2022, the vast majority of personnel are primarily mobilized. Recently, thanks to the opportunity to engage in recruiting, the number of contract workers in the unit has increased. However, the vast majority are soldiers who came to us for mobilization from training centers. If taken as a whole, more than 2/3 of the personnel are mobilized, and another 30% are those who found information about the battalion on media resources, on bigboards, on Reserve+, through recruiting centers. Those who self-mobilize are able to choose the position that best suits their desires and civilian experience. In the battalion, there is an opportunity to choose a direction for yourself, and not so that everyone goes under the same comb and it does not matter whether you were an agriculturist or a small businessman or worked on the railway. Everyone will be able to get a position according to his skills. If you're a great driver and you know how to fix an engine, you'll be a driver, my friend. If you have skills in the IT field, we also have suitable tasks. For example, there are UAV workshops, where we ourselves repair and improve large and small -birds-, configure kamikaze drones. Do you want to become a pilot - no questions, we will show and tell. Even if you do not have experience and skills, there are a number of experienced warriors in this field, there are a lot of training centers where everyone will find a position according to their calling. - Is there a guarantee that a person who has passed according to the necessary criteria for a certain position will serve in that position? - Absolutely. If she confirms her qualifications and shows results, not only this serviceman, but also everyone around, primarily the command, will be interested in her continuing to perform tasks in this particular position. But there are also nuances. It will not be the case that if a person comes and does not show results in this position, then he will remain in this position forever. If you don't manage, you don't show results, you're lazy, then the trust credit ends - and then please do what they say. Then I'm sorry, my friend, if you don't cope, then in this case another military approach will already be applied and you will be transferred to a position that corresponds to your level of knowledge and skills, and which is now critically needed specifically in the battalion. — Now the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were able to independently recruit new recruits without the mediation of the TCC and SP. Is it practiced by the 21st separate special purpose battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade? - Of course, we practice. You can learn about us directly on our Telegram channel, on battalion Facebook pages and Instagram. Just enter the name of the battalion in the search engines and you will immediately find our page with a description of the combat path of the unit, information on how to join the battalion and vacancies. Aggregate vacancies in the Armed Forces of Ukraine from ArmiyaInform There are also vacancies in various platforms such as Work.ua or the newly created application Rezerv+, where you can mobilize directly. — In the ten years since the beginning of the open armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have gone through a very significant path of powerful modernization. Are these changes visible at the battalion level? What are they? — I have seen these changes personally — not from the outside, but in the army, because I have been serving for much longer than 5 years. I remember how the fighters still hemmed the -oak-. Therefore, the changes are very noticeable - starting with elementary issues of providing property, equipment, its quality - and ending with the conduct of hostilities. Material security is the first component that has changed very significantly for the better. The second component is how we now fight. For example, drones, real-time communication and data transmission, software that allows for operational control have given a very big boost and huge change to the tactics of warfare. We now have a variety of drones, from large UAVs such as Vampires and Bats to ground-based drones, both kamikaze and logistics drones. With the help of drones, it is now possible to provide supplies to advanced positions, as well as to deliver or drop large -bombs- directly on the enemy's head (smiles - ed.). And this is not to mention the many other high-quality Western weapons such as Javelin or NLAW, LAVR or MaxxPro armored vehicles and much more. It's one story when you drive a pickup and all your protection is an icon on a torpedo, and it's quite another when you fly in an armored Hummer with a Browning machine gun on the roof. - You mentioned ground drones. Despite the fact that their appearance on the front is no longer news, they still continue to be perceived as a certain novelty compared to UAVs. Can you say a few words specifically about ground unmanned complexes and their tasks? - As for ground drones, this is a really new branch of development for our division. However, it is extremely promising because there are specific tasks, especially in urban areas, that ground-based drones can perform best, and for which these tools are designed. For example, to deliver cargo without risking the lives of soldiers. Or drive a kamikaze drone directly into the enemy position and detonate four TMs to completely destroy it. All this allows, first of all, to save the lives of our soldiers and, secondly, to save a significant amount of ammunition that would have to be spent to fire damage to these positions. I will not reveal all the secrets about ground drones, because this component is still developing and has not gained much popularity. But, I think that in about half a year, ground drone crews will not be a novelty, but will become as commonplace as UAV crews and will appear in all units. They will perform tasks just as successfully and become as indispensable an integral part of operations as aerial drones. Nowadays, videos of FPV kamikazes or bombers with resets will not surprise anyone, instead, they are doing extremely important combat work. Thanks to this simple, already familiar element, we save a lot of lives of infantrymen who do not have to engage in direct combat with the enemy. Combat work of drone operators of the 21st special purpose battalion of the Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi Drones, heavy night bombers are 5 to 10 drops per night. This is a minus of the enemy's logistics, it is a deprivation of his ability to accumulate before assault actions. There were times when the enemy tried to build up on the front edge before attempting to storm our positions. We worked on them for a day with various drones, both kamikaze and heavy bombers. In the end, the commander of the assault group of the Russians refused to obey the order, turned off the radio station - and we listened to their conversations - and, judging by everything, left the position. The assault did not take place. They refused to storm, because every 20‒25‒30 minutes something would definitely come at them from our side. —The combat work of the UAV is very vivid, it is shown in countless videos. However, there is something that remains behind the scenes - providing battle management, establishing and maintaining communication, the work of EW. We understand that it is not possible to talk about everything in detail, but at least in general terms, what can be said about this -invisible- component of combat operations? - Communication is generally a key component of fighting, fire control. There will be no connection - there will be nothing. You will not be able not to give a command, you will not be able to adjust the means of fire, you will not be able to simply manage a unit. Without communication, any unit at any level will simply be incapacitated. It will be a group of people with weapons, with some skills, but it will not be a single fist, it will not be a single military body. So is the EW - it's invisible in the video, but just as important as kamikaze drones and bombers. The enemy uses FPV drones as actively as we do. Therefore, without REB, without providing reliable protection, no task can be performed now. Currently, no vehicle will be allowed into the combat zone without a REB, as this is an unjustified risk to personnel. Covering with electronic devices is also very relevant now. By the way, our battalion has recently created a separate department for the provision of REB. As of today, there are many vacancies in it, so if any of the readers of this interview have relevant knowledge, experience and see themselves as a specialist in radio-electronic warfare - welcome.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/12/pro-drony-reb-ta-vakanty-v-osoblyvomu-bataljoni-kombat-kucher-rozpoviv-yak-koshmaryt-voroga/	2024-12-11T20:11:06-08:00

Fierce battles continue in this direction with the enemy, who prevails primarily in manpower. The Russian occupiers threw significant forces, trying to break through the Ukrainian defenses, but the Ukrainian soldiers show exceptional resilience, inflicting significant losses on the enemy. According to General Oleksandr Syrskyi, in order to maintain defensive positions, it is necessary to make non-standard decisions that increase the effectiveness of defense and destruction of the enemy. -The main task is to strengthen the defense, to provide units with a sufficient amount of ammunition and their smooth transportation,- noted the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. While working at the positions, Oleksandr Syrskyi listened to information about the current situation, identified problems and issued appropriate orders.

These measures are part of the policy of the Ministry of Defense to implement modern approaches to the organization of defense procurement, which are based on the principles of transparency, responsibility and timely delivery. -In general, in 2025, we plan to allocate more than UAH 67 billion to rear property. Purchases have already been announced for about half of this budget. In the midst of war, we cannot afford any delay. Early contracting is a guarantee that the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be provided with everything they need,- Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov emphasized. For his part, the Director of the Procurement Policy Department of the Ministry of Defense, Hleb Kanevskyi, noted that the forecasted procurement procedures and sufficient time for their implementation will give Ukrainian business the opportunity to fulfill large volumes of orders in a high-quality manner. -By the end of this year, the Prozorro system will hold auctions for the purchase of 550,000 pairs of summer boots and one million summer field suits, which will allow early preparation for the spring-summer period,- he said.

Oleksiy Neizhpapa thanked Great Britain and Norway for their initiative, determination and leadership in forming and coordinating the work of the Coalition, as well as all the states that joined this initiative. According to him, the Maritime Coalition is a unique multifunctional and multi-domain project with a clear road map until 2035. Today, it includes 19 countries, 12 of which have already signed the accession document. -Despite the fact that a year is a relatively short period, we managed to achieve significant results. We preserved the safety of navigation in the northwestern part of the Black Sea, forced the enemy to leave the bays of Sevastopol, made it difficult for his actions in the Sea of ​​Azov, and restored the export of Ukrainian products by sea,- he said. The commander of the Armed Forces Navy noted that, at the same time, the situation near the Ukrainian coast is quite fragile. The enemy does not stop trying to disrupt shipping from the ports of Ukraine, and his main goal is to deprive Ukrainians of access to the sea. -Therefore, I appealed to partners to double our efforts and accelerate the formation of the necessary capabilities, especially strike, and port protection. We must use all opportunities to destroy the enemy fleet,- Oleksiy Neizhpapa emphasized. It is already planned to receive the following aid packages during 2024-2025 to strengthen Ukrainian defense capabilities and effectively counter the aggressor. -The partners expressed their full support for Ukraine in the fight for freedom and assured of their readiness to continue increasing cooperation within the Maritime Coalition,- the commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said.

Why it is more difficult to return deported children than military children: the President's explana...	He told this in an interview for SBN. -You exchange the military for the military. Yes, unfortunately, sometimes the Russians block it, but it happens. Sometimes there is a possibility of returning civilians. And we understand the tool by which we return civilians. What about the children? It is very difficult with them, because we cannot trade children for children,- he stated. Volodymyr Zelenskyi noted that there are no stolen Russian children in Ukraine. -We didn't steal anyone, we didn't deport anyone. Our operation in the Kursk region is proof. It cannot be said that there are simply no Ukrainians on Russian territory, and therefore we did not touch anyone. No, we operated in the Kursk region. Not a single person was stolen, not a single civilian was killed by us, not a single child was harmed there. That's the difference,- he emphasized. According to him, the Russians stole 19,500 verified Ukrainian children. -These are the children who are verified by our institutions. But pay attention to the fact that officially, it seems to me, in 23 years, the Russian ombudsman reported that they are keeping 700 thousand Ukrainian children. This is their official data. I don't know how true this is, but it's terrifying. They are proud to have stolen children,- the head of state said. The President of Ukraine said that children can be returned only thanks to partners and joint pressure. -Now we are returning children through the mediation of Qatar, through the mediation of the Vatican, and certainly there are examples where this or that country can help with a small number of children. To date, we have returned 1,030 children. 1,030 out of 19,500 verified,- he said. We will remind, President Volodymyr Zelensky metwith Council of Europe Secretary General Alain Bercet and discussed the need to create a special crime tribunal aggression As reported by ArmyInform, Yale University researchers identified hundreds of of Ukrainian children from Donetsk and Luhansk regions, who were abducted by Russia in February 2022, as well as their whereabouts and deportation routes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/11/chomu-povertaty-deportovanyh-ditej-skladnishe-nizh-vijskovyh-poyasnennya-prezydenta/	2024-12-11T08:57:53-08:00

Slavic spy: a Russian agent leaked data on the artillery of the Armed Forces	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. As the investigation established, the man was recruited by the Russian special services through social networks. The main task of the agent was to identify the positions of the main and reactive artillery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which tracks the assault groups of the invaders in the Slavyansk direction. He also searched for the coordinates of checkpoints on key highways in the region. To collect information, the attacker traveled around the area, secretly recorded the location of the Ukrainian military and transmitted the data to Russian curators through a liaison. He turned out to be a former resident of Lyman, who after the occupation of the city joined the armed groups of the Russian Federation and is currently fighting on the Eastern Front. After the attacks, the agent was supposed to conduct reconnaissance and correct repeated attacks. SBU employees caught the traitor red-handed when he tried to hand over another batch of intelligence. A mobile phone with evidence of subversive activity was seized from him. The detainee was informed of the suspicion of treason committed under martial law (Part 2, Article 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). The court chose a preventive measure - custody. He faces up to life in prison with forfeiture of property. As reported by ArmyInform, the SBU established the identity of another war criminal of the Russian Federation, who is involved in the torture of civilian residents of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/11/slovyanskyj-shpygun-rosijskyj-agent-zlyvav-dani-pro-artyleriyu-zsu/	2024-12-11T02:08:25-08:00
Former Wagnerians from Syria operate in the north of the Kharkiv region: the occupiers attack from t...	The commander of the platoon of unmanned aircraft systems of the 92nd separate assault brigade said this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- named after the kosh chieftain Ivan Sirko Mykola with the call sign -Kitty-. — If we take into account the change in weather conditions, the enemy no longer uses frontal attacks, because the shore along the reservoir has become exposed. And moving infantry groups across that shore is almost always a 100% negative for the enemy. So they shifted the vector more towards flanking [attacks],- he said. The military reported that the Russians are trying to storm the area of ​​the settlement of Strelecha of the border Lipetsk community of the Kharkiv district. — Attempts of active assault actions near the settlement of Strelecha. But also the enemy does not experience any strategic results, it is detected by our unmanned systems, artillery systems are used, and the result is always in our favor so far, and it will continue to be so, - said the commander of the drones. The officer told about the composition of the enemy's forces. — Now motorized rifle units are fighting directly in our direction. We are also currently monitoring the Africa Corps group. These are, in principle, fighters of the former -Wagner group- and the contingent from Syria, who were called to fight the -colonial policy- of the West, he said. The military assessed the level of training and skill of the enemy. — People from the -African Corps- are more prepared, they are ready for adverse weather conditions, for difficult conditions of combat operations. Therefore, we have certain surprises from such guys, he said. However, Ukrainian fighters are also ready for difficult weather conditions. — As for work, this is not the first winter. We adapt to the weather conditions. We know certain types of weapons, namely unmanned systems, which should not be used with quality now. We're low on humanity, we're also low on cloudiness. Therefore, certain types, such as the long-range reconnaissance wings, are currently ineffective. Therefore, we perform these tasks with the help of FPV drones, explained the commander of the drones. He described the tactics used by Ukrainian drone pilots. — We fly out on reconnaissance directly with ammunition, one might say, on a hunt. If the movement of some equipment or manpower is detected, or we simply find something disguised as a result of reconnaissance, then a defeat occurs. If we don't find targets by calling, if we don't see something on this hunt that could be hit, then we simply work on targets already known in advance, so-called planned targets, - he said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the north of Kharkiv Oblast, the occupiers are fighting marginally, needlessly with prisons and North Korea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/11/kolyshni-vagnerivczi-z-syriyi-diyut-na-pivnochi-harkivskoyi-oblasti-okupanty-atakuyut-z-flangiv/	2024-12-11T01:56:44-08:00
We learn osuohai, we meet immigrants from Yakutia: the realities of the occupied Luhansk region	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. It is noted that the relevant draft law is being developed in the so-called LNR. The initiators are sure that such a step will facilitate the migration of families of Russian servicemen to Luhansk region, which will solve the problem of shortage of personnel, in particular among doctors, teachers and accountants. Meanwhile, in Novodruzhesk, which is next to Lysychansk, there has been no electricity supply for more than two years. The remaining local residents hoped in vain to solve this problem after a pseudo-referendum, fake elections or a change of local -curators-. Instead, they began dismantling equipment at transformer substations in the settlement, to which the Russian military was involved. The restoration of critical infrastructure facilities is not being carried out, which confirms the further neglect of the basic needs of local residents.

This is reported by the Command of the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Especially brutal murder - Article 105. Killed a pedophile who raped a 13-year-old girl from an orphanage. The sentence is 22 years and 3 months of strict regime,- says Danylo. From this term, Usov managed to serve only 1 year. Agitators for the SVO appeared in the colony. He says he didn't want to sign, but was threatened with violence. -One by one, we were brought to the chief's office, where there was a representative from the Russian Armed Forces. Those who refused were proved in the evening that -it will be necessary. They pushed me papers and told me to sign everything,- the Russian continued. Usov signed the contract without hesitation. Propaganda said that they were going to fight against foreign legions and NATO because -there are no more Ukrainians in the Armed Forces.- -For refusing to sign, prisoners were threatened with -press houses-. They assured me that I would not make it to the colony. And after the -press house-, where people were broken, everyone and everything signed,- Danylo added. On the same day after signing the contract, Usov was sent to Barnaul from the pre-trial detention center. There they were dropped off from the bus depots, where other prisoners were already waiting. -We gave out dry rations of water and put them on buses to Novosibirsk. They said that there are two days and you can meet with your relatives. Mom left, but she didn't have time to get there, they told us that we were flying out urgently. We never met. -Mom used to say, 'It would be better for you to sit and not go to SVO,'- said the former prisoner. Usov and other convicts were brought to the first training ground, where they were engaged in construction work for 2 weeks. -They dug, sawed, built, laid electricity. There was no training. I've been building cars because that's what I know. Once they were taken to the training ground, but only because television came. They gave out 15 rounds per machine gun, like we are training here,- Danylo noted. Usov broke his leg during one of these -training sessions- at the Zoryanyi training ground near Luhansk. He says that prisoners were shot and thrown with grenades. This is how the instructors instilled courage in the newly minted fighters. Three weeks later, they were sent to a training ground in the Kursk region. There, they were taken to an abandoned factory, where they passed a medical examination, worked on racks, and disassembled weapons. Over the course of a month, prisoners were transferred to different villages of the Kursk region. In one of them, Usov and other paratroopers were pelted with drops from drones. For several days, Usov, along with other wounded convicts, hid in the basements until they were captured by Ukrainian paratroopers. -Our commanders abandoned us. The boys and I assumed that in this way, when we were working, our command calculated the enemy's artillery. Each prisoner, on the eve of the military exit, was issued one grenade for suicide. They said that it is impossible to surrender to captivity. One fellow blew himself up, but I couldn't. -I probably didn't have enough courage,- said the Russian. As reported by ArmyInform, the fighters of the 80th Halych Assault Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces repelled another unsuccessful enemy assault and took captured 11 Russians from the 11th Assault Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/11/ubyv-pedofila-zmusyly-jty-na-svo-daly-granatu-dlya-samogubstva-istoriya-polonenogo-rosiyanyna/	2024-12-10T23:37:52-08:00

Miracle armored personnel carrier of the Viking marines: how amphibious all-terrain vehicles are use...	The BvS-10 (short for Bandvagn Skyddad, -protected tracked vehicle-) is a Swedish-British tracked amphibious armored personnel carrier. In service with the Marines since 2023. This technique was transferred by Great Britain. Amphibious all-terrain vehicles consist of two parts: the first car is for the commander, driver-mechanic and gunner, the second is for transporting the landing party. Accommodates up to 12 people. The machines have excellent maneuverability, are able to overcome water obstacles and operate in flooded areas. This is possible thanks to the wide rubber track (has a Kevlar insert), which is not heavy on the swamp, and on the sand of the APC. There is an automatic transmission, it moves quite quickly on dry land, accelerates to 70 km/h. The guys tried more - they took 75 km/h. Of course, overcoming water obstacles is much slower - 5 km/h. It dives into the water at 1.25 m and moves there with the help of caterpillars. The Viking is well armored, equipped with a 12.7mm Browning M2 machine gun and special grenade launchers to create smoke screens. The combat module rotates 180 degrees, also protected by an armor plate. The equipment is very light and convenient to use. Cummins turbocharged diesel engine produces 285 horsepower. The mechanical power of the engine is transmitted to the rear of the car, meaning it is fully four-wheel drive. The weight of the front link is 5000 kg and the rear link is 3500 kg. Unlike our MTLB and BMP, these machines are much simpler and more economical. Fuel consumption 6.7 liters per 100 km. Like a normal car. The range is 500 km. That's quite a lot. Our mechanics-drivers mastered this miracle of technology for more than a month at the training ground in Great Britain. Tactical and technical characteristics, equipment and combat capabilities were studied in detail. Theory, followed by practical training in all weather conditions. Driving lessons are the base. British instructors showed all the technical intricacies and features of armored vehicles. They taught the basics of -first aid repair-. Of course, marines consolidated their knowledge on tests. Plus, auxiliary courses on improving work on this technique are periodically organized in Ukraine. When the brigade fought in the Kherson direction, Viking was used less for its intended purpose. Here, in Donetsk region, these machines are already in full use. -The tasks are diverse: delivery of amphibious combat groups through difficult terrain and their landing, including overcoming water obstacles, evacuation of the wounded from the battlefield, delivery of provisions and water. They even carry ammunition. Our engineers also had to deliver explosives to the area of ​​combat missions. In short, everything that can be delivered to the front edge of our guys, we deliver. Due to the small dimensions of the armored personnel carrier, it is inconspicuous, the enemy often does not see it because of plantings or large bushes. Once the amphibious all-terrain vehicles were attacked by the Russians with their FPV drones: -They hit the landing compartment, but the machine continued to move and, most importantly, no one was hurt. I believe that MTLB could hardly withstand this blow. Not to mention the amount of shrapnel that comes in during shelling. Katsaps try to hit APCs with mines, but usually they do not hit on target. A meter or two from the cars.- -Of course, there have already been cases when several cars were hit, but the crews remained completely unharmed. Somehow I even remember: there was a collision with an anti-tank mine and no one was hurt. Imagine! Did anyone even have a concussion? The Viking rink was only damaged, so he could not go any further. Then the next car left and picked up the boys. They independently all plunged into the amphibious landing and evacuated. The armor is solid so far. Of course, if there is a direct hit by a large-caliber projectile, you understand.- In order for the knocked-out APC to burn completely, the Katsapas used as many as 10 FPV drones. That's 10 direct hits to completely destroy the tech. -Bird- says: there are no particular problems with spare parts. -If necessary, the British deliver them to Ukraine. They have a lot of such equipment under conservation there. They send tracks, engines, other mechanisms. We repair cars in our repair units.- What's interesting? According to the crew of the machine, due to its compactness, the Viking is less likely to be blown up by mines. The secret is that the limited weight is distributed over the wide surface of the rubber tracks, making mines less likely to detonate. This is the survivability of these APCs. -For example. Again, the track on the MTLB is not wide and there is a much greater load on the mine. That's why there was an explosion there immediately.- Vyacheslav is 36 years old, originally from Pervomaisk, Mykolaiv region. Awarded the Order -For Courage III degree-. In the army since the beginning of the large-scale invasion. -In Mykolaiv, they were just recruiting for the marines. It was necessary to form units to support our troops in the Mariupol region. I am a sergeant, I have a term of service in the internal troops. At first he got into the reserve company of the 36th Marine Brigade. They worked in the Volnovakha district. He fought in 2022 in various places of the Volnovasky district. He got into the environment with his brothers. Lost connection. Russian equipment and occupiers were already all around. It was possible to get out and join other marine units. In the 38th brigade since 2023, he received a promotion to the rank of officer and the opportunity to lead an airborne assault company. We ask: for which combat episode was awarded the Order -For Courage III degree-. -Bird- replies: -This is a collective award from all the guys in my unit. Their heroism is incredible. At that time, the intensity of hostilities in Mariintka, Pisky, and Vodyan was such that every day and everyone in the positions could be awarded orders. No one felt sorry for themselves and, in general, often, unfortunately, did not count with life.- &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/11/chudo-btr-morpihiv-viking-yak-na-fronti-vykorystovuyut-vsyudyhody-amfibiyi/	2024-12-10T21:03:36-08:00
Armored monster on the water: the Korean car manufacturer will create the most modern tank	Not without a certain amount of boasting declared by the development company, this next-generation main battle tank surpasses all capabilities of modern MBTs, providing more effective performance tasks with the help of the latest technologies for future warfare, ArmiyaInform reports. As considered by the experts of the defense portal Army Recognition, a collaboration between Hyundai Rotem, the Development Agency of Defense of the Republic of Korea and the Korea Research Institute for Defense Technology Planning and Improvement is a significant technological breakthrough that brings the country closer to the introduction of hydrogen vehicles for military purposes. The K3 is expected to be equipped with hydrogen fuel cells, advanced electric motors and batteries, making it an environmentally friendly alternative to diesel engines. This innovative system not only reduces emissions, but also allows the tank to operate almost silently, greatly increasing its stealth capabilities, a significant strategic advantage in modern warfare. The expected design of the K3 offers significant performance advantages, including the ability to navigate difficult terrain and steep slopes. In addition to the hydrogen fuel cells, the tank will have a 130 mm smoothbore gun, which is a significant upgrade from the K2's 120 mm gun, improving its firepower. Hyundai Rotem also revealed plans to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into the tank's fire control system. This neural network-based feature aims to improve the K3's aiming and accuracy capabilities, giving it an edge in pre-emptive strikes and rapid threat assessment on the battlefield. Production of the all-hydrogen K3 tank is planned for 2040. As an interim solution, Hyundai Rotem will initially present a hybrid model combining diesel and hydrogen systems. This transition phase will allow the South Korean military to take advantage of some of the benefits of hydrogen technology in preparation for a full transition to this energy source. Hyundai Rotem officials confirmed that this hybrid version will soon be put into service, supporting South Korea's strategic goals of reducing emissions while maintaining reliable military performance. The development of the K3 tank is in line with the wider trend towards the use of hydrogen fuel in the global defense and transport sectors. Hyundai, already recognized for pioneering work in the field of fuel cells, is expanding its expertise in military technology by contributing to the development of hydrogen-based mobile solutions. For example, the company has previously worked with Chinese firm WeRide on autonomous water-powered vehicles. Similarly, in the United States, advances in hydrogen technology are making waves in commercial and military maritime transport, with projects such as -Sea Change-, the first hydrogen ferry approved by the US Coast Guard, which is soon to be launched in San Francisco. A hydrogen fuel cell works by converting hydrogen and oxygen into electricity, water and heat through an electrochemical reaction. It consists of three main components: anode, cathode and electrolyte. The hydrogen stored in the tank is injected into the anode, where it is split into protons and electrons with the help of catalysis. Protons pass through the electrolyte to reach the cathode, while electrons unable to cross the electrolyte travel through the outer circuit, generating a useful electrical current. On the other hand, oxygen, which is normally drawn from the air, ends up at the cathode, where it combines with protons and electrons to form water, a net byproduct of this reaction. This technology, which produces only water and heat, provides a sustainable energy source that does not pollute the environment, ideal for applications in vehicles that require low acoustic and heat signatures, such as stealth military operations. In modern military operations, a hydrogen tank would have significant strategic advantages, particularly in terms of stealth, autonomy and operability in a hostile environment. Due to the low temperature signature, the hydrogen tank would be more difficult to detect by infrared surveillance systems, facilitating discrete maneuvers, night patrols and infiltration into enemy rear areas. The increased autonomy of such military equipment will also allow armored units to penetrate deeper into enemy territory without frequent refueling, which is a valuable opportunity in areas with complex logistics supply chains. In addition, producing only water vapor with no polluting emissions will make the tank resistant to degraded or polluted environments typical of war-torn urban and industrial areas. By reducing dependence on fossil fuels, this type of vehicle will ease logistical requirements and protect supply lines, which are often vulnerable to targeted enemy attacks. Finally, the silent operation of hydrogen technology will provide a decisive advantage for ambushes or defense in wooded or urban areas, allowing the tank to remain undetected until combat. Thus, the hydrogen tank can meet the unique challenges of today's conflict, offering a combination of caution, autonomy and environmental resilience that will greatly enhance operational capabilities on the ground. Projects on the development of hydrogen military vehicles are gaining momentum around the world, although South Korea is at the forefront with its K3 tank. Other countries and defense companies are also exploring the potential of hydrogen for military applications, although efforts are generally less advanced than Hyundai Rotem's. In the United States, the military is evaluating the viability of hydrogen as part of its Next Generation Combat Vehicle program (NGCV). General Motors Defense, for example, has developed a prototype ZH2 , a hydrogen-powered all-terrain vehicle designed for the US Army. This model aims to test the stealth and autonomy of hydrogen technology for defense missions. In addition, BAE Systems and Oshkosh Defense, two major defense contractors, are also exploring hybrid and hydrogen technologies for future applications, although for now they are mainly focused on hybrid vehicles. In Europe, the MGCS (Main Ground Combat System) program, which is detailed told our editors in one of their publications and which jointly led by Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) and Nexter, is the flagship project for the development of the future European main battle tank. However, it is still at the specification stage: hybrid and hydrogen options are being considered to reduce emissions and increase stealth. Rheinmetall, another major player involved in the high-profile project, is also exploring alternative propulsion solutions, but a final decision on the Germans' implementation of hydrogen technology has yet to be made. Japan is also interested in hydrogen fuel cells for armored vehicles through Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The industrial conglomerate is exploring the possibility of using hydrogen technology for its future battle tanks, responding to the Japanese Ministry of Defense's requirements for solutions that increase autonomy while reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is focusing primarily on prototypes and performance testing in difficult terrain to evaluate the applicability of hydrogen in its combat vehicles. Israel is another potential player interested in the benefits of hydrogen for missions that require low acoustic and thermal signatures. Israeli companies such as Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) are conducting research into stealth defense vehicles and are considering alternative power solutions to meet the specific needs of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), although no formal hydrogen programs are currently was launched. Summarizing the analysis of the arms market, it is believed that although several countries and defense companies are actively engaged in research into new power technologies to reduce the impact of military equipment on the environment, few of them have made hydrogen an immediate priority. The Hyundai Rotem K3 project puts South Korea at the forefront of hydrogen-powered battle tank development, offering a roadmap for other countries. This innovation could prompt European, American and Asian players such as BAE Systems, General Motors Defense, KMW, Nexter and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to accelerate their own hydrogen programs as they continue to explore the technology's potential for military realities. The company Hyundai Rotem from the Republic of Korea is engaged in the development of the newest main battle tank K3.

Was -Funny-, but became -Smiley-. The story of a tanker whose life was saved by his mother's call	How to go through the path of an artilleryman, an infantryman and eventually become a tankman in a short period of time, and what advantages the Leopard 1A5 has on the battlefield, a serviceman told the correspondent of ArmiyaInform. Serhii entered the Armed Forces of Ukraine two months before the start of the large-scale invasion — in December 2021. -I wanted to go to the military service. My grandfather told me since childhood that every man should serve. But I didn't have time for the fall draft. And I had a choice. Either wait for the spring of 2022 or go for a contract. I signed the contract,- recalls Smiley. Sergey became an artilleryman in the 72nd separate mechanized brigade. At the beginning of the invasion, he defended Kyiv region. In particular, he participated in the battles for Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel. -The first tangible moment was February 27, 2022. We then worked at the SAU. A rocket flew about 5 meters from her. I don't know what it is, but it's very powerful. I was lucky then. For some reason, I really wanted to call my mother. I left to pick her up, and at that very moment it flew by. A funnel formed 2 by 4 meters,- Smailik recalls. After Kyiv region, there were battles in the East. First in the Bakhmut direction, then in the Ugledar direction. -I received the first wound in the direction of Bakhmut. I was in the infantry at that time. The tank and the BMP worked on our position. A shell hit a tree above us. And the debris hit me. I stayed in the hospital for a week and then came back. Later we were transferred to Ugledar. And there, during one fire contact, a VOG flew behind me from the -undertray-, says Serhiy. After treatment, Serhiy was transferred to mortars. And later he got into the 44th separate mechanized brigade, which was being formed at that time. He was supposed to be a mortarman there, but it turned out differently. -A certain number of people were retrained as tanker drivers. Sent to study in Germany. It lasted for 2 months. After that, they returned, got the equipment and went to Kharkiv region,- says Serhiy. -Smileyk- affectionately calls his car a kitty. He says that at first it was difficult, because everything is new and unclear. However, already during the battles, the tankers quickly gained experience and consolidated their skills: -Already now, when leaving the position, we only need 2 minutes to work out 13 essential shells and then roll back. Most often we work in dugouts and trenches. They worked on tanks, armored personnel carriers, BMPs. A friendly crew once left to work on an enemy tank. They hit with the first shot. It was, I think, a T-90.- All in all, if everything is set up and calibrated correctly, the Leopard 1A5 is a very accurate gun. -We had a moment - at a distance of 3.5 kilometers, our gunner hit a machine gun DOT. The projectile flew right into the window,- recalls Serhiy. In addition, the tank is equipped with high-quality aiming devices, which are also used on the more modern Leopard 2. -Once it happened that they went to work in the Kupyansk direction. We reach the firing position, and the gunner says: -I see a tablet.- That is, he saw in the crosshairs through the night vision system that one of the Russians was sitting and clicking something on the tablet. Well, they started to -pour- right there,- recalls Serhiy. Because of its origin, the tank constantly attracts the attention of the enemy, says -Smileyk-. And as soon as he is noticed, the hunt for him begins. The most enemies are in the sky. In particular, these are FPV drones and Lancets. Although active armor, -barbecues- and EW devices have appeared on the cars, this does not always help. Therefore, tankers try to do everything as quickly as possible. -Leopard 1A5 helps a lot in this regard. They are very maneuverable. Much more -lively- than Soviet tanks. There was a moment when we shot back and the enemy started working on us. We started to roll back. Usually the tank accelerates to 60 kilometers per hour. But here the mechanic-driver gained more speed. He shouts at me: -Smiley, I'm going 67 kilometers!-. In addition to speed and maneuverability, the tank also has armor. In particular, the Leopard 1A5 -Smileyka- withstood the impact of two anti-tank missiles. -Last year, when we were working with direct fire, 2 ATGMs flew into the -mask- on the tower. But the tank survived. We were still able to leave on it. The crew was injured. But everyone survived,- Serhiy says. During Serhiy's service, not only his specialty changed, but also his call sign. At first, while in the infantry, he received the nickname -Funny-. Although the situation at that time was not at all fun, says a serviceman: -We are lying in a trench, and they are working on us with everything they have. It was so scary that it was a slipper. Also, in the morning and until the evening, the enemy constantly tried to approach in order to engage in fire contact. Well, I thought that it was necessary to at least somehow raise the spirits of my fellow citizens. And he began to make various jokes about the fact that the Russians still cannot hit us. Then they told me I was funny. And that's how it stuck. And when I was transferred to mortars, they asked for my call sign. He said that -Funny-. But there was a foreman who called him something else - -Smiley-. -Smailyk- speaks succinctly, but without hesitation, about his motivation to serve in the ZSU: -I would rather be here than the enemy would be at my home.- I would rather die than have the enemy do anything to my family. No one here fights for deputies, politicians. Everyone fights to protect their family.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/11/buv-smishnyj-a-stav-smajlykom-istoriya-tankista-yakomu-vryatuvav-zhyttya-dzvinok-materi/	2024-12-10T20:32:32-08:00
The situation is under control: the Russian army simply imagined that it had breached the border in ...	In fact, this information is not true, and the situation at the border remains under control. Andriy Demchenko, the spokesman of the State Security Service of Ukraine, stated this on the air of the Kyiv24 TV channel: -The positions held by the border guards are not located directly along the border line. But if we talk about that aspect, then the border units did not record any attempts to enter, nor any attempts at hostilities. The area there is characterized by wetlands, so it will be difficult for the enemy to gain a foothold there or develop their actions.- Andriy Demchenko noted that directly on the territory of Russia, in the Kursk region, the enemy is trying to advance in order to knock our forces out of their positions. The Sumy OVA also denied the information about the alleged -breach of the border- by the Russians: -Currently, there are no data from the military regarding the change in the situation at the border, the situation is under control,- said the head of the administration, Volodymyr Artyukh. It should always be remembered that the border line with Russia is actually the front line, where our Defense Forces hold their positions to counter any enemy attempts to enter our territory. The Defense Forces of Ukraine call on citizens to trust only official sources of information and not to succumb to enemy manipulations aimed at destabilizing the situation in the region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/11/sytuacziya-kontrolovana-prosto-armiya-rf-uyavyla-shho-prorvala-kordon-na-sumshhyni/	2024-12-10T20:12:58-08:00
Membership in the EU, frozen assets of the Russian Federation and the Air Defense Forces: the Presid...	About December 10, the Office of the President informs. The head of state thanked the European Parliament and the European Council for the financial and political support of Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion. -Yesterday's allocation of 4.1 billion euros for Ukraine for this year within the limits of the Ukraine Facility program is very important for us. We are also looking forward to an €18 billion macro-financial loan for Ukraine. For us, such decisions are very important. All the political decisions that were supported by the majority of the European Parliament during these almost three years were very important for us,- the President said. During the meeting, they discussed military support, as well as the strengthening of air defenses to protect people and critical infrastructure facilities in Ukraine from Russian attacks. One of the key topics of the negotiations is the use of frozen Russian assets for the benefit of defense needs and the strengthening of air defense, because this directly helps to bring a just peace for Ukraine and the whole world closer. Particular attention was paid to the progress of Ukraine on the way to EU membership. -Our goal is to be closer to the EU as soon as possible. We are aiming at the active adoption of the necessary laws and the implementation of reforms,- ​​Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. Iraçe García Perec emphasized that it is important to continue military, financial and humanitarian support to Ukraine. -We know how important this is to all of us. You are defending your country and our shared values, freedom. We know how important it is to continue working in this direction,- she said. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov also -proyektiv-z-yes/->met with deputies of the group -Progressive Alliance socialists and democrats-. They discussed ways of consolidating international support for Ukraine, promoting the development of joint projects with the EU, in particular, between the Ukrainian and European defense industries.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/chlenstvo-v-yes-zamorozheni-aktyvy-rf-i-ppo-prezydent-zustrivsya-z-delegacziyeyu-yevroparlamentu/	2024-12-10T12:06:19-08:00

The horrors of the occupation in Izyum: two Russians who tortured the mother of a Ukrainian law enfo...	The Office of the Prosecutor General informs about this on December 10. The suspects are the assistant shooter of the grenade launcher of the 1st rifle division of the 3rd rifle platoon of the 1st rifle platoon of the 3rd rifle company of the 204th rifle battalion of the -DNR- regiment and the commander of the intelligence group 607 of the special purpose center of the North Caucasus District of the Federal Service of the National Guard of the Russian Federation. According to the investigation, in July 2022 in Izyum, the suspects together with other occupants broke into the house where a woman - the mother of an active Ukrainian law enforcement officer - lived. They detained her and took her to the torture chamber set up on the territory of the railway hospital. -DNR militant systematically raped a woman and committed sexual acts against her. In addition, he exerted psychological pressure on the woman: he threatened to kill her, as well as strip her completely, tie her in the square, take a photo and send the photo to his son, a law enforcement officer,- the report states. During one of the interrogations, the occupiers attached wires to the victim's legs and turned on the current. The victim was in severe physical pain, fell to the floor several times, but was forced to stand up and repeatedly shocked. -Also, the occupiers put handcuffs on the woman's hands, a gas mask on her face, hung her handcuffs from the ceiling and beat her with a belt. The suspects held the victim in a torture chamber from July 1 to July 10, 2022. During the period of illegal imprisonment due to the inflicted mental injuries, the woman attempted suicide,- the law enforcement officers said.

-For money? No!-: a woman from Lviv tried to pay a bribe for illegal travel abroad	About this reports State Border Service of Ukraine. The woman was looking for clients on the Internet, offering her services for an amount from 7 to 10 thousand US dollars. One of these clients was a 43-year-old man from Lviv who was planning to leave for Spain. The organizer received $10,000 from him and promised to assist in illegal border crossing. The woman planned to hand over part of the money, namely 7 thousand dollars, to the border guard of the 7th Carpathian border detachment. However, the employee refused the bribe and reported the crime to the competent authorities. The organizer was detained while trying to transfer money.

Occupation budget: -lnr- exists at the expense of Russian handouts	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. According to the draft budget, the revenues of the so-called -LNR- are planned to be 144.8 billion rubles. Of these, 92.6 billion rubles, or almost two-thirds, are interbudgetary transfers from the Russian budget. The rest of the income, including subsidies and subsidies, provides only a little more than 50 billion rubles. The largest source of own revenues remains the tax on the income of individuals - it forms 83.4% of this part of the budget. However, the arrival of investors that could improve the economic situation has not yet been observed. In addition, the Russian authorities established control over the housing and communal economy of the occupied Luhansk Region. Until 2028, non-governmental organizations are prohibited from managing apartment buildings. All functions in this area have been transferred to Russian state organizations, despite the possible objections of local residents. These facts once again demonstrate that the occupied territories remain economically unsustainable and completely dependent on external funding from Russia. As reported by ArmyInform, in occupied Aydar (former Novopskov) ->Russian troops continue raids and restrict exit from the settlement. In particular, three exits from the city remain closed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/okupaczijnyj-byudzhet-lnr-isnuye-za-rahunok-rosijskyh-podachok/	2024-12-10T10:47:40-08:00

The overthrow of the Assad regime in Syria: significance for Ukraine	This is how the more than half-century rule of the Assad family ended in Syria and one of the important stages of the civil war that has been going on since 2011. About the significance of the overthrow of the Assad regime for Ukraine, we talk to Oleksandr Chupak, an expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Studies-: -Syrian opposition forces succeeded in triumphantly realizing -Aleppo in three days- and -Damascus in eleven days-. They drove the Assad family out of the country, which had held power for 53 years. Syria was and remains a theater of war, where two states hostile to Ukraine are actively involved: Russia and Iran. They have both invested significant resources in Syria, making it a testing ground for modern warfare tactics. However, recently the focus of their attention has shifted to other directions: Russia has stalled on the fronts against Ukraine, and Iran is waging an active proxy war against Israel. In fact, in Syria, the scenario of Afghanistan in 2021 was repeated, when the hopes of the foreign contingent on the local armed forces completely failed. In the case of Syria, the government troops surrendered the territories to the opposition even faster than the Afghans to the Taliban,- says Oleksandr Chupak. Russia, the main ally of the Assad regime, did not provide him with the necessary assistance at a critical moment. Despite the fact that Putin threatened in 2017 that -if the terrorists raise their heads, we will deal them such blows that they have not seen before,- and Moscow Patriarch Kirill said in 2015 that -the Russian operation in Syria will lead the Russian Federation away from any - what evil-. Now, apparently, evil has approached the Russian Federation again. -For Russia, Syria is an important logistics center, in fact, the only unimpeded exit to the Mediterranean Sea through the port of Tartus. This path guarantees Moscow access to the Balkans and North Africa, where Muscovites traditionally have a significant presence. Depriving Russia of Syrian ports would mean weakening, if not losing, its contact with spheres of influence in the said territories. And while the Russian-Ukrainian war continues, the Kremlin will not have access to the Mediterranean either through the Bosphorus or through Gibraltar. The failure in Syria is evidence that the war against Ukraine is draining Russian resources. In previous years, it was the presence of Moscow's private military companies with air support that allowed Assad's army to control most of the major cities without any apparent risk of losing them. Now, due to the need to transfer forces to Ukraine, the government army is left alone against its enemies. There is a widespread opinion that the elimination of Yevgeny Prigozhin, formerly the main organizer of the Russian PMK, was fatal for the Syrian contingent. Of course, the failure in Syria does not mean that Russia will immediately fall on other fronts. However, it demonstrates that the Russian military machine is not all-powerful and is capable of collapsing under the blows of well-armed and organized troops. The logical continuation of the Syrian scenario should be the expulsion of Russia from other places where it has a military presence: Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Africa and, ultimately, from the territories occupied by it, which are now part of the Russian Federation (Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, and many others).- Oleksandr Chupak notes. Now the events in Syria are developing dynamically - the Russians are withdrawing their troops, and Israeli armored units, on the contrary, have crossed the demarcation line on the Golan Heights and are advancing towards Damascus. Oleksandr Chupak is sure that the establishment of a Western-friendly regime in Syria will contribute to the establishment of trade in energy carriers between the countries of the Persian Gulf, Turkey and Europe. And the laying of the pipeline here will allow many countries to finally abandon Russian oil.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/povalennya-rezhymu-asada-v-syriyi-znachennya-dlya-ukrayiny/	2024-12-10T09:01:17-08:00

Electric current, pipes and threats: a Ukrainian woman tricked the people of Akhmativ and escaped fr...	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. This time it is about Magomed Uzdorbiyev, a fighter of the special rapid reaction unit of the Rosguard -Akhmat-. At the beginning of the full-scale war, his unit took part in the capture of the village of Makiivka, Svativ district, Luhansk region. In order to establish an occupation regime there, the Rashists carried out so-called -clearances-, which were accompanied by the kidnapping of local residents and the looting of private property. According to the investigation, on April 12, 2022, a group of -Kadyrivets-, which included Uzdorbiev, broke into the residence of the local headman. After the occupiers found patriotic pro-Ukrainian photos on her computer, they tied the woman up and took her to a torture chamber set up in a captured gymnasium on the territory of the community. In the cells, Uzdorbiev together with his accomplices tortured the victim with electric current and beat her with a metal plastic pipe. Then the Rashists kept the woman handcuffed to the battery for several hours. During the torture, the -Kadyrov- demanded that she provide them with the residential addresses of the families of Ukrainian defenders. Also, the person involved -knocked out- from the victim information about the places where she hid the Ukrainian flags that she took from the gymnasium during the capture of the village. Late in the evening, the occupiers let the woman go home so that she could collect the -necessary- information for them under the threat of death within a two-day period. However, the victims managed to secretly get out of the village to the territory controlled by Ukraine, without providing the occupiers with any information about the Ukrainian soldiers and their families. Forensic medical examination confirmed that the victims suffered severe injuries as a result of torture. On the basis of the received evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed Uzdorbiev of the suspicion for h. 2 Art. 28, ch. 1 Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (cruel treatment of the civilian population and other violations of the laws and customs of war committed by a group of persons in a previous conspiracy). Comprehensive measures are underway to find and punish the war criminal.

The horror of Syrian torture camps: the President of Ukraine compared the regimes of Assad and Putin	He wrote about this in his Telegram channel. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the Assad regime relied exclusively on violence for decades, and Russia uses the same methods. The President emphasized that the Russian occupiers created similar torture chambers and prisons in every occupied territory of Ukraine. Atrocities began in Crimea in 2014, when repressions affected Crimean Tatars, journalists and politicians. Later, similar practices spread to Donbas, in particular in the infamous Isolation prison, and after a large-scale invasion in 2022, they became even larger and more brutal. The president emphasized that Assad and Putin are not just vassals and overlords, but accomplices in violence. Dictators like Assad cannot survive without the support of dictators like Putin, who, according to Volodymyr Zelenskyi, will surely seek revenge for the fall of Assad. -There must be punishment for terrible atrocities and violations of human rights. In fact, Putin and Assad should end up in prison, not those innocent people whom they have been imprisoning for years,- the head of state emphasized. The President called on the international community to unite and support Ukraine in the fight against the Russian dictatorship, stressing that this will help protect other regions of the world from violence. As reported by ArmyInform, for the retreat from the Syrian Republic Russians attracted a caravan of military transport ships, on which the remnants of troops, weapons and military equipment are loaded techniques	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/zhahy-syrijskyh-kativen-prezydent-ukrayiny-porivnyav-rezhymy-asada-i-putina/	2024-12-10T06:49:26-08:00

Not an army, but a rallying point: The occupiers are fighting on the margins, needlessly with prison...	About this on the broadcast of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- the spokesman of the OTU -Kharkiv- told - lieutenant colonel Yevhenii Romanov. According to Yevgeny Romanov, it's all because they are trying to advance where their artillery and aviation have already worked. It is difficult for them to maintain defense in these destroyed areas. The defense forces, on the other hand, effectively destroy the attack aircraft. -It is very difficult for them to bring ammunition supplies there. Replace people. Evacuation of the wounded. The dead are not even mentioned. And getting new forces there is another task, since they move on foot, they do not use armored vehicles,- said the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU. Armored vehicles are not used, in particular, also because this resource is limited. As is the human resource. -Professional soldiers are worn out in 10 years of war. They already use such a resource that they have caught or lured with money, collected from prisons. This is not an army, this is a meeting place,- Yevgeny Romanov said. Earlier ArmyInform reported, in the Kharkiv direction, the enemy is storming in the districts of Staritsa, Tykhoi, Vovchansk and in the direction Cossack Lopan.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/ne-vijsko-a-zbigovysko-okupanty-voyuyut-marginalamy-nepotrebom-z-tyurem-ta-pivnichnoyi-koreyi/	2024-12-10T06:11:47-08:00
Losing contact and getting lost: how Russians avoid participating in -meat-attacks	This was reported on the Army TV stream by the commander of the fire support company of the 5th Kyiv Assault Brigade Mykola Zinko. -Very often such interceptions happen, when the Russians refuse to go on the attack, and they are forced. They say that they will be -zeroed- if they go back. Such people later get lost somewhere, turn off their walkie-talkies, they try to find them, because if one does not leave, the others also start to refuse,- said Mykola Zinko. According to him, Russians are greatly affected by the sad fate of those who went on assaults earlier. -They understand that the previous group went to the same end, we destroyed it, that's why their motivation disappears,- Mykola Zinko said. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 5th assault Kyiv brigade repelled a foot assault of the occupiers in the Pokrovsky direction. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/ne-vyhodyty-na-zvyazok-i-zagubytysya-yak-rosiyany-unykayut-uchasti-u-myasnyh-shturmah/	2024-12-10T05:52:19-08:00

According to Oleksandr Borodin, the occupiers' grinding of their units in senseless attacks are not separate episodes. This is a conscious strategy. -It should be understood that this is along the entire length of the front - they are trying to beat exhaustion in this way. And they developed such a reserve mechanism. This is how they built the production of both drones and ammunition in order to constantly take endurance. And see who can hold out longer,- said Oleksandr Borodin. How to ->reported ArmyInform, it is steadily difficult in Kharkiv Oblast—the enemy is rushing the banks of Oskol and Borov.

Checking the roads several times a day: how our fighters fight remote enemy mining	This was reported on the Army TV stream by the commander of the fire support company of the 5th Kyiv Assault Brigade Mykola Zinko. -Very often the Russians use FPV drones to mine our logistics. Enemy drones simply land on the road with ammunition. It can even be a TM-ka (anti-tank mine). But here our sappers work perfectly, and those areas where our logistics routes pass, they pass several times a day,- said Mykola Zinko. According to him, there are also enemy drones that drop -petal- mines on the roads. -They are anti-personnel, but their explosion is quite enough to puncture a tire and the like,- remarked Mykola Zinko. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 5th Kyiv assault brigade hit a Russian bomber RBU-6000 -Smerch-2- in the Kramatorsk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/perevirka-dorig-po-kilka-raziv-na-dobu-yak-nashi-bijczi-boryutsya-z-dystanczijnym-minuvannyam-voroga/	2024-12-10T02:23:29-08:00
Hit in the head - our drones hit either a very dumb or a deaf occupier	The video of combat work was released on December 10 on the brigade's channel. Two Russian soldiers were walking along the road when our FPV drone flew up to them. For some reason, the occupiers did not try to react to him at all: they did not run away and did not evade. Then the drone was able to fly up and hit one of the Russians directly in the head. The second invader, not at all impressed (in every sense of the word), simply moved on. -Sudden death overtook the occupier,- the brigade commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, in the 68th hunting brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush demonstrated three cases of powerful explosions, which sappers were supposed to make it difficult for the enemy to advance.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/udarylo-v-golovu-nashi-dronari-urazyly-abo-duzhe-tupogo-abo-gluhogo-okupanta/	2024-12-10T02:04:14-08:00
Panic escape - for evacuation from Syria, the Russians brought in a whole caravan of planes	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on December 10. Several An-124 and Il-76MD aircraft are scheduled to fly from the Khmeimim airbase on routes to the Ulyanovsk, Chkalovsky and Privolzhsky airfields. Also, the aggressor state attracts additional fleet objects: in particular, the city of Baltiysk was ordered to prepare the dry cargo ship Sparta II and the large landing ship -Alexander Shabalin- for the departure to Tartus. The large amphibious ships of the Northern Fleet of Russia -Alexander Otrakovsky- and -Ivan Green- headed for the Mediterranean Sea. The enemy frigates -Admiral Gorshkov- and -Admiral Golovko- are also participating in the -Syrian retreat- operation. In the port of Tartusa, the Russians are carrying out emergency dismantling of equipment and military property. Several hundred Russian special forces have already arrived there to ensure the safety of the retreat. Probably, the aggressor state is counting on agreements with anti-government forces regarding an unimpeded exit from Syria. Even the representatives of the so-called Moscow diplomacy no longer call the rebel groups against the Assad regime -terrorists-, but demonstrate a neutral, even -sweet- public rhetoric. Meanwhile, frustration and oppression continue among the remnants of the Russian contingent in Syria - Muscovites even express dissatisfaction with their leaders and commanders, in particular with their organizational incompetence.

Mykola Volokhov, commander, told about this on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- of the -Terra- unit of the 3rd separate assault brigade According to Mykola Volokhov, it is quite normal for the Russians to spend dozens of people to try to capture a normal landing. -The armored vehicles are on fire, the infantry is going to the ground. Unfortunately, the enemy has an extremely large resource. And he does not regret it, it happens that the platoon, and sometimes the company. So that you understand, an infantry platoon is 30 people, an infantry company is 100 people,- said Mykola Volokhov. For the enemy, his infantry is expendable. The enemy command can kill its stormtroopers just to check something. -Just to see what it will be like. If, for example, you try to swim across that Oskil. Try to swim in different ways. Look. And if those infantry are lost, they believe that this is the normal state of affairs,- said the commander of the Terra unit of the 3rd separate assault brigade.

In Cherkasy region, they wanted to throw bombs at a wounded soldier and his volunteer wife	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on December 10. According to the results of a special operation in the region, a criminal group was neutralized, which tried to blow up volunteers right in their house with the help of improvised explosive devices. According to the case materials, the motive for the attempt was the refusal of the victims to pay the fictitious debt for repair work in their house. To commit the crime, the perpetrators prepared 4 improvised explosive devices, which they equipped with gunpowder, nuts and ignition cords. In the future, they planned to throw explosives into the bedroom where the volunteers were supposed to rest. The security service exposed the criminal group in time and arrested two of its members red-handed when they were preparing to break into the victims' homes. During the searches, improvised explosive devices, components for making explosives and mobile phones with evidence of the crime were seized from the suspects. Currently, two organizers of the group have already been notified of suspicion under part. 3 Art. 15, ch. 2 Art. 115 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (premeditated murder committed by a group of persons according to a prior conspiracy). Their accomplice is also suspected. The perpetrators are in custody. They face life imprisonment with confiscation of property.

-Half a hundred of those who are not spared are thrown to the ground-: the enemy does not stop storm...	Oleksandr Danylenko, head of group of interaction with the media of the brigade of the State Border Service -Hart-. According to Oleksandr Danylenko, it is absolutely impossible to let them do this. After all, if the occupiers cross the Vovcha River, it will create the prerequisites for their further advance in the Kupyan direction. And that is why there are constant assaults in Vovchansk. -About ten every day. And the enemy attacks in small groups, and so-called meat assaults. They throw, relatively speaking, half a hundred of those who don't feel sorry for it - and maybe they will manage to capture some such locations,- said the head of the media interaction group of the State Border Service -Hart- brigade. If such one-time attack aircraft manage to capture positions, follow them more professional fighters are coming. -They are covered by artillery, mortars, and the same drones. But these attempts are unsuccessful, unsuccessful. The enemy is trying to make his way through the ruins of what is left of the city, but they are already waiting for him,- assured Oleksandr Danylenko. How ArmyInform reported that the situation in the Vovchan direction is stable and tense.

Fake diagnoses, bogus marriages, personal escorts - the most popular schemes of crossing the border ...	The State Bureau of Investigation reported this on December 10. Statistics of criminal proceedings show that illegal schemes for transporting people across the state border are mainly created by officials, employees of the TCC, MSEK, doctors and law enforcement officers. Most often, criminals use the mechanism of removal from military registration due to fake diagnoses of unfitness for military service. Also, the employees of the DBR began to identify cases where they tried to make money from conscripts directly at the checkpoints. Personal escort services to the border, sham marriages, etc. appeared. During the investigation of such proceedings, only the amount of documented bribes amounted to UAH 11.4 million. In fact, the amounts are much higher and will be established during the investigation. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/pidrobleni-diagnozy-lypovi-odruzhennya-osobystyj-suprovid-nazvani-najpopulyarnishi-shemy-perepravlennya-cherez-kordon/	2024-12-09T23:46:58-08:00

The most famous Middle Eastern -heavyweight-: Israeli gunsmiths improve their drone	As stated in a statement on the official portal of this aerospace giant, combining UAV characteristics and missiles, the Harop has long been a formidable barrage munition equipped to hunt high-value targets such as unmanned surface ships, command points, supply depots, tanks and air defense systems, ArmyInform reports. Using an electro-optical homing head and no pre-reconnaissance plans, the Harop has a 9-hour airborne endurance to search for targets in a defined area, locate and identify them, plan an attack route, and then strike from any direction, shallow or steep diving At the same time, according to the data developers of kamikaze drones, Harop overcomes difficulties in communicating with control points thanks to its immunity to GNSS jamming. As a guided weapon system, Harop is controlled by man-in-the-loop remote control and its combat mission can be interrupted if necessary. Launched from containers mounted on trucks or naval vessels, the Harop is easily deployed in a variety of terrains and environments. One of the key features of the Harop is its homing system. It is equipped with electro-optical and infrared sensors that allow you to find targets in difficult weather conditions and at night. As soon as the target is identified, the drone heads towards it, destroying it by detonating the built-in warhead. AI Harop has impressive technical parameters that make it versatile: — Flight range: up to 1000 km. — Flight time: 6 hours. — Maximum speed: 417 km/h. — Weight of the warhead: 16 kg. - Hit accuracy: less than 5 meters error. These characteristics make the Harop effective against a wide range of targets, including radars, command posts, armored vehicles and ships. IAI Harop has already entered the armed forces of countries such as Israel, India, Azerbaijan, Singapore and Morocco. Its capabilities are valued for high accuracy and flexibility in modern warfare. In addition to the basic version, there is a smaller Mini Harop model, which is designed for tasks at shorter distances and is more compact. Barrage munitions such as the Harop are becoming increasingly popular due to their cost effectiveness. Unlike traditional missiles or drones, these UAVs are able to stay in the conflict zone for a long time, waiting for the right opportunity to strike. This greatly increases their tactical value. Barrage munitions, such as Harop, are becoming part of a global trend towards the development of autonomous weapons systems. They provide a strategic advantage on the battlefield, minimizing personnel risks and increasing the accuracy of strikes. In the coming years, it can be expected that their use will only expand and technologies will improve, making these systems an even more important part of the arsenals of the leading military states.

Danish F-16s — after Syria to Ukraine: where they fought - Fighting Falcons - Royal Air Force	Where the Danish F-16 Fighting Falcon multi-purpose fighter jets managed to fight before reaching Ukraine, ArmyInform reminds. The first serial -Fighting Falcons- entered service with the Royal Danish Air Force in the spring of 1980. Gradually, they replaced the already significantly outdated at that time second-generation fighters F-100 D/F Super Saber and F-104 Starfighter. By the mid-1980s, they were adopted by four squadrons - 727 and 730 at Skrudstrup Air Base and 723 and 726 at Aalborg Air Base. Subsequently, in 2005, all Danish Fighting Falcons were assembled into 727 and 730 squadrons at Skrudstrup air base. Before the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the main task of the Danish F-16 was the protection of the territory of Denmark and integrated participation in the defense of the countries of Western Europe within the framework of NATO's general strategy. Since the 1990s, the set of tasks of the Royal Danish Air Force has changed significantly. In 1999, the Royal Danish Air Force was reorganized into an -expeditionary- force capable of supporting international operations around the world. Danish combat and transport aircraft began to be deployed and used in a number of international military operations. For the first time, F-16s of the Royal Danish Air Force took part in the NATO bloc's military operation -Allied Force- during the war in Kosovo on the territory of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The operation lasted from March 24 to June 10, 1999 and became the final stage of the Kosovo War. During it, F-16s became the first military aircraft of the Royal Danish Air Force to take direct part in combat operations. At that time, a total of nine F-16 fighters of the Royal Danish Air Force from the 730 squadron took part in the mission of missile-bombing of military facilities on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Before, during and after Operation Allied Force, units from all four squadrons of the Royal Danish Air Force visited the Balkans. Denmark's combat aircraft were based at the Italian Grazzanise Air Base. Soon, Danish F-16s took part in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. In this operation against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in 2001-2003, six -Fighting Falcons- from the 727th squadron took part. Taking off from the territory of Kyrgyzstan, they carried out 743 missions, conducting reconnaissance and bombing terrorist targets. It was at this time that the F-16s proved their unique ability to rapidly deploy and be based almost anywhere in the world. The infrastructure of the airfields (Ganchi, Manas, Kant) of the former Soviet republic, and then also of Afghanistan, turned out to be quite suitable and sufficient for the placement of these fighters. After the accession of the Baltic states to NATO, F-16 fighters of the Royal Danish Air Force took part in patrolling the airspace of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania within the Baltic Air Policing. Based at the Šiauliai International Airport in Lithuania, from July to October 2004, five Battle Falcons flew 48 sorties defending the new members of the North Atlantic Alliance. Subsequently, Danish F-16s took part in the surveillance and protection of the airspace of the Baltic States also in 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2014, and also patrolled the airspace over Iceland in 2009, 2010 and 2015. In 2009, Danish fighters flew over Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Iceland at the same time. In 2011, six Danish F-16s from 727 and 730 squadrons took part in NATO's joint operation -Unified Protector- in Libya. Being stationed at the Sigonella Air Base in Sicily, the fighters of the Royal Danish Air Force flew 599 sorties from March 20 to October 31, 2011, dropping 923 high-precision guided aerial bombs on military targets. In just the first 12 days of the initial Odyssey Dawn operation, Danish F-16s flew 41 sorties and dropped 102 bombs. In total, during Operation Unified Protector, the Danish -Battle Falcons- flew approximately 1,300 sorties. This was about 5% of the total sorties by NATO aircraft, which flew a total of 26,435 sorties. The last combat mission of the Danish F-16 before arriving in Ukraine was the participation in the operation -Inherent Resolve- against the Islamic State (ISIS) in Iraq and Syria. From October 2014 to October 2015, seven Combat Falcons from Denmark were based at Ahmed Al-Jaber Airfield in Kuwait, flying 547 sorties over Iraq and dropping 503 aerial bombs. In the next phase of the fight against ISIS, seven Danish F-16s operated over Iraq and Syria, based at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. From June 17 to October 5, 2016, fighters of the Royal Danish Air Force flew 166 sorties, striking 231 targets. After the Royal Danish Air Force adopted the Combat Falcons, progress significantly accelerated, software and hardware made a significant leap. This led to the need for a technological upgrade of the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The Danish F-16s have undergone significant modernization, largely carried out in cooperation with Danish industry. The Fighting Falcons were updated under the Mid-Life Update program, designed to maintain the effectiveness of existing aircraft in the middle of their service life. Thanks to this, the aircraft that Denmark handed over to Ukraine are significantly technologically improved. Engine improvements give them more power while using less fuel, and new and updated instruments and weapon systems provide better pilotability and weapon accuracy in difficult combat conditions. Currently, even a relatively small number of F-16 Fighting Falcon available in the Air Force of Ukraine -povitryanyh-czilej-zbyly-bojovi-sokoly/->makes a significant contribution to airspace protection country. Thanks to Denmark, the increase in the number of Ukrainian -Combat Falcons- will be able to significantly increase the effectiveness of these combat aircraft in the Ukrainian sky.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/danski-f-16-pislya-syriyi-do-ukrayiny-de-voyuvaly-bojovi-sokoly-korolivskyh-povitryanyh-syl/	2024-12-09T21:01:26-08:00
-I came to the TCC, although I had armor-: about repelling the attack of 15 invaders and the -repair...	How did you manage to repulse the assault near Nevsky in the winter of 2023? But who else from Valery's family has also now joined the defense of Ukraine? The sergeant told our correspondent about this: -I myself came to my TCC on March 6, 2022. Although I, as a railwayman, had armor. Two months passed and my eldest son followed me to serve. From our family, now we are both fighting. I can remember one of the combat episodes. It was in February 2023. It was necessary to repel the attack of the assault group, where there were a lot of occupiers. It was near Nevsky in Donetsk region. At that time, we had already been in those positions for a month. Constant shelling, assaults&#8230; That day again, before the assault, there was heavy shelling. We saw a group of 15 people. They opened fire from small arms on them. At the same time, we adjusted our mortars, they helped us a lot then. The enemy has never attacked us with such a number at the same time. But then we fought back. Although the enemy managed to approach us by 50 meters. In general, during that period it was such that we lost some positions, but over time we still repelled them. And when another unit replaced us, we transferred all the positions we had taken at the beginning, we did not lose a single one. During all this time, I had many injuries. The last time the air ambulance came, it damaged my inner ear, ruptured the eardrum. But already more or less, the doctors repaired it. Now I have transferred to the management of the company as a material support sergeant. Because over time the commander saw in me a manager. In general, before the large-scale invasion, I was a civilian, working on the railways since 2009. He started as a track fitter, then an engineer, and when he entered the war, he was the chief mechanic of the enterprise. Maybe that's why they transferred me to the office, because they saw that I can work with documents and people. I am currently serving as the Battalion Headquarters Logistics Group Officer.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/ya-pryjshov-do-tczk-hocha-j-mav-bron-pro-vidbyttya-ataky-15-okupantiv-ta-vidremontovane-vuho-serzhanta-zaliznychnyka/	2024-12-09T20:31:44-08:00
Kremlin media attacks on the Armed Forces: why the enemy continuously demonizes Ukrainian soldiers	In the draft state budget of the Russian Federation for 2025, more than 137 billion rubles ($1.4 billion) is provided for financing state propaganda, which is 13% more than this year. For comparison: in 2023, this amount was 58 billion rubles ($500 million). Propagandists on different platforms tailor their messages to their target audience. For example, some sites use emotional and negative language, which grossly violates journalistic standards. At the same time, more restrained lexemes and constructions are applied to others. This variety of communication approaches caters to the needs of different categories of readers: for some, open language of hostility is presented, for others, more veiled rhetoric. However, identical messages and images aimed at discrediting Ukraine and Ukrainians are consistently promoted on all platforms. Russian media often -attack- soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Their messages are almost always accompanied by aggressive clarifications about -Nazism- or demonize the fighters, which contributes to the formation of a negative image. In addition to dehumanizing the image of the Ukrainian military, the Russians fuel the rhetoric of -victims- by constantly generating different stories with the same scenarios, where it seems that the Ukrainian military kills, abuses, affects mothers with children, etc. This cements in the mind of the domestic consumer a persistent association that armed forces and violence are identical. Thus, over the past few days, Russian sources have been circulating new batches of fakes about the alleged killings by the Ukrainian military of civilians in Donbas and throwing bodies into wells, about the destruction of drinking water sources, the destruction of churches, etc. Propagandists, of course, do not provide any evidence for these stories. All these publications refer either to the -testimony- of the Russian military, or to the words of residents of the occupied territories, who recount something that they seem to have heard from others. The purpose of such fakes is to discredit the Defense Forces of Ukraine and an attempt to justify their own numerous war crimes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/10/ataky-kremlivskyh-media-na-zsu-dlya-chogo-vorog-bezperervno-demonizuye-ukrayinskyh-voyiniv/	2024-12-09T20:16:22-08:00

Volodymyr Zelenskyi commented on the events in Syria and the presence of Wagnerites in Africa	The head of state wrote about this on December 9 in social networks. -Assad's regime fell not only because of the strength of the opposition. This also happened because there are not enough Russian troops there. Why? Because the entire combat-ready Russian army is on the territory of Ukraine. And this says precisely that the entire army of this pseudo-empire is fighting against the Ukrainian people today,- he assured. According to him, the same is already happening in Africa. -We know that the Wagnerites were there. And we know how many -Wagnerians- were destroyed in Ukraine. -Russia wants its regimes in Africa, which would influence the African continent, and for this they used the Wagnerites,- the President noted. In his opinion, that is why it is very important today that all countries that value a world without war and security - European countries, the United States, other countries of the world, world leaders - understand this perspective: now and right here, a lot is being decided. -The strength of Ukraine depends on whether the Russian army is strong. Because if Ukraine falls, Putin will return to Syria to take revenge, and to Africa, and to many other regions that interest him. And it seems to me that this is the most important thing that everyone should understand: in this union around Ukraine, success is the general success of the world,- he summarized.

Separately, they discussed the urgent needs of Ukrainian soldiers, the staffing of brigades and the possibility of Estonia's participation in the purchase of defense products from domestic manufacturers. This will help strengthen Ukraine on the battlefield and bring a just and lasting peace closer. -We thank your country very much for the fact that you are very forthright and speak very clearly about Ukraine's future both in the EU and in NATO,- the President noted. The meeting also discussed Ukraine's progress on the path to joining the EU and the importance of reaching a consensus among allies on the invitation to NATO.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked for the invitation and noted that Ukraine has every reason to become a member of this important organization. The Prime Minister of Estonia assured that his country and people will continue to support Ukraine in all possible ways, because they consider Russia a common enemy. -We made it clear: Ukraine is part of Europe and should be part of NATO. Because if we want to have a just and lasting peace, we need both. Because if Putin wins and changes the borders by force, it will send a signal to, for example, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and everyone else to continue doing similar things. So for Europe, what Ukraine is doing is a struggle for the freedom of Europe, and also for the freedom of the entire democratic world,- said Kristen Michal.

We are counting on stronger, decisive actions by Germany from you personally,- the head of state said. The President noted friendly relations between Ukraine and Germany. In particular, this is confirmed by recent negotiations with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Kyiv and a meeting with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier in Paris. Volodymyr Zelenskyi and Friedrich Mertz discussed increasing the financing of military aid to Ukraine for the next year. This is critically necessary to protect lives in Ukraine, as the country suffers from Russian strikes every day, and every show of support saves lives. The increase in aid also directly strengthens Ukraine's position to bring a just and credible peace closer. One of the key topics of the meeting is the Victory Plan. The parties agreed that Ukraine can be strengthened by long-range capabilities and an invitation to NATO, and the achievement of a just peace will have an impact on global security. Ukraine's integration into the EU, ensuring unity in Europe and its role in strengthening Ukraine were also discussed.

The head of state announced that the visit of the Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of National Unity of Ukraine Oleksiy Chernyshov to Berlin is already planned. Friedrich Merz noted that there is an intense debate in Germany about the details of military support and what kind of weapons to transfer to Ukraine, but there is a consensus in principle about providing aid to end the war and establish a just peace. -The position of our faction is clear: we want to give your Armed Forces the ability to reach military bases - not the civilian population and infrastructure, but so that you can achieve the very objectives from which the war against your country is being waged. I spoke about this a few weeks ago in the Bundestag. By limiting the range of weapons, we force you to fight with one hand behind your back,- he emphasized.

Provision of the largest army in Europe: the DOT spoke about the results of the work	Arsen Zhumadilov, general director of the Procurement Agency of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine -State rear operator-. According to Arsen Zhumadilov, this result is due to the fact that the agency managed to build the right procurement process. As it should be. -We have planning, we have normal interaction with the consumer, on the one hand. On the other hand, we have interaction with the market. This means that we understand exactly what the consumer needs and when, and we place appropriate orders in a timely manner through the Prozorro electronic procurement system,- he said. According to the general director of the -State rear operator-, they provide the largest army in Europe, one of the largest in the world. It is a very large system in itself, in which there are many components. Now the agency has signed contracts for the total amount of 75 billion hryvnias — they closed needs with a total cost of 92 billion hryvnias. 17 billion hryvnias were saved. And all because of the predictability of the process and competitiveness. -Already in November of this year, we are purchasing what will be delivered in the next one. That is, it was not the case when we started at the beginning of this year - we needed to ensure the supply of goods under the contracts that we entered into at the beginning of January, so that the deliveries under these contracts would be in January,- said the general director of the procurement agency. The digital algorithms used by the DOT allow both to control suppliers and to interest them. -Previously, an average of 45-60 days passed between the delivery of goods and payment. Now, due to the fact that this entire process has been digitized, including all additional invoices, documents, etc., from the delivery of the product to the payment for this product takes an average of 10-15 days,- Arsen Zhumadilov stated. DOT responds to all problematic moments as quickly as possible and solves them systematically. As for failures, here the general director of the agency is adamant. -Regarding failures. Nevertheless, I will say that in 24 we managed to avoid them. As of today, we do not have any -material- failures, that is, everyone changed clothes for the winter in a timely manner.

Putin does not want this war to end. Therefore, he must be forced - the President	The President wrote about this on December 9. -I emphasized to both President Macron and President Trump: first of all, you will see that Putin does not want this war to end. Therefore, he must be forced. It is possible to force only if Ukraine is strong. A strong Ukraine before any diplomacy is strong on the battlefield. It's a strong army, it's weapons packages, etc., it's long-range systems, certainly -atakams-, and -taurus-, and -storm shadows-, and -scalps-. We need all this very, very much. And yes, exclusively for strikes on military targets, we emphasize this,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy assured. According to him, security guarantees are also important. -Now we cannot be in NATO, but we can be invited to NATO. And we already need such security guarantees. And we talked about that. And this is exactly how I formulate our opinion. As for the invitation to NATO, it is difficult to talk about it with President Trump today, because he is not yet in the White House, he does not have all these legal rights,- explained Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He said that he is going to call President Joe Biden in the near future and raise the very issue of the invitation to NATO. -Because Biden is currently the current President of the United States, and a lot depends on his position. And it makes no sense to discuss with President Trump what today, while he is not in the White House, does not depend on him,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. He also thanked the United States and Joe Biden, bipartisan support for the recent package, which the President called very important and serious support for Ukraine. -If there is a pause while Ukraine is not in NATO, and even if we had an invitation, but we would not be in NATO, and there is a pause, then who will guarantee us some kind of security? We can think and work on Emmanuel Macron's position. He suggested that some part of the troops of one or another country should be present on the territory of Ukraine, which would guarantee our security while Ukraine is not in NATO. But before that, we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the EU and when Ukraine will be in NATO. Understanding our future, these would be very effective guarantees,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyi. As reported by ArmyInform, President told about enemy attacks for the past week.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/09/putin-ne-hoche-zakinchennya-cziyeyi-vijny-tomu-jogo-treba-prymusyty-prezydent/	2024-12-09T04:45:25-08:00

The pace slows down a little — in the Kharkiv region, the enemy is preparing new mechanized rolls	Oleg Romanov, the commander of the anti-tank battalion of the 3rd separate assault brigade. According to Oleg Romanov, the enemy is creating a bridgehead and, most likely, will use the tactics of mechanized rolling as soon as the ground freezes. However, now the intensity of attacks has decreased somewhat. -In my opinion, the pace is already getting a little lost. Perhaps, before winter, the mobilization capabilities fall. But we will see. We will not run ahead, so as not to provoke,- said Oleg Romanov, the commander of the anti-tank battalion of the 3rd separate assault brigade. How reported ArmyInform, it is steadily difficult in Kharkiv Oblast — the enemy is rushing to the shores of Oskol and Borov. The third assault unit repulses -rolls-, counterattacks and destroys the reserves in the rear of the invaders. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/09/trishky-zbavlyayetsya-temp-na-harkivshhyni-vorog-gotuye-novi-mehanizovani-nakaty/	2024-12-09T01:04:28-08:00
- My sons did not even serve a term...-. The story of the Savostyanov family, which chooses victory ...	But no calls ring in his apartment. Neither apartment nor telephone numbers. He understands that he will never again sit down with his son at the table and talk to him. In such moments, when he is enveloped by indescribable sadness and does not want to live, he drips Corvalol, trying to calm his heart. But where is there!.. Tolya Savostyanov, like most Ukrainians, learned about the large-scale invasion of Russians from television news broadcasts. And the arrivals of -Iskanders- and -Calibers- that -visited- the city once again confirmed this information. And on February 26, when thousands of residents of Dnipro continued to leave their homes, fleeing from the war, a man went to one of the city's territorial recruitment centers with a single request - to be allowed to defend both his city and the whole of Ukraine. There they asked if he has experience in army service, what military specialty he has and where he would like to serve. — I know about the army from movies and the stories of my father, a personnel officer, he sincerely admitted. — And where would you like to serve? And anywhere. The main thing is to be in action&#8230; After a short conversation, he was sent to the 234th Battalion of the 128th Territorial Defense Brigade. Sagittarius -Later, the son said that thousands of our compatriots came to the brigade assembly point in those February days and he was proud that he was among them,- continues the father. — Our units entered the battle after a month and a half and stopped the enemy's offensive in the spring of 2022 on the border of Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions. Over time, all of them took part in operations to liberate Kharkiv region, Luhansk region, and Donetsk region. The son, who had never even held a machine gun in his hands before, admitted to me that he had learned military craft from his brothers who had passed through the ATO/OOS. And there were quite a few of them in the unit. He has been to many hot spots in this damn war. The hottest is Kurakhovo district in Donetsk region. There he survived a lot of artillery and rocket attacks, when it seemed that his life was about to end. However, he survived by some miracle. What I heard from my son is difficult for an adequate person to understand. From his words, I know that Putin's scoundrels simply wiped off the face of the earth both the city and the people - its residents. No, bastard katsaps are not at war with us, but are destroying us and our children, as Ukrainians were destroyed by their ancestors at the beginning of the 30s of the last century. The only difference is that those were dying of hunger, and these are being beaten with Calibers and Daggers. When it came to the danger that befalls our boys at every step and I asked my son to be careful, Tolya said that the Lord God himself was helping him. But one day ended tragically for him: he received an injury that, as doctors later said, was incompatible with life. But his brothers quickly took him to a mobile hospital, where doctors stabilized his condition. Anatoly Sevastyanov was treated in many military hospitals, including the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Clinical Hospital, through which thousands of our soldiers have passed and where the best doctors are gathered. He underwent cranial trepanation, several of the most difficult surgical interventions in the head area. The duel with the skeleton lasted almost a year. Unfortunately, she prevailed and he passed away this summer. -Anatoly was a real soldier, although he did not wear a soldier's uniform until February 2022,- says one of his brothers. — If you want to hear about him as a person, then I will say one thing: he was ready to sacrifice his own life for the sake of the lives of those around him. Anatoly went to the TCC on February 26, and his brother Oleg on April 9, telling his father that he was ashamed to sleep at home, knowing that his brother was fighting. To Serhii Anatoliyovych's suggestion to think it over, he answered with a categorical -no-. He happened to serve in the 55th Zaporizhzhya Sich Artillery Brigade, armed with 155-mm French self-propelled artillery. Together with the same guys, more than once and more than twice he terrorized the occupiers, accurately destroying both manpower and equipment. At first he was a gunner, but over time he retrained as a -KRAZ- driver, providing batteries with shells. Oleg, by the way, learned the driving trade at the Society's Dnipro driving school. And mastered it properly. Fellow gunners say that only because of Sevastyanov's remarkable driving skills, his car, which was repeatedly tracked by enemy UAVs, did not become a target of the Russians. Talking with retired Major Serhii Savostyanov, I asked him what his greatest wish was, to which he replied: — First of all, I want the death of my son Anatoly to become one of the bricks in our victory over the enemy. I want to wait for Oleg to be alive and well. Then we will gather both his brothers and the fallen Anatoliy at the same table. And we will remember my son, and tens of thousands of other sons, fathers, brothers, whom fathers and mothers, children and wives did not wait for, not with an angry, silent word, as the poet wrote. Eternal to all of them!..

Our naval drones worked on Russian helicopters and airplanes near the Crimean Bridge	About this reported on December 9 Security Service of Ukraine. The Russian pilots considered themselves hunters and counted on easy hunting, but they became the prey, because the naval drones opened fire in return. The newest -Sea Baby- were equipped with large-caliber machine guns with ballistic programs for automatic guidance and automatic target acquisition. Intercepted Russian radio communication indicates that there are dead and wounded on board the helicopters. The helicopters themselves received significant damage and now require major repairs. SBU drones also hit a barge that was transporting military equipment and equipment for the repair of the Crimean bridge, which the occupiers are still trying in vain to restore after previous bombings by the Ukrainian special services. -Sea Baby- is our multi-purpose platform, which can accommodate various weapons: both missile systems of volley fire, and flying drones and heavy machine guns. The main thing is that it once again proved its effectiveness. The results of our work are actually much more than we can show now, but everything has its time,- the SBU said. These water drones were produced as a result of the joint fundraising of several foundations and volunteer communities in February of this year. As ArmyInform reported, the Ukrainian drone war in the Black Sea led to the failure of special operations of the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/09/nashi-morski-drony-vidpraczyuvaly-po-rosijskyh-vertolotah-ta-litakah-nepodalik-krymskogo-mostu/	2024-12-08T23:49:27-08:00

Martens, leopards and cobras: the expert told about a German zoo that helps Ukraine	-Only if you go through the most important classes of weapons, then Germany is definitely in at least the top five (those who provide assistance - ed.). So let's figure it out. Excellent Leopard 2 tanks. In my opinion, there is nothing better in tank building. Despite this, there is also Leopard 1. Of course, there is a slightly weaker 105 -millimeter gun, but as an infantry cover weapon works just fine. Very successful Marder (Ukrainian marten) infantry vehicles. They are surpassed only, in my opinion, by combat Swedish CV90s and, of course, the M2 Bradley. There is no need to talk about the Iris-T air defense system. This is the only system with a medium range of up to 50 km, which has one hundred percent damage to the target: and all possible, both cruise missiles and unmanned systems. Not to mention such, at first glance, seemingly banal things, but very, very necessary - demining machines. We understand that our country is currently the most mined country on planet Earth. Further. Beautiful grenade launchers Panzerfaust 3 - after AT-4 and after Instalaz C90 and Carl Gustaf are probably the most massive and best grenade launcher. Plus much needed stuff like DM-31 anti-tank mines and the like, with a huge amount of small arms, a very nice Heckler automatic rifle &amp; Koch. Yes, I would very much like to see a good Taurus long-range missile appear (in Ukraine - ed.), but there are also certain nuances here. The Germans produced up to 600 of them in total, and they have about 125 in their arsenal. Even if 30 of them conditionally appear, they fundamentally do not solve anything. Some fat target will definitely be destroyed, but it is not necessary to talk about the fact that this is a war-breaking missile. Plus one more very important detail also matters. This is a huge amount of microelectronics and especially optics. The Germans have always been famous for very high-quality optics of all types and aiming systems. Not to mention the fantastic COBRA counter-battery machine. The Russians don't have anything like that. And most of all, we can safely say that this is almost the best class of weapons that exists. Even American systems of various purposes, say, AN/TPQ-36, 48, 50, are not equal to this particular machine&#8230; Therefore, it is definitely not correct to throw stones at our strategic ally on the European continent.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/09/kunyczi-leopardy-ta-kobry-ekspert-rozpoviv-pro-nimeczkyj-zoopark-yakyj-dopomagaye-ukrayini/	2024-12-08T21:03:11-08:00
-Cowboy Duel- on MSDS: how -Drone- on -Hurricane- is seconds ahead of the invaders	The acting commander of the artillery platoon of the 48th separate artillery brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, junior sergeant Andrii with the call sign -Drone- told ArmyInform about his military career and combat work - the importance of the speed and coordination of the crew's actions, the -sharp vision- of drones and the accuracy of shots -. The call sign -Drone- has been attached to Andrii since the beginning of the service - as early as 2020. The military man says that he is not connected with the UAV, but with the abbreviation of his name. Andriy - -Andron-, -Dron- - that's how it happened between the brothers. — I entered the Armed Forces of my own free will back in 2020, signed a contract, passed the basic combined military training and studied in one of the artillery brigades. In January 2021, he received the -hundredth VOS- and was sent to the zone of joint military operations (Operations of the United Forces - ed.), where he served for 8 months and returned for training in his profession, the soldier says. In 2020, Andrii just turned 20 years old. At that time, it seemed to many Ukrainians that the war in the East of Ukraine had stopped forever, and to end it once and for all, it was enough to simply stop shooting. Instead, -Drone- was sure that if you wanted peace, you should prepare for war. — Studied in 2014. I was 14 years old then, and although of course no one drafted me into the army, even then I thought and wanted to go and serve as a volunteer - to defend my land, family and friends from the enemy. For me, the war began at the end of 2013, when the Maidan began, repressions began against students, against ordinary people, - explains the gunner. At the educational center, Andrii not only studied, but also taught himself. As the most motivated and responsible cadet, he was appointed deputy commander. And since there were not enough instructors, -Drone- often conducted classes with his brothers himself. — I have been interested in and engaged in -military- since childhood. I watched historical and documentary films, read books about war, studied weapons and battle tactics. That's why he had certain theoretical knowledge, says Andriy. The military adds that despite the limited training time and the lack of instructors, they trained and prepared for combat operations in a high-quality manner. Then, in the zone of OOS, it was possible to significantly improve the acquired knowledge and skills, because it was necessary for the daily performance of combat and special tasks. — In the OOS zone in our area of ​​responsibility for a long time, everything was generally quiet and peaceful. Several times we went on duty for three days. Of course, there was a tense situation on the front line, there were shelling. At that time, we were preparing, sharpening our skills, knowledge, and gaining practice, the fighter recalls. — Already from November to December 2021, it became finally clear that a full-scale invasion would inevitably take place. -Russian troops were approaching the border with Ukraine, and we were sent to artillery training,- Andriy says about the eve of the start of the great war. Then he began training to be an anti-tank platoon commander, mastered the MT-12 -Rapir- gun, the -Grad- MLRS and the -Uragan-. I had to continue studying already in combat conditions - practicing with rocket artillery on columns of Russian invaders in the Sumy region. In 2022, -Dron- fought in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions, took part in the expulsion of the occupiers from the North of Ukraine, the successful offensive of the Defense Forces of Ukraine north of Kharkiv at the end of April - in May, and the famous Slobozhan offensive operation in September-October. — In the Sumy region, we worked mainly on columns of Russian equipment. And in the Kharkiv region, they have already begun to work on base camps, on the accumulation of manpower and equipment, on the placement of equipment on firing positions. In September, we worked from the Kharkiv side towards the border with the Belgorod region of Russia. They hit enemy positions in the area of ​​the village of Liptsi and neighboring villages, Andrii recalls. — In jet artillery, there are several types of projectiles, which are used depending on the target on which it is necessary to inflict fire damage. There are explosive devices, there are cassettes. We can hit infantry, fortifications, columns or clusters of enemy vehicles. We can remotely mine the area with anti-tank mines to prevent the enemy from advancing, says the gunner. The most memorable for the military was the well-aimed strikes on enemy anti-aircraft guns - -Hrad- and -Smerch-. There were cases when, thanks to the timely receipt of information from intelligence, it was possible to hit the enemy right at the firing position even while he was starting to deploy and prepare for firing. — If the intelligence worked on time, provided quality data, then there is nothing complicated about it — we just have time faster than them and know exactly where to hit, -Dron- explains. To an outside observer, it reminds one of the famous cinematic cowboy duel, in which the faster and more accurate wins. However, here the enemies are not several meters apart, but tens of kilometers, and their weapons are not Colts and Winchesters, but deadly long-range salvo missile systems. High-quality and timely further intelligence allows you to stay ahead of the enemy by seconds. To practice on the target, gunners are given coordinates, after which they begin to perform a combat mission. - A full pack of 16 shells can be fired in a very short time - from 8 to 20 seconds. It is necessary to prepare for shooting in a few seconds, one and a half minutes maximum. And it is necessary to roll twice as fast - in 45 seconds maximum. If a well-coordinated crew is working, then this is all done very, very quickly, explains the -Drone-. Later, being in a safe place, the -reactive women- will learn about the results of their work. The results of the objective control are proved to the gunners by sending a photo or a short video. This can be done by real drones - -quadriks- or -wings-, which record fire damage to enemy targets. Andriy says that he and his brothers are always pleased to learn that they worked exactly on target, inflicting maximum damage on the occupiers. Thus, the -sharp vision- of the drones and the skillful, fast and coordinated actions of the crew allow you to accurately hit the invaders under the most difficult conditions. The gunner says that in the almost three years since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the war has changed several times and requires constant training and improvement from Ukrainian soldiers, because the enemy does not stand still and learns from its own mistakes. — In 2022, the Russian was very defiant, walked in columns, did not prepare enough. Now the enemy is learning no less than we are. Their FPVs are also developing more, and their -wings- are developing, and their artillery also began to work better. They have already learned to fight, says Andriy. However, the biggest problem, he is convinced, is not this, because the Ukrainian military still surpasses the enemy in terms of training and is ahead in innovation. The threat is a change in attitudes in society, which has begun to perceive war as routine and many speak of -war fatigue- and do not want to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine. — Many civilians for some reason believe that the war is already over for them, that the enemy will settle for some conditions and cease hostilities. However, this will not happen, the war will reach everyone anyway. The military needs to be replenished, we need to be replaced on the front lines with fresh, trained units, those who have been fighting for many months, years should be given a rest, the defender explains. He is convinced that there is no other way for Ukrainians than the nationwide support of the Defense Forces of Ukraine and the personal participation of all citizens in the defense of the country. After all, the gunner claims, he and his comrades are not fighting for politicians, as some claim, but for their own families and their home, which was invaded by the Russian invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/09/kovbojska-duel-na-rszv-yak-dron-na-uragani-vyperedzhaye-okupantiv-na-sekundy/	2024-12-08T20:56:53-08:00
Missiles have reached the micro level: the development of miniature missiles for drones has been com...	As declare the authors of the portal of the Spanish Defense Industry Association TEDAE, this development, carried out by the Pyrenean firm Aertec in cooperation with the General Directorate of Armaments and Materiel (DGAM), is part of the ARPA project aimed at equipping remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) of its own production with high-precision weapons, ArmyInform reports. Aertec worked with DGAM to redesign its Tarsis-W platform, an armed variant of the Tarsis 75 UAV, as part of DGAM's Coincidente program. In this collaboration, Aertec contributed 70% of the funding and DGAM provided the remaining 30%. The contract with DGAM covered design, prototype production, development and a series of successful ground firing tests, including the launch of a fully guided missile with a warhead. These tests, conducted at the San Gregorio test site in Zaragoza and the Las Bardenas test site in Navarre, demonstrated the missile's readiness for the next stage of qualification. In 2025, Aertec plans to conduct up to 100 additional firings in the -ground-to-surface- and -air-to-surface- launch options to assess the missile's viability for integration with the Tarsis-W platform. As inform the experts at the defense portal Army Recognition, the Tarsis 75, Aertec's Class I UAS system, is a light tactical unmanned aerial vehicle an aerial system (UAS) designed for reconnaissance, surveillance and integration with its light weapons. The UAV has a maximum take-off weight of 75 kg, can carry up to 12 kg of payload and has a maximum flight time of 12 hours. The drone has a wingspan of 5.2 meters, a length of 3.8 meters and can operate from different runways and locations. It has integrated catapult launch options, emergency parachute landing and a back-up satellite communication system. The UAV operates autonomously for the full flight plan, including take-off and landing, while maintaining the ability to manually operate if required. It can reach a height of up to 5,000 m. meters and has an operational range of 70 to 150 kilometers, making it suitable for the deployment of the Fox I micro-missile. The Fox I micro-missile, also known as μASM A-Fox, is designed specifically for use with small RPAS and has intermediate inertial navigation together with a semi-active laser guidance terminal. It has a length of 900 mm, a weight of 3 kg and a range of up to 4 kilometers, capable of hitting a variety of mobile targets and objects equipped with counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS) sensors. Aertec's Fox I relies on an in-house developed high-performance homing kit and a laser homing gun for precision targeting. The warhead of the missile and the rocket engine were developed in cooperation with the Spanish defense equipment manufacturer Instalaza. The warhead, adapted from the C90 Instalaza munition and equipped with a specially designed fuze, is intended for use against designated targets. The rocket motor is designed to fit the compact scale of the warhead while maintaining stability in flight. INTA's Ground Systems Directorate supported the project with testing resources and engineering assistance. In addition, the modular design of the Fox I micro-rocket allows it to be integrated into various flight platforms with minimal software modifications. Optimized for Class I UAVs such as the Tarsis 75, the missile's size and flexibility make it suitable for a number of light aircraft platforms that incorporate precision attack capabilities. The potential of micromissiles such as Aertec's Fox I for drone applications is to equip small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) with efficient, lightweight and adaptable precision strike capabilities. These micro-missiles allow you to hit lightly armored targets with minimal side effects. Their modularity and small size allow it to be integrated with different types of drones, maintaining flexibility between missions. In addition, their adaptability allows drones to provide close air support to their own units and conduct combat operations beyond line of sight using onboard sensors and targeting systems, facilitating operations in high-risk environments. This capability provides cost-effectiveness by reducing the need for larger drones or conventional munitions for specific tactical scenarios, from counter-UAV to direct fire support.

The Russians invented a fake about the instructions on how to meet the fallen defenders from the fro...	For example, Kremenchug schoolchildren are given instructions on how to properly kneel when meeting fallen defenders from the front. The corresponding poses are shown on the postcards. A reverse image search leads to similar pictures on several photo stocks (photo sales sites). It is signed in English, literally -a set of soccer players kneeling to protest racism and police brutality for Black Lives Matter.- The original drawing illustrates how football players and athletes protest by kneeling and raising their hands up. This gesture became global after the killing of African-American George Floyd in May 2020 in the United States, which caused a wave of protests around the world. And it was first used by American football player Colin Kaepernick, when in 2016 he knelt with his hand raised during the playing of the US national anthem before National Football League (NFL) games. The gesture signified disagreement with racial inequality and police violence. It is interesting that a fragment of the poem -On the Shield- by Oksana Lesyk-Paduchak is printed on the fake instructions. It is likely that Russian propagandists used it to create the illusion of greater resemblance to the truth. And also to show the -Nazi image of Ukrainians-, since the poem uses a trigger word for Russians - -Banderivskyi-. In addition, the -news- does not contain any specifics - where did it become known, in which school it was noticed, comments of eyewitnesses. Taken together, all this indicates that this is a Russian fake. In fact, in many cultures, people kneel: to pray, ask for forgiveness, or honor the memory of the dead. In Ukraine, fallen soldiers are commemorated by getting down on one knee. It is a gesture of respect, completely voluntary. But Russian propaganda gives it a negative connotation. After all, in their understanding, kneeling symbolizes submission to the ruler. They still often kneel down when addressing their Kremlin dictator. The fake was created in order to cause negative emotions towards the Ukrainian authorities, to undermine trust in education and to impose certain stereotypes that are not characteristic of Ukrainians.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/09/rosiyany-vygadaly-fejk-pro-instrukcziyu-yak-zustrichaty-zagyblyh-zahysnykiv-iz-frontu/	2024-12-08T20:04:31-08:00

-I saw a shot from an RPG-7 fly in front of my eyes and hit a barrel with fuel- — the story of a fig...	His story published byState Border Service. Yuriy is from Luhansk and since childhood dreamed of becoming a soldier. After graduating from college, he joined the State Border Service. -On June 2, 2014, we were raised by another alarm. They thought it was a training course, but they saw a red rocket signal. At the same moment, bullets flew from all sides. They hid on the territory of the car park, behind the cars, then ran to the inspection pit for vehicles, in which some mobilized man was already wounded in the leg,- the man recalled. According to him, there were few bullets, but they fired intermittently from a hole in the forest strip, in which the enemy's shots flared. -I looked out - I saw how a shot from an RPG-7 flew in front of my eyes and hit a barrel with fuel. It was like a slow motion movie! The fire was very intense. We had to move to the nearest building. They began to cover us with mortars, and we could not understand where the fire was coming from in order to respond with underbarrel grenade launchers,- said -Artist-. He remembered the movie -Saving Private Ryan-, in which Tom Hanks searched for enemy positions with the help of a mirror. I found a mirror in one of the offices, crawled to the window, saw a flash behind the greenhouses along the track. -Oh, and we showered them with gifts! But I was also -burned-. He was wounded in the stomach by a direct hit from a cumulative shot. In an hour and a half, I was evacuated to the Luhansk hospital, then on a helicopter to Kyiv,- Yuriy said. He underwent rehabilitation in Israel, at the Hadassah medical center in Jerusalem. Within two weeks, he started visiting the day hospital on his own. It was necessary to drive almost through the entire city. -The most difficult thing was to accept that I would no longer be able to run like before, one hundred percent. I returned to the army, because the uniform suits me! But, seriously, since 2018, we have been fighting for the right to military service for persons with disabilities who received it during the defense of the homeland,- explained the -Artist-. In 2021, the law was passed and it was reinstated. As an officer of the special projects department, he currently draws various illustrations, situations and comics for the social networks of the State Border Service. The man has the Order -For Courage- of the III degree and the award of the President of Ukraine -For participation in the anti-terrorist operation-.

There is currently no threat surrounding Toretsk: the Defense Forces spoke about the fighting in the...	About this on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- the deputy chief of staff - the head of the planning group of the staff told the audience Mykhailo Stoykevich of the 49th separate assault battalion -Karpatska Sich-. Despite the tactics of fighting in urban areas, according to the officer, the enemy periodically resorts to the use of artillery damage and the use of anti-aircraft guns. Thus, he exposes his own soldiers to danger. -And they never counted their soldiers. And for those groups that seep into the city, such trips are almost always a one-way trip. Moreover, we do not even record the attempts of the Russians to evacuate their wounded,- the Ukrainian military officer emphasized. In turn, our units are actively using unmanned systems to fight enemy groups. -The invaders are trying enter the city in small groups and occupy some buildings. We track them and attack with FPV drones after dark, thereby hiding the occupiers under the ruins of buildings,- said Mykhailo Stoykevich. The officer noted that our units have an advantage in night attacks thanks to more modern bomber drones , equipped with the appropriate dark-adapted surveillance systems, and the enemy is actively developing a fleet of fiber-optic UAVs. -Such drones on wires are very difficult to suppress with electronic warfare. It is almost impossible to neutralize them until they are damaged,- Stoykevich assured. However, under the current weather conditions, the use of drones is becoming more and more problematic. According to the deputy chief of staff of -Karpatska Sich-, drones -don't like- rain and frostbite. However, the enemy also has such problems. The officer of the Armed Forces informed that the enemy made several attempts to bypass the city of Toretsk in order to surround it. However, all such forays of the Russians ended in failure: their groups were defeated in small villages located near this settlement. And at the moment there is no extraordinary threat to the surroundings of the city. As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy concentrated his offensive efforts in the districts Toretska, Dilyivka, Leonidivka and Shcherbinivka, where seven clashes took place, currently three more clashes are taking place.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/zagrozy-otochennya-toreczka-narazi-nemaye-u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-pro-boyi-u-misti-na-donechchyni/	2024-12-08T08:28:33-08:00

According to him, numerous cases of illegal arrests and sentences are recorded. In particular, in Energodar, an employee of the Zaporizhzhya NPP was convicted on trumped-up charges of attempted sabotage. Torture and imprisonment have become common methods of intimidation. Residents of the occupied territories are also forcibly mobilized and sent to the front. -Many are forced to participate in a war against their own state. Despite this, some find an opportunity to surrender to the Ukrainian military,- said Ivan Fedorov. He emphasized that anyone forcibly mobilized can use the state program -I want to live- and surrender to captivity. This guarantees safety and saves lives. As reported by ArmyInform, during the day the occupiers made 269 strikes on 11 populated areas of the Zaporizhzhia region, as a result of which a 65-year-old man died in Vasylivskyi district.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/nezakonni-areshty-j-prymusova-mobilizacziya-shho-vidomo-pro-sytuacziyu-na-okupovanyh-terytoriyah-zaporizhzhya/	2024-12-08T07:47:11-08:00
They are not worth the price - the enemy still has enough reserves for attacks on Chasiv Yar	About it in TV Andrii Polukhin, press officer of the 24th mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, told Suspilny. -The situation remains difficult, the enemy is trying to storm the positions of our defenders, is making attempts to bypass them and is using small infantry groups as a sort of DRG, which are trying to impose a battle in the rear behind the backs of our defenders,- noted Andriy Polukhin, analyzing the events last week According to him, the enemy is actively shelling the territory of the city from various fire systems, as well as inflicting damage with aerial bombs. At the same time, according to the military, the Russians have not recorded the arrival of new units. -The reserves that they accumulated earlier are still enough for offensive activity. At this time, there are no special changes in the tactics of the Russians. Not particularly affected by their maneuvers and weather conditions, since this is an urban lane. In many places there is asphalt, there are still places where you can drive without problems on any vehicle, despite the weather,- stated Andriy Polukhin. According to Polukhin, at the moment, the biggest problem for the occupiers is not the weather, but the successful work of Ukrainian drone fighters: the -Rarog- battalion, as well as units of unmanned systems in the battalions of the brigade. Among the problems faced by the soldiers of this military unit is the presence in the city of civilian residents who, for reasons known only to them, bypassed the evacuation and remain in Chasovoy Yar. Andriy Polukhin pointed to the fact that Russian saboteurs quite often use civilian clothes to disguise their intentions, and therefore the movement of a group of citizens who are not invaders through the streets complicates the combat work of Ukrainian soldiers -At this moment, indeed, local residents still remain there . Somehow they don't have a drastic effect, but the understanding that they can be in certain places where combat operations need to be carried out somewhat constrains the movements of our troops,- Andriy Polukhin said. As reported by ArmyInform, the drones of the -Rarog- unmanned systems battalion of the 24th mechanized brigade named after King Danylo showed footage of the liquidation of the army kombat Russian Federation Yevhen Smirnov, known by the call sign -Yermak-. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/za-czinoyu-ne-stoyat-vorogu-poky-vystachaye-rezerviv-dlya-atak-na-chasiv-yar/	2024-12-08T07:23:18-08:00

The army of the Russian Federation flees from Syria by planes and ships - GUR	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on December 8. The rapid process of overthrowing the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria was marked by the shameful flight of the Russian contingent from the territory of the Arab republic. In the Syrian capital, Damascus, the dictator's residence, government buildings and the central office of national television are under the control of anti-Assad forces. After losing control of Damascus amid a continued offensive by opposition forces in the provinces of Latakia, Hama and Tartus, the Russian army withdrew its warships from the naval base in Tartus, which Assad had previously lent to Moscow in return for its security. On December 8, the frigate -Admiral Grigorovich- of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation and the cargo ship -Engineer Trubin- of the Northern Fleet of the Russian Federation left Tartus in the Mediterranean Sea. Also, the Russians are transferring the remnants of their weapons and military equipment from Syria by military aircraft from the airbase in Khmeimim. -After the capture of Damascus, the forces opposed to Assad are moving to the coast - Russia's probable loss of military bases in Tartus and Khmeimim will finalize the Kremlin's defeat in the Middle East,- GUR believes. As reported by ArmyInform, soldiers of the GUR destroyed the enemy -Hurricane- in the Zaporozhye direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/armiya-rf-tikaye-z-syriyi-litakamy-ta-korablyamy-gur/	2024-12-08T06:44:27-08:00

A video about it was released on December 8 on the unit's channel. -Today is just a crazy day, a lot of fpvishok were launched, but there is one caveat&#8230; this bunch of fpvishok was launched on us. We shot down almost all the enemy drones, but there were also missed ones. Due to the fact that the enemy flew at high frequencies, it was not possible to land them with EW. Not all weapons can shoot back effectively either. So we specially filmed a small review and told how and with what we fought back and on what frequencies the enemies are currently flying in Donetsk region,- the unit commented on the video. In particular, -Sharp Cartridges- questioned the effectiveness of using shotguns against kamikaze drones, since the shot does not cause serious damage to enemy copters. As reported by ArmyInform, operators of the -Sharp Cartridges- unit of the National Guard we filmed a drone cleaning of a house with Russians, by the forces of our attack aircraft.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/drib-ne-bere-krashhe-z-avtomata-nashi-piloty-vidbyly-ataku-desyatka-vorozhyh-fpv/	2024-12-08T06:04:46-08:00
Marines of a sick person - in Kurshchyna, the Russians attack with a brigade of -freaks-	About on the air of the telethon -Edyni Novyni- announced the press officer of the 47th mechanized brigade Anastasia Blyshchyk. According to her information, the main force of the Russians, which conducts the assaults, is the 155th Marine Brigade of the Russian Army. -And this is a really elite unit of the Russian Federation. They are really prepared, they are well equipped, that is, they are not some mobilized people who are simply thrown for meat. It is clear that each of their assaults is planned. That is why they are motivated to fight here, and we are motivated to eliminate them. The brigade of these marines are really -repulsed-, they are finished bastards who document their crimes, how they kill Ukrainian prisoners, torture them. We eliminate them in battle,- emphasized Anastasia Blyshchyk. Using the example of a specific battle, the press officer noted that the units of the brigade were opposed by well-prepared and well-equipped enemies. -In particular, they were dressed in camouflage robes. This is special white clothing, it is spotted to blend in with the snow. They also used armored vehicles, they were also amphibious assault vehicles, and they were also MTLB. They were met by our anti-tankers, who were firing from the Stugna ATGM, and also worked as UAV operators. And a huge thank you in this situation to the engineers who very competently placed the mine barriers,- Anastasiya Blyshchyk emphasized. She noted that before the mentioned combat, in the last 2-3 weeks, the Ukrainian infantrymen had not seen enemy heavy equipment on the battlefield at all. If anything was observed, it was motorcycles, ATVs. -And more Russians used this type of transport for logistics. But just now they became more active. I don't know if they will try to advance with equipment again, or if they will return to infantry assaults, we will see,- Anastasiya Blyshchyk said. As reported by ArmyInform, the unmanned systems battalion of the 47th mechanized brigade daily causes colossal losses to the enemy, supporting our infantry in Kurshchyna. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/morpihy-hvoroyi-lyudyny-na-kurshhyni-rosiyany-atakuyut-brygadoyu-vyrodkiv/	2024-12-08T05:46:13-08:00

They sighed - in Slobozhanshchyna, the combat activity of the enemy has decreased	About it at telemarathon and -The only news- said the spokesman of the operational-tactical group of troops -Kharkiv- lieutenant colonel Yevhenii Romanov. -We are observing a decrease in Russian assaults. Twice they tried to advance in the Vovchansk region, but they failed. In general, we observe that the number of shelling and attacks has really decreased. Over the past 24 hours, the occupiers have carried out two strikes using four guided aerial bombs, Yevgeny Romanov stated. At the same time, according to the speaker, during Saturday, the enemy struck 17 kamikaze drones and carried out 199 attacks on the positions of defenders of Ukraine. -But this is twice less than the statistics for the period of a week and a half before-, Yevhenii Romanov said. He noted that the soldiers of the units of the Defense Forces respond adequately to all actions of the enemy. -Yesterday, the enemy was still without 56 soldiers. Of them, 26 occupiers suffered irreversible losses,- Yevgeny Romanov noted. At the same time, according to Yevgeny Romanov, in recent days in the Kharkiv direction there has been a decrease in the number of attacks by guided aerial bombs (UABs) from the enemy, which may be due to the fact that the enemy has concentrated its resources on other areas of the front or faced limitations in their use -This resource (KAB) is limited for them. Therefore, they are forced to save on flights, and the CABs themselves. Or they don't have the ability to carry out air attacks,'' Evgeny Romanov stated. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the operative-tactical group -Kharkiv- told about the fighter Serhii with the call sign -Kosii-, who not only managed to save himself, but also destroyed enemies, who brutally executed his fellow prisoners. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/vyzdyhaly-na-slobozhanshhyni-bojova-aktyvnist-voroga-zmenshylasya/	2024-12-08T04:45:22-08:00

Creating Controlled Chaos: In the south, the enemy continues to terrorize the civilian population	About this on the air of the military TV channel said Serhiy Bratchuk, the spokesman of the Ukrainian Volunteer Army -South-. -According to the speakers of the aggressor, they are going to launch an attack on Zaporizhzhia, or the Zaporizhia direction, and then, as it were, shift their forces in order to force the Dnieper and reach the right bank, create a bridgehead and, accordingly, attack the regional center of Kherson. And all this was scaled in the information space with the use of appropriate publics, appropriate introductions. And, of course, that this worries people,- said Serhiy Bratchuk. However, according to him, the situation, from the side of the Ukrainian command, is fully controlled, no matter how difficult it was. Although the enemy's movements are quite intense. -At least the task that faced the Russians for more than a month is an attempt to enter our islands located on the Dnieper. With these islands, in fact, they are trying to achieve an increase in the gray zone and an increase in fire pressure on the right bank, on those communities that are near the Dnipro,- stated Serhiy Bratchuk. He stated that we are talking about terrorism against the civilian population, because the enemy uses UAVs quite actively. -The enemy absolutely does not shy away from using these drones against the civilian population. Every day we receive reports of attacks on individual citizens and groups of civilians. The occupiers are also hunting for representatives of the National Police, rescuers of the State Emergency Service, and medical workers. That is, I would even say that the enemy is trying to vividly demonstrate its terrorism,- Serhii Bratchuk emphasized. According to him, these signals of terrorism are primarily aimed at our partners as well, they say that Russia has power, Russia is not ready and will stop at nothing, even the killing of civilians. -Well, actually, this is an attempt to create a situation of panic, a situation of controlled chaos among peaceful citizens. Moreover, this is one of the elements of the concept of waging a modern war, which is promoted by the Russian Federation, and they quite actively developed and are developing this direction of their strategy of waging war on the basis of Soviet instructions, where no one spared people. Especially when it comes to those territories that Russia wants to invade,- Serhii Bratchuk is convinced. The speaker also pointed out that now in the area of ​​responsibility of the units in the south, the invaders are actively conducting sabotage and reconnaissance activities along the banks of the Dnipro. -If we are talking about islands and assaults on them, the Russians are trying to enter the island and gain a foothold on boats or other watercraft. Very often they fail to do this, but those who fall over try to get a foothold and wait for the next group. Whether there will be a next group is already a question. Especially since the fire control from our right bank is constant,- concluded Serhii Bratchuk. According to his conviction, all this hostile activity in the Dnieper direction, as well as in the Zaporizhia direction, is aimed at distracting our forces. As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy dnipro-ta-zaporizhzhya/->frightens with a big attack on the Dnipro and Zaporizhzhya. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/stvorennya-kerovanogo-haosu-na-pivdni-vorog-prodovzhuye-teroryzuvaty-myrne-naselennya/	2024-12-08T03:36:02-08:00
One to five: Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the losses of Ukraine and Russia	The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, announced this on December 8. He said that since the beginning of the full-scale war, Ukraine has lost 43,000 soldiers who died on the battlefield. -370,000 cases of assistance to the wounded, and this is taking into account that in our army, approximately 50 percent of the wounded return to the ranks, and all injuries, including light and repeated ones, are recorded,- the head of state said. According to him, one of the key differences between the Russian army and the Defense Forces of Ukraine is the level of development of front-line medicine, which is much higher in the Ukrainian army. -We in Ukraine are grateful for this to everyone who helps develop medicine in our army and saves our wounded, carries out rehabilitation. Since September of this year, Russia has been losing people on the battlefield in a ratio of 5 and even 6 to 1 in our country. That's how they want to seize more land before the pressure of the world on them can increase to an unbearable level,- the President said. In addition, he urged not to forget about the Ukrainians who are in Russian captivity - there are thousands of people, military and civilians, and some of them have been in captivity since 2014, when the occupation began. As of February 24, 2022, Ukraine managed to return 3,935 Ukrainian people from Russia: 3,767 soldiers and 168 civilians. -We have to get everyone back and it's still a lot of work. And we must establish the truth about all our missing people. Let's not forget about the children deported by Russia from Ukrainian land: the Russians themselves say that there are hundreds of thousands of such stolen children, and Russia scatters them across its territory,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. According to him, getting them back is the hardest part. At least several million people remain in the occupied territory of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/odyn-do-pyaty-volodymyr-zelenskyj-oprylyudnyv-vtraty-ukrayiny-ta-rosiyi/	2024-12-08T03:13:21-08:00

Their main mission is to protect their brothers and to destroy the forces of the Russian occupiers as much as possible,- commented the work of their anti-tankers in the brigade.

The weather is bad, but the enemy is even worse - our pilots have learned to work well in difficult ...	Maksym Bilousov, the head of the communications department of the 60th brigade, told about this in the stream on the military TV channel ArmyTV. -Now there is a slight lull in our area of ​​responsibility precisely from the point of view of the involvement of armored vehicles. The enemy is not using it as actively now as it was a week ago. But he does not stop constant assaults with the participation of infantry,- Maksym Bilousov said. According to him, enemy infantrymen have different degrees of combat training. From time to time there are very worthy opponents. According to Maksym Bilousov, they have an idea about regrouping the unit, about conducting the battle in sectors. But a considerable number of Russian soldiers practically did not undergo any thorough training. -They don't even know where they got to. One of the prisoners said that they were, so to speak, trained at the training ground for just a couple of days, and then they were transferred to the front. And he got to us because they told him: -Take some water and take it to the front.- He took his burden, left and came out ... to us,- Maksym Bilousov said. In the certain absence of enemy armored vehicles on the battlefield in the area of ​​​​responsibility, their operators of unmanned systems organize a hunt for both Russian infantrymen and firing points. In particular, mortar calculations of the invaders. -As a recent example of a successful hunt, there is a video that we posted. Our aerial scouts found a mortar nest of the occupiers. Somehow they didn't hide it very well. And the soldiers from the unit of combat UAVs — FPV drones quickly hit the position of the invaders. Because mortars are still such a thing that can cause a lot of damage. And hitting a mortar is, I think, such a very good and good bonus for us,- Maksym Bilousov emphasized. According to him, the pilots of the kamikaze drones find a way out even in bad weather, fly between the clouds and then work in a very organized manner on the enemy's positions. As reported by ArmyInform, aerial scouts of the 60th mechanized Ingulets brigade noticed a Russian lying on the ground with a weapon. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/pogoda-pogana-ale-vorogu-shhe-girshe-nashi-piloty-navchylysya-dobre-praczyuvaty-u-skladnyh-meteoumovah/	2024-12-08T01:46:59-08:00
- I remember the sparks that flew from their bulletproof vests - Serhiy killed the Russians who shot...	The story was made public on December 8 by the operational-tactical group -Kharkiv-. Serhiy comes from Chernihiv Oblast. During the war, he went through all the circles of infantry hell. He was hunted by mortars and drones, poisoned with gas and tried to kill at close range during assaults. He survived where there seemed to be no hope left. Otherwise, Serhii does not call it a miracle of God. -This happened during the defense of a small, completely destroyed Donetsk village. There were very fierce battles, for three days we were -covered- with everything possible. We are tired, wounded, hiding in the basement among the ruins from shelling and drops. We were left without a portable REB. We sit and wait for the boys from neighboring positions to bring. Suddenly we hear someone approaching the basement. They asked for the password, but they are Muscovites! Experienced, careful - they do not go to us, they only throw grenades and shout: -Surrender!-. I have a wound in my leg, my Achilles tendon is torn, I'm bleeding a little. The boys are contused and injured. They decide to leave, and I stay until the last. I hide in mattresses, rags that lie on the floor. Suddenly I hear automatic rounds: the guys who came out to surrender are being shot. The Russians begin to descend to the basement. Two. One says: -There were more of them!-, the other denies: -No, we killed them all!- Two things saved me: firstly, it was dark in the basement, secondly, they didn't shoot the space before the event,- recalls Serhiy. The invaders acted quickly, in a businesslike manner: they began to barricade the entrance in case of our drones. -Weapons were put away for convenience, and one of them threw a machine gun almost into my hand - I even felt the heat from the receiver. Then he acted on reflexes: he grabbed the -Kalashnikov-, checked. The Muscovites were trained: after shooting, they changed the magazine to a full one, a charge in the chamber. He emptied the machine gun at the enemies in turns. I remembered the sparks that flew from their bulletproof vests... He automatically changed the empty magazine to his full one and somehow crawled out into the yard. It turned out that one of the boys who were shot by Muscovites was alive: the bullet hit his face, there was a lot of blood, so they decided that he was dead. The two crawled to the shelter, called for help. We had to wait more than four hours. All this time we pretended to be dead, because enemy drones were circling above us. His brothers were the first to be evacuated, it was easier with him - he could go by himself. They came after me a little later. At first they dragged me, then they carried me, finally they picked up a bicycle in the village and rolled me on it. Thank God, it was delivered. Then - the hospital, numerous operations, rehabilitation. I recently returned to my unit, but I no longer fit in the attack aircraft: you can't run without an Achilles tendon. Scandibai slowly, but I plan to continue to serve, to do something useful, to pass on experience. It's a pity - now I can't drive a car&#8230; In general, I was very lucky then. What is the moral of all this? Guys, never trust the Russians, don't surrender, they will definitely shoot you. It is necessary to fight to the last, this is the only chance to survive. Don't allow yourself to be killed, it's better to kill the enemy first,- Serhii advises.

-Bats- in the service of the Coast Guard: American law enforcement officials are betting on the late...	According to distributed information by the United States Coast Guard Command, V-BAT drones (one of the variants of the translation into Ukrainian - -Bat- - author) are able to take off vertically and do not need airstrips, which makes them less vulnerable to detection and enemy attacks, ArmiyaInform reports. With a flight range of up to 370 km and the ability to stay in the air for a long time - up to 11 hours - they give law enforcement an important advantage in the form of reconnaissance, long-term surveillance and reconnaissance. In particular, units of the US Coast Guard will use patrol ships already available in this structure to launch drones. In particular, on the National Security Cutter or Legend class vessels. After all, V-BAT is able to take off vertically and land on a field of only 4x4 meters. The drone weighs 56.5 kg and can carry up to 11 kg of payload. Equipped with a powerful optical-electronic system with a thermal imaging sensor and artificial intelligence, V-BAT ensures effective detection and recognition of targets. The duration of the drone's flight is up to 10 hours. The fuselage of the V-BAT measures 9 feet (2.74 meters) with a wingspan of 9.7 feet (2.95 meters). The system works with Hivemind's own Shield AI technology, which allows it to fly autonomously in the harsh conditions of the activity of enemy air defense assets without GPS or communication. This software supports control of four V-BATs and a software application is currently being developed to increase the number of drones for use in swarms. The UAV is powered by a 24-horsepower twin-cylinder engine that provides a top speed of 56 miles (90 kilometers) per hour and an altitude of up to 20,000 feet (6,100 meters). The UAV can be transported in a pickup truck and assembled by two employees in less than 20 minutes, making it a true expeditionary system designed for dynamic movement and fluid mission sets. So far, Shield AI produces about 120 machines a year, each of which costs about $1 million (although the price will be lower when buying in bulk). As for the future of the unmanned system, according to Brandon Tseng, president of the Shield AI startup, the next stage of development is the integration of missiles into the V-BAT. -We put into production a Northrop Grumman missile called Hatchet, which is a laser-guided munition that will be released at the end next year,- Tseng reported. At the same time, V-BAT is one of the contenders for participation in the Pentagon's FTUAS project, which should replace drones. 7_Shadow->Textron RQ-7 Shadow. The final decision on this program is expected in 2025, and the introduction of the drone into the troops in 2026. V-BAT Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) presentation.

-Nona- in action: how to hit with the first shot. The story of the gun commander from the legendary ...	He is currently a gun commander in the 25th Separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade. How to hit a moving tank with a 2C9 gun? But is it possible to destroy an enemy assault group with the first shot? Yuriy told our correspondent: -I have been at war since the first days of the large-scale invasion. He came to the TCC, was assigned to the 25th separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade. Our calculation is fighting on a 2C9 gun, it is a 120 caliber. I started as a gunner, now I am a gun commander. As an interesting fact, I can tell about one case. Somehow art reconnaissance could not work with us due to bad weather conditions. And our infantry on the front edge saw the gap we gave on the objective. They gave us the coordinates of this gap. We adjusted accordingly and hit the target. It was an enemy assault group. There was another case. We started working. We received a reply. We quickly rolled over and found our way from a new place almost without preparation and achieved the goal we started working on from the previous place with the first shot. And it was also an enemy assault group. We have 120 calibers, which, as a rule, we work with on the front edge. Rarely do we technically shoot. Recently, we have been working with mines at short distances, 4-5 kilometers. Why mines, because the 2С9 is a self-propelled mortar gun. Can work both as a mortar and as a cannon. Simply put, this is a rifled mortar. Well, 2C9 is a self-propelled, tracked. She is better known by the name -Nona-. It was still made on the basis of BMD. Can -swim-, by the way. I really like this gun. Shoots well. Although the barrel is not very long. I still remember the incident. This is August 2022, Bakhmut direction. First morning, our next objective is an enemy stronghold. Once an enemy BMP drove up to him. And we hit her with the second shot. The next morning we are again given the same objective. And another BMP arrives at the same place. And we impress her again!.. This is really memorable. We were sent a photo report later. That cheered us up. Then, during the Lyman offensive, things got interesting in October 2022. It is in the area where the reservoir cascades along the Zherebets River. The enemy was on the left bank in Terny. And we hunted a tank there. And of course he was moving. And somewhere from the tenth shot we got him. We didn't see it, we were just given the coordinates: -plus 10 meters-, -to the left 0.01-. And in a couple of minutes we were informed that it had caught fire. It was not destroyed, but it was disabled. At some point, we even wanted to drop this tank without shooting at it. But with the last shot they did hit. In order for your calculation to work well, it must be prepared. When there is free time, for example, with a gunner to -pull up- certain moments that you noted during combat work. It is also very important to analyze the results of shooting. And, of course, the consistency of the calculation is important. Everyone should be like one family. So that there are no quarrels in the team. Because sometimes for two weeks we sit together in our cannon, in a closed space. Therefore, it is important that there is psychological compatibility. It is also necessary for the gun commander to always have a leadership position. Because there are various stressful situations at the front, when your subordinates can get confused and at this moment they just need to be told what they should do. The support of the commander in such episodes is very important.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/nona-v-diyi-yak-vluchyty-z-pershogo-postrilu-istoriya-komandyra-garmaty-z-legendarnoyi-25-ky/	2024-12-07T20:48:02-08:00

In response, the representative of the diplomatic institution explained that the Embassy never provided such -recommendations- and did not participate in the creation of this video. In addition, the fake text is poorly written in Danish and does not correspond to the official communication style of the Danish authorities. TCC and joint ventures are one of the favorite topics of Russian fakers. Every day they launch another fool into the information space, which aims to disrupt the mobilization in Ukraine in any way possible. Earlier ArmyInform reported about a fake, the British Embassy allegedly provides its citizens with leaflets advising them to avoid TCCs in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/rospropaganda-vzhe-v-daniyi-fejk-pro-buklet-daye-porady-yak-povodytys-z-tczk-v-ukrayini/	2024-12-07T20:21:02-08:00
The Ukrainian military man - Sei- played one of the main roles in the world-famous game S.T.A.L.K.E....	The game has become a true quintessence of Ukrainian meanings and context. At least take into account the fact that in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl used 420 (!) Ukrainian songs of the main and secondary characters of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was embodied by Ukrainian theater, film and dubbing actors, and, in particular, those who joined the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. One of them is Oleksandr Laptiy with the call sign -Sey-. A theater and film actor, since 2023 a serviceman of the 1st Special Forces Battalion of the 12th Azov Special Forces Brigade. The soldier of the National Guard became the prototype of one of the main characters - Scar. During an interview, ArmyInform asked a serviceman about how he joined the team of game creators, how fellow gamers reacted when they learned that a colleague had joined the creation of a cult product; about personal permission for filming from Brigadier General Denys Prokopenko, about how S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 sharpens the perception of the Ukrainian context in the world community, as well as how he joined the ranks of the Defense Forces, using his official position (although he had armor from mobilization). - Please tell us how this story started: that you became the prototype of one of the main characters of the Stalker game. - This story began in November 2021. Before the full-scale invasion, I was a professional actor, drama theater director, and Ukrainian cinematographer. And one day I got a message on messenger from a casting director working on S.T.A.L.K.E.R. And then she says that she wants to invite me to the casting, I still didn't know what character it was about. At first I thought it was a prank. Because S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - my favorite game that I played ten years ago and I was waiting for the second part! And here is the message! I actually thought it was a joke. But: why not try? I went to the central office of GSC Company group, met the casting director, the person who wrote the scripts, and they gave me a text with the words: -Let's try.- And I saw that my prototype was Scar. And it is an iconic character for all gamers who play S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Everyone who played the first part of the game -Clear Sky- knows that it ends with intrigue, and it is not clear whether Scar died. The global gaming community wanted to know if Scar survived. And then they give me texts. And I find out that Scar survived - but I'm signing hundreds of non-disclosure documents at the same time, and I'm not even allowed to say that I'm somehow involved with S.T.A.L.K.E.R., not to tell some storylines(laughs - ed.). Then I realized that everything is serious, me they said that I was suitable for them and that I should expect a call to the filming site. But first, as is appropriate in computer games, a 3D model is made. This is quite an interesting process: you enter a room that is simply hung with cameras, cameras, more than three hundred of them. You sit down, you are photographed from different angles, you act out several emotions, which will then directly become the prototypes of Scar's emotions. Then, in February, the shooting process began. I had quite a few shooting days, but after several shoots that took place on the 19th of February, the next one was supposed to be in the 20th of February. But everything ended. And even later, when I joined the ranks of Azov, I received a message that the work continued and that the developers would like me to voice my character. I'm like, wow! But now everything depended on the command. - Was the command consulted before this, or was it in favor? Do you mind? Were there agreements? — There was no command against. Of course, there was a lot of agreement. I immediately came to the combatant and said: -I have such a request for you, friend combatant, it is unusual. I need KZV (short-term release of a serviceman), but not for family reasons.- I told this story and that I needed to be in Kyiv for a few days, for the first session. The combatant replied that it should probably be decided by the brigade commander. He was just going to see him on business, and he promised to ask about me. An hour later, he returned with the answer: -Radish has gone haywire. Pack your things in the evening - fly to Kyiv in the morning.- - Was it for you an image and a thrill that you became a part of this legendary game, because you said that you were already familiar with this game? - Of course I played. In the process of preparing for filming, I went through the first part again to remind myself of the plot. Scar has changed during this time, as the story has been 10 years in the past and he has survived several radioactive releases. In the second part, Scar became a rather impulsive and expressive character, although in the first part he was mostly silent. Yes, it was valuable for me to participate in the creation of this game. First of all, when you read the script, you have incredible emotions. After all, I knew the answer to the question of whether the Scar was alive or not, but I could not say about it. This is a secret that I kept until the release (laughs - ed.). - Do people in your unit play this game, acquaintances, friends? When they find out that you were involved in the creation of a new -Stalker- - how do they react? It's very emotional, because some people don't like the Internet, others like a laptop. Yes, there are fans of the game in the unit. When they found out that I was involved in the creation process, they constantly asked when the keys would be available, they said: -There is a promotional version, give me the keys- (laughs - editor). I asked them to wait a little, because then they won't be interested if I spoil something, the intrigue will disappear, and this is the whole excitement for a gamer: to keep tension while playing the game. This is very cool! - When did you first admit to your brothers? - I didn't say that I was playing Scar, but our brigade media service made a clip where they said that an Azov was involved in this game. And everyone's like, -Oops!- (laughs - ed.). There were a lot of questions. But I asked to wait for the release. —The first part of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. many associated it with the Russian Federation, thought it was Russian. Now there is a clear realization that this is a Ukrainian product. In your opinion, is Ukrainianness advancing in the world because of this game? — Yes, I heard such an opinion that, they say, the first S.T.A.L.K.E.R. was kind of pro-Russian, but this is not a completely correct statement, in my opinion. Because the basis of the game is the real events of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Then there was the Soviet Union, and for some reason Russia took and appropriated the history of the USSR, although it is the history of specific republics. Therefore, this was another attempt by the Russians to appropriate and steal our history. Of course, the first S.T.A.L.K.E.R. was Russian-speaking at that time, because the Russian market is much larger. But I think it was purely a marketing ploy to attract a larger audience of gamers. This should be taken into account. But I will not say that the game was -pro-Russian-. This is just a fictional world that is built on the history of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. And to think that the Russian Federation is a descendant of this history is not correct. And now that all-out war has broken out thanks to the Headmasters, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. became a purposeful promotion of Ukrainian content not only throughout Europe, but also throughout the world. Russia was completely forgotten, and it's great, it was simply taken and cut off. I watched the streams of foreign bloggers (Americans, Germans, French, Koreans), and they all advise not English dubbing, but rather Ukrainian, because it is more emotional and closer. When I was working on the voice over, I was of course shown the English material. And I heard the voice of the person who voices my character in the English version. And for him the word -Pripyat- is just a word, he does not know what it is. I am from Chernihiv. I remember this disaster. I know what Pripyat is, the exclusion zone, the red forest&#8230; For me, these are close words, and this is the Ukrainian context. More than once I have heard that even those people who do not understand the Ukrainian language are advised to turn on Ukrainian dubbing with subtitles. And the music is powerful, this is also a big plus. - Games are a whole culture, a separate universe. Do you have the feeling that you will Ukrainianize this direction? What are you doing with information on Ukraine at a time when a large-scale and informational confrontation is going on?... — Yes, definitely. The war is hybrid, and an important application of this, shall we say, soft influence on the Western world. This is how we advance our narratives, our war, that we are in now. We introduce the Western world to our culture so that they see that it is fundamentally different from Russian culture and art. — Tell us about yourself: when did you join the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine? Why -Azov- in particular? — This, by the way, is the first question that is voiced at an interview. When you walk into a recruiting center and the person representing Azov asks: -Why Azov?- I thought I should give some kind of non-standard answer, according to my civilian profession. And I answered as follows: -Azov- is a subdivision that organically combined one of the principles of ancient philosophy: kalokagatia. This is a combination of physical qualities and moral and ethical ones. They looked at me carefully and answered: -It's not that simple, but we're not on the way to it.- But I am sure that Azov is the realization of the principle of kalokagatia. Just look at the commanders: Redis's friend, Kalina's friend, Gandalf's friend. These are people with an incredible education, with an intellectual base, they are constantly developing. This is the real Ukrainian elite that builds the idea of ​​the Ukrainian nation. They asked me how old I am. I answered that it was 49. They said that they take it up to 45. I answered that at the age of 49 I passed BZVP and did not ring the bell. It was in June 2023. Although the 20-year-olds were knocking. But I'm hardened by the 90s, I'm going strong-willed until the end (laughs - ed.). - And until June 2023, what were you doing? - When in February 2022 year, the enemy was in Chernigov district, I immediately took my family out and stayed in the city. They worked on improving the defense capability. Then, when the enemy left, I received an offer to become an adviser on issues of culture, arts, tourism, and religion to the head of OVA Vyacheslav Anatoliyovych Chaus. A bunch of tasks were cut there, they had to be done. But at the same time, when the information campaign on the creation of offensive brigades began, I began to think that I should somehow be involved in this process. I applied to several divisions, but I received feedback only from Azov. Then I went to the governor and said: -In 3 days I will be called to the basic course.- He was a little stunned, but generally supported my decision. That's how I joined Azov. — What is the most vivid memory of your service in -Azov-? When was it dangerous, when was it scary, and when was it fun? War is a point of contact where everything mixes: tragedy, comedy, life, death, dark humor, tears, disappointment, elation. It's always scary when it flies. When KABU rustles and you don't know where exactly it will fly. One of the bright moments happened to us in the area of ​​concentration, we were then standing in the direction of Serebryan Forestry near Liman. Three rockets arrived, 150 meters from us. There was a big fire, urgent evacuation of property. And we had several kittens (now in the war, they are born in packs). And here's my brother standing with two kittens in this chaos, during the re-detonation, when everything explodes&#8230; He stands holding them both under his arms, and they just hang like two -sausages- and do not understand what is happening. I then thought that if boys in such a dangerous situation are still thinking about kittens, then they are cool boys. We then evacuated the kittens too. All are alive, only the boys had severe contusions, and the property burned down. —Many people do not join the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine due to a number of fears about mobilization. Did you have any fears and how did you deal with them? What would you advise civilians who have not yet joined the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine - as a person who also left their comfort zone at one time? , I used my official position(slyly smiles - ed.). I just had armor from mobilization. But I called the head of the TCC, introduced myself as an adviser to the head of the OVA and described the situation that I had to be in the unit in two days. I was accompanied by a person and everything worked out. This is how I once used my official position. And about fears&#8230; They arise from the fact that many people do not know how it is organized: how the army is organized directly in the conditions of war. For some reason, people think that if you get into the army, you will definitely go to the trenches. But now everything is arranged in such a way that a person is given the opportunity to choose a specialty and a position according to the skills of civilian life. If you are, for example, an electrician or an auto mechanic, you will be taken with your hands in any department, because the equipment is like consumables, it constantly needs to be repaired, and there are not enough people to fix this process 24/7. The army needs people. And the fear of the army comes from ignorance. Communication is a very important issue, and a very difficult one. Information removes any fears. Yes, war is scary, of course. But don't be afraid only of fools. - What for you will be a victory in the Russian-Ukrainian war? - A difficult question. This is a very difficult question&#8230; I think the big break will be a win for me. There is a great silence inside me. And, probably, there will be men's tears&#8230; Because at first you keep this list of guys (dead brothers - ed.), and then you understand when there are more than 40 of them&#8230; Therefore there will be silence inside me. And thanks to those who gave the most. And you will remember everyone by their call sign&#8230; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/08/ukrayinskyj-vijskovyj-sej-zigrav-odnu-z-golovnyh-rolej-u-vidomij-na-uves-svit-gri-s-t-a-l-k-e-r-intervyu/	2024-12-07T20:03:08-08:00

Eggs for less than 17 hryvnias, women's uniforms and inclusive dry rations: the state operator of th...	The state rear operator managed to save 17 billion hryvnias for the year, said the General Director of the agency Arsen Zhumadilov. According to him, the need for the total cost of 92 billion hryvnias was proved to them. It was closed with almost 700 contracts worth 75 billion hryvnias. The saved 17 billion was redirected to cover additional needs. -We bought almost 163,000 body armor. This would be enough to fully supply the armies of Hungary, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Belgium, and Sweden combined,- &#8211; noted Arsen Zhumadilov. The Director General of DOT also recalled that this year clothing and protection for female military personnel were purchased, inclusive dry rations were developed (halal, kosher and plant-based rations) and the DOT chain system was implemented, which reduced the duration of movement of documents in food for the Armed Forces by 4 times. There were also certain problems. For example, scandals involving the supply of low-quality stew and a batch of meat in which a needle from a syringe was found. According to Arsen Zhumadilov, the agency reacted to these cases and implemented additional measures to control suppliers so that such problems do not occur again. At the beginning of next year, the State rear operator plans to introduce its own NPS tool &#8211; collect and analyze feedback from suppliers, brigades, individual units and military personnel. Currently, DOT supplies food, clothing, fuel and lubricants, and IT technologies for the needs of the Armed Forces.

- We are constantly working to ensure that the lands along the state border, in accordance with the ...	He stated this during the telethon -Edyny Novyni-. Along the length of the border, this shade can be from 30 to 50 meters. And if we talk about the border with Belarus and Russia, this section can be wider - up to two kilometers, but it is not necessary that all this land is transferred to the property of the military units of the DPSU. It is necessary to understand that the lands can be state property, communal, private, and there are also lands along the border belonging to the nature reserve fund. And if we talk about the last category, then they can be of state or local importance. And it is precisely in order to transfer the lands of state reserves to military units that there should be a Presidential Decree. Therefore, the relevant Decree of December 5 reduces the land of the Chernobyl reserve and the land with a width of 45 meters along the state border is transferred to the ownership of the military units of the DPSU for the arrangement and maintenance of engineering and fortification facilities. This will allow us to continue increasing the engineering arrangement of the border, maintenance of crossings, border signs, equipping technical systems of terrain control, video surveillance systems. So that we have proper arrangements on the state border in a direction that is threatening to us. We continue to strengthen the border with Belarus along its entire length, because this is a threatening direction for us as long as Belarus remains under the influence of Russia. We must have strong defensive positions there to repel any attack should the situation change. At the moment, Russia does not have a sufficient number of units, forces and means on the territory of Belarus that could pose a threat to us. We remind you, situation in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Khortytsya- military defense unit, it remains tense, but controlled by the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/my-vedemo-postijno-robotu-shhob-zemli-vzdovzh-derzhavnogo-kordonu-vidpovidno-do-zemelnogo-kodeksu-buly-peredani-do-vijskovyh-chastyn-dpsu-andrij-demchenko/	2024-12-07T08:12:57-08:00
the kremlin drags on the war with a cheap mortgage	This is reported by Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Despite huge budget payments to ordinary Russians for those who volunteer to sign a contract to participate in the war, the Kremlin faces a steady decline in the number of people willing to fight. Instead, high losses require a constant supply of manpower. Under such circumstances, the Russian authorities invent new and new forms of encouragement that would force the residents of the Russian Federation to go and kill Ukrainians. Subsidized mortgages are another attempt to solve the issue of reducing army recruitment. Currently, the mortgage rate without benefits reaches 35% in the Russian Federation. There is also a so-called preferential -family mortgage-, where the rate is about 6%, but this program is constantly underfunded from the budget. Because of this, the first installment on a preferential mortgage has already been raised to 50%, which makes it unaffordable for most Russians.

The situation in the area of ​​responsibility of the OSUV - Khortytsia - remains tense, but controll...	This was stated by Lt. Col. Nazar Voloshyn, spokesman for the -Khortytsia- OSU. -Of course, the situation is changing dynamically, and in our area of ​​responsibility, 150 clashes with the enemy took place per day. The enemy attacked the Pokrovsky, Kurakhivskyi and Vremiivskyi directions the most. There were 48 enemy assaults in the Pokrovsky direction, 35 in the Kurakhivskyi direction, and 21 in the Vremiivskyi direction. Also, during the past day, the enemy in our area of ​​responsibility carried out 5 airstrikes, dropped 8 guided and aerial bombs, carried out more than 3,200 attacks on populated areas with various types of weapons and 250 strikes with kamikaze drones,- he emphasized. Already this day, 11 enemy assaults took place, which carried out more than 300 attacks on positions and populated areas using various types of weapons. The enemy is trying to carry out active offensive actions, but the Defense Forces restrain the offensive, inflicting considerable losses on him both in manpower and in equipment. The Kurakhiv direction is important for the enemy to align the front line. This will allow him to regroup, withdraw some units for recovery, and then, having accumulated resources, conduct further offensive actions. The Vremiiv direction in the northwest of the Donetsk region is also a priority for the enemy, because it is one of the elements of the Kurakhiv-Pokrovsky offensive. The day before yesterday, the enemy was more active there, there were 37 enemy assaults. However, the Defense Forces, having recaptured the settlement of Novy Komar, improved their tactical position. In the Pokrovsky direction, the formations of two Russian combined armies are concentrated against us. These are the 2nd and 41st armies of the -Center- troop group. In the Kramatorsk direction, near Chasovoy Yar, the 98th Airborne Division, which was twice defeated by our defenders, and which was repeatedly replenished with personnel, is standing against us. In the Pokrovsky direction, one of our brigades restrains the assaults of four motorized rifle brigades of the Russian army at once, one of which is the 74th motorized rifle brigade. The enemy is trying to move its personnel and equipment between directions in the east of Ukraine. In particular, in the Pokrovsky, Kurakhivskyi, Vremiivskyi and Toretsk directions. Where he suffers a significant defeat, he tries to compensate for the lost forces and resources from other directions. We remind you that Oleksandr Syrsky released the video, on which our drones destroy enemy equipment and infantry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/sytuacziya-v-zoni-vidpovidalnosti-osuv-hortyczya-zalyshayetsya-napruzhenoyu-vtim-kontrolovanoyu-sylamy-oborony/	2024-12-07T07:31:33-08:00

A traitor in uniform: an ex-policeman was sentenced to 15 years in prison for collaborating with the...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. Prosecutors proved that during the occupation of Shevchenkive village of Kupyan district, the former policeman voluntarily went over to the side of the enemy. In July 2022, he submitted an application to the so-called -military-civilian administration of the Kharkiv region- to join a pseudo-law enforcement agency and concluded an -employment contract.- Initially, he was given the position of -acting precinct police inspector-, and in September 2022 he was promoted to -chief of police station No. 2- in the village. Before the liberation of Kharkiv Oblast by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the ex-policeman fled to the Russian Federation together with the Russian military. He is wanted, and the terms of serving the sentence will begin to be calculated after his arrest. As reported by ArmyInform, gave over 120,000 liters of diesel fuel to the occupiers, instead of pouring it over and burning it them: a traitor was sentenced in Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/zradnyk-u-pogonah-ekspolicziyanta-zasudyly-do-15-rokiv-uvyaznennya-za-spivpraczyu-z-okupantamy/	2024-12-07T06:49:05-08:00

Collaborators at the maintenance of Luhansk region prepare children for -their-	This is reported by a> Center of national resistance. The main condition for victory was the ability to control drones. According to the -educators-, it was the control of the drones, as well as the best results in the dress and song competition, that showed that the children were continuing the age-old Cossack traditions. -After all, such talents demonstrate the readiness of young men and women to join the ranks of the Kremlin army at any moment,- the organizers said. The students of the fake Luhansk Cossack Cadet Corps won. Distorting the historical truth, brainwashing is the Kremlin's tradition, which criminally takes root in all territories where the occupiers set foot. The topic of Cossacks is particularly distorted for propagandists. And it is mostly used in schools. Cossacks in Ukrainian schools in the temporarily occupied territories have already become teachers. For example, in the Kherson region, these representatives of the occupation forces conduct lessons on so-called political information. Children are told about how Russian peace is being implemented on Ukrainian lands destroyed by them, films are shown about the beauty of the Russian Federation and how important it is to become a part of Russia. We remind you that the occupiers use the labor of people with disabilities to -own- needs.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/kolaboranty-na-to-luganshhyny-gotuyut-ditej-do-svo/	2024-12-07T05:56:58-08:00

In the village of Kindiyka, a 46-year-old man was injured as a result of such an attack: he received a mine-explosive injury and shrapnel wounds to his arms and legs. The victim was hospitalized. Another victim was a 35-year-old resident of Antonivka. An hour ago, a Russian drone dropped explosives, causing the man a mine-explosive injury and shrapnel wounds to the chest and arm. Yesterday evening, another Kherson resident was injured by a drone strike. A 46-year-old man suffered a mine-explosive injury and hypertensive crisis. A few days ago, as a result of Russian shelling, a 62-year-old resident of the Kherson region suffered an explosive injury and shrapnel wounds to the lower leg. Two men who were attacked by drones the day before also needed medical help. Among them is a 79-year-old resident of Kindyika, who received a mine-explosive injury and shrapnel wounds to the torso, forearm and leg. His condition is currently being checked by doctors. In Bilozerka, the occupiers threw explosives on a civilian car. A 73-year-old man was injured, who received a mine-explosive injury and a concussion. As ArmiyaInform reported, Russian troops shelled a village in Zaporizhzhia: a civilian died.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/chyslenni-zhertvy-atak-na-hersonshhyni-vorog-prodovzhuye-pidstupni-ataky-na-myrne-naselennya/	2024-12-07T05:12:41-08:00
The occupiers use the labor of people with disabilities for their needs	This is reported by Center of National Resistance. Here, patients are forced to carry out plans to manufacture so-called aid for the needs of terrorists. First of all, it is about weaving camouflage nets. The occupiers of using the labor of people with disabilities cynically argue that weaving has healing properties for the sick and develops fine motor skills. The Russian occupiers' use of the labor of the unprotected population of the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine is a -normal practice-. Since the beginning of the year, the Luhansk character of the Kremlin program has been actively implemented in the schools of the Luhansk region. Pupils organize propaganda events, in particular, make trench candles for terrorists of the Russian army. We remind you that the enemy is terrorizing agrarians from temporarily occupied Ukraine with innovations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/okupanty-vykorystovuyut-praczyu-lyudej-z-invalidnistyu-na-potreby-svo/	2024-12-07T04:53:05-08:00
EU countries plan to create a fund to strengthen defense potential	About this informs the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Funds are planned to be raised by placing bonds under national guarantees of participating countries. The model will involve both EU member states and non-EU states (Great Britain, Norway). Participation in the fund will be voluntary, which will allow neutral countries (Ireland, Austria, Malta, Cyprus) to refuse the project, but not to veto it. The estimated amount of funding could be at least 500 billion euros – the minimum required to meet Europe's defense needs over the next decade. Implementation of the project will be an important step towards strengthening the defense potential of the EU. The initiative already has the support of the Netherlands, Finland, and Denmark. We remind you, the second batch of F-16 for Ukraine from Denmark is already in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/krayiny-yes-planuyut-stvoryty-fond-dlya-posylennya-oboronnogo-potenczialu/	2024-12-07T04:29:59-08:00

About this on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- Aeneas told the spokesman for the 36th Separate Brigade of Marines named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinskyi.

In total, in the Kursk direction, the brigade destroyed more than 24 units of armored vehicles, two tanks, 26 units of KAMAZ-type vehicles, passenger cars, ATVs, and also removed more than 1,000 personnel. -The Russians are attacking in columns, head-on, trying to break the morale and fighting spirit of the Ukrainian defenders, as well as to mask some actions where, in their opinion, they have some success. But luckily for us, they have no success, painstaking combat work is going on every day,- noted -Enei-, the spokesman emphasized that they do not ignore any Russian occupier, they understand this, that's why many of their infantry go to deserters. -The enemy is trying to land those who are left closer to our positions so that they somehow conduct combat operations against such legendary brigades as ours and neighboring ones,- the speaker noted. The specificity of the work in the Kursk region is that maneuver work is carried out - both defense and offensive. -This is used by both the enemy and us. However, many enemy infantry do not even reach the point they were assigned. And because of the great losses, they are not morally ready to fight even in the Kursk region, not ready to perform the tasks that their leadership sets them,- Eneis summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, drones and DRGs are not so effective in the rear: what winter changed at the front.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/rosiyany-atakuyut-kolonamy-v-loba-morpihy-rozpovily-pro-speczyfiku-boyiv-na-kurshhyni/	2024-12-07T04:13:08-08:00
Agrarians from temporarily occupied Ukraine are being terrorized by the enemy with an innovation	reports this Center of national resistance. the Kremlin obliged farmers to obtain Russian-style driver's licenses for tractor drivers. The process of replacing the document will continue until the end of December 2025. If the farmers do not fulfill the new conditions of the Russian terrorists, their equipment will be confiscated. Meanwhile, in the temporarily occupied Zaporizhzhia, Putin's henchmen began to fight hysterically over possible farmers' riots. After all, due to total looting, terror and confiscation of property, farmers cannot withstand the conditions in which the Kremlin forced them. We remind you, in the Vasylivsky district, the Russian occupiers fired artillery attack on the village of Primorske.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/agrariyiv-iz-tymchasovo-okupovanoyi-ukrayiny-vorog-teroryzuye-novovvedennyam/	2024-12-07T03:47:31-08:00

The occupiers have blocked exits from Aidar and are simulating the restoration of factories	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, head of the Luhansk OVA. The invaders organize queues of cars and check local residents and guests according to their lists. This time, they are looking not only for ATO/OOS members, but also for their relatives, even distant ones. According to Artem Lysohor, this is how Russian law enforcement agencies try to achieve -results- for reporting at the end of the year. At the same time, the occupation authorities announce the attraction of investors to the industrial enterprises of the front-line cities. However, in reality, no activity was observed on the destroyed objects. During the two years of occupation, demining of the territories has not even begun. It is known that the launch of the -Azot- chemical plant in Severodonetsk has been postponed for the -next few years-. Currently, the occupiers are trying to restore only one of dozens of shops, which has been operating as a separate enterprise since the 1990s. Raids and imitation of industrial recovery become a cover for repression and attempts to create the appearance of economic activity in the occupied territories. As reported by ArmyInform, Kysh Babaj and Tol Babaj: occupiers brought fabulous guests from Tatarstan and Udmurtia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/okupanty-perekryly-vyyizdy-z-ajdaru-ta-imituyut-vidnovlennya-zavodiv/	2024-12-07T03:08:11-08:00

Ukraine adopts the Croatian experience in anti-mine activities: a workshop within the framework of t...	reports this by the Main Directorate of Mine Action, Civil Defense and Environmental Security. The educational session covered the following topics: Specialists of the Croatian Mine Action Center shared their 30-year experience in demining territories affected by the 1991-1995 war for independence. They talked about the creation of national demining standards, conducting non-technical surveys, as well as monitoring the work of non-governmental organizations. Special attention was paid to the use of drones equipped with video cameras, magnetometers and other equipment for surveying contaminated areas. In addition, the possibilities of involving IT solutions, interactive databases, maps and artificial intelligence for the analysis of large volumes of data were discussed. Colonel Yevhenii Zubarevskyi, head of the mine action organization department, noted that the Croatian experience will be taken into account during the development of national standards in this area. The head of the CROMAC operations department, Davor Laura, emphasized that modern technologies and innovative approaches used by Croatia are actively studied by the international community.

Not so effective drones and DRG in the rear: what winter has changed at the front	Oleksandr Danylenko, the head of the group of interaction with the media of the State Border Service -Hart- brigade, told about this on the -Social News- broadcast. In particular, in Vovchansk, the enemy storms up to ten times a day. However, the border guards of the -Hart- brigade repulsed the enemy, intelligence revealed the movement of the enemy, attempts to set up positions. Enemy DRGs are also trying to sneak into the rear, but our guys detect them. Therefore, the situation is under control. -Regroupings associated with fairly large losses occur constantly among the enemy. The number of manpower and equipment is kept at approximately the same level, but this is enough to make breakthrough attempts in the area,- Oleksandr Danylenko noted. In addition, snow and frost leave their mark. At low temperatures, drones, of which there are many, fly less because the batteries drain faster. And when it snows, visibility becomes worse, drones become less effective. -Also, due to the low temperatures, thermal imagers can see people and equipment better, and tracks are better visible on the snow. And this must be taken into account in order to be invisible to the enemy. And the enemy, unfortunately, also takes this into account,- the spokesman noted. Oleksandr Danylenko noted that every day our servicemen with artillery, mortars, and drones destroy enemy positions, equipment, guns, vehicles, mortars, personnel, and destroy their fortifications. -The enemy is suffering significant losses both in manpower and equipment. It's not very easy for him here, that's why he sits and waits, and with the help of the DRG he tries to feel our weak points, but he has no success,- the speaker added. As reported by ArmyInform, in the direction of Kurakhiv Russians maintain their large presence and do not lose their ambitious plans to move forward. However, they are hindered by the successful combat operations of our fighters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/ne-taki-efektyvni-drony-ta-drg-v-tylu-shho-zminyla-zyma-na-fronti/	2024-12-07T02:09:00-08:00

The press officer of the 33rd separate mechanized brigade, Nazar Voytenkov, told about this on the -Suspilne Novy- broadcast. -Our defenders are under constant pressure from the enemy, because there are really many Russians. Despite this, every day our UAV units destroy from 5 to 15 enemy soldiers,- he noted. According to observations from the sky, it is clear that they are trying to organize points of accumulation of their strength, warehouses from BC. -We destroy all this and interfere with their logistics. Despite the cold weather, they move on light non-armored vehicles (quad bikes, motorcycles, buggies, pick-up cars), transport personnel to the accumulation points, which we monitor and destroy with preventive pinpoint strikes,- noted Nazar Voytenkov. According to the spokesman, our tankers are working well. Armored groups advance to the front and destroy the enemy literally a few meters away in fortified places, dugouts and other locations. -In the ranks of our enemy there are both trained military personnel and mobilized ones, with which the enemy is renewing its frantic losses. But one should not underestimate the power of the enemy, because whatever they are, there are still a lot of them,- Nazar Voytenkov summarized.

Fleeed from Romania to the Armed Forces: details of return after illegal border crossing	About this informs DPSU. The detainee turned out to be a citizen of Ukraine, a resident of Vinnytsia, who is a military serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In October, he voluntarily left his post and illegally crossed the border. Later, learning about his brother's mobilization to the army, he decided to return to continue defending the country with him. The detained serviceman was informed about the possibility of avoiding punishment for voluntarily leaving the military unit in accordance with Article 401 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. Currently, the materials on the administrative offense have been compiled, and the man is preparing to resume his service. This case reminds of the new norms of the law, which allow military personnel to return to the ranks of the army without criminal liability in case of voluntary return to service. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces or recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/tikav-z-rumuniyi-u-zsu-podrobyczi-povernennya-pislya-nezakonnogo-peretynu-kordonu/	2024-12-07T00:52:23-08:00
Something like an ear stick or a rag: for Russians, their people are just -raskhodnyk-	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, the spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the air of -Suspilne Novosti-. However, unfortunately, the Russians are much more numerous than our defenders. And they are able to replenish their losses at the front from the reserves. In the Kramatorsk direction near Chasov Yar, the enemy is accumulating a significant number of troops and is trying to storm. The number of assaults is increasing. In the Seversky direction, the enemy received a good repulse and now does not even try to storm our troops. The enemy almost does not use the equipment in the above-mentioned directions, because it is not effective in urban battles. -Artillery and possibly tanks firing from closed positions are being used. Our FPV drones, artillery, do well with them. Every day we get a good catch - from 3 to 5 units of artillery installations are destroyed,- noted Anastasia Bobovnikova. According to her, there are no big changes in weather conditions.

Armored toy for Kim Jong-un: North Korea inspected a new tank	Arms market experts interviewed by reporters of the American magazine Newsweek say that North Korea has introduced a new main combat tank (OBT), the design of which is similar to modern Western counterparts. Tianma-2 -resembles modern Western and American main battle tanks very much,- the Army Recognition Group, a Belgian company, said in turn , which conducts military analysis. Experts from a group that studied images of the Tianma-2 released by the North Korean news agency compared the tank to the German Leopard 2A7/A8, known for its advanced and modern armor, firepower and digital systems. Experts in the basics of tank construction have determined that the layout of the North Korean MBT involves the placement of the driver-mechanic at the front on the left, the turret located in the center, and the power plant located at the rear. The tank is manned by a crew of three, supported by an automatic loading system for the main weapon, a 125 mm smoothbore gun. The turret design includes modular composite armor that provides improved protection against kinetic energy projectiles (APFSDS) and cumulative charges (HEAT projectiles). The modular design allows for quick replacement of damaged armor sections in the field, which is characteristic of many modern main battle tanks. In addition, dynamic armor (ERA) covers the front and sides of the hull, and special wire protection is installed in the rear to protect against rocket-propelled grenades and other cumulative charges. One of the most striking updates of this model of the North Korean battleship is the integration of an active protection system (APS), which is similar to the Trophy APS from Israel and its European counterparts. The Tianma-2's APS system includes radar sensors on each side of its turret for threat detection, as well as countermeasures designed to intercept incoming anti-tank missiles and projectiles. To further strengthen the tank's defenses, the turret roof is equipped with an anti-tank launcher to combat drones, reflecting North Korea's emphasis on countering new aerial threats. The upgraded Tianma-2 turret also includes a Remotely Operated Warfare Station (ROWS) equipped with a 12.7 mm heavy machine gun, as well as launchers capable of firing anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs). The tank is equipped with a panoramic sight system for observing the battlefield and conducting the battle by the commander and gunner, which provides enhanced opportunities to capture targets with their subsequent escort. Originally unveiled as the M2020 during a military parade on October 10, 2020, the Cheonma-2 has undergone significant changes since its first public appearance. It was officially named Cheonma-2 after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's visit to the Defense Development Academy on May 29, 2024. The original Cheonma-2 demonstrated North Korea's desire to modernize its armored forces, and the new Tianma-2 builds on that prototype by integrating advanced technology and improved battlefield survivability. According to Army Recognition experts, the exhibition presentation of Tianma-2 emphasizes that North Korea continues to focus on the development of local military technologies capable of competing with global standards. The inclusion of advanced features such as APS, modular armor and counter-drone capabilities signal a shift to equipping your forces with tanks designed for the high-intensity scenarios of modern warfare. Defense market experts noted that given the technological leaps demonstrated in its design, the appearance of the Tianma-2 in North Korea's arsenal is likely to attract close attention from regional and global military analysts. Although North Korea has not provided official specifications or performance data for the new MBT, visual evidence from the exhibition underscores its desire to create a powerful and modern main battle tank. The event adds a new dimension to the regional security landscape, as Tianma-2 could potentially strengthen North Korea's armored forces, influencing tactical and strategic calculations on the Korean Peninsula and beyond. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xM_Rm2m7bA Video: Presentation of the new main battle tank of the DPRK Tianma-2.

What awards are in the system of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the Armed Forces of Ukraine	Awards are primarily a moral value, because they testify to the recognition by the state and society of a person's real merits. After 2014, with a review of the war in Ukraine, the entire award system of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the Armed Forces of Ukraine was compositionally and ideologically modified to reflect the historical progress of the Ukrainian military. The Department for the Development of Military Symbols and Heraldry of the Central Directorate for the Development of Material Support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is responsible for the development of military awards, which, in response to ArmyInform's request, reported what awards are in the system of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the Armed Forces of Ukraine and what are the principles and ideology of creation modern Ukrainian military awards. Awards in the system of the IOU and ZSU are divided into four main complexes. The first is the departmental incentive awards of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The current decorations of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine are established by the Order of the Ministry of Defense No. 392 dated November 21, 2022. According to it, servicemen and employees of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as other persons, can be awarded the badges -Cross of Special Merit- and -For Exemplary Service-, as well as medals: -Iron Cross-, -Knight's Cross-, -Military Cross-. , -Cross of Valor-, -For Wound-, -Cross of Honor-, -Golden Trident-, -For Strengthening defense capabilities-, -3rd point of the military brotherhood-, -Defender of Ukraine-, -For assistance to the defense-, -Cross of the Ground Forces-, -Cross of the Air Forces-, -Cross of the Naval Forces-, -Cross of Special Operations Forces-, -Cross of the Forces Territorial Defense-, -Logistics Forces Cross-, -Support Forces Cross-, -Medical Forces Cross-, -Airborne Assault Forces Cross-, -Cross Communications and Cyber ​​Security Troops, Cross of the State Special Transport Service, Peacekeeper Warrior, Service Veteran, 20 Years of Faithful Service, 15 Years of Faithful Service, 10 Years of Faithful Service. The second award complex is the incentive awards of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine -Cold weapon- and -Firearm-, established by the order of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine No. 693 dated 10/23/2012. According to this order, the -Firearms- badge is a pistol, a revolver and a hunting firearm, and the -Meadow Weapons- badge is a saber, broadsword and a club. The third award complex is the Honorary Badges of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, established by the order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine No. 187 dated 07/05/2023. This order, in particular, established the following badges of honor: -Cross of Merit-, -Cross of the Brave-, -Steel Cross-, -Silver Cross-, -Golden Cross-, -Military Honor Cross-, -3a conscientious service-, -Combatant cross- with the breastplate -Honor and memory- next to it, -For invincibility-, -For life preserved-, -3a contribution of the army-, -The best sergeant (sergeant) of the Armed Forces of Ukraine-, -For combat valor-, -Shield of the winner-. And, finally, the fourth complex is the Commemorative breastplates of military units, established by the order of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine No. 478 of 03.08.2021, which is entitled -Regulations on the commemorative breastplates of military administration bodies, units, military units , institutions and organizations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine-. According to this provision, commemorative badges were established -with the purpose of developing the symbols of military administration bodies, units, military units, institutions and organizations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, increasing the prestige of military service, strengthening military-patriotic education.- Drawings of breast insignia are developed taking into account the specifics of the activity of the military unit, its affiliation to the relevant type of Armed Forces, type of troops (service), history and combat traditions, place of deployment, etc. When creating award systems, specialists were primarily guided by the provisions of Decrees of the President of Ukraine No. 694 dated May 18, 2000. -On streamlining heraldry in Ukraine- and No. 365 of May 30, 2012. -About departmental encouraging awards-. However, ideologically and artistically, awards were created based on the position of continuity of modern awards from the symbols and award traditions of the period of the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917–1921, awards of the UHP government in exile, awards of Ukrainian national emigrant organizations of 1930–1990, awards of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army of 1942–1950 years Some awards are based on historical prototypes. In particular, the -Iron Cross- medal originates from the single combat award of the UNR Iron Cross -For the Winter Campaign and Battles-, established by the order of the Main Command of the Army and Fleet of the UHP dated 10.19.1920, signed by Simon Petlyura, the chief commander of the troops of the UNR Directory. The official incentive award of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine -Golden Trident- originates from the award project of the Western region of the Ukrainian People's Republic, established on April 30, 1919, which was not implemented more than a hundred years ago. A number of insignia of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are based on the awards of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. For the first time, the UPA Main Command introduced the awards system by its order No. 3/44 dated January 27, 1944. The design projects of these awards and the technology of their minting in underground conditions were developed by a member of the regional reference office of propaganda of the OUN Branch of the North-Western Ukrainian Lands, the famous graphic designer Nil Khasevych (1905–1952) and his student -Svyrid-. They were approved by the UGVR on June 30, 1950. An equally important element of the award ideology and award practice was the study of modern phalerist traditions of partner countries and their comparison with the national phalerist heritage. In particular, an in-depth analysis was carried out regarding the military awards of the USA, Great Britain, the Republic of Poland, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the French Republic.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/yaki-nagorody-ye-v-systemi-minoborony-ukrayiny-ta-zbrojnyh-syl-ukrayiny/	2024-12-06T21:03:42-08:00
Mobilization of volunteers in the Transcarpathian way: about -chips- recruiting, monetary reward and...	But the main thing is that they give a 100% guarantee that you will be sent to serve in the military unit in which you want to serve or they will choose the appropriate unit for your specialty. In addition, they also give a monetary reward of 20 thousand hryvnias for the fact that you are called up for service under a contract from the Tyachiv district of Transcarpathia. Active military personnel and their families are provided free of charge with rehabilitation programs and rest in the sanatoriums of Solotvyno in Transcarpathia. How did you manage to establish an effective recruiting mechanism? Why do people believe the servicemen of Tyachiv RTCC and SP and go to Transcarpathia from all over Ukraine? What is their main -feature-? ArmyInform asked the head of the Tyachiv district TCC and SP Colonel Andrii Oleschuk about this: -Our recruiting system works simply and efficiently. About a year ago, we realized that we needed to change our approach to recruiting candidates for military service under a contract. We analyzed our work and formed several important criteria, which gave, in fact, the result of recruiting volunteers. Right now, we are exceeding our contract staffing plan by 300%. So, first, we introduced advertising in social networks, in the media, and created printed campaign products. Social advertising is aimed at different strata of the population and it is conventionally divided into three directions: — Russia has attacked and the Motherland must be defended; — advertising that shows the destroyed cities and villages of our Ukraine; — a social package and state social guarantees: financial support, rewards, vacations, career growth. Plus an additional incentive from us to recruiters in the amount of 20 thousand hryvnias. The first two ads worked well in 2022-2023. People are looking more at cash benefits and social security issues this year. The second is communication with military units. We work with many military units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. First of all, these are the local unit of the TrO Forces, the 128th separate Transcarpathian mountain assault brigade, the 47th separate mechanized brigade -Magura- and many other units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Third, the creation of comfortable conditions, documentary support for conscripts, humane treatment of candidates and their social support. Of course, no lies, work on mutual trust and feedback from the recruiters themselves. This, by the way, is the most important criterion of our work. If the recruiter has a letter of recommendation from a military unit in his hands and he has had experience in military service for the past 10 years, then the process of filing documents together with the VLK (if everything is in order with his health - ed.) goes as quickly as possible. Unless, of course, an additional medical examination is required. If everything is OK: before 12 o'clock and the serviceman is already leaving for his military unit. Is it fast, I think so. Very often there are situations when people come from other regions, because at the local TCC it takes more time to process documents and send them to the army. And guys don't want to wait. For example, in Kyiv, one man was processed for 5 days, as soon as he learned about the speed of work of Tyachiv RTCC and SP, he immediately went to us with the documents. In general, they come from different regions of Ukraine. From Kherson, Kyiv, Dnipro, Ivano-Frankivsk, Lviv, Chernihiv, etc. We estimated that almost 60% of the people who came to us could not register for service in the TCC and SP at their place of residence. Next, if, for example, a person who has never served, but wants to join the ranks of the Marines, then together we will find him the unit in which he wants to go. This applies to all majors. Sapper, signalman, paratrooper, tanker, anti-aircraft gunner, stormtrooper, medic, cook, military sailor, etc. Again, it doesn't matter how long the search itself takes. The recruiter lives, eats and rests on weekends as much as necessary. The main criterion is that a person should be satisfied with the choice and be sure to serve where he wants. We had an incident. A man who worked in civil aviation arrived. Well, we spent a month and a half looking for a suitable specialty for him and a part in which he wanted to serve. And all this time he lived here in Tyachevo. We take people where they want to go. And we guarantee them that they will get to serve there. There are, of course, isolated cases when recruiters, who already come to the Training Centers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to pass the BZVP, are not always assigned to the military units to which they wanted. We, for our part, can no longer influence these things. Financial support is provided by the Tyachiv District and Transcarpathian Regional Council. These are primarily united territorial communities, private entrepreneurs and philanthropists from our area, who renovated sleeping quarters, toilets and showers. That is, they provided normal living conditions for volunteers. Plus, they provide funds for a cash reward of 20,000 hryvnias to everyone who enlisted from us to join the army. Food itself: purchase of products, their delivery, cooking itself. This is all for the charity funds of our entrepreneurs. And what is interesting, military personnel who have already served some time on the front lines can come here to us on vacation with their families and undergo rehabilitation in sanatoriums and recovery centers in Solotvino and other places located in Tyachiv district. Plus recreation centers in Khust. Military personnel even come to us after being wounded. There are rehabilitation centers with hot salt springs in Solotvino. With the permission of recruiters: we organize watching movies in cinemas, swimming in pools, hiking in the mountains. This is all absolutely free for our defenders who voluntarily went to serve under a contract. All candidates for contract service take a course in tactical medicine at our RTCC and JV in cooperation with the national resistance center of the Transcarpathian region: they learn to provide first aid, work with tourniquets. At the end of the course, everyone is given a first-aid kit with the necessary drugs free of charge. Plus, they take classes on national resistance. These are the basics of military affairs. They are also taught the basic skills of handling weapons. For this, we have the appropriate weapon models. If we take young people, they are interested in the newly created units of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Unmanned Systems. About 40% want to serve there. Older people, who have already served in the army, are more likely to choose those specialties in which they completed their military service or those in which they fought during the ATO/OOS period. There is another category of recruiters who are ready to fight in assault brigades. In principle, it does not matter to them which VOS to obtain. Or those who only want to join the Army or the Marines. And there are quite a few of them. I remember, even a year ago, there was a huge lack of trust in the work of our RTCC and SP. After all, society, unfortunately, has developed a negative attitude, in principle, towards the work of TCC and joint ventures. There was a stereotype - they say that even volunteers are deceived, they do not get where they want to serve. In addition to the long processing of documents and VLK, quality is a problematic issue, people lose hope and lose the desire to protect the state from the enemy. This is where our -main chip- lies. We undertook to reverse this negative trend with the recruitment of volunteers and to show that RTCC and JV can work effectively. At the same time, creating the necessary household and social conditions. Everything for people - comfort and service. People who voluntarily went to this terrible war to defend Ukraine from the enemy deserve special respect. This is the key point. Yes, step by step, we fixed the system and it worked. Feedback from military units helped us a lot in this. Who recommended us to potential candidates to come to us and get registered quickly. I remembered one incident. A volunteer with a letter of recommendation to one of the mechanized brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We called the representatives of the unit, they say, they say, -make arrangements, but we don't believe that he will get to us.- We, in turn: -ok, when the military comes to you in the unit - go on a video call for confirmation.- At that time, the team was really surprised. After that, even more volunteers were called to that part through our RTCC and SP. Gradually, the principle of -word of mouth- worked for the very recruiters who signed a contract with us. These are hundreds and hundreds of real testimonials. Here, we can say, came a turning point in trust in our work. Next, our authority was already working for us. Plus a monetary reward of UAH 20,000, it also worked effectively. There are people with different social status. Many people come to us without money. There is an important nuance here. Everyone knows that in the Armed Forces, monetary support is calculated for the actually served last month. And what to do with those military personnel who undergo BZVP in Educational Centers. That is, they have no money in the first month of training. We are solving this problem with the help of these 20 thousand hryvnias. These funds are received by our volunteers in Tyachevo, before being sent either to Training Centers or directly to military units. All volunteers receive monetary incentives without exception. In addition, we provided proposals for the implementation of the mechanism for the purchase of cars for personal use by servicemen who entered into the first contract. We will remind that contract holders have the right within three months from the date of conclusion of the contract to receive a certificate for the purchase of a vehicle in the amount of 150 thousand hryvnias. The mechanism itself is still under development. We, in turn, offer to ensure communication between the owners of car dealerships and the military. That is, to undertake a commitment and help our defenders buy a car. It is necessary to dispel an absolutely harmful myth, which was successfully launched into the information space of Ukraine by Russian propaganda. It concerns the passing of the VLK of those who are conscripted into the army. For example, the TCC and SP -turn a blind eye- to obvious health problems and seek to drag everyone to the ZSU in a row. This is not true. Once a 45-year-old man from Cherkassy came to us. He was obviously from a poor family. He ate at our place more than three times a day. So, in the course of VLC, he was diagnosed with throat cancer, accordingly, he was informed about the diagnosis and was not invited. They bought a train ticket and he went home for treatment. There was a volunteer, a 28-year-old guy from the Kherson region. A letter of recommendation is in hand. He passed the tests, his blood sugar is high, up to 60. We tell him, boy, go home, get treatment, and then come to us. The part was informed that we could not call him. Many candidates have AIDS and other diseases that make them ineligible for military service. This is all clearly established. Because the most important thing for us is the health and life of people. Therefore, we invite all willing conscripts who are fit for service in terms of health to stand up for the defense of Ukraine. One of the main differences between contract service and mobilization during martial law is the ability to choose a unit and specialty.

The enemy is dispersing the attack on - NATO's plan for the introduction of troops into Ukraine -	In fact, the narrative of the Western -occupation- of Ukraine has been promoted by Moscow since the Revolution of Dignity. It is Russia that has been violating the territorial integrity of Ukraine since 2014, and in 2022 it tried to completely occupy the country. In addition, Russia is dispersing a manipulative -throw-in- as if -Western Ukraine will join NATO separately from other regions, like West Germany during the Cold War- with a reference to the American publication Politico. Actually in the article of the Politico publication entitled -Ukraine's peace plans: Many ideas for ending the fighting, but the sides, as before, are far from each other- there are several models for ending hostilities in Ukraine. One of the options is when Ukraine receives an invitation to join the alliance within its internationally recognized borders, instead security guarantees are extended to those territories under the control of the Ukrainian authorities. Thus, Russian mass media and social media users once again take quotes from foreign media out of context, this time to spread the narrative about the division of Ukraine. Such statements are aimed at causing Ukrainians to mistrust Western allies, shaking the unity of the country and its partners.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/vorog-rozganyaye-vkyd-pro-plan-nato-shhodo-vvedennya-vijsk-v-ukrayinu/	2024-12-06T20:28:58-08:00
-Twice for seven-, or How the master sergeant Red twice led his comrades out of the encirclement in ...	In the ranks of the Ryzhy Armed Forces from the first day of the large-scale invasion: -At 7 a.m. on February 24, I heard explosions and went outside. A comrade drove by in a car, he says, war. I immediately went to the TCC for a military ID and passport. I had a first-line reserve after my military service. They said I was needed. We were put on a bus and we went to Goncharivske. Then I didn't think about anything in particular: they said it must be, therefore it must be.- At that moment, Ryzhy's family was waiting for the arrival of their daughter. The wife saw off with tears in her eyes. Mom was also upset. But the man says that they still couldn't refuse him. Then there was a clear realization: first of all, it is necessary to protect the closest people. In 2022, as part of a rifle battalion, he went to defend the state in Donetsk region. He says that even then the situation was tense, but the enemy had fewer drones at that time. For the most part, the enemy stormed with infantry: -By the end of 2023, they had a lot more technical means. We were constantly under enemy drones: you enter a position under drones, take turns constantly under drones, leave the same way under drones. In winter, everything is complicated by the fact that the leaves fall, so it is more difficult to disguise the position.- One of the episodes that Ryzhom remembers the most happened on December 1-2, 2023. Then a group of enemy infantry consisting of eight people came almost close to the position of the rifle battalion: -There were four of us and eight of them. Landing. From one end of the hole, from the other end of the hole - they haven't had time to dig yet. The branches were used to make a shack so that the fpv wouldn't fly in. It was foggy. A drone hovered above us. While I was contacting the senior to find out if it was our bird or not, I lowered my head and saw the enemy 10 meters away. A battle ensued. They immediately threw us at RGD-5. For a moment, I might as well call it quits. But I realized that I want to live more than they do. And immediately shot two stores in the Somali style, then began aiming fire. The guys and I put 5 of them, one gave up. Two of them were beaten up, they were still shouting: -friend-brother, pamagi-. It was not possible to take those two and to provide them with help - all the time the Russians were firing from grenade launchers and mortars. Therefore, our infantrymen did not come out of the shelter. Instead, the Russian, who surrendered first, even managed to tell a little about himself. However, as it turned out later, the versions about why he took part in the war were made up on the fly: -I remember that he said his name was Vova, he was 40 years old. He went to war so as not to be imprisoned. But when he was brought to our far position, he told a completely different story there. That he was caught, brought by force. They promised that trenches would be dug, but they threw themselves into the storm.- Currently Ryzhy, together with his brothers, performs combat missions in the territory of the Kursk region. Twice he had to remove people from the environment. And twice he was able to get everyone out alive. -The first time, a platoon leader came and said that it was necessary to go on an assault. We went as a group of 16 people on two BMPs. Three tanks moved to cover us. They drove to the place, took positions. It was difficult, many enemy fpvs, three hundred appeared among us. The wounded were evacuated. Reinforcements came to us and we continued our work. But the next day, neither evacuation nor support groups could reach us. We took up a street and a half. The enemy realized that there were not so many of us and began to knock out every house. They worked on us actively with mortars, rockets, and fpv, there was constant shelling from small arms. It was not possible to get us through the windows, because we strengthened them well with boards, beds, and bedside tables. But then the Russians started breaking through the roofs, dropping the so-called -lighters-. And when one house was occupied, it was necessary to move to the next one,- Ryzyy recalls. -When the combatant realized that the equipment could not reach us, he began to take us out in small groups. It turned out that I became the leader of the group. He took out at least seven people. They walked -on brimstone-, through the enemy's street. The commander accompanied us by radio. They walked through the swamp. It was difficult because I was thirsty. Twice the fellows managed to drop half a liter of water each from the drone. I tell the guys: don't drink a lot, wet your lips and move on. As soon as we got out of the swamp, it was easier, but we had to move across open terrain. There was a moment when an enemy drone overtook us, one fighter was injured - shrapnel hit his shoulder blade and leg. But we managed to get to our neighbors, where we were able to rest a little. I drank one and a half liters of water in a minute. Then the combatant got in touch, said to go further. And so he brought us to the evacuation point, from where we were already taken to the place of deployment. The only thing I thought about then was how to get all the people out alive. And also about the fact that I had one RGD-5, one F-1, three stores. I will shoot the stores, throw a grenade. One more remains. Let the enemies come,- says the man. The redhead led seven fighters, brought them all to the evacuation point. Even later, finding himself in relative safety, the first desire was to call his relatives. The husband had not been in touch for a long time, so he understood that the family was worried: -I talked a lot with my daughter. She called everyone home. He told his wife that he did not call because roaming abroad is very expensive. I started joking, because I realized that it was safe, that everything was over. At that moment I was already released.- During the third trip to the territory of Kurshchyna, the man again had to take out his comrades: -A combatant came out to me, around 9 o'clock, told me to leave. Offered at my discretion: either now or in the evening. The guys and I consulted, decided what to expect. Moreover, the enemy BMP had already moved in, unloading the infantry. We decided to go in the afternoon. Just gathered as three drones hovered above us. We waited until they took off, heard that it was quiet, and left after landing. He went out to the commander, asked where to go. The most frightening thing was to move through a clear field, there it was necessary to overcome about a kilometer and 200 meters. Just like the first time, 7 people were taken out, the same way the second time. My lucky number.- Ryzyy is now the chief sergeant of the rifle battalion company. Among his tasks is the training of personnel. Goes to training grounds with soldiers, shares his experience, tells in detail how to prepare for combat. He says this about his motivation: -I have two daughters. Wife. Mother. Three sisters. Brother. If we do not destroy the enemy, he will come to our homes. And if we talk about the Kursk operation, it is better for us to destroy the enemy on his own land than for them to come to us again.- Dina Wong for ArmyInform	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/07/dvichi-po-sim-abo-yak-golovnyj-serzhant-ryzhyj-dvichi-vyviv-pobratymiv-z-otochennya-na-kurshhyni/	2024-12-06T20:12:13-08:00

Seventeen wounded. Two died. And these are only two Russian strikes on two Ukrainian cities in one day,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyi. In his opinion, the thousands of such strikes that were carried out by Russia during this war clearly state that it is Putin who does not need real peace, he only needs the opportunity to do this to any country - bombs, missiles, all other violence. -It can only be resisted by force.

As reported by ArmyInform, the President assigned ranks to military personnel and handed over battle flags.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/06/prezydent-ukrayiny-obgovoryv-pryskorennya-nadannya-dopomogy-z-kerivnyczeyu-italijskogo-uryadu/	2024-12-06T08:21:32-08:00
The voice of defense: how -Armiya FM- became a radio station for all Ukrainians	To the Day of the Armed Forces, the information service of NSJU prepared a story about the main military radio of our country. The history of the radio station began in 2016 — -Army FM- was called to support military personnel in the area of ​​an anti-terrorist operation. Since then, radio has significantly expanded its audience. Today's -Army FM-, which works as part of the Central Television and Radio Studio of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine headed by Lieutenant Colonel Serhii Zhukovsky, is a radio station that speaks in 37 settlements throughout Ukraine. This is no longer exclusively a radio for military personnel, but for every Ukrainian, because practically every family has a military person. -Army FM- broadcast is structured taking into account the needs of the audience. The main prime time is in the morning and evening hours, when people go to work or return home. From 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., the morning show of the famous radio presenter Serge Gagarin, who tells listeners about important events, communicates with listeners, from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., the evening show of experienced radio host Igor Kozak, and from 8:00 p.m. until 10:00 p.m. — -Evening Poe-, author's program by a famous Ukrainian singer and military serviceman Oleksandr Polozhynskyi. Under the leadership of Major Andrii Davydov, -Army FM- works with the military and political leadership, receives information about the development of the defense complex, what weapons our units are equipped with, how training is conducted. -Army FM- maintains constant contact with the audience through all available communication channels. Communication is especially active during the morning and evening shows, when listeners can join in discussing current topics. The radio station is present on all social networks and messengers, so any listener can conveniently write, express their opinion or ask questions to an expert in the studio. Among the listeners' questions are many about how to get to serve in one or another unit of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. And this despite the fact that nowadays this information can be easily found on the Internet or on street billboards. But on the radio, there is a program with military servicemen who tell how they came to serve in their units, about their military experience, about the combat path of the brigades and joint achievements. The radio also distributes recruiting videos through its social networks, from which you can learn that the army is not only about combat tasks, there is also other work that many can do. The main audience of the radio station is men and women aged 30+: current and future military personnel, volunteers and their family members. It is interesting that before the start of the full-scale invasion, the radio was listened to even in the temporarily occupied territories. Listeners from Luhansk, Donetsk, Makiivka, Debaltseve called and wrote messages. The work of military radio does not go unnoticed by the enemy. The site has been repeatedly attacked by cyber attacks. The most recent case was on the Day of Remembrance of the Holodomor Victims. The site was attacked allegedly from Indonesia, although it is clear that in fact it was from a completely different country. In the front-line territories, the Russians are trying to jam Ukrainian radio broadcasts and broadcast their own. The enemy allocates huge funds for disinformation, has at least twenty years of experience in imperial propaganda. The programming content of -Army FM- is diverse and meaningful. Every day at 4:30 p.m., the program -Stratcom Speaks- is broadcast - an up-to-date summary of the most important military and socio-political events in Ukraine and the world. Captain Kateryna Bilenko's program -There is no reason to worry- is broadcast twice a week, which tells about the legal features of military service. A special place in the broadcasting network is occupied by the program -Timely about- - the author's project of Dmytro Simanskyi. The program discusses global topics: international military cooperation, recruiting and mobilization, energy, political processes. Guests are top officials, military, diplomats and politicians. Verified objective news from primary sources and refutation of Russian fakes is the most important direction of the radio station, which is overseen by Captain Maria Veres and highly experienced journalist Oleksiy Mustafin. Andriy Vyrva provides timely sports news. Every day on -Army FM- you can hear -the same historian from Tik-Tok- Oleksandr Alfyorov, a soldier of the 3rd Assault Brigade, with a unique author's column -A Minute of Ukrainian History-. The radio station always supports a variety of events for military and veterans at all levels. A prime example of this is the partnership with Invictus Games. Its manifestation on the air is the big weekly project -Games of the Invincibles- from the inside. Also, -Army FM- likes to provide media support to interesting initiatives of units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. A lot of attention on the radio is paid to the musical content. Radio presenter, now captain of the ZSU, Serzh Gagarin, who has more than 22 years of experience in radio broadcasting at leading Ukrainian radio stations, joined the Army FM team at the end of 2022 after serving in the Chernihiv National Guard. At the same time, a professional approach to the formation of the program grid and music playlist was applied to the broadcast. The format of -Army FM- is Modern Rock / Power Pop, which is based on rock compositions, recognizable world hits and a large share of modern music from Ukrainian rock artists who have an unblemished reputation. Ukrainian music occupies more than 40 percent of the airwaves. Nobody arbitrarily rearranges songs on the air. The music selection that the radio -plays- is determined in advance, taking into account categories, hours and audience preferences. With the passage of time since the large-scale invasion, the musical preferences of listeners have changed. -Bayraktarshchy- became less. At the beginning, there were a lot of jokes in the style of -what a Cossack you are-, -what a Cossack you are-, -Russian ship-, etc. Now is the time for more serious music that conveys important messages to listeners. Some songs can make you feel sad, and some songs can inspire you for important things and victories. At -Army FM- they are convinced that music can save, -pull out of a psychological pit.- Someone is inspired by Oleksandr Polozhynskyi's -Knight's Cross-, someone likes -Pianoboy- with the song -I can do everything-, someone likes -Surface Tension- with the motivational composition -Tomorrow-, someone likes the group -Pyratyn- and its humorous song -Arta-, someone else the work of the Finnish group -Moon Shot- called -Yes!-, recorded in support of Ukraine, or Yarmak's track -Babylon-. The Ukrainian military believes that today it is important to talk to people about Ukraine's victories - and not only at the front, but also in sports, art, film production, and the IT sphere. All of these parts make up our overall prospective Victory. The radio station is actively developing and planning new projects. I would like to see more programs, but the human resource of the Central Television and Radio Studio of the Ministry of Defense is limited, in addition, military personnel are assigned to combat units on a rotational basis. But from the New Year, some pleasant surprises are waiting for the listeners. At -Army FM- they intend to introduce an international project about global changes, talk about the political component of events in the world, how it affects Ukraine and democratic countries. They are also planning a full-length program on the fight against Russian fakes, they want to talk more about Western weapons and Ukrainian developments. As of now, military radio speaks in 37 settlements, including the big cities of Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Zaporizhzhia, Poltava, Rivne, Kryvyi Rih and others. Also, the -Army FM- signal receives a considerable number of small front-line and border towns and villages, where radio is more or less the only way to receive information, so the mission of the radio station does not lose its strategic importance. Another expansion of coverage and the start of broadcasting in Mukachevo is on the way. There are plans to obtain more permits for temporary broadcasting in order to inform Ukrainians about the state of affairs in the army and the state in general. Today, Army FM is much more than just a radio station. It is an information outpost that reminds every day: together we are strong, together we are free, together we will win. It is a voice that, through music, news and communication, supports the fighting spirit of defenders and the entire Ukrainian people.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/06/golos-oborony-yak-armiya-fm-stala-radiostancziyeyu-dlya-vsih-ukrayincziv/	2024-12-06T08:04:08-08:00

The next day, the enemy sent 20 soldiers on three armored personnel carriers for reinforcements. The Russians thought that the positions were under their control and began to rush their infantry without haste. However, UA_REG immediately began liquidating the Russians and their equipment. The Russians decided to make a beautiful landing with the BMP, but they were prevented by -Cats- from the 130th battalion of the TRO. At first, they hit the infantry with skirmishes, later they burned the bekha with a direct hit. Then the -Cats- used drones to search for Russians and successively destroy them. The Sturm-S anti-tank missile system was shown for the first time in the Armed Forces. Our fighters are already learning to work with him on training grounds. It is known that -Sturm-S- is adapted and modernized to the needs of modern warfare. These and other topics are discussed by our presenters - lieutenant colonel Serhiy Misyura and lieutenant Yevhen Nazarenko.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/06/zasidka-sso-na-rosiyan-baba-yaga-palyt-voroga-nova-zbroya-proty-tankiv-strim-iz-pryfrontovogo-mista/	2024-12-06T07:23:02-08:00

The TOT -military commissariats- reported on the first batch of illegals who signed a contract with ...	About this reports Center of National Resistance. The workers, who were initially taken to the construction site, are now under pressure to sign a contract with the Russian army. The reason is that there is less need for their services due to a decrease in the pace of construction during the construction crisis that began in Russia. Illegals are threatened with deportation with a ban on entry, instead they are offered to sign a contract and promise not to send them to the front line. However, this is a delusion, because the empire always fights with other people's hands. We remind you that in the temporarily occupied territories, the Russians continue to destroy any Ukrainian identity.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/06/na-tot-vijskkomaty-vidzvituvaly-pro-pershu-partiyi-nelegaliv-yaki-uklaly-kontrakt-iz-zs-rf/	2024-12-06T06:52:26-08:00

And there are already many confirmations of Russian UAVs being hit by our ELF-P drone. -Brave1 helped the manufacturer take all the necessary steps to codify according to NATO standards, as well as test it in combat conditions.

He organized the forced mobilization of citizens for the war against Ukraine - the leader of the DNR...	reports this by the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor's Office. On February 19, 2022, with the aim of waging an aggressive war against Ukraine, the -head of the DNR- entered into a conspiracy with the highest political leadership of the Russian Federation. He announced a general mobilization on the territory of Donetsk region temporarily occupied by Russian troops. Following the instructions of the Kremlin, the head of the pseudo-state entity signed a number of legally void -decrees-. At the same time, in order to increase the number of occupation troops, the accused changed the maximum age of conscripts from 55 to 65 years. Thanks to these actions, members of illegal armed formations in the regular army of the Russian Federation carried out a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In compliance with the -decree- of the leader of the pseudo-republic, subordinate employees of the -military commissars- and commanders of enemy units threaten the citizens of Ukraine with criminal responsibility for refusing to fight against our state. All these actions are a gross violation of the requirements of Articles 4, 8, 51, 147 of the Geneva Convention on the Protection of the Civilian Population in Time of War of August 12, 1949, as well as Art. 23 of the Hague Convention on the Laws and Customs of War on Land of October 18, 1907.

-Managed the torture- during the capture of Balaklia: prosecutors referred the case against the occu...	reports this by the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office. According to the investigation, the accused was a military commandant in Balaklia, a city that was under Russian occupation for more than half a year. Among the Russian military, the figure is better known as -Granit-. He signed orders and instructions authorizing Russian servicemen to illegally detain and torture civilians.

Thus, in April 2022, the military commandant ordered his subordinates to detain a local resident who actively expressed a pro-Ukrainian position. The occupiers kidnapped the man, put handcuffs on his hands and a bag on his head, and brought him to the torture chamber, before beating him in the face. Then the Russian military brought the man for -interrogation- to the military commandant.

The man was kept in a torture cell for 21 days without sufficient food and water, without fresh air, a bed and basic sanitary conditions. Regarding another victim, the commandant carried out almost the same execution. In addition, he informed the detainee that in case of disobedience, the victim's relatives would be taken to the Russian Federation, and the man would go to prison. Later, both detainees were released. The indictment was sent to the Balakliya District Court of the Kharkiv Region for consideration.

Illusory victories of the Russian Federation: what the enemy invents to divert attention from large-...	Moreover, the MORF regularly reports on the -destruction- of HIMARS launchers, the number of which has already exceeded that received by Ukraine. About writes Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security. These statements are aimed at supporting the illusion of Russia's -greatness-, because Russian propaganda has always operated on the principle of quantitative exaggeration. For example, back in 2017, Sergei Shoigu reported on the -laying off- of 500,000 km² in Syria, although the area of ​​the entire country is only 185,000. km². At the same time, the real facts remain outside the official summaries. By report of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, in November, the Russian army suffered the largest irreversible and sanitary losses in force since the beginning of the large-scale invasion: during this month, our soldiers -two hundred- and -three hundred- 45,720 enemy soldiers. But this data is overlooked by propagandists who focus on creating their own illusory victories. After all, the Russians can indeed shoot down Ukrainian missiles with oil depots, airfields or military factories. Such fake -reports- not only create a false picture of reality for the domestic audience, but are also designed to divert attention from Russia's large-scale losses and failures at the front.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/06/ilyuzorni-peremogy-rf-shho-vygaduye-vorog-aby-vidvernuty-uvagu-vid-masshtabnyh-vtrat/	2024-12-05T21:02:38-08:00
A serious reason for neurosis in the Kremlin: Germany is waiting for a missile capable of -penetrati...	However, as informs the portal of the influential German publication Der Spiegel, the Bundeswehr does not yet have an appropriate budget for this is an important project, ArmyInform reports. According to the publication, the Ministry of Defense of the Federal Republic of Germany presented to the budget committee of the Bundestag the profile of the corresponding project in confidential documents for the state budget for 2025. Accordingly, from a military point of view, it makes sense to order 600 Taurus Neo cruise missiles for approximately €2.1 billion. The first units of long-range weapons may be delivered in 2029. The decision to develop Taurus Neo, according to German observers, marks a significant step in modernizing Germany's military potential and strengthening its strategic position in a tense geopolitical context. According to German media reports, the Taurus Neo project is aimed at expanding the capabilities of the existing Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missile. In particular, according to German parliamentary sources, the modification involves increasing the flight range, increasing the accuracy of hitting targets and the power of the warhead. The Taurus Neo's technical improvements are expected to include a flight range exceeding 500 km. The guidance system will be modernized, it will integrate advanced technologies of inertial navigation and GPS correction to increase accuracy for detecting hard-to-reach targets. It is also assumed that the missile will be equipped with a more powerful warhead designed to penetrate heavily fortified structures such as bunkers or underground storage facilities. In addition, the Taurus Neo can include anti-missile defense bypass technologies, which increases the missile's ability to evade enemy radars and anti-aircraft defenses. Currently, the German armed forces have at their disposal approximately 600 Taurus KEPD 350 missiles, which are mainly used on Tornado fighters. Although the missile has also been tested on the Eurofighter EF2000, this aircraft is not yet used as a standard launch platform for the Taurus. The upcoming conclusion from the operation of Tornado fighters raises the question of the launch platform for the Taurus Neo. As such, the Eurofighter is the Bundeswehr's most likely option, while integration with the F-35As recently ordered by Germany is unlikely without a full redesign of the missile to match the internal compartment of the American stealth fighter. Experts of the IKK defense portal Defense Express (DE) reminded that the first batch of Taurus missiles in 600 units cost the Germans €570 million, deliveries continued until December 2010. As reported by ArmyInform , Taurus missiles in Germany were repeatedly requested by Ukraine. However, the chancellor of the country, Olaf Scholz, makes categorical statements from time to time that Germany will not transfer these long-range weapons to Ukraine, and the other day he noted that he will not change his position on this issue. As of today, according to data by the authors of the DE portal, Germany does not produce Taurus cruise missiles. Last year, the CEO of MBDA Deutschland, Joachim Knopf, stated that it would take a year to resume production of these weapons, taking into account delays in the delivery of electronics or explosives. As reported, in the long term, Germany could consider integrating the Taurus Neo into the FCAS (Future Combat Air System) is a next-generation fighter project developed in cooperation with France, Spain and Belgium. Despite the fact that in the coming decades, the US Air Force is expected to play a central role in the modernization of European air forces. In Germany, it is believed that the Taurus Neo technology could have significant implications for European defense. As a high-precision, long-range weapon, this missile can enhance deterrence capabilities while offering additional strategic capabilities for the continent's collective defense. However, the financing of the Taurus Neo project remains a serious problem for the German government. So, according to data reporters of the defense portal The War Zone, the budget of the Federal Republic of Germany for 2025 will require include the €350 million required to launch development, and current budget constraints may affect costs in the coming years. However, the support expressed by the government coalition in Germany indicates a favorable outcome for the implementation of the project, despite possible debates in the German parliament regarding the feasibility of prioritizing such costs in difficult economic conditions. The announcement of the Taurus Neo project came just two days after the signing of a historic defense agreement between Germany and the United Kingdom aimed at accelerating the development of a new, more advanced long-range missile than the Storm Shadow. This agreement was followed by the announcement of the UK joining the European Strike Program (ELSA): a French-led initiative that includes Germany, Poland and Italy. As part of ELSA, it is planned to develop a missile with a flight range of 1,000 km. up to 2 thousand km by 2030. Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missile.

-The U.S. military was cool long before 2022-: about the war of the Hornet, Chip and Dale and the fi...	Experienced artilleryman Major Kostyantyn Rymarenko told ArmyInform about what the long years of war in Donbas since 2014 gave the Ukrainian army, why the armed forces were cool long before the large-scale attack of the Russian Federation on Ukraine, as well as why UAVs are critical for artillery with the call sign -Khorunzhiy-. Military -Khorunzhiy- began his career in 2012 with ordinary military service. Then, as a graduate of the Alfred Nobel University in Dnipropetrovsk, he had to serve only 9 months. However, in the end, this short term was only the beginning of a long military career, during which he went from a soldier to a major. To the question about the military department during higher education, the officer answers awkwardly, noting that this is a separate sad story. Unfortunately, during the 1990s and early 2000s, and especially after 2010, the system of training military personnel through military departments at universities was largely disorganized. So the future officer began his service in the army -on a general basis- and now does not regret it. He recalls that during the conscript service, despite the chronic underfunding, outdated material base and remnants of the -Soviet regime-, military affairs were taught qualitatively. - In Divychki, conscripts were taught very well - no worse than officers are taught now. Everything was very well organized, it was very cool training - no questions. Almost everything I know about artillery, how it works, all the basics, I know because of my military service. Really taught very well. Although it was a bit -long- (smiles - author), they taught everything - from A to Z. They laid a very strong base, - says the gunner. All the best from this basis, he believes, allowed the Armed Forces of Ukraine to give a worthy rebuff to the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine in 2014 and became a reliable basis for the further development of the Ukrainian army. The following years before a large-scale attack were also not wasted, so the ASU was already cool well before 2022. Kostyantyn Rymarenko met Russia's attack on Ukraine in the ranks of the Armed Forces, because he signed a contract after the -period-. So we can say that he has been fighting since the very first days of the more than ten-year war. — In 2014, the 25th brigade was the first to leave for Donbas in a convoy, it was the first battalion tactical group (battalion tactical group — author) of the first battalion. On March 10, 2014, we went to the area of ​​the Amvrosiivka settlement. The first 150 km went well - people supported, helped, gave all kinds of -little things-, says the officer. Then the problems began - people in civilian clothes obstructed the movement of convoys of military equipment, blocking roads and chasing traffic. Voyskovyi recalls that the demonstrators were not only extremely decorated due to anti-Ukrainian propaganda, but also well coordinated - it was noticeable that someone was leading them. - Everything was coordinated to the point that they knew the point where it would be most profitable to stop the convoy. Because a convoy is a lot of armor and wheels, it is a military Ural. We often drove on dirt roads, fields - and people in civilian clothes clearly met us where we had to enter the paved road. They already stood at that place in advance, that is, they were coordinated, because they themselves could not follow our movement and understand where exactly we were going, -Khorunzhiy- recalls. The crowd blocking the road could number from a few dozen to two or three hundred people, who had to be bypassed, persuaded or even dispersed by force. It was noticeable that the hysteria among the locals was being specially fanned, and in the crowds you could see trained -activists- provocateurs who organized everything. The further combat path of the gunner lay through Amvrosiivka, Sloviansk, Debaltseve, Shakhtarsk&#8230; The attempt to liberate Donetsk in mid-August 2014 was memorable, during which units of the brigade were supposed to move from Debaltsevo through Nizhnya Kryna in the direction of Khartsyzk. It was then, the officer is convinced, that Russia's first large-scale attack on Ukraine took place. Before that, the Russian Federation operated through special services, organizing, coordinating and supplying weapons to Russian and pro-Russian militants. In the last decade of August 2014, the neighboring aggressor state directly used units of its regular army. Then one group of Ukrainian troops, says -Khorunzhy-, advanced through Nizhnya Kryna to the south, while the second was to go north to Khartsyzk from the side of Ilovaisk. They both had about 7 kilometers to go. — 14 kilometers — and Donetsk would be in a cauldron. But on August 24-25, 2014, the first full-scale invasion of Russia took place, which was hidden. The Ilovai group had an option to come to us to the north, and if we hit each other at the same time, we would meet in Khartsyzka, and everything would be fine, the gunner explains. To prevent this plan, Russia was forced to use units of the regular army, because there were clearly not enough Russian and pro-Russian fighters, and they did not have any tangible support among the local population. Khorunzhiy spent the next six years in a war that many Ukrainians chose not to notice. Meanwhile, soldiers of the Armed Forces defended Ukraine, restraining the enemy in the East of the country. The defenders gave their lives and health, for years they almost did not see their relatives and friends, while the rest of the country continued to live their usual lives. — During the year, we spent 10 months in the ATO/OO zone, then two months at home. Of these two months, we spent one at the training ground, and the other was at the PPD (permanent deployment point - author) and went to training. That is, during my service, I almost did not see my own family, my children, - explains the soldier. However, this time did not pass in vain either for Konstantin himself or for the Armed Forces. -Khorunzhiy- was trained and obtained the rank of primary officer, served in the command and artillery reconnaissance battery, was a platoon commander and a battery commander. And the Ukrainian army has gone through an important path of modernization and gaining combat experience. — In May 2015, I went to study. We mastered the AN/TPQ-48 - studied, disassembled, assembled, repaired. We were well taught in electronics, then there were also courses. After all, in November 2015, I was given the rank of junior lieutenant, - recalls Kostyantyn Rymarenko. The AN/TPQ-48 is an American man-portable counter-battery radar station designed to detect enemy mortar installations. Together with other innovations and assistance from partners, it became very helpful during the war in Eastern Ukraine. In 2020, Kostyantyn Rymarenko resigned from the Armed Forces, hoping to spend more time with his family and recall his civilian specialty as a marketer. However, a large-scale attack by the Russian Federation disrupted all plans for a peaceful life. - From the very morning of February 24, I sent my family to my relatives, and I immediately took my bag - all the military property I had - and went to the military commissariat. When I arrived, they didn't even know what to do and how to do it. And I was already completely gathered at their door. I was quickly taken through all the offices, all the officers - and on the same day I went to the brigade, -Khorunzhiy- recalls. Several days were spent on organizational work, and already on February 27, the officer left for Donbas, where to this day he defends Ukraine as part of his native 25th separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade. — When I put my family in the car and sent them to my relatives, took my bag and went to the military checkpoint, I honestly thought I was going to die. I did not believe that we would succeed. But maybe it's because everyone thought so and everyone left - that's why we survived and are still standing, the soldier explains. He is sure that it was the simultaneous rise and joint efforts of Ukrainians, primarily those who gained military experience during the war in the East in 2014-2022, that allowed Ukraine to withstand the extremely difficult conditions of the first months of the large-scale invasion. Another key to the successful defense of Ukraine is the creativity of Ukrainian defenders and innovation in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Ukrainians brought knowledge, skills, skills and even hobbies acquired in civilian life to the Armed Forces - and this gave a colossal result. — In civilian life, I had a hobby — I flew on FPVs, on quadcopters. Thanks to this, we were the first in the brigade to fly a quadcopter. At the beginning of the large-scale invasion, there was only one Mavic in the division. Three officers flew on it: I, at that time a senior lieutenant and commander of intelligence, also a senior lieutenant - the deputy commander of a battery from the MPZ - and a division commander in the rank of lieutenant colonel, - says the military man. Before that, the gunners had only wing-type UAVs, and they were even afraid to fly on the recently handed over single Mavic, so as not to lose it. However, in the end, the gunners confidently mastered the new technique and ensured an extremely high result. Three officers took turns flying one drone and directly adjusted fire, transmitting data by radio to the gun commanders. This made it possible to quickly adjust fire and achieve significant accuracy. The scaling of the same process and the significant increase in the number of UAVs made it possible to spread the acquired experience to other artillery divisions of the brigade - and drones changed everything. — If we had as many drones at the beginning of the war as we do now, the occupiers would have all died then. We fired about 300 shells without knowing where. We were told the coordinates - we shot there. If the volumes that we fired at the beginning of the war were combined with such direct streams, which thanks to UAVs we have now, it would be possible to simply destroy any position, the officer explains. The military jokingly compares the 25th Sicheslav Airborne Brigade to Chip and Dale from the famous Disney cartoon about the chipmunks. After all, he says, the brigade is often sent to the direction where the biggest problems arise and where it is urgently necessary to -put out the fire-. — The first time this happened was in the Avdiivka region, when we were planned to be taken out for recovery and replaced by another brigade. Our units began to leave, but not even a day and a half passed when those who replaced us began to fall and lose positions. Therefore, we were forced to urgently return and save the situation, the officer says. Then many more times the Czechoslovak paratroopers were transferred to the hottest and most difficult areas of the front, and everywhere they provided the desired result - both in defense and in attack. -Khorunzhiy- fondly remembers the Slobozhan offensive operation, when the Defense Forces managed to liberate a huge territory of the Kharkiv region with a swift thrust. — When we were transferred to Kharkiv Oblast, there were very big doubts, but we fulfilled the assigned tasks and everything was successful. With minimal losses and with a huge amount of trophies, Raisin was liberated. Then, with already greater losses, unfortunately, they reached the Lyman, he says. The military believes that if it was then possible to introduce additional reserves, reinforce and replace the already exhausted Ukrainian military, the offensive could be continued. Victory in the war is just as achievable, he is convinced. For this, the two most important conditions are necessary - nationwide support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and a sufficient number of motivated and well-trained soldiers.

The occupiers created classes of young Russian Guardsmen at TOT	About this informs Center of national resistance. In the temporarily occupied territories, the enemy pursues a policy of militarizing children in order to raise future janissaries from them in the future wars of the empire. In particular, the Russians invented classes of -young Russian Guardsmen-, which were supervised by the police. The children were given -cadet- uniforms and forced to swear allegiance to the occupiers. At the same time, they were given lectures by people who organize torture chambers and kidnap people from the streets. In the future, the children were promised benefits when entering specialized educational institutions. The Kremlin spent hundreds of years building a system in which service to a dictator or in the army is the only chance to build a career if you live in the provinces of the empire. In this way, Moscow ensures control over the captured lands and gains manpower for wars of aggression. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the occupied Luhansk Region they are planning to spend 43 billion rubles on the so-called development of the coal industry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/okupanty-stvoryly-klasy-yunyh-rosgvardijcziv-na-tot/	2024-12-05T11:56:49-08:00

Rustem Umyerov discussed international military aid for Ukraine with attachés of partner countries	This is stated in a post on the minister's Facebook page. The main topic of discussion is international military aid for Ukraine. -I expressed my sincere gratitude to every country that supports us in the fight against the aggressor. It is extremely important for Ukraine and our partners that the transferred weapons and equipment are used as efficiently as possible on the battlefield,- said Rustem Umyerov. Together with the representatives of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence, the participants of the meeting informed the military attachés about the digitalization of military aid records. Before the start of the full-scale Russian aggression, weapons records were kept exclusively in paper format. The Great War showed that such approaches need to be fundamentally changed. This year, the Ministry of Defense made significant progress in reforming the supply of weapons and equipment to NATO standards. One of the key achievements was the implementation of the SAP system, which translates the accounting and provision of the army into a modern digital format, convenient for analysis and control. Thanks to the license transferred by Germany, SAP is scalable to all units of the Defense Forces. Today, the system covers 3,000 users at the tactical, operational and strategic levels. About 300,000 items have already been entered into the database, and in the online mode we monitor key indicators: the number of weapons, their condition and distribution among units. -Such formats of meetings with the military attachés of our allies will be regular. At the next event, we plan to summarize the results of military aid for previous years and define support plans for 2025. Transparency, clarity and accountability are the principles that the Ministry of Defense steadfastly adheres to in cooperation with our allies,- Rustem Umyerov concluded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/rustem-umyerov-obgovoryv-mizhnarodnu-vijskovu-dopomogu-dlya-ukrayiny-z-atashe-krayin-partneriv/	2024-12-05T10:44:21-08:00

Kharkiv, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions remain the most polluted freed territories. Representatives of the Main Department of Mine Action, Civil Defense and Environmental Security of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported this at the fifth review conference (5RC) on the implementation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and Their Destruction, which was held in the Kingdom of Cambodia within the framework of the Siem Reap-Angkor summit. Representatives of 90 participating countries, 12 observer countries of the Ottawa Convention and almost 20 delegations of various international organizations took part in the event. The Ukrainian delegation told the international community in detail about the crimes of the Russian Federation related to the use of anti-personnel mines against the civilian population. The conference participants were also provided with information about shelling of humanitarian demining groups, which prevent the full implementation of mine action activities. In addition, it was informed about the measures to clean up the territories contaminated by Russian anti-personnel mines and the progress in this area that the units of the Ministry of Defense managed to achieve during 2024. Thus, during the non-technical survey, 35,000 km² of the territory was marked as not containing evidence of the presence of risks. This made it possible to reduce the area of ​​potentially contaminated areas from 174,000 to 139,000 km². As reported by ArmyInform, in 2024 in Ukraine 10 new demining battalions were created. In addition, the fleet of mechanized demining vehicles increased from two units to 52, of which 42 are in the Armed Forces and 10 are in the State Special Transport Service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/zlochyny-armiyi-rf-ponad-1000-czyvilnyh-pidirvalysya-na-protypihotnyh-minah-vid-pochatku-shyrokomasshtabnogo-vtorgnennya/	2024-12-05T09:15:38-08:00

Increasing the ruble discount rate will not help and it will continue to fall	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The regulator allows its increase to 25% at the next meeting of the board of directors on December 20. Also, according to the statement of the Central Bank, the exchange rate has become a new -pro-inflationary factor-. Price growth remains high, and the slowdown in lending, in particular corporate lending, is recorded. It is unlikely that an increase in the discount rate will help the ruble. High inflation of 8.8% and an increase in the key rate in December create significant risks for the Russian economy. We are talking about a decrease in the purchasing power of the population, an increase in the cost of lending, an increase in the debt burden, etc. The war against Ukraine is finally bringing the Russian economy into the abyss. We remind you that the Russian authorities plan to allow the use of in harmful jobs in the industry of teenagers from the age of 16.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/pidvyshhennya-oblikovoyi-stavky-rublyu-ne-dopomozhe-i-vin-prodovzhyt-padinnya/	2024-12-05T09:26:10-08:00

In the Russian Federation, they are beginning to involve children in harmful industries	About this informs the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation believes that these changes -will allow enterprises to conclude agreements on paid internships with students of professional educational organizations.- In fact, the goal of such innovations is the desire of the Russian government to solve the problem of labor shortages, primarily at military-industrial complex enterprises.

During the first half of this year, Russian employers sent job invitations to more than 3 million people aged 14 to 18. Propaganda of the Russian Federation tries to justify the involvement of teenagers in hazardous work with examples from the Second World War and the thesis that -work even in hazardous industries is safer for children than being on the street.- The actions of the Russian authorities once again proved the readiness of the Kremlin not to reckon with its own people, in particular with the interests of children, for the sake of aggressive goals in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/v-rf-pochynayut-zaluchaty-do-praczi-na-shkidlyvyh-vyrobnycztvah-ditej/	2024-12-05T04:36:36-08:00

The forests burned, the mines stopped: the occupiers justify the failures in the Luhansk region	This was reported by the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysohor. However, the real consequences of the activities of Russian investors, who received mines in the region back in February, remain doubtful. Among the -results- of the work are mass layoffs, salary delays, and dismantling of equipment. Meanwhile, the occupying authorities of Luhansk region blame the destruction of 4.3 thousand hectares of forests around Stanytsia Luhanska solely on climatic conditions. The local forest farm claims that the cause of the fires was an increase in air temperature. Other factors - the lack of preventive measures, the shortage of extinguishing agents and rescuers - are not taken into account by the occupiers. As well as the failure of the disaster relief campaign. Residents of the affected settlements, whose houses burned down, were mostly forced to evacuate on their own. Rescue units of the occupiers did not arrive at the site, leaving people to fight the fire alone. The situation in the occupied Luhansk region demonstrates that real assistance to the population and solving environmental problems remain on the margins of the occupation administration's attention. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupying authorities of Luhansk region intensified forced mobilization, directing efforts to attract young people to the army of the Russian Federation. Workers of military commissariats carry out inspections in public places and at addresses, forcing conscripts to sign contracts, bypassing their military service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/lisy-zgorily-shahty-zupynylys-okupanty-vypravdovuyut-provaly-na-luganshhyni/	2024-12-05T00:11:20-08:00

Propagandists attack the computer game: what they invented this time	According to the propagandists, the game allegedly collects players' personal data, such as IP addresses, names, locations, even without their consent, passing this information to Ukrainian military commissariats. This fake was accompanied by the use of the Wired logo, which was supposed to give the information the appearance of authenticity. Propagandists also claim that the studio received funding from the Ukrainian government in exchange for such activities. About this writes Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security. In fact, the GSC Game World studio raised significant funds ($800,000) for the support of the Armed Forces with the help of crowdfunding and donated them to the Ukrainian charity -Return Alive-. In response, Russia started a campaign against the game, including statements about its possible ban. This case is another example of the spread of disinformation aimed at discrediting Ukrainian achievements, particularly in the field of video games. It's also a continuation of a campaign similar to Netflix's previously documented fake trailer disinformation campaign dubbed -Matryoshka-. The main goal of such fakes is to undermine trust in Ukraine and its initiatives on the world stage.

Is there gender equality in the military: about the number of women in the army, body uniform and NA...	The ArmiyaInform correspondent asked Diana Kopanytsia, the head of the Department of Humanitarian Support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, about all this and more. — Ms. Diana, can you provide statistics on women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine? How many in total are in the ranks of the Armed Forces as of the beginning of December 2024, of which there are military personnel? What are the statistics on women in genera and species (number of women)? — Over the past three years, the number of women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, compared to the data before the beginning of the large-scale invasion, has increased by more than 20%. As of October, the total number of women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine was almost 69,000, of which more than 48,000 were military personnel. Instead, in January 2022, on the eve of a large-scale invasion, the total number of women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine was more than 52,000. Currently, more than 5,500 women soldiers are on the front line. Among women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, we now also have more than 10,000 officers, more than 13,000 sergeants, more than 23,000 soldiers and more than 1,500 cadets. The number of female servicemen in leadership positions is almost 7,000, and this figure shows a gradual trend towards growth. More than 1,000 servicewomen have been awarded state awards and more than 18,000 servicewomen have already received combatant status. As for the information in the breakdown of the number of women by military branch, the largest number of women is usually in the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as the largest branch of the military, where more than 18,000 women serve. The figures are somewhat lower in the Air Force and Medical Forces, where the number of women in each branch exceeds 6,000 servicemen. A fairly significant number of female military personnel is also observed in the Territorial Defense Forces, Support Forces and Logistics Forces, and the Naval Forces. After all, we also have hundreds of women successfully serving and performing combat missions in the Special Operations Forces and the Unmanned Systems Forces. — Ukrainian servicemen appeal attentionthat sexism in the army is a widespread phenomenon and lack of material support is one of its manifestations. In particular, it is about the form according to the size and shape of the body, anatomical body armor, underwear, etc. What coordinate system are we currently in to correct this situation? What is your administration doing for this? — Prior to the start of the large-scale invasion, security in the Armed Forces of Ukraine was predominantly male-oriented. In particular, at the level of regulatory documents of the Ministry of Defense, only a single uniform standard was approved - men's. The women's uniform was provided only for the formal one - a petticoat, a skirt and high-heeled shoes. There were also no requirements for personal protective equipment and other tactical items for female servicemen. This created problems for female military personnel, who were forced to wear men's uniforms that did not meet their physiological needs and anthropometric parameters. The situation with the material support of female servicemen in the Armed Forces of Ukraine is not ideal, but it has positive dynamics. Every day, with the joint efforts of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff, we work to improve the material support of female servicemen, and at the moment we have the following results in this direction. In December 2023, for the first time, female servicemen received 50,000 sets of summer field suits, which are made taking into account female anthropometric parameters. Such uniform samples contain structural elements that allow female servicemen to feel comfortable while performing tasks in field conditions and permanent deployment points. Field trials of the women's demi-season uniform are currently underway, and the first samples of the winter uniform are ready for research testing. During 2023, women's underwear was also tested, which in 2024 was supplied to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The supplied underwear samples cover a wide range of sizes, and also have a comfortable cut that does not restrict movement and is suitable for use in full equipment when performing combat tasks. Ultimately, in December 2023 and January 2024, the Ministry of Defense certified two bulletproof vests for female servicemen. The corresponding protective equipment has an outwardly curved armor plate, narrowed shoulders and an extended bottom, which helps to adjust the body armor to the anatomical features of a woman. — Where do you see a positive trend regarding gender policy in the Armed Forces during a large-scale war? Where is the critical situation, and where is the most needed point of effort? — A key achievement in ensuring gender equality in the Armed Forces of Ukraine is the removal of legal restrictions on the tenure of women in military positions. Since 2018, Ukraine has managed to significantly expand the range of combat positions for women: there are opportunities to be commanders of infantry units, female snipers, machine gunners, grenade launchers, scouts, and even drive armored vehicles or be a tank gunner. As of today, there are no regulatory obstacles to the occupation of positions by women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Women have the opportunity to serve in positions of their choosing, including typical combat specialties (recon, sniper, machine gunner, grenade launcher, gunner or UAV operator - ed.). And as practice shows, women in such positions are effective. At the same time, we periodically receive requests that, in fact, commanders do not admit female servicemen to combat positions, despite the high motivation of such women and the absence of objective obstacles to the performance of such tasks. We are working together with gender advisers and commanders of the types and separate branches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to minimize such discrimination. — How do you cooperate with partners in the context of gender equality? What do they praise for, and what shortcomings do they point to? — Cooperation with international partners is one of the main areas of activity of the Office, as the direction of gender equality is an important direction. Most of the standards in the field of ensuring gender equality are borrowed from international documents in the field of human rights, as well as the practice of international courts. I also want to note the fruitful cooperation of the management with our Ukrainian partners and experts in the field of ensuring gender equality. Thus, during 2023-2024, more than 250 advisers on gender issues of the Ministry of Defense have already undergone educational training with the assistance of national and international public organizations. The Department also systematically and productively cooperates with the Government Commissioner for Gender Policy Kateryna Levchenko regarding the implementation of the -Women, peace, security- agenda. Thanks to the professional work of these organizations and experts, the advisers on gender issues had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with international approaches to the issues of preventing and combating manifestations of discrimination, gender-based and domestic violence, the foundations of international humanitarian law. - When we talk about -NATO's gender equality standards- - what exactly are we talking about? Explain in simple language. - Put simply, the NATO Gender Equality Standards are a set of rules, guidelines and principles that help ensure equal opportunities, in particular, for women and men in the armed forces of NATO member and partner countries. The goal of these standards is to create an environment where every service member, regardless of gender or gender identity, can fulfill their potential. At the same time, gender equality does not at all mean that we should allocate equal resources to meet the needs of women and men in the military, or fully equalize men and women in terms of rights and responsibilities during service. True gender equality involves the fair distribution of resources and the creation of equal conditions for people, taking into account their gender needs. After all, it is quite clear that the proper material support of a woman who performs combat tasks may require more resources than in the case of creating identical conditions for male servicemen. If we look at this issue from a practical perspective, then in this context we should also mention the initial requirements for the interoperability of Ukraine with NATO, which Ukraine must implement in the near future so that our Armed Forces can effectively interact with the military structures of the member countries of the Alliance and conduct joint military operations. Such requirements include, for example, the introduction of a clear system of gender advisers in the Ministry of Defense system, the removal of legal barriers that prevent the participation and representation of women in security and defense sector institutions, thematic training for gender advisers, the development of prevention policies and responding to sexual violence in the military, etc. — At the beginning of October 2024, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine announced that it plans to conduct a gender analysis and identify institutional obstacles to the implementation of equality programs in the ranks of the Armed Forces. As of the beginning of December - how are things going? - To begin with, it is worth finding out what gender analysis actually is. Simply put, it is the identification and assessment of barriers that exist in law or in practice that prevent equal rights and opportunities for service members because of their gender or gender identity. Gender analysis involves collecting and analyzing data (for example, the number of women and men in different units - ed.), identifying practices or rules that may create inequality (for example, women's limited access to certain military occupations), and ultimately, the preparation of recommendations or draft regulations designed to solve the identified problems. That is, effective gender analysis is a long and painstaking work that requires the processing of a large amount of diverse data. Another important area of ​​our work is the gender analysis of data on military positions held by women and the identification of barriers that prevent women from effectively performing their duties. Our strategic goal is to create all the necessary conditions for women to occupy leadership positions in the army, demonstrating their professional qualities and leadership skills. - What are you planning for 2025 in the context of gender policy in the Armed Forces? - One of the key priorities for the next year is the regulatory regulation of the status and powers of the gender advisor in the Ministry of Defense system in accordance with NATO standards and best practices. We will also continue the gender analysis of the current needs of female servicemen in the army and, based on its results, we will work on improving the physical and material support of female servicemen, in particular, in cooperation with international partners. And, as we have done this year, we will work hard to train our gender advisers so that they can get not only the legal status and powers written in the regulations, but also practical tools to carry out their daily activities, and in the future they can participate in joint operations involving NATO countries. A separate priority is for us to improve the language training of advisors on gender issues, because, as I mentioned earlier, gender issues are of a global nature and are based on international regulatory documents and NATO standards, most of which are written in English.

It was not necessary to go far: the Finnish army ordered new mobile 120-mm mortar systems from a loc...	As stated in the release, disclosed by the manufacturing company on the occasion of the conclusion of the relevant contract, the new mortar system integrates traditional heavy mortar weapons into a modular carriage, which is then mounted on a military truck, reports ArmyInform. The mortar complex, codified by the Finnish Army as the 120 KRH M3, was developed by Patria for the Finnish Land Forces. TREMOS is a modular carriage with a fire control system and recoil compensators. It can use any traditional 120mm mortar and mount on 4×4/6×6/8×8 trucks that have the appropriate container -locks- to secure the cargo. In case of machine malfunction, the weapon can be quickly transferred to another chassis. The module does not require any preparation before firing and can fire directly from the chassis of the vehicle, which greatly increases the mortar's mobility. -Patria has increased the mobility of heavy mortars in excellent cooperation with the Finnish Army and the Finnish Defense Forces Logistics Command, creating a new weapon system,- said Jussi Järvinen, executive vice president of Patria's Finnish division. He emphasized the significant tests carried out and pointed to Patria's legacy of innovative mortar systems, such as the famous AMOS (Advanced Mortar System) and NEMO (New Mortar) turrets, which are the basis of TREMOS development. The artillery system, by its characteristics, does not differ in any way from a similar trailed mortar, which would work traditionally on the ground. The main goal of the project is to increase the survivability of the mortar units of the Finnish ground forces due to better mobility in the conditions of war with an enemy that conducts counter-battery warfare and actively uses reconnaissance and strike drones. The Finnish military command is convinced that in the future heavy mortars will play an increasingly important role in the composition of ground troops as the main means of defeating from closed positions. Currently, the country's ground forces plan to gain experience in the use of such systems on ordered pre-production samples, and later make a decision on possible additional purchases of 120 KRH M3 complexes. -The goal is to start training conscripts with the new mortars during 2026,- said Colonel Ari Lehmuslehti of the Ground Forces Headquarters of the Finnish Armed Forces. However, the experts of the IKK defense website Defense Express (DE) were quite skeptical about this choice of soldiers' weapons countries of Suomi. According to their conclusions, it is a standard 120-mm mortar with manual loading, which was installed on the chassis of a truck, added a digitalized guidance system and a hydraulic recoil absorption mechanism. -The choice of this system may be surprising, because Patria has a much more advanced NEMO, which has a perfect fire control system, the possibility of a -fire raid-, when several mines that were fired from the same vehicle on different trajectories arrive at the same target, and also even the possibility of shooting on the move. It is also worth adding about the mechanization of charging and the fact that it is an armored chassis compared to TREMOS. At the same time, if the wheeled chassis can be replaced by a tracked one, for example, for the US Army, the NEMO mortar system was installed on the AMPV chassis,- noted the IKK DE. It should be recalled that our editors told in detail in one of his previous articles on the NEMO armored mortar system. By chance remind that in the order of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine dated August 28, 2023 on acceptance for armament The 120-mm mortar M/41D, the developer and manufacturer of which is the Finnish company Patria, is indicated in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation of regular samples of foreign weapons. In turn, the authors of the portal European Defense Review indicate that the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Finland concluded the above contract for the supply of a pre-production batch of TREMOS modular mortar systems, which are expected to be delivered to the troops in 2025. The number of ordered units is not named, but the contact amount is €4.7 million. Patria presented this new weapon system at the Future Mortar Systems conference in London on October 29, 2024	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/hodyty-daleko-ne-dovelosya-finska-armiya-zamovyla-novi-mobilni-120-mm-minometni-systemy-u-misczevogo-vyrobnyka/	2024-12-04T21:01:40-08:00
F-16 against Russian cruise missiles: how many air targets were shot down -Battle Falcons-	Since then, Russia has launched three massive combined air and missile strikes on Ukrainian territory — one in late August and two in November. F-16s participated in repelling these large-scale attacks as an air defense tool. Official information on the effectiveness of the use of F-16s against Russian cruise missiles and attack UAVs was collected and the number of enemy air targets shot down by Ukrainian -Battle Falcons- was calculated by ArmyInform. Full statistical information on Russian cruise missiles and attack drones shot down by the F-16 has not been officially made public. Therefore, approximate calculations of enemy targets destroyed by the -Battle Falcons- can be made only on the basis of separate official reports of the Air Force and the General Staff, as well as statements of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. For the first time, F-16s demonstrated their high efficiency in Ukrainian skies during the repulse of a Russian air-missile strike on August 26, 2024. Then the enemy launched 127 missiles of various types and 109 Shahed-131/136 attack UAVs on the territory of Ukraine. It was shot down 201 air targets - 102 missiles and 99 attack UAVs. Unfortunately, the military pilot Oleksiy Mes with the call sign -Moonfish- died in an aerial battle. In the notification of his death, the Command of the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine noted that during the repulsion of the Russian of a massive combined air and missile strike, the pilot destroyed three cruise missiles and one attack UAV Instead, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported, that -during the aerial combat, the F-16 aircraft demonstrated their high efficiency, four enemy cruise missiles were shot down by airborne weapons.- So, on August 26, 2024, F-16 fighters shot down at least four cruise missiles and one Shahed. Russia carried out the next large-scale combined air and missile attack on the objects of the energy sector of Ukraine with various types of air, land and sea-based missiles and Shahed type UAVs at night on November 17, 2024. Then, as reported President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi, F-16 pilots shot down about 10 enemy air targets. The Supreme Commander-in-Chief did not specify exactly which enemy aircraft the pilots of the Ukrainian -Fighting Falcons- destroyed, but their contribution was about 7% of all enemy air targets destroyed at that time. Finally, on the night of November 27-28, 2024, Russia struck Ukraine with 188 air strikes, including 91 missiles of various types and 97 Shahed attack UAVs. Among them the Defense Forces of Ukraine vorozhyh-bpla/->shot down 76 Kh-101/&#8221;Caliber- cruise missiles, 3 guided air missiles X-59/69 and 35 Shaheds. Seven enemy cruise missiles were destroyed by F-16 pilots. Volodymyr Zelenskyi reported this in an interview with the British broadcaster Sky News on November 29. -Seven cruise missiles were destroyed two nights ago. Seven missiles that flew over infrastructure, civilian infrastructure,- he said. Thus, for the second time, the President of Ukraine highly praised the effectiveness of F-16 fighter jets in repelling massive combined air and missile strikes from the Russian Federation. -How are the F-16s doing today? Very good. Great, for the most part,- he emphasized in an interview with Sky News. Also, Volodymyr Zelenskyi partially reported specific data on the effectiveness of the pilots of the -Fighting Falcons-, because it is not excluded that, in addition to cruise missiles, they also shot down several -Shakhed-. At the same time, the Head of State also noted the biggest problem of the F-16 as a Ukrainian air defense tool — their insufficient number. -We have very few F-16s,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an interview with Sky News, emphasizing the need for the Defense Forces of Ukraine both for more of these fighters and for other types of modern weapons. However, despite their small numbers, the Ukrainian -Battle Falcons- undoubtedly proved their high efficiency as an air defense vehicle, destroying about 20 enemy air attack vehicles. Increasing the number of F-16s in the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be able to significantly improve this statistic.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/05/f-16-proty-rosijskyh-krylatyh-raket-skilky-povitryanyh-czilej-zbyly-bojovi-sokoly/	2024-12-04T20:47:16-08:00

Chief Sergeant Volodymyr of the 53rd Mechanized Brigade named after Prince Volodymyr Monomakh told on the ArmyTV stream about this. -There is an impression that the Russian leadership has a goal - to quickly wipe out their people, whom they send for meat. Then wait for some time, then type again and erase again. That is, they do not need to occupy some frontiers, but to put more of their people in,- said Volodymyr. As reported by ArmyInform, the 53rd brigade appealed to the servicemen who voluntarily left their units, with a call to return to service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/shturmuyut-tak-nache-hochut-shhob-shturmovyky-shvydshe-zakinchylysya-taktyka-rosiyan-na-toreczkomu-napryamku/	2024-12-04T11:58:55-08:00
The occupiers are preparing to launch fiber-optic drones at a distance of 15-20 kilometers	About this on the ArmyTV stream, a serviceman of the 4th brigade of operational assignment of the National Guard -Rubizh- Andriy Otchenash, who is located in the Lymano-Kupian direction. -The adversary started using optical fiber. If you watch his telegram channels, the enemy says that he will use copters on fiber optics for 15-20 kilometers. This is a not very pleasant situation, because it will complicate our logistics, because EW devices do not work on fiber-optic drones,- said Andriy Otchenash. He also noted the progress of the Russians in the development of Lancet strike drones, as well as aircraft-type reconnaissance UAVs. -They don't stand still, and that's also a minus. But thanks to the fact that our guys are also trying to find a countermeasure, for example, knocking down their wings with epfivishkas, this nullifies the successes of the Russians,- noted Andriy Otchenash. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 4th battalion -Freedom Force- of the National Guard brigade -Rubizh- -motolyg/->spectacularly repulsed the desperate attack of the invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/okupanty-gotuyutsya-zapuskaty-optovolokonni-drony-na-15-20-kilometriv/	2024-12-04T11:44:38-08:00
Stalin-era cannon and -lancets- — the occupiers assembled a special group against our artillery	Major Ivan Dragan, Chief of Staff of Art Division 93 of the -Kholodny Yar- mechanized brigade, told on the ArmyTV stream about this. According to him, the enemy group includes pilots of reconnaissance UAVs, -lancets- and long-range M-46 guns, developed back in 1951. -Russian -lancets- work very clearly and mostly in tandem with artillery. If they find our firing positions, they launch the first -lancet-. Somewhere in 20-25 minutes, the second one flies, and then the counter-battery artillery, one or two long-range guns, or 2S19 or M-46 caliber 130 millimeters are connected,- said Ivan Dragan about the enemy's tactics. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the Signum 93 unit of the mechanized brigade -Cold Ravine- spectacularly destroyed an enemy tank that advanced towards our positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/garmata-stalinskyh-chasiv-ta-lanczety-okupanty-zibraly-speczialnu-grupu-proty-nashoyi-artyleriyi/	2024-12-04T11:34:47-08:00

One UAZ and 4 fools — in Kurshchyna, our pilots recorded a comedy with Russians	The video was released December 4 on the unit's channel. A car drove up to the hole where the occupiers were hiding. The Russians tried to load their comrade into it, who could not walk either because of injuries or because of alcohol intoxication. At that moment, the first arrival of our kamikaze drone took place, which broke through the Uaza roof. At this time, two Russians tried to pull up their non-walking comrade, but they did not succeed. Maybe also due to alcohol intoxication. Then the driver went down the slope. Down — not up, the Russians were able to get their comrade to the UAZ and load it. Everyone was going to leave, but the pride of the Russian automobile industry was stuck. The Russians tried to push when another drone arrived. Then the surviving Russians waved their hands, left the car with a non-walking comrade and went somewhere. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of The Ravens unit of the 129th brigade of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces showed their next booty: 3 enemy armored personnel carriers and buggy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/odyn-uaz-i-4-durni-na-kurshhyni-nashi-piloty-zapysaly-komediyu-z-rosiyanamy/	2024-12-04T11:03:50-08:00

And this in Georgia, of course, is not only a problem of one people and not only of our region - how today's authorities in Georgia are pushing the country to obvious dependence on Russia. It's just shameful what things they are going to now against their own people. And when Moscow praises this government in Georgia, it clearly outlines who they are currently working for in Tbilisi and for whom they are dispersing protests. Certainly not for Georgia,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He said that Ukraine's legal response to the events in Georgia is being prepared. We are also working with Europeans and other partners on specific actions. The President instructed to prepare relevant sanctions decisions.

-Pinocchio- for 10 million - in Zhytomyr Oblast, a fairy tale with an unhappy ending was exposed	This was announced on December 4 by the Special Prosecutor's Office in the field of defense of the Central region. According to the investigation, the suspects seized state funds in the total amount of over UAH 10 million during the conclusion and execution of three contracts in 2022-2023. It is about the supply to KECH to provide military units with fuel wood at inflated prices. The director of the private enterprise ensured the organization of receiving price offers from business entities, which contributed to the victory in the public procurement of the specified LLC. In the future, the director of this limited liability company entered into contracts for the supply of firewood to KECH of the district at inflated prices. He received funds in his bank accounts and legalized them by transferring them to cash. The head of KEC of the district signed and approved unprofitable contracts, additional agreements and expense invoices without conducting price market monitoring. This led to wastage and misappropriation of budget funds.

He crossed himself and stabbed himself, shot himself, but he was breathing - the Russians surprise o...	The videos were released on December 4. Aerial scouts of the 60th mechanized Ingulets brigade noticed a Russian lying on the ground with a weapon. When our drone flew up to him, the occupier pretended to shoot himself in the head and died.

Relay cabinets of Ukrzaliznytsia were set on fire: 6 citizens were notified of the suspicion	This was notified in the SBU. At the enemy's behest, they tried to destroy substations and energy facilities of Ukrzaliznytsia with the help of flammable mixtures. The occupiers recruited all the participants remotely through specially created Telegram channels, where the rioters offer money in exchange for cooperation. However, instead of funds from the Russians, the arsonists received suspicion from Ukrainian law enforcement officers. Thus, a 33-year-old resident of the capital was detained in the Kyiv region, who, after serving 10 years in prison for theft, went to cooperate with the occupiers. According to their instructions, the recidivist set fire to the Ukrzaliznytsia relay box, which ensures the uninterrupted movement of trains on one of the sections in Kyiv. Another person involved is a 29-year-old resident of Boryspil, a gambling addict who hoped to -cover- his losses on lottery machines with money from the Russian Federation. For this purpose, the intruder also burned down another Ukrzaliznytsia relay cabinet. Four local teenagers, aged 15 and 14, were arrested in Mykolaiv Oblast for setting fire to an electrical substation that provides electricity to most of the residents of Pervomaysky District. During the searches, clothes, flammable mixtures and mobile phones with evidence of crimes were seized from the suspects. All detainees were notified of the suspicion under part. 2 Art. 113 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (sabotage committed under martial law). Perpetrators, including minors, face life imprisonment with confiscation of property. Complex measures were carried out by SBU employees in Kyiv and Kyiv, Mykolaiv Oblasts jointly with the National Police under the procedural guidance of the Kyiv City Prosecutor's Office, as well as the Kyiv and Mykolaiv Oblast Prosecutor's Offices.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/pidpalyuvaly-relejni-shafy-ukrzaliznyczi-povidomleno-pro-pidozru-6-gromadyanam/	2024-12-04T03:21:44-08:00
-Most of those who surrender are newly mobilized-: the enemy throws reserves into the assaults	The spokesman of the operational and strategic group of troops -Khortytsia- lieutenant colonel Nazar Voloshyn. In particular, according to Nazar Voloshyn, it was hot in the Kurakhiv direction. There, the occupiers tried to break through the Ukrainian defense 44 times last day. Assaults cost the enemy huge losses. In addition, over the past 10 days, approximately 50 occupiers have surrendered. -Most of those who surrender are newly mobilized and recently convicted. There are rare cases when those who are now captured have less than a month from the announcement of the verdict to their capture,- Nazar Voloshyn noted. As reported ArmyInform, only in the last week the losses of the occupiers on the Eastern Front amounted to almost 9 thousand persons	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/bilshist-tyh-hto-zdayetsya-v-polon-svizhomobilizovani-protyvnyk-kydaye-v-shturmy-rezervy/	2024-12-04T03:07:56-08:00
He ran away with his -wife- to live with his bride: two pseudo-spouses were exposed at the border	About the State Border Service of Ukraine informs December 4. -At the Krakivets checkpoint, the border guards of the Lviv detachment discovered a 24-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman who got married, most likely, without the intention of creating a real family,- the message reads. At first, the husband said that he was allegedly taking his wife to Germany for treatment of the musculoskeletal system. Later it turned out that he had recently proposed to another girl, who, after crossing the border, was supposed to go to him. In addition, border guards exposed another pseudo-couple at the Sheghina checkpoint. -A 44-year-old native of Ivano-Frankivsk region married a 57-year-old compatriot. In communication with the border guards, the man could not answer a number of questions: where his wife is from and when she was born, he also could not say. The citizen intended to leave for the Czech Republic,- said the State Security Service. On the detection of signs of a criminal offense, responsibility for which is provided for in Art. 332 of the Criminal Code -Illegal transportation of persons across the state border of Ukraine-, operatives of the detachment informed the National Police.

Neither the dropping of enemy drones nor fear prevented the Reaper from evacuating his wounded comra...	His story was told in the Land Forces. -Reaper- was on combat duty that day. One of the pilots was injured by the recoil, but it was not possible to evacuate him through open terrain. Brothers called Oleg for help as a more experienced fighter. Despite the danger from repeated drops, -Reaper- reached the wounded man and helped save him. -Put on the armor and ran. I worked in that place and knew where he could be dragged. At that moment, it was not scary, I did not think whether they would reset or not. Fear came later. And then we waited for the moment and pulled away together with a friend,- the fighter said. The Ground Forces said that before the war, -Zhnets- was a tractor driver. He joined the army on mobilization. -It was clear to me that it was better to stop the enemies away from home. When the enemy is next to your family, it is more difficult to fight - your head is occupied by something else,- Oleg explains his motivation. As reported by ArmyInform, Oleksiy on the pseudo -Loki- in October 2024 in the north -operatora-pzrk-loki/->knocked down from MANPADS two enemy UAVs of the type Shahed-131/136.

-Maidan- in Georgia and an offensive operation in Syria: Putin is losing influence in the Caucasus a...	Meanwhile, on November 27, Syrian opposition forces launched a large-scale offensive against Bashar al-Assad's forces in Aleppo province in Syria. The Syrian rebels successfully took advantage of the vacuum created by the weakening of Hezbollah, pressure on Iran and Russia's focus on the war with Ukraine. It was the Russians who most helped Assad stay in power since the start of the country's civil war in 2011. Oleksandr Chupak, an expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Studies-, talks about the situation in Georgia and Syria in an exclusive comment to ArmyInform. -Anti-government protests in Georgia cannot but remind us of the events of the Revolution of Dignity in Ukraine in 2013-2014. Pro-Russian oligarchic forces likely hold power through manipulation of the electoral process. The government announces the suspension of the European integration process. Thousands of protests erupt on the streets, which are accompanied by clashes between demonstrators and security forces. Like Yanukovych's regime at the beginning of the protests in Kyiv, the Georgian government exudes confidence that the rallies will lead to nothing. Despite national dissatisfaction with the announced results of the elections held on October 26, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze was not afraid to put the country's rapprochement with the EU on hold on November 28. The move was immediately hailed by Vladimir Putin as an example of -courage-. As soon as the protests broke out, the authorities began to frighten the nation with the so-called -Ukrainian scenario.- The most powerful Georgian oligarch, Bidzina Ivanishvili, who is credited with full control over the current government, has warned of the danger of a second Russian invasion in the event of an overthrow. Despite the mass of the protests, they lack a clear leader. President Salome Zurabishvili, who did not recognize the election results and publicly supported the protesters, is symbolically acting in this role. However, it is not directly coordinating the protestors' efforts. The difference here can be costly, because on the other side of the confrontation, the security forces have not yet shown any signs of disloyalty to the authorities. The lack of a general plan of action does not allow Georgians to organize resistance cells outside the borders of large cities. The government firmly controls the state media, which carries out anti-protest propaganda. Further developments will depend on the ability of various protest groups to unite around a common goal. Having a strong leader or group of leaders with uncompromising views can turn a national movement into a force that the authorities cannot handle. However, the probability of success of anti-government forces in Georgia is still much lower than a decade ago in Ukraine.- -The offensive of the Syrian opposition groups in the north-east of the country is already being compared with the attack of Hamas on Israel last October. Both operations were unexpected by their opponents and brought quick results to the attackers. However, in the case of Syria, the current government is on the verge of a real disaster. In fact, the province of Aleppo was surrendered without a fight, for which complex battles with the involvement of foreign contingents (primarily Russian and Iranian) were fought for years. As of December 4, fighting is underway for the city of Hama, an important logistics center in the center of the country that connects the north (Aleppo), the south (Damascus) and the Mediterranean coast, where the Russian naval contingent is located. Since the rapid advance of the opposition forces has stopped, the front line is relatively stabilized. They name several scenarios for the further development of events, but for Ukraine, the best option would be the intensification of hostilities for a long time, which would force Russia to transfer significant forces to Syria. Currently, we see that the Syrian government army is showing low combat effectiveness, so Assad will rely on the support of his partners. There are already two positive points for us: — the transfer of Russian aircraft to Syria. This can reduce the intensity of shelling of the Russian-Ukrainian front by air defense systems and air defense systems and the general activity of enemy aviation; — increasing costs for the war in Syria will divert Russian forces from the Ukrainian direction and may accelerate the economic collapse of Moscow. Further developments will depend on the presence of forces in the opposition. Obviously, their rapid offensive would not have been possible without the foreign support that Turkey, the United States and Europe could provide. If the supply rate is high (and not the same as for Ukraine), opposition forces will be able to gain a foothold and develop an offensive. The fate of the Russian fleet is the most interesting. Where will he go if the government loses the coast? If Spain does not allow through Gibraltar, there remains a passage through the Bosphorus, if the Turks allow it. Then an exciting trip to Novorossiysk awaits on the ship of the Russian Federation under the strikes of Ukrainian surface drones.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/majdan-u-gruziyi-ta-nastupalna-operacziya-v-syriyi-putin-vtrachaye-vplyv-na-kavkazi-ta-blyzkomu-shodi/	2024-12-04T01:57:24-08:00

Often before attacks, smoke is thrown onto the field so that under their cover the stormtroopers can advance as far as possible, but it does not always work out. -Our line is quite stable in the brigade. Sometimes it happens that one or two get to our trenches, but they are either destroyed there by the infantry, or the drones finish them off,- says Yevnen Alkhimov.

She spied on the defenders of Chernihiv under the guise of taxi rides: a minor was detained	About informs December 4 SBU. -In order to -bypass- the Ukrainian air defense, the agent had to identify and transmit to the aggressor the coordinates of the anti-aircraft missile systems and radar stations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine that defend the border region. For the conspiracy of reconnaissance trips, the girl ordered a taxi in which she drove around the area and secretly recorded the objects she needed,- the SBU said. After such trips, the figure returned home, where she created an intelligence report for her Russian curator in the form of media files with -required- geolocations. The SBU military counterintelligence exposed a Russian agent, documented her crimes and arrested her -red handed- while she was photographing a defense facility. It was established that the person involved was in direct contact with a staff member of the Russian game, with whom she communicated through an anonymous chat in the messenger. During the searches, a mobile phone with evidence of intelligence and subversive activities for the benefit of the Russian Federation was seized from the detainee. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed the accused about suspicion for h. 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The perpetrator is in custody. She faces up to life in prison with forfeiture of property. As reported by ArmyInform, the Security Service detained</a a resident of the city of Kostyantynivka, who was recruited by the special service of the Russian Federation in the summer of this year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/pid-vyglyadom-poyizdok-u-taksi-shpyguvala-za-oboronczyamy-chernigova-zatrymano-nepovnolitnyu/	2024-12-04T01:28:17-08:00
Ukrainian missile program: why -Neptune- and -Palyanytsia- are becoming symbols of a new defense era	This was announced by the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov. According to him, April 13, 2022 was a historic day for Ukrainian defense. Just then, using the domestic missile complex -Neptun-, the Armed Forces of Ukraine sank the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation - the cruiser -Moscow-. -Today, when the war continues, missiles become not only a symbol of a technological breakthrough, but also a critically important tool for the defense of our state,- he noted. The Minister of Defense said that in modern warfare, missiles are a key element for striking the deep rear of the enemy. Despite the effectiveness of drones, their power is limited. In addition, the use of foreign missiles often requires coordination with partners. -This is where the strategic importance of own missiles is manifested. Ukrainian cruise and ballistic missiles will allow our Armed Forces to act independently, delivering pinpoint strikes on key enemy targets. This not only strengthens our defense, but also creates an effective deterrent mechanism for the aggressor,- he assured. Rustem Umyerov reminded that this year Ukraine has already produced the first 100 rockets a>. This became possible thanks to the work of the Ministry of Defense, which coordinates both public and private initiatives in missile development. -In particular, serial production of R-360 cruise missiles of the Neptune complex has been restored and scaled up. Modified missiles are now capable of hitting targets at a longer range. Private enterprises are also showing incredible results,- he said. For example, a new startup implemented the Palyanitsa missile project, which has already entered serial production thanks to the support of the Ministry of Defense. -This is a vivid example of how the state and the private sector come together to achieve a common goal,- said the head of the defense department. As Rustem Umyerov noted, Ukraine is not only developing its own potential, but also integrating into the European defense industry. This cooperation makes it possible to localize the production of foreign technologies in Ukraine. Among the key projects: According to the Minister of Defense, these initiatives provide access to advanced developments and create an opportunity for the modernization of the Ukrainian defense industry. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is actively accelerating structural changes, creating conditions for more effective management of the missile program. The new Department of Support for Missile Projects and ABM Means, as well as the Main Directorate for the Development of Missile Programs, will coordinate the efforts of the state and the private sector. -This program will allow not only to provide modern weapons for today's battles, but also to lay the foundation for the defense of the future. Ukrainian missiles will become a guarantor of the security of our state, capable of deterring any aggression,- Rustem Umyerov explained. He emphasized that the Ukrainian missile program is not only about war. It's about independence, self-sufficiency and technological breakthrough. -Our successes in rocketry prove that we are capable of creating game-changing weapons. These missiles will protect our land today. And they will ensure peace in the future. Because in the modern world, victory is not only a question of strength, but also a question of technology,- he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov held a meeting with Ukrainian manufacturers of missile weapons, at which plans for 2025, key areas of cooperation and development of the industry were discussed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/ukrayinska-raketna-programa-chomu-neptun-ta-palyanyczya-stayut-symvolamy-novoyi-oboronnoyi-ery/	2024-12-04T01:13:14-08:00

Changes to Russian legislation allow recruits to be sent to a combat zone immediately after being drafted, without the mandatory three-month term of military service. In Severodonetsk, meanwhile, the third winter continues without full-fledged centralized heating. The occupation authorities were unable to fulfill their promises regarding heat supply made in 2023-2024. Despite the launch of one boiler house, its capacity is not enough to heat multi-storey residential areas. In some neighborhoods, the coolant does not reach at all, and in areas with heating, the batteries remain barely warm. Frequent bursts of pipelines complicate the situation, and the number of emergency teams is insufficient for a quick response. As a result, many local residents remain in the cold without receiving adequate assistance. The freezing residents of Severodonetsk are forced to rely on their own strength in conditions where the occupation authorities continue to ignore their needs. As reported by ArmyInform, there is still no mobile phone in Lysychansk connection, which was disconnected by the Russian occupiers. Local residents are forced to travel to Novoaidar or Starobilsk to contact their relatives.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/syevyerodoneczk-zamerzaye-molod-vidpravlyayut-na-front-realiyi-okupovanoyi-luganshhyny/	2024-12-04T00:26:51-08:00

CAESAR doctors: how French self-propelled guns are repaired near the front line. ArmyInform report	Proximity to the front is not just words or geography, it is immediately felt: while we were waiting for the boys, we saw about ten flights from different directions. Only by the smoke rising, it was roughly understood whether it was an anti-tank missile or an anti-aircraft missile. White and focused is the KAB, and black and floating on the horizon is the MLRS. The guys have arrived and we are quickly going to the landing site, one of thousands in Donetsk region. Not the only place where you can try to hide in the steppe. Almost every landing is cut down, injured by enemy artillery or anti-aircraft guns, but saved for our defenders. We've arrived at the Burrow, the camouflaged hideout for the CAESAR ACS and its crew. The machine lives up to its name, the CAESAR is big and majestic. It would be a virtue on parade, but in the steppe it is not easy to hide it to protect it from enemy blows. Driver-mechanics Serhii and Ivan greet the cannon, they are old friends and brothers, and like real doctors, they take suitcases with tools and immediately start inspecting the car. Ivan disappears behind a huge wheel, everyone is anxiously waiting for a diagnosis: whether it will be possible to repair it on the spot, or whether it will have to be taken deeper to the rear, to the repair company. An anxious wait, finally Ivan says that today's problem is small: the tube on the handbrake is broken. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief. From time to time, Ivan's smiling face appears from under CAESAR, a headlamp shines, and Serhii hands out tools, gives advice and cheers everyone up with jokes. Then they conjure something together with the help of a gas burner and tweezers, Ivan disappears again. In 15-20 minutes, satisfied with their work, they say that the car is ready for battle. The calculation quickly gathers and goes on combat duty, leaving the smoke behind, and we behind them, only already in the direction of the contact line. Serhiy is a driver-mechanic. He is 50 years old, he is from the Chernihiv region, he was mobilized back in 2022, he got into the repair department of the brigade. I ask how CAESAR is in terms of repairs. Sergey smiles and shakes his head: - CAESAR seems not adapted to these weather conditions and operating conditions. It's one thing to ride the track, shoot and drive, then it's all good. And when bad weather starts, and you have to drive through fields, then everything becomes much more difficult. On the Zaporizhzhia direction, there was a difficult situation with the brake pipes, because when the mud freezes, it easily breaks the brake lines. We then went around the clock to repair. Because this is a very smart car, all on sensors, and if it shows that the brake fluid is leaking, then the car will not go anywhere. And so we moved twenty-four hours a day from car to car, repairing. Unfortunately, this is a weak point, because the car is like a military one, and the pipelines are made of plastic tubes that cannot withstand any loads. - Perhaps the French created this self-propelled gun for desert conditions? - Most likely, for European conditions. Because we faced the fact that in the summer, when there was no rain and the dust was terrible, then everything also went out of order. For example, the locks on the wedge could not be closed, because the guys try to lubricate everything, but dust gets stuck, and this does not allow the machine to work as it should. The responsibilities of the calculation include the maintenance of a combat vehicle. There are things they have to do after combat work, including cleaning the wedge. Because if it is dirty, the lock does not close, then they cannot shoot, the automation simply will not allow it. If the calculation is not yet very experienced, then it happens that they call - and we repair the car by phone, remotely. - Do you have time for departures? - We try. It happens when you work on one machine, you know that two more machines are waiting for you, then you choose something more difficult that the guys themselves will not be able to eliminate. There are still problems with the electronics. Unfortunately, the further, the more. Because even the powder boxes fall apart from so many shots. Can you imagine what happens to those wires and sensors in the car that they endure? - Do you have enough spare parts? - There are enough critical ones, they are supplied to us. We buy some small things ourselves, because there is no time to wait for elementary things, such as oil seals, gaskets. When there is already a serious breakdown, then the car goes to the factory, and there they already change the parts. —You started with the Soviet self-propelled guns. How different is CAESAR from them? - Very different, especially the -stuffing-. Because CAESAR is packed with electronics. In the Soviet self-propelled guns, everything is arranged more simply: it drives - while it drives, it shoots - while it can shoot. And there are many such nuances that some sensor has worked - and the car has stopped. Like today, when the usual brake pipe broke. It's good that the car was in the hole. And it happens that it is on the way to the fire line, much closer to the front line, and then it is an excellent target for FPV drones, which take apart the car very quickly. There was no such thing in the Zaporizhzhia direction, we did not hear about efpivishkas, except that -Lancets- flew in from time to time. Driver-mechanic Ivan from Vinnytsia region. He was mobilized a year and a half ago. Before mobilization, he worked in the State Emergency Service, was a dispatcher, then resigned, worked abroad, then in construction. — When I was mobilized, I did not have much experience in repairs. Well, except that he was fixing his car at home. Of course, I had no idea about CAESAR then. I saw him for the first time in the Zaporozhye direction and was a little scared at first. But nothing. Day by day sorted it out fine. — Did it take a lot of time? — It takes two or three weeks not to be afraid to approach her. During this time, you can more or less figure out what and why. I was lucky, because as soon as I arrived, I was assigned to work with an already experienced master. And I rode with him for two weeks. He showed me everything, told me everything. I quickly absorbed all this. Here the problem is that YouTube will not help. Almost everything is there, but about CAESAR - nothing. In general. Therefore, only my own experience and the experience of my peers. - Do you remember any such breakdown, which would be called the most difficult? - There were many such breakdowns, you can't remember everything at once. For example, when there was a CAESAR flight that was standing in a hole. It was necessary to quickly evacuate the car from there. We arrived, and everything was cut down. It was necessary to replace the damaged wheels, and try to do this if the nuts were cut by debris! Thank God that not all eight wheels had to be changed, but only on one side and only three. But they are big and heavy. Well, even though the crew helped, because my partner and I arrived, we both take turns. And there was another problem, that it was not land, but a real swamp. We try to lift the car with a jack, and the jack just sinks into the ground. You are constantly lifting, the jack is drowning, you are laying and laying, twisting further. It's as if there is such a thing as changing the wheels, and it took four hours. And it's not in the rear four hours, but where it can fly! And it is there for a very long time. - Do you like this job? - But how can you tell. Unfortunately, this is war. But yes, it's okay. Well, if you know your job, you like it. If there is an order to be transferred somewhere, I will not argue, but if I were given a choice, I would probably go to the CAESAR calculation, and I would try myself there. But that's also normal. Extreme is also enough.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/likari-caesar-yak-remontuyut-franczuzki-samohidky-nepodalik-peredovoyi-reportazh-armiyainform/	2024-12-03T21:07:05-08:00
Benefits for combatants: ArmyInform reminds you of the main ones	A significant part of them really works, although it requires a certain amount of time and nerves to design. And some of them have already lost their relevance. Most of the benefits are regulated by the Law of Ukraine -On the Status of War Veterans, Guarantees of Their Social Protection-. Participants in hostilities (hereinafter referred to as UBD) have the right to: The area of ​​housing for which a discount is granted, when calculating the heating fee, is 21 square meters. m of heating area for each person who permanently lives in a residential building and an additional 10.5 sq. m per family. And for families consisting only of disabled persons, a 75% discount is provided for the use of gas for home heating for double the size of the standard heating area (42 sq. m for each person who is entitled to a fee discount, and 21 square meters per family). By the way, you can get a benefit not only for own housing, but also for rented housing. An experimental project was also introduced, which has to make it easier for combatants and war veterans to receive benefits for paying for housing and communal services. As for travel, it is enough to show the ID card of a participant in hostilities for urban transport. For the most part, this works fine with public transport. But there are problems with FOPs. The fact is that local budgets should compensate them for the transportation of beneficiaries. But this does not always happen. So there are cases when the passage is refused. What to do in such a situation, read in our material /a>. To travel to other regions, for example, by train, you also need a ticket sheet, which is given together with the UBD certificate. The state provides combatants with targeted support for obtaining professional (vocational and technical), professional pre-higher and higher education in state and communal educational institutions: Benefits enjoyed by families of combatants: Of course, this is not a complete list of benefits regulated by the state. But we tried to talk about those that are currently relevant. We also note that having the right to a benefit is not always enough to use it. In many cases, it still needs to be properly completed. How to do this, read here. It is also important to understand that there are currently many initiatives by local authorities or private organizations regarding combatants. There are stores that provide discounts on goods and services for the presence of an ID or even a military ticket. Participants in hostilities in many regions can visit museums, exhibitions, zoos, theaters for free or at a significant discount. Therefore, if you are on vacation, you should always have your ID with you. Certain benefits are introduced by local authorities. For example, in Kyiv and some other regions, children of combatants are provided free meals in educational institutions. Or free parking . There are also material assistance programs for military personnel. Therefore, it is worth contacting the authorities at your place of residence and finding out what options are available to you.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/pilgy-dlya-uchasnykiv-bojovyh-dij-armiyainform-nagaduye-pro-osnovni/	2024-12-03T21:04:24-08:00
The hype surrounding Putin's Oreshnik: the Russian Federation invested considerable funds in the pro...	The direct threats of the bunker fuhrer are joined by Kremlin propagandists, who reproduce many different types of materials, trying to cause panic among Ukrainians. A large number of leaked materials indicate that Russia has invested heavily in a propaganda campaign aimed at promoting its -latest weapon-. However, their reliability raises serious doubts. First, according to the GUR of the IOU, on November 21, Russia struck the territory of Ukraine, using a ballistic missile from the -Kedr- missile complex. Ukrainian air defense can theoretically shoot down such missiles, as well as -Daggers-, about the impossibility of shooting down, which Putin said shortly before the large-scale invasion. Secondly, no confirmation of the -terrible- consequences of the missile strike on the Dnipro was ever provided. Those shots that spread on the network turned out to be an abandoned building in Chita, the St. Petersburg sports and concert complex and the Baikonur Cosmodrome. And the video of the alleged flight of the -Oreshnik- is a plume of exhaust gases from the Soyuz-2.1A space launch vehicle. In fact, Putin's -Oreshnik- turned out to be one big fake, and the hype surrounding it, which alarmed many Ukrainians, has the main purpose of cheering up the domestic Russian audience, frightened by the strikes of Western weapons on Russian military factories, airfields and oil depots. After all, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have repeatedly proven that Russian military facilities are not that protected.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/azhiotazh-navkolo-putinskogo-oryeshnika-rf-vklala-chymali-koshty-u-propagandystsku-kampaniyu/	2024-12-03T20:19:37-08:00
To shoot down a cruise missile or -Shahed- from MANPADS: all about the simulator on which anti-aircr...	At one time, ArmyInform already wrote about the training of anti-aircraft fighters. At that time, the simulator had various aerial targets in its library: airplanes and helicopters of various types. Now, in the conditions of the Russians' use of missiles and UAVs of various types, there is a need for its improvement. As project manager Reserve Lieutenant Colonel Mykola Salamakha said, they had to significantly change the software of the training complex: -The company now produces three types of MANPADS simulators. This is a simulator of the Igla portable anti-aircraft missile complex, the American Stinger MANPAD and the Polish-made Piorun MANPAD. When developing a new package of programs, we took into account that a cruise missile, as a rule, flies at an altitude of 50 to 150 m, unlike airplanes that fly at an altitude of 1-5 km. Therefore, these are completely different algorithms of combat work and a completely different way of training a shooter. The angular speed of the target, the boundaries of optical detection are different, in addition, the time from the detection of the missile to the possibility of launch is significantly reduced. Usually, an anti-aircraft gunner sees a missile at the last moment and needs to orientate himself very quickly and shoot, as a rule, in pursuit. With Shaheds, the situation is somewhat simpler, because its speed is about five to six times lower than the speed of a cruise missile, up to 150 km/h. Although now there are new models with a jet engine and a speed of up to 500 km/h. The simulator program provides simulation of targets at different speeds at different altitudes and in different terrain. According to Mykola Solomakha, in addition to single simulators for an anti-aircraft gunner, simulators for the separation of portable anti-aircraft missile systems have also been developed. In particular, tablets or remote controls are used to receive external information or targeting, as it happens in real life. As experience shows, a person who has undergone training in a training center on simulators and has about two or three hundred launches behind him is able to work properly in a real combat situation. The new simulators also take into account some specific moments of work, says the commander of the anti-aircraft unit, senior sergeant Andriy: -When the launch zone is displayed on the simulator, that is, from the moment when the target is visually detected and the shooter begins tracking the target, when he points the sight and when the head captures the target and begins to give a signal that it is possible to shoot, such a concept as shooting on the parameter should be taken into account. This means that it is possible to miss a hit due to the fact that the anti-aircraft missile will have to make very sharp maneuvers and the missile may simply break due to overload. On these simulators, this moment is taken into account. And there are simulators where there is no such launch zone and the instructor does not understand how correctly the shooter acted when performing the exercise.- After exercises, the simulator automatically assigns a grade. There are also separate explanations for the instructor, who must explain to the cadet how he acted, at what points he made mistakes and why, for example, the grade was lowered. To the question of how much time a person needs to prepare from scratch and to be ready to go on combat duty, Mykola Salamakha answered as follows: -In March, April, May 2022, right here in the workshop, people practiced for several hours during 3-5 classes . During each of them, the serviceman made 8-10 launches. And after a person makes more than 50 starts, sustainable skills already appear in him. According to Mykola, it is important to constantly maintain and improve the skills of anti-aircraft fighters. If there is a trainer in the team, training should take place at least once every two weeks, if more often, then it is even better. If there is no simulator, it is advisable to send the anti-aircraft gunner for retraining at training centers at least once every six months to restore the skills he acquired during training.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/04/shhob-zbyty-krylatu-raketu-abo-shahed-z-pzrk-vse-pro-trenazher-na-yakomu-gotuyut-zenitnykiv/	2024-12-03T20:54:52-08:00
The caliber is smaller, the ammunition is smarter: Sweden is replenishing its BMP fleet	As informs the defense portal Army Recognition, the Scandinavian country plans to purchase about 50 such weapons to replace the CV9040C models. ArmyInform reports. Reporters said that this machine, which is part of the CV90 family developed by BAE Systems Hägglunds, was presented without the additional armor that will be included in the final version. Similar presentations were held in Denmark, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It is worth reminding that CV90 BMPs are also well known in units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. Batches of these armored vehicles were repeatedly transferred to the Ukrainian military as part of aid from the Western allies, as reported by reported by our editors. The new defense project, which received the international designation CV9035 and Stridsfordon 9035 in Sweden, combines the CV90 MkIII chassis with the turret from the Mk IV version. In May 2024, BAE Systems has signed a contract with the Swedish Defense Material Administration FMV for new CV9035 MkIIIC vehicles, as well as associated integrated logistical support. -These new CV9035 MkIIICs will enhance the capabilities of the Swedish Army and provide aircrews with improved combat awareness, increased mobility, protection and lethality,- said Tommy Gustafsson-Rusk, managing director of BAE Systems Hägglunds, which develops and manufactures the CV90. One of the most significant changes in the new BMPs is the weapon system, where the 40mm Bofors gun used on previous models has been replaced by the 35mm Bushmaster gun. This gun upgrade is expected to maintain effectiveness through the use of programmable ammunition. In addition, the CV9035 Mk.IIIC is equipped with two missiles Rbs 58, a modified version of the anti-tank complex Akeron MP, which improves the ability of BMP to hit enemy armored vehicles, including tanks. When designing the CV9035 Mk.IIIC, BAE Systems gunsmiths focused on improved protection of the armored vehicle. It weighs approximately 35 tons, such a solid weight is explained precisely by the additional reservation. The BMP is equipped with sensors and countermeasures designed to detect and respond to threats such as anti-tank missiles, including a system that can launch a defensive projectile to intercept an enemy missile. The armored car also has rubber tracks to replace the steel tracks of older models, and a rear ramp instead of the traditional hatch. BMP retains the capacity of 6-7 military personnel in the landing cabin. Added a 360-degree video camera system to improve crew situational awareness. The version shown in Sweden matches the model the Netherlands is buying, but the Swedish version will have additional armor in the final configuration. Although the exact number of vehicles and the value of the contract have not been disclosed, experts estimate that about 50 units of the new BMPs, potentially valued at $360 million, have been ordered. Armament deliveries are expected between 2025 and 2027. The CV90 BMP family, which has been in service since the 1990s, includes a wide range of variants adapted to different operational needs. These vehicles were purchased in large numbers, more than 1,700 units, performing various functions such as air defense, reconnaissance and armor recovery. The CV90 platform continues to be operated by several countries, including Norway, Finland, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Slovakia, which have adopted it for their respective defense forces. As Sweden continues to plan to modernize its fleet of infantry fighting vehicles, CV9035 Mk.IIICs are expected to play a key role in meeting the country's military needs in the coming years. New BMP CV9035 will replenish the fleet of armored vehicles of the Swedish army.

Cheap and angry - the enemy concentrated a large number of towed guns in the Pokrovsky direction	About this on the ArmyTV stream a soldier of the 14th regiment of the Forces of Unmanned Systems of the Armed Forces with the call sign -Aladdin- told about it. -We see a lot of trailed guns. There used to be fewer of them, but now there are very, very many. We can find 7-8 of them in one flight. We also see many trucks delivering BC. It's hard to tell which howitzers are because they're usually camouflaged,- Aladdin said. According to him, the enemy uses tactics of small groups on the front line. -We see a lot of motorcycles, we see buggies, they are different, the Russians put something on them and it is difficult to recognize them, we see a lot of -loaves- and we see enemy infantry. It is not always possible to work on them all day, because we have not very good weather in this direction,- Aladdin complained. As reported by ArmyInform, the 14th regiment of unmanned aviation complexes of the Forces of Unmanned Systems of the Armed Forces caused fire damage to the Buk-M2 air defense system.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/03/deshevo-i-serdyto-vorog-zoseredyv-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-velyku-kilkist-prychipnyh-garmat/	2024-12-03T12:02:27-08:00
