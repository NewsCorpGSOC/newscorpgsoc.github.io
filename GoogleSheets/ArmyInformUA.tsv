Our teams have been instructed to consult on the next steps. We deeply appreciate the fact that Ukraine and America stood side by side from the first moments of the Russian invasion. Your determination is incredibly important for our victory,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. The President also met with US Vice President Kamala Harris. -It is very important for us to be completely clear and work in full coordination with the United States. We must end this war, we need a just peace. We must protect our people — Ukrainian families, Ukrainian children — and everyone from Putin's evil. And we are grateful to America for supporting Ukraine all this time,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. As reported by ArmyInform, USA will provide Ukraine defense assistance in the amount of $7.9 billion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/27/prezydent-ukrayiny-predstavyv-prezydentu-ssha-plan-peremogy/	2024-09-26T21:26:44-07:00
It is not customary for us to avoid -dvizhuhy- — Arkas Commander-in-Chief about the situation west o...	The conversation with the officer was published on September 27 on the brigade page. Recently, the 3rd mechanized battalion -celebrated- a kind of anniversary - two years in this direction. -When we first entered here, it was a completely different war. -Maviks- and FPV were exotic then, and now broadcasts must be conducted 24/7. The enemy does not stand still and is constantly improving, adapting to us, responding to our decisions. We also do not stand still: we change tactics in response. There is no need to treat the enemy as weak and stupid. The battlefield is a chessboard, and you have to think about your moves 10 steps ahead,- says Arkas. He has been in this direction since the very beginning: he was a platoon commander, then a company, now he is a deputy battalion commander. He knows this direction very well — from the firing positions of the platoons to the entire battalion defense area. The understanding of war and combat changes when you rise from an infantryman in a trench to a command post, says the deputy commander. -Everything comes with experience, and experience is a priceless thing. The theory that you did not use or used somewhere on the training ground cannot be compared with the knowledge that is gained in battle. As a commander, I always try to be with the soldiers in positions. The moments when fighters of some units ask how it can be that the commander is personally in positions with his fighters are surprising. And for us, this is the norm,- Arkas shares. In his opinion, when the commander is directly with the soldiers, the soldiers feel better morally, and the commander sees the situation on the battlefield in detail. -In our battalion, platoon and company commanders are on the first and second lines of defense. At least one of the officers of the company or platoon is constantly in position. -All fighters know their commanders by face and regularly see them at ground zero,- notes the deputy commander. According to him, the tactics of the enemy have also changed during this time, and more than once. -Currently, the main task of commanders at all levels is to identify and destroy as many enemy targets as possible, as far as firepower is available, and to secure our infantry. Usually the Russians send a column of 5-10 pieces of equipment: mostly a tank with a trawl goes, then the main column: 2 tanks, an armored personnel carrier, an armored personnel carrier, all with infantry. It is this equipment that we destroy on the far frontiers, even on the approach to our positions,- says Arkas. According to him, there used to be roll after roll of equipment with a difference of an hour, 3-4 assaults per day. Over time, the Russians changed their tactics — they began to use infantry groups themselves without the use of armored vehicles. Later, they began to fly into positions on motorcycles or golf carts, in several groups, and some enemy attacks succeeded due to the effect of surprise. -Over time, we understood exactly what types of attacks there can be, and how to counter them. Thanks to the coordinated work of each unit, in particular drone operators and mortars, we manage to repel heavy enemy assaults,- the officer assures. From the command to the ordinary infantrymen in the trenches, the unit adheres to the principle of proactivity - the enemy must be constantly kept in suspense and put pressure on him. -It is not customary for us to avoid -double talk-. When our infantry sees the enemy, everything flies. Sometimes you have to calm them down there. There would be pistols - the boys would shoot with pistols. I have a fighter on pseudo -Trophy-. My former platoon sergeant. So I often stopped him: -Can you let others shoot too? Calm down a bit.- He will see movement somewhere, immediately -Arkas, let's work out? We need to cheer them up.- Our people themselves understand that if you don't show your teeth, sooner or later you'll be attacked. When the enemy has just climbed out somewhere, -lighted up-, and immediately flies towards him, he is even afraid to go out afterwards. Then you fly around their positions, and they have yellow bottles of urine lying around the trenches, because they are afraid to go to the toilet,- Arkas laughs. According to him, the current war requires round-the-clock inclusion. -I always have a work tablet on in my dugout. I fall asleep under the current and wake up under the current. I hear through a dream that both AGS and LNG are already working. I run into the KSP, and they report to me: -Arkas, they started moving, and we hit them right away.- Then they buried something near 8 occupiers. Then it turned out from the intercepts that this group was supposed to storm us. And they did not even reach the assembly point. Thank God that there are such proactive people who have fire in their eyes and have no mercy for the occupiers,- says the Deputy Commander-in-Chief. He is convinced: people are the main resource in war, it is not the equipment and weapons that fight, people fight. -Almost everything in our country rests on the bright heads of the servicemen themselves. We in the battalion maximize the strengths of each soldier and use their professional skills from civilian life. For example, a brigade is being replenished: we know that a person in civilian life was an electrician or a good car repairer, and in the brigade he took the position of a gunner. Over time, this serviceman moves from infantry and position work to more specialized work: repairing equipment, helping with equipment, etc. We always ask the military what they understand and what exactly they want to do,- says Arkas. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 4th mechanized battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky destroyed the Russians, who tried to jump into our positions. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/27/u-nas-ne-zavedeno-unykaty-dvizhuhy-zamkombata-arkas-pro-sytuacziyu-zahidnishe-vugledara/	2024-09-26T21:16:23-07:00

BTR-60M -Khorunzhy-: what is the descendant of the famous armored car capable of with a new -heart- ...	About the relevant decision of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine ArmyInform reported on September 2. The editors asked Andrii Haruk, a well-known arms researcher, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny, to share his impressions of this armored vehicle. — Yes, I know that the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has codified (i.e. provided the NATO code) another Ukrainian armored personnel carrier — BTR-60M -Khorunzhy- produced by NVO -Praktyka- (famous, in particular, for its -Kozak- armored vehicles). This machine already has a certain history - it has been known at least since 2021. -Khorunzhiy- is positioned as a modernization of the BTR-60 (which is clearly hinted at by the designation BTR-60M). But I (I'll emphasize right away - I'm familiar with -Khorunzhi- only from the photo) cannot understand WHAT in the BTR-60M remained from the basic BTR-60 (probably BTR-60PB). - On what, Andriy Ivanovich, are your conclusions based? - The body is completely new, with a changed location of the motor-transmission compartment (moved from the aft part of the body to the right front). Thanks to this, the armored personnel carrier got rid of the hereditary defect of the entire family, starting from the BTR-60 and ending with the BTR-90, which is the lack of ergonomics. Now the paratroopers for entering/exiting the vehicle use a convenient ramp, as on Western vehicles and the Ukrainian BTR-4. In addition, the height of the body has also been increased, which also had a positive effect on ergonomics. The paired installation of antique GAZ-49B carburetor engines was replaced by a 210 hp Deutz diesel engine. This entailed a replacement of the transmission, in which a modern six-speed Allison automatic transmission appeared. The BTR-60 could have remained, except for the bridges, but this is also inaccurate. - In the very name of these combat vehicles, it is determined that they are supposed to protect soldiers from threats on the battlefield. What is known about the reservation of this platform? - The armor protection corresponds to the CCSA-4 class, that is, the first level of the STANAG 4569 standard. at a distance of 30 m and more, as well as from fragments of 155-mm shells in the event of an explosion at a distance of at least 100 m. This is not a very high level of protection. But thanks to this, the BTR-60M turned out to be quite light - its equipped weight is 10,800 kg (according to the developer, this is probably the weight of the -bare- chassis, without the combat module). - As far as I know, this machine has been presented to the general public before - In October 2021, the prototype of -Khorunzhoi- was demonstrated in Kyiv at the -Digital Future of the Army- exhibition in the configuration of a command and staff vehicle. A tower with a telescopic antenna mast, similar to the BMP-1KSH tower, was installed on it. &nbsp; Review of -Khorunzhy- in the KShM variant. Video: Building Tech But already in mid-November, this same prototype (board number -240-) was tested on the test site with the Turkish SARP KPVT combat module, armed with a 14.5-mm KPVT machine gun. The decision, in my opinion, is questionable in view of the relatively low reliability of the KPVT and the lack of auxiliary weapons. There are also SARP Dual modules, which provide for the installation of weapons units (machine guns of caliber 12.7 and 7.62 mm, or a 40-mm automatic grenade launcher and a 7.62-mm machine gun) and are installed on Ukrainian armored vehicles - Kozak-2M1 armored cars or MT-LB transporters. — However, in addition to the exhibition presentations, this machine went through codification and baptism of fire. What do you know about it? - February 18, 2023 -Khorunzhiy- -lighted up- for the first time at the front. The example that got into the short video differs from the first prototype in some details of the body construction, the lack of video cameras of a circular view, etc. It is armed with a hand-operated turret-mounted machine gun and crown-type protection, the same as on many Cossacks. Since then, no information about the combat use of the BTR-60M has been published. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/27/btr-60m-horunzhyj-na-shho-zdatnyj-nashhadok-vidomoyi-bronemashyny-z-novym-serczem-ta-obladunkamy/	2024-09-26T20:50:15-07:00
From the Luhansk airport to the battles in Kurshchyna: the story of Stanislav Havrysh, full knight o...	One of the names on the list of awardees is Major Stanislav Gavrish. The officer was awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, 1st degree. So, now he has become a full cavalier of this high state award. Stanislav is a serviceman of the 80th separate airborne assault brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. A graduate of the military academy in Lviv, later in Odesa. He says that since childhood he dreamed of the army, the service attracted him. Hardened by battles since 2014, in particular for the Luhansk airport. After graduating from the military college, he immediately went to Kharkiv Oblast to the battalion's base camp. Next is the war zone. And already on August 1, 2014, Havrysh and his unit went to Luhansk airport. -The tanks occupied the heights and fired at us from the heights. Morally, everyone could stand. Morally, everyone suffered. Everyone was ready to give their lives in case of need,- recalled he is interviewing in 2021. -On the night of August 2, 2014, there was heavy shelling from Grady.- It was the first night in the zone, we were -baptized-. By morning, ammunition was still being torn apart&#8230; We then suffered serious losses in equipment, until the morning we extinguished the fire&#8230; Then there was mortar shelling. Didn't understand at first what it was. Saw several flashes from the Luhansk side. Fields with wheat were on fire, the whole land was burned,- the soldier said. Then, in the distant 2014, the military man had to understand and see with his own eyes how treacherous the enemy is. -Entering the villages, we saw the consequences of enemy artillery shelling, the affected families. One woman buried her daughter, granddaughter, great-granddaughter. And I was left alone. Our boys were still helping with the burial,- the officer shared. In 2021, officer Havrysh went to study in the Czech Republic, where our military took courses in combat shooting. Then, along with Ukrainian paratroopers, military personnel from 10 other countries mastered the methods of firing according to NATO standards. All classes were conducted by British instructors. The officer uses all this accumulated experience during the large-scale invasion of the Russians. Works well: in September 2022, while still a captain, Havrysh was awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky II degree by Presidential Decree. Now the officer is a participant in the Armed Forces operation in the Kursk region. And on September 16, the soldier became a full knight of the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi. Let us add that the same Decree of the President of Ukraine contains the name of Major Yaroslav Kryklyvy. The officer was awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, II degree.

What is known about the special information operation of the Russian Federation and what are the ter...	The same information with reference to -anonymous sources- was also spread by the Turkish publication Aydınlık. This publication belongs to the pro-Russian party Vatan and regularly rebroadcasts Russian propaganda and anti-Ukrainian fakes. Repeated statements and groundless accusations against Ukraine are the signature style of Putin fakers. This is a typical Russian special information operation aimed at promoting a narrative about an allegedly -terrorist- Ukraine and -Kyiv's ties to international terrorism.- In this way, Moscow is trying to discredit Ukraine in the eyes of the international community, as well as to divert attention from its own crimes, which are quite real and proven. After all, it is Russia that actively and openly cooperates with the terrorist organizations Hamas and the Taliban, and also supports the international terrorist activities of the -Wagner- PMC. In addition, it constantly lures mercenaries from many countries of Asia, Latin America, Africa and even Europe to the war in Ukraine. So, as of May 2024, according to the data of the IOU GUR, citizens of India, Nepal, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Venezuela, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Burkina Faso, Mali, Algeria fought on the side of the Russian army. Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo, Uganda and the Central African Republic, as well as Serbia and Moldova (from Transnistria and Gagauzia).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/27/shho-vidomo-pro-informaczijnu-speczoperacziyu-rf-i-do-chogo-tut-terorysty/	2024-09-26T20:30:50-07:00
American air defense systems for F-16: defeating Russia according to the Yugoslav scenario	After all, -air-to-ground- weapons are not only -air-to-surface- missiles, but also all aviation munitions used by combat aircraft to hit ground targets. It also includes aerial bombs, air-launched cruise missiles, automatic guns, machine guns and grenade launchers. Attention to this detail in the official message is fully justified, because earlier Politco announced that the United States will provide Ukraine with unique high-precision, medium-range AGM-154 JSOW gliding guided bombs. According to the publication, the range of this weapon, which is capable of hitting enemy targets at a considerable distance, will allow Ukrainian F-16 pilots to stay at a safe distance from the line of combat, beyond the reach of Russian air defense. AGM-154 JSOW strike with a unitary warhead First of all, the AGM-154 JSOW is intended for use against poorly protected targets, such as: lightly armored armored vehicles and trucks, aircraft at base airfields, as well as anti-aircraft missile systems. Although this munition is not an air-to-ground missile and its range is more limited, it is quite sufficient to effectively destroy front-line ammunition and fuel-lubricating depots, hit enemy positions, communication nodes, and manpower. Strike AGM-154 JSOW with a cluster warhead AGM-154 JSOW is capable of hitting targets protected by enemy air defense. This makes it possible to significantly reduce or even eliminate the risk of damage to the aircraft from which this guided aerial bomb is launched. Gliding of the munition is provided by two wings that extend after launch and provide flight at a given distance to the target. When dropped from low altitudes, the AGM-154 JSOW is capable of hitting targets at a distance of up to 22 km. In the case of a high-altitude launch, its flight range can be up to 130 km. The total weight of the ammunition is about 500 kg. It can have both unitary and cluster warheads. Among the advantages of the AGM-154 JSOW should be counted the high accuracy of guidance, especially when it comes to geolocated static targets. Also, the ammunition has an infrared homing head, invulnerable to radio frequency interference. In addition, this glider bomb is inconspicuous to air defenses, so it is practically impossible to shoot it down. This makes the AGM-154 JSOW a highly effective munition capable of keeping Ukrainian F-16s safe, as they will be able to drop them without flying into the range of Russian air defense. The AGM-154 JSOW was used in a number of prominent US and other NATO military operations. Among them: The most famous of these operations is the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO forces as part of the 78-day Operation Allied Force. At that time, the planes of the North Atlantic Alliance made about 2,300 rocket-bomb attacks on almost a thousand objects on the territory of Serbia and Montenegro. In total, 23,000 missiles and aerial bombs were dropped on Yugoslavia, including about 14,000 aerial bombs with a total weight of 27,000 tons. Among the main targets of the rocket-bombing attacks were Yugoslav air defense targets, which were hit by F-16CG and F-15E Strike Eagle aircraft, including AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon glide bombs. The air defense of Yugoslavia failed to effectively counter the bombing and was practically destroyed. Industrial enterprises, oil storage facilities, infrastructure and energy facilities, logistics hubs, including railway and road bridges were also hit. Also, the bombing caused casualties among the civilian population and the destruction of dozens of medical and educational institutions, historical and architectural monuments, and about 40,000 residential buildings. Subsequently, the casualties among the civilian population of Yugoslavia and the destruction of non-military objects during the bombing of the country by NATO forces allowed the Russian Federation to blasphemously justify the war crimes of the Russian military during the large-scale Russian attack on Ukraine. For example, if the NATO countries could bomb Yugoslavia, then the Russian Federation seems to have the right to strike Ukraine with impunity, destroy civilian objects and kill Ukrainian civilians, disregarding any international treaties and conventions, rules and customs of war. The possible provision of AGM-154 JSOW guided air bombs to Ukraine as part of the new US aid package to Ukraine could significantly help the Defense Forces to counter Russian aggression. However, there are a number of factors that can negatively affect the use of AGM-154 JSOW against military targets of the Russian Federation. First of all, it is Russian air defense, significantly more powerful than what Yugoslavia once had. In addition, as a counterpart to the Russian KAB, a guided air bomb, the AGM-154 JSOW is a fairly expensive munition. Depending on the modification, its price is from almost 300 thousand and significantly higher. Considering the price, the number of such AGM-154 JSOW that can be transferred to Ukraine within the limits of the new aid package cannot be significant and commensurate in number with the Russian anti-tank missiles, with which the Russian army regularly strikes Ukrainian territory. Not to mention that the US has a limited number of AGM-154 JSOWs that it can transfer to Ukraine. High-quality high-precision ammunition of Western production may, in general, turn out to be less effective than cheap, low-quality Russian anti-aircraft guns, which will be taken not so much by the accuracy of hits as by the mass of use. Only the practical use of the transferred ammunition will show whether it will be possible to defeat Russian numbers with American quality and deal with Russia -according to the Yugoslav scenario-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/27/amerykanski-kaby-dlya-f-16-zdolaty-rosiyu-za-yugoslavskym-sczenariyem/	2024-09-26T20:20:19-07:00

As reported by ArmyInform, USA announced the provision of defense aid to Ukraine in the total amount of $7.9 billion. At the same time, Great Britain announced its intention to speed up providing Ukraine necessary military support, and the new government intends to exceed its promise to supply 12 AS90 self-propelled artillery units.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/26/nimechchyna-zbilshyla-vijskovu-dopomogu-ukrayini-na-400-mln-yevro/	2024-09-26T11:34:03-07:00
A draft law on the Unified State Register of Military Servicemen may appear in Ukraine	This is reported in messages MOU. -The creation of the Unified Register is another step in the digital modernization of our military management system. When the draft law becomes law, we will receive legal tools for working with information about a serviceman and protecting such data. This will allow our military personnel to manage their careers and acquire the necessary education and skills. As a state, we will be able to provide them with administrative and social services in electronic format,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense for Digitalization. The draft law provides: The draft law provides that the register will not contain information about military service, rank or specialty. Sensitive data, the developers suggest, will be stored in protected circuits of other information systems and, if necessary, can be depersonalized using Military ID instead of first and last name.

So that people can conveniently come here or call, contact recruiters and not be afraid of anything. You can come or call, at least ten times, if necessary. The experience of the recruiting center on the right bank is absolutely positive. Kyivans and guests of the capital come and are interested.

Winter is near, autumn is already here: are the Defense Forces ready for the cold	The chief of the planning department of the 13th brigade of operational assignment -Charter- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- - Lieutenant Colonel Anton Baev of the National Guard of Ukraine. — With the change of season, we see that the forest begins to fall and the terrain begins to open up. This is good for us, because we begin to see the enemy where he was not visible. And secondly, it is a risk for our units. But we already went through it at the previous place, where we performed combat missions. We already know this situation, we know how to prepare for it, said the soldier. He said that, first of all, the change of season will affect the nature of the infantrymen's combat work. - The conditions of our area were such that it was a dense forest, our assault groups always noticed that it was difficult to work in the forests, because when we entered the forest, the visibility was no more than 2 meters. Almost blindly, our units advance through the forest, and contacts with the enemy can occur on level ground, - said the soldier. He assured that they started actively preparing for the change of season and weather conditions in the unit at least a month and a half ago. — The brigade went on combat missions for the first time precisely during the winter. We were preparing even before the exit, we calculated everything and prepared well. Therefore, this situation is not critical for us at the moment. Having some experience, we are preparing for this in advance, - emphasized the military man. The officer explained that the planning processes take place in advance, because in no case can one afford to miss the moment, especially in the conditions of war. — Our units are equipped with warm clothes and heating devices. But we understand that no matter how much you put on the front, it is a war, and any position can be destroyed along with all the property that is there, - noted the military man. He also explained the danger of a number of measures to arrange permanent residences and heating in the conditions of hostilities. Common in civilian life, they are unacceptable near the battle line. — For example, we can't put a burgher in the front positions, because it's smoke, it's unmasking. Therefore, it is necessary to purchase additional power supplies, such as EcoFlow, and some small chemicals that help warm hands, feet, and so on, the officer noted. In addition, Anton Baev drew attention to the peculiarities of arranging shelters depending on weather conditions and soil characteristics. — The soil behaves differently, the water level can rise and fall. Some means are needed that will pump water from the positions so as not to sit knee-deep in water, he noted. The -Charter- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine prepares for all this in advance. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Russian trenches are dug by -disposable slaves- and deliberately and purposefully shoot at their own (she explained why is this the norm for the enemy), and also informed that the occupiers use outdated Soviet armored vehicles, which, however, make a combat unit and change the methods of its protection.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/26/zyma-blyzko-osin-vzhe-chy-gotovi-syly-oborony-do-holodiv/	2024-09-26T01:49:18-07:00

He said that, first of all, the change of season will affect the nature of the infantrymen's combat work. - The conditions of our area were such that it was a dense forest, our assault groups always noticed that it was difficult to work in the forests, because when we entered the forest, the visibility was no more than 2 meters. -Almost blindly, our units advance through the forest and contact with the enemy can occur on level ground,- the soldier said. He assured that active preparations for the change of season and weather conditions in the subdivision began at least a month and a half ago. — The brigade went on combat missions for the first time precisely in the winter period. We were preparing even before leaving, we calculated everything and prepared well. Therefore, this situation is not critical for us at the moment. Having some experience, we are preparing for this in advance, - emphasized the military man. The officer explained that the planning processes take place in advance, because in no case can one afford to miss the moment, especially in the conditions of war. — Our units are equipped with both warm clothes and heating devices. But we understand that no matter how much you put on the front, this is a war and any position can be destroyed along with all the property that is there, the military man noted. He also explained the danger of a number of measures for arranging permanent residences and heating in the conditions of hostilities. Common in civilian life, they are unacceptable near the battle line. — For example, we can't put a burgher in the front positions, because it's smoke, it's unmasking. Therefore, it is necessary to purchase additional power supplies, such as EcoFlow, and some small chemicals that help warm hands, feet, and so on, the officer noted. In addition, Anton Baev drew attention to the specifics of arranging shelters depending on weather conditions and soil characteristics. — The soil behaves differently, the water level can rise and fall. Some means are needed that will pump water from the positions so as not to sit knee-deep in water, he noted. The -Charter- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine prepares for all this in advance. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Russians trenches are dug by -disposable slaves- and deliberately and purposefully shoot at their own (she explained, why is this the norm for the enemy), and also informed that the occupiers use obsolete Soviet armored vehicles, which, however, make a combat unit and change the methods of its protection.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/26/zyma-blyzko-osin-vzhe-pogodni-zminy-ta-syly-oborony/	2024-09-26T01:49:18-07:00

Fracture injuries are the most common type of injuries. Hard, painful, torn, sometimes fatal. The occupiers do not know the line between acceptable and inhumane. Able to bring only grief and trouble, they continue to fight with all possible means of defeat. Evacuation from the battlefield is complicated by shelling and enemy attempts to destroy the evacuation transport. In such conditions, it is possible to save the wounded, who receive proper help from the brigade's medical staff. -This war has been going on for an unbearably long time, but no one has the right to surrender. Especially a doctor. Every living wounded person is a victory. Every day of our defense is a victory,- the brigades say.

The border is on fire: the border with a terrorist country is under constant fire	Andriy Demchenko, spokesman, told about this on the broadcast of the -Edyny Novyny- marathon State Border Service of Ukraine. -What our border groups record is that the majority of shelling occurs in the Sumy region. The enemy is also actively shelling Kharkiv Oblast. Well, it is necessary to understand that in the Kharkiv region there are two centers where active combat operations are being conducted - in the direction of the settlement of Liptsi and Vovchansk. There are fewer shellings in Chernihiv Oblast, but they are also present there every day,- said the spokesperson of the State Border Service of Ukraine. The enemy actively uses artillery and unmanned aerial vehicles of the shock type. If we talk about the Sumy region, then aviation is also actively striking here. Although the situation with shelling is heterogeneous in the region itself. -Actually, within those limits where the Armed Forces of Ukraine are conducting a corresponding operation in the direction of the Kursk region, we can even talk about a decrease in the activity of shelling there. But the Sumy region has a border with a terrorist country of more than 500 kilometers, and the enemy continues to strike in other areas,- assured Andriy Demchenko. ArmyInform told, however, that attempts to illegally cross the western border continue, and the number of those willing has definitely decreased over the past month and a half.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/26/kordon-u-vogni-mezha-z-krayinoyu-terorystom-pid-postijnymy-obstrilamy/	2024-09-26T00:47:33-07:00

-Parktronic- for the drone: the occupiers are improving the system of protection of reconnaissance U...	About how the Ukrainian defenders overcome the resistance of the Russians, on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon the deputy commander told Oles Malyarevich of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket chieftain Ivan Sirk of the -Achilles- shock air defense battalion. — Every day, we used some solutions, because the enemy is already putting anti-aircraft missiles on these planes, and rear-view cameras to see what is flying up. This is a very difficult job, which is carried out by our best pilots and technical personnel of the battalion. This is a special mission and they are doing it successfully, he said. The classic -projectile and armor competition- — the confrontation between the means of destruction and protection — has found new manifestations in the -war of drones.- However, the technical solutions of the enemy help him only temporarily. — It happens that we shoot down one or two UAVs every day, and then we cannot do it for three or four days because they invented a solution to counter us. We gather a technical quorum of specialists, decide what needs to be done to beat them in this matter, find these solutions and continue working. This is a constant struggle of technologies, minds, - said the military man. He noted that the main task of Ukrainian drones is to deprive the Russian occupiers of seeing the positions and movements of the units of the Defense Forces on the ground. He also expressed confidence that the soldiers of the Defense Forces always surpass the enemy in terms of knowledge and creativity. - On their part, it must be admitted that there are many intelligent people who, unfortunately, work for destruction, for death, while we work for life. I am sure that our intellectual potential is much higher than that of the enemy, and we will win because of this. Not with quantity, but with quality, with intelligence, - emphasized the officer. The officer said that over the past few days, the drones of the -Achilles- attack UAV battalion shot down 16 enemy reconnaissance UAVs. - We learned to knock them down. After the war, we will tell how it was done, said Oles Malyarevich. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that reconnaissance UAVs of Russians have been shot down by drones for more than seven months.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/26/parktronik-dlya-drona-okupanty-vdoskonalyuyut-systemu-zahystu-rozviduvalnyh-bpla/	2024-09-26T00:34:42-07:00
-Shopopalo-, which is being built next to the Kerch bridge, will not be completed this season.	On September 26, on the broadcast of the -Edyny Novyni- marathon declared the spokesman of the Military - Dmytro Pletenchuk, captain of the 3rd rank of the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. We are talking about a mysterious building, which the occupiers will have next to the Kerch bridge. Her role is not yet clear. It can be both a hydrotechnical structure and barrier structures. -What it is will be clear when they finish it. And in this season, they most likely won't be able to do it. Because the period of storms is beginning and, accordingly, it will be very difficult to build something in such conditions. It may be a protective structure, it may be some kind of regular transition, but for now it may be a little too early to draw conclusions. In any case, we will see how they will pass in this period, which begins in the fall and ends already in the spring,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. Also, according to the spokesman of the Armed Forces Navy, there are chances that the construction is completely useless - because from time to time the remains of any construction in the sea are washed ashore after another storm.

Destroy the enemy's artillery: the expert revealed the secret of the success of the Defense Forces o...	Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmyInform why this was achieved and how much enemy artillery still needs to be destroyed in order to deprive Russia of the possibility of using these weapons against Ukraine. It is no secret that in order to suppress and destroy the artillery of the Russian occupiers, the Ukrainian defenders are conducting a counter-battery fight on different areas of the front. — First of all, there are a few very important questions about the artillery that need to be cleared up. Despite the fact that drones enter the great war as a very serious striking force, no one will ever replace artillery on the battlefield. Why? Of course, the drone is very good, it is a high-precision and high-quality weapon. But the drone can carry 2, 3, well, a maximum of 5 kg of explosives. Instead, 152-mm or 155-mm artillery ammunition is within 50 kg of the iron itself plus 5-7 kg of explosives, Petro Chernyk emphasizes. Another key point. Ammunition shrapnel is the primary impact force. After all, artillery ammunition can scatter them at great speed over large areas, that is, it is a much more powerful and serious striking force than a drone. Artillery therefore remains paramount in this war. At the moment, despite the use of even drones, at least 80% of the war takes place with the help of artillery. So far, the Defense Forces have set absolute records for the destruction of enemy artillery. More than 18,000 Russian artillery units were affected. That's a fantastic amount. At the beginning of this war, especially until the spring of 2023, 90% of the hits in counter-battery duels were actually done by artillery. That is, cannon on cannon. Why did we manage to work so well? Ukrainian gunners have modern means for accurate detection of enemy artillery. These are, in particular, counter-battery radars, which were provided by our partner countries as part of military assistance to counter Russian aggression. The German COBRA radar system is very effective in detecting enemy artillery. It is considered one of the world's best ground-based weapon detection systems. With a declared detection range of up to 100 km, COBRA is capable of detecting and classifying up to 40 units of artillery systems in two minutes. Plus, the American counter-battery system AN/TPQ-36 at a distance of up to 24 km can count up to 20 units of artillery barrels. And at close distances of 4-5 km, the AN/TPQ-48 and 50 systems are already operating. To defeat enemy armored vehicles, our artillery actively and extremely effectively uses -smart munitions- such as SMArt 155 and BONUS, which contain homing subelements. Let's not forget the M982 Excalibur guided munitions. In the spring of 2023, the mass use of FPV drones began. Precisely for the destruction of enemy artillery installations. — Our gunners have learned to calculate the location of the enemy's artillery installations very well. By the way, again thanks to these counter-battery systems. They were able to accurately direct FPV drones. Therefore, we have a phenomenal result for the summer of this year. More than 4,500 artillery installations of the Rosarmy were affected. If you divide this indicator by the number 72 (for example, the regular artillery brigade of the enemy is 72 artillery units. - Ed.), then more than 60 enemy artillery brigades were destroyed (damaged). But there are several nuances. Because quite understandable questions arise, why does Russia have such huge reserves in terms of artillery supply? And what is their margin of safety? At the beginning of the invasion, the regular complex of the Russian Federation had approximately 5,400 barrels and more than 10,000 in storage. Plus up to 5 thousand mortars. Currently, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces, more than 18,000 enemy artillery systems have been destroyed. But there is a certain pitfall, I would say, in terms of calculation. It's not a bug, it's just that accounting is very complicated. — Let's take a look at the D-20 installation as an example. It is a heavy gun, has a large armor plate, and is on rubber wheels. A drone flies into it with a 2-3 kilogram explosive. A cannon is considered hit even if the wheels are burned and the sight is broken. But often after the explosion, the barrel, breech and recoil remain intact. How to count then? Is it already a decommissioned barrel or not? No, not written off, explains Petro Chernyk. Losses are not 100% destruction of artillery systems. In most cases, these are damages that only put the unit out of combat condition for a while, while keeping it repairable. - Then the Russians took the cannon to the factory, repaired it and returned it to the battle. That is, it is necessary to take into account the reverse cycle of equipment repair. It is simply impossible to calculate how many art barrels actually survived the repair. Therefore, in my opinion, 18 thousand destroyed artillery systems of the Russian Federation is not their absolute destruction. To be fair, it's an injury. It is a completely different thing when an Excalibur munition flies precisely on enemy equipment, and nothing is left of the installation. Then, of course, we can talk about the absolute destruction of technology. — Here lies the philosophy of answering the question, what is the enemy's margin of safety. And it is extremely difficult to give an exact answer, how much more needs to be hit, plus 6 or 7 thousand artillery installations, in order to completely deprive Russia of the possibility of using artillery on the battlefield, the military expert claims. It should not be forgotten that the Soviet Union produced a huge number of samples of a wide variety of artillery and delivered them, in particular, to so-called friendly countries. Russia is conducting targeted work to return artillery systems from African countries to ensure its own needs in the war against Ukraine. The Chinese are very covertly, in small numbers, but also provide the Russians with these weapons. Plus help to the Russian Federation from North Korea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/26/znyshhyty-artyleriyu-voroga-ekspert-rozkryv-sekret-uspihu-syl-oborony-ukrayiny/	2024-09-25T20:55:18-07:00

According to Ivan Fedorov, the Russians targeted a residential building and the territory of one of the industrial enterprises. The head of the OVA noted that private houses were mutilated. Emergency personnel and utility workers are working at the sites of the hits. As reported by ArmiyaInform, as a result of the air attack of UAVs on Kyiv in the Pechersk district, a fire previously broke out on the first floor of a 5-story residential building.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/26/vid-nichnogo-udaru-rosiyan-po-zhytlovij-zabudovi-zaporizhzhya-postrazhdala-dytyna/	2024-09-25T20:51:40-07:00
Three days in a coma, -Smerch- and pure victory in Japanese: the story of teacher - warrior Anton	The first story is about military serviceman Anton, a former educator and physical education teacher of the Novomykolaiv educational and rehabilitation center. What is it like to live without one kidney after being injured on the Bakhmut direction? Why did Anton's father not recognize his son's voice in September 2022? A military man told ArmyInform about this: - Before serving in the Armed Forces, I worked in an educational institution for children with severe speech disabilities. Work there was very difficult and troublesome. The groups of children were small, 12–16 students, because in such a school you have to pay more attention to everyone. He was a physical education teacher there, but most of the time he worked as an educator&#8230; Two educators were assigned to each class, who, in fact, performed the function of parents. For example, my shift starts. I take the children to the dining room. After that, they change clothes and the self-training begins. And you work with the children until the evening. Then you put them to sleep. One word, like a hen with chicks. And you come in the morning, wake up the children, dress them for lessons, and everyone should be clean and washed. You take them to breakfast, then take them to class and sit them at their desks, check for workbooks, textbooks. Morally, it is difficult&#8230; At that time, I was young, I still had enough strength. But if now, I probably wouldn't have the strength for such a job. Because, really, hard work. But then it's nice when your former, already adult students see you on the street, come up to say hello, and you understand that you worked for nothing. In 2017, I started serving in the 93rd separate mechanized brigade -Kholodny Yar-. I consider it my military alma mater. It was there that I gained combat experience. A large-scale invasion was encountered in this brigade. And on September 22, 2022, I was seriously injured in the direction of Bakhmut. There was an arrival. RSZV -Smerch-. Cartridge ammunition. It broke very close to me. Immediately such pain was not felt. And then&#8230; As a result of the injury, the right kidney is absent. They collected me, as they say, piece by piece. I have prostheses and implants inside. In total, I had 10 operations in a month and a half. &#8230;In the hospital in Dnipro, the doctors put me in a coma for three days. When I woke up after that, I did not understand anything. He calmed down only when he saw his own sister in the ward. Another interesting moment before the hospital was when he was still at the headquarters. He opened his eyes. I asked the doctor for his phone number, dialed his father, because of all the numbers at that moment, he was the only one I remembered. And when you are under anesthesia, your voice changes for a certain period. I say: -It's me, your son Anton.- And the father: -This is not my son.- Because the number is not mine. And at that moment I say his favorite phrase, -wasari awaset ippon-. This is a judo term that translates to clear victory. Only then did my father recognize me. He asks what happened. I answer that it hurt a little, but everything is fine. All in all, I'm very lucky to be alive. But for something I stayed here in this world. &#8230;In July 2023, I was already in the army. Of course, he could not return to the brigade with such a diagnosis. Therefore, at first he served for a short period in one of the RTCC. Currently, I am in another structure of the Ground Forces Command. Some of the students who studied at the educational and rehabilitation center where I taught also joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And even two have already died. &#8230;By the way, I support the fact that the concept of the school subject -Defense of Ukraine- is changing now. I consider it very appropriate. And it had to be done since 2014. Children must be taught so that they are ready. Moreover, we do not know what will happen tomorrow. It is necessary for children to be able to protect themselves, their family, their relatives. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/26/try-dni-v-komi-smerch-ta-chysta-peremoga-po-yaponsky-istoriya-vchytelya-voyina-antona/	2024-09-25T20:45:34-07:00

50 kg of happiness on the enemy's head: a heavy-duty drone with a significant flight range was prese...	Warsaw defense publication Defence24 notes that, first of all, the new concept of the Polish unmanned aerial vehicle Warmate 50 attracts attention with its size, ArmiyaInform reports. In addition to the general presentation of the concept of their new creation, the Polish aircraft builders have currently limited themselves &#8230; general data about this UAV. It became known that, compared to the previous products of the company, it has much larger dimensions and, as the name suggests, a warhead weighing 50 kg. This development is distinguished not only by its large dimensions, but also by its functionality, since in this case it is the first sample of a long-range kamikaze drone created in Poland. At the moment, it is assumed that the Warmate 50 will be able to hit targets at a distance of several hundred kilometers. As follows from the publication of the IKK Defense Express defense portal, its experts believe that the Polish long-range drone kamikaze is just taking its final shape. Because, for example, regarding the power plant, there is only general information that it will be an -internal combustion engine-, the expected indicators regarding speed and specific flight range are not mentioned. There is also only a general mention that, unlike previous models, the Warmate 50 has been developed with an approach that involves -maximizing combat effectiveness through the flexibility of surveillance functions-, so it will be an unmanned aerial vehicle -intended exclusively for strike missions-. -In other words, in the case of the Warmate 50, it is assumed that this kamikaze drone will hit stationary targets at a long distance according to predetermined coordinates, and the in-flight guidance function at the command of the operator will not be available,- DE experts said. It is emphasized that the basis for the development of Warmate 50 was the Warmate 20 kamikaze drone, which is equipped with a warhead weighing 20 kilograms and the presentation of which took place in May 2024. In general, Warmate 50 is given the following characteristics - this drone will be able to fly even to Moscow. UAVs from the Warmate family are well known to drone operators from the Defense Forces of Ukraine. Within the charity project -Polskie drony Warmate do obrony Ukrainy!- Polish benefactors donated money for the purchase of dozens of drones. Our editors told in detail about these winged products from RP. The mention of -Moscow- caused a nervous reaction -from across the border-. In those swamps, the traditional great-power curling took place. In particular, some news outlets at one time compared the Warmate 50's predecessor, the Warmate 20, to the Russian Lancet. At the same time, the Kremlin troubadours shyly forgot to clarify that this ZALA -Lancet- , well somehow, VERY similar to &#8230; Israeli drone HERO. Warmate 20 in the Russian Federation was called -an analogue of that which has no analogues-, arguing that the warhead is larger than that of the Lancet and smaller than that of the Shahed/Gerany. In turn, editors from Warsaw's Polskie Radio noted: -Warmate 50 is an example of a solution that is increasingly dominating the modern battlefield. Thanks to a powerful warhead and a long flight range, the drone can significantly strengthen the operational capabilities of the Polish armed forces, especially in the context of delivering high-precision strikes on strategic targets.- Presentation of UAV Warmate 50.

Who did the propaganda win this time: fictional adventures of the Akhmatians in Kurshchyna	This was noted by the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security. In fact, this attack by a Kadyrov militant from the Akhmat unit is a development of the plot of Russian propaganda about the mass involvement of -mercenaries from NATO countries- in hostilities on the side of Ukraine. Russian fakers have been speculating on this since 2014. The plot about American mercenaries is needed by Kremlin propaganda to promote narratives about -foreign governance- in Ukraine and the desperate struggle against NATO aggression. Putin's propaganda invents -Western mercenaries- to explain the defeats of the Russians and the successes of the Ukrainians, whom it has ridiculed for decades. And Forward Observations Group, which Russian disinformers call a -private military company,- is a tactical equipment and medical equipment company founded by American veteran Derrick Bales. It has nothing to do with military operations in Ukraine. Creating such fakes allows the Kremlin to have support among the Russian population and to explain its own military failures. The successes of the Ukrainian army are often portrayed as the result of the help of -all-powerful- Western forces, rather than as achievements of the Ukrainian military. the Kremlin also constantly tries to portray Ukraine as a state that is not capable of standing up to Russia on its own and needs -mercenaries- for support. This is part of the narrative about the weakness of the Ukrainian army and the alleged -external management- of the country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/26/kogo-rospropaganda-pobyedila-czogo-razu-vygadani-prygody-ahmativcziv-na-kurshhyni/	2024-09-25T20:30:44-07:00

The MOU revealed the details of the restructuring of the procurement model for the Armed Forces with...	Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov informs about this. -It's not just about quantitative indicators of savings and procurement volumes, but also about fundamental shifts in resource management, digitalization, and the involvement of the Ukrainian manufacturer in the process of providing the army,- he said. One of the first strategic decisions of the new team was the restructuring of the procurement model for the Armed Forces according to NATO principles and with zero tolerance for corruption. -The Ministry abandoned the function of direct procurement, leaving behind only the establishment of the rules of the game. For this purpose, the Department of Procurement Policy was created within the structure of the Ministry of Defense - a key center for the development of procurement rules,- noted Dmytro Klimenkov. Direct purchases are assigned to specialized agencies: -Defense Procurement Agency- (AOZ) and -State Rear Operator- (DOT). They play a central role in meeting the needs of the Ukrainian army. According to the Deputy Minister of Defense, the division of functions is necessary for maximum transparency and prevention of corruption risks. A clear delineation of roles between the ministry and agencies ensures that each structure focuses on its tasks and also avoids conflicts of interest. AOZ took on the procurement of weapons and military equipment. DOT focused on rear support - the supply of food, fuel and lubricants, tangible property. These agencies are key elements in improving the efficiency and transparency of the procurement process for the Armed Forces. -However, as we move towards joining NATO, we are continuing procurement reform to improve efficiency and meet Alliance standards,- he said. In his opinion, one of the important steps was the decision to merge the two agencies responsible for the provision of defense needs into a single structure. Military practice showed that the parallel work of these agencies led to duplication of functions, inefficient use of resources and delays in decision-making. And in the conditions of war, this is unacceptable, since the promptness of the supply of military equipment and equipment is critical. The single agency will be created on the basis of the State Rear Operator (DOT), which has already demonstrated its effectiveness, transparency and integrity in the provision of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -This will make it possible to optimize processes and ensure compliance with NATO standards, which will bring us closer to integration into Euro-Atlantic defense structures,- Dmytro Klimenkov assured. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkovtalkedabout the principles of a new food supply model for the Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/25/u-mou-rozkryly-podrobyczi-perebudovy-zakupivelnoyi-modeli-dlya-zsu-z-nulovoyu-tolerantnistyu-do-korupcziyi/	2024-09-25T08:26:13-07:00

Cheap consumables: Russians fight with -disposable- soldiers	Officer 1 of the separate detachment of the Special Purpose Center -Omega- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- - of the National Guard of Ukraine. — They sometimes use the so-called meat assaults, using their junk that they have in the state. This is how he makes reconnaissance a battle and after that discovers our advanced positions, - he said. In this way, the enemy implements the tactics of assault by small groups of infantry and tries to carry out combat tasks at the expense of the lives of its soldiers. -Sometimes they use their personnel to scout out our positions and then destroy them,- the officer explained. Such combat reconnaissance is deadly for the vast majority of enemy attack aircraft, as Ukrainian drones effectively work on the logistics of the occupiers in their near rear, destroy enemy command posts and shelters, and shoot down Russian reconnaissance drones that adjust enemy artillery fire. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that technique of the occupiers — Soviet junk, but the enemy makes it a combat unit, and also informed that suicide soldiers dig trenches for the Russians.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/25/deshevi-vytratni-materialy-rosiyany-voyuyut-odnorazovymy-soldatamy/	2024-09-25T03:26:52-07:00

-New women are giving birth-: in Kharkiv Oblast, the Russian command is fighting with -Zhukiv- tacti...	Why do Russians need this, the head of the planning department of the 13th operational brigade explained on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- appointment of -Charter- of the National Guard of Ukraine, Lieutenant Colonel Anton Baev. — It is a very common story for the enemy to discover our firepower precisely by manpower. The groups are sent precisely in order to draw attention to themselves and to draw out all our means, which begin to work actively to destroy and prevent the enemy from reaching our own infantry, he said. Such a lethal tactic for enemy infantrymen allows the enemy to identify fire positions and determine the fire system of Defense Forces units in order to then inflict fire damage on them. - In this way, our artillery and mortars are discovered - and they start working, - explained the soldier. When something goes wrong with the enemy, he does not hesitate to open artillery fire on those areas where his own infantry are. — Friendly fire is also present if everything falls apart in them, plans collapse, and they see that they are losing the initiative. Or we already proceed to certain actions and start to move a little, we make such small counterattacks, then they do not spare ammunition for the artillery and cover the squares where their units are located, - said Anton Baev. The Russian command is allowed to do so not only by the absence of any moral and ethical safeguards, but also by the presence of a sufficient number of manpower, which can be safely thrown to the slaughter, and the confidence that the losses will be replenished without delay. - We actually record from various sources - both from our air reconnaissance and from the interrogation of prisoners, which our brigade periodically takes, that our enemy is periodically replenished with manpower, - said the guardsman. Under such an approach, the quality of training of enemy soldiers does not matter at all. - This power can be different. As well as the barely mobilized and untrained ones, as well as those who have already fought a little. But there is constant replenishment, because as the fighting goes on, they lose a lot of manpower. And you have to hold on, you have to move forward, that's why they are constantly being replenished, - emphasized the officer. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that open artillery fire on own soldiers is a routine practice for the Russian military, and not an occasional excess.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/25/baby-novyh-narozhayut-na-harkivshhyni-rosijske-komanduvannya-voyuye-za-zhukivskoyu-taktykoyu/	2024-09-25T02:29:23-07:00

-The task remains unchanged-: the Armed Forces explained why the Russians are rushing to Kharkiv	What is the enemy's goal, explained by the commander of the -Achilles- air defense missile battalion on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon. Captain Yury Fedorenko of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the Kosh chieftain Ivan Sirk. — For the enemy, the task remains the same - they are assigned the task of advancing as much as possible through the battle formations of the Defense Forces to the administrative borders of the city of Kharkiv with the aim of further raising firepower and inflicting fire damage on residential areas. It is important for the enemy to increase his terror, for him it is important to destroy Ukrainians, the officer said. For this purpose, the occupiers are trying to carry out shock and assault actions in the north of the Kharkiv region, first of all, on the part of the battle line that is closest to the administrative borders of the regional center. This is a shade of Hlyboke — Liptsi. However, the Defense Forces managed and continue to manage to deter the offensive actions of the enemy. It was possible to achieve this thanks to the combination of two factors - the effective actions of units to destroy the occupiers and the Kursk operation. — The defense forces managed to significantly defeat the enemy's shock-assault potential. Also, after the beginning of the Kursk operation, the enemy was forced in one way or another to transfer the reserves that were supposed to strengthen their grouping on this stretch to Kurshchyna, the drone commander explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Russians hit the two residential high-rise buildings in Kharkiv, in one of the damaged buildings, floors from the eighth to the third were destroyed, in general as a result of the heavy bombardment with six aerial bombs, it is known about three dead and more than 30 injured people.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/25/zavdannya-zalyshayetsya-nezminnym-u-zsu-poyasnyly-navishho-rosiyany-rvutsya-do-harkova/	2024-09-25T01:51:36-07:00

Russia's war against Ukraine will end because the UN Charter will come into effect - the President	The text of the President's speech was published on his official website. -One day, in this hall, they will definitely say that Russia's war against Ukraine is over: not frozen, not suspended, not forgotten - truly over. And it will not happen because someone is tired of the war. Not because someone bargained something out of Putin. Russia's war against Ukraine will end because the UN Charter will come into force. It should work. Our Ukrainian right to self-defense must prevail. Our cooperation with peoples of the world who value life as much as we do. Our territorial integrity. Our sovereignty, the independence of our country. We are protecting what every nation would certainly like to protect for itself. And what the UN Charter guarantees for everyone,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. According to him, it is Russia that always has to lie to justify its war. Not Ukraine. Russia cannot refer to the UN Charter to explain what it is doing against Ukraine. Actually, in her perverted way, in her distorted world, she does refer to the Statute, but this is simply madness. -Russia remained silent because it could not explain why a Russian missile recently hit a grain ship heading to an Egyptian port across the Black Sea. Russia is either silent or lying about why its drones and missiles are detected in the airspace of Poland, Moldova, and Romania. Ukrainians are injured and die every day. Daily. Today again Russian bombs hit residential buildings. Even an ordinary bakery became a target. What is so threatening for Russia in the production of bread? Putin has no answer. And Russia never has an honest answer to the question of why its army kills children in Ukraine, -defeats- schools and hospitals, fights not for justice, but for the blackout of a neighboring nation,- the President said. According to him, Putin has nothing to say if you ask him why he is trying to drag Belarus into war, why his propagandists threaten the peoples of the Caucasus or Central Asia, or why Russia invests most not in the development of humanity, but in hatred. Russia has no legitimate reason—absolutely—for making Iran and North Korea de facto accomplices in their criminal war in Europe when their weapons kill Ukrainians and help Putin steal Ukrainian land from the Ukrainian people. -We know that some people in the world want to talk to Putin. We know that. Meet, talk, communicate. But what exactly can they hear from him? That he is upset because we are exercising our right to protect our people? Or that he wants to continue the war and terror just so that no one thinks he was wrong? This is also madness,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He reminded that from the first second of this war, Russia is doing something that cannot be justified in any way according to the UN Charter. Every destroyed Ukrainian city, every burnt village — and there are already hundreds and hundreds of them — is proof that Russia is committing an international crime. And that is why this war cannot simply -subside-. -That is why this war cannot be calmed down by talks. Necessary actions. And I am grateful to all the nations that are really helping in ways that save the lives of our people. Putin has violated so many international norms and rules that he will not stop himself. Russia can only be forced to make peace. And this is exactly what is needed - to force Russia to make peace as the only aggressor in this war, the only violator of the UN Charter,- the President urged. He reminded that now, with the approach of the third winter of this war, Russia is again trying to destroy the Ukrainian energy industry, and this autumn it is acting even more cynically. -They are preparing to attack our nuclear power plants, three of them, we have this information and we have evidence of this. If Russia is willing to go this far, it means that none of what you value matters to Moscow. This kind of Russian cynicism will continue to strike if it is given any place in the world. The UN Charter leaves no room for this. And that is why the Peace Formula also leaves no room,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy assured. He recalled how in 2022, at the height of the war, while proposing the Peace Formula, he proposed to adhere to the UN Charter — to make effective everything for which this organization was created. Each point of the Peace Formula is based on the principles, goals and norms of the UN Charter - on the rights it guarantees to countries and on the resolutions of the General Assembly, which are already supported by the majority of countries. -And there are not different versions of the UN Charter for different parts of the world. There are no regional quasi-statutes. There is no separate UN Charter for the BRICS or the G7. There is no separate Russian-Iranian UN Charter or separate Sino-Brazilian UN Charter. There is only one UN Charter that unites everyone — should unite everyone. There is only one way to a just peace - clear steps that everyone understands equally, and this is reflected in the Peace Formula. This is the implementation of the UN Charter. And we all know what needs to be done if we honestly assess the situation and really want to stop Russia's war. And the most important thing is to act. Together, of course. Of course, in unity. Without creating new and unnecessary divisions of the world into blocs or regional groups. Unity always works for the benefit of peace,- the President assured. He stated that it is necessary to prepare a second Peace Summit to end the war. All together. And invited all principled nations to join Ukraine in this process. All those who truly respect the UN Charter. -We invite China. We invite Brazil. I have already invited India. We work with African countries, with all of Latin America, the Middle East, Central Asia, Europe, the Pacific region, and North America. All are equally important for peace. All of them. No exceptions. Just as the UN Charter should work without exception. This is the process that will lead us to peace. To a just peace. Real peace. Peace that will last. We all already know how to achieve it. We have the Peace Formula. We have the UN Charter. And we have all the forces necessary to implement this. All it takes is determination. Thank you very much. Glory to Ukraine!- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said.

Surface radio electronic fighter: French developers offer military sailors the Magellan drone	How informed the defense portal EDR, the mission of the novelty is to perform various tasks, starting from radio-electronic warfare, information gathering, target detection and identification, and ending with reconnaissance and surveillance of surface and underwater objects, ArmyInform reports. With a length of six meters and a displacement of 1,000 to 1,200 kilograms, Magellan is an addition to the Couach product line. from its R&D department, Couach Shipyard, to ensure a systematic response to the needs expressed by customers. According to the designers of the unmanned vessel, it was expected to embody three key characteristics: technological modularity, perfect sea characteristics and practicality of operation. The ship's hull is made of composite, carbon and Kevlar, which makes it strong and adaptable to defense needs. Couach Shipyard's research in maritime security makes Magellan a platform capable of handling the constraints at sea. The drone is highly resistant to water and was designed using self-leveling technology. Its innovative hybrid diesel-electric propulsion is based on the use of a 13 kW micro-turbine, which allows it to sail for 5 days at a speed of 6 knots with reduced noise to provide drone camouflage. Magellan features a modular technology platform design capable of carrying a large volumetric payload – over 500 liters – for the integration of end-user-selected equipment. The drone can be equipped with modules that allow, for example, to deploy acoustic buoys or ESM (electronic support measures) modules. The marine drone in the USV version contains a mission planning module, its ground or airborne control center provides mission monitoring for its user. The design of the drone has been optimized by Chantier Naval Couach's research and development department to maximize its practicality for the user. The Magellan Marine Drone is designed to be easily transported in a standard 20-foot container and retrieved without assistance thanks to its retractable mast and lifting hook without the use of a recovery system. Couach Shipyard, already recognized for its expertise in the construction of composite ships, applied its expertise to the field of drones for the first time with the Magellan. This development is the result of a high-tech turnaround by Couach following the establishment of a research and development department at the shipyard, which has already led to a significant increase in system integration skills on ships.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/25/nadvodnyj-radioelektronnyj-borecz-franczuzki-rozrobnyky-proponuyut-vijskovym-moryakam-dron-magellan/	2024-09-24T20:44:24-07:00
Defense of Zmiyny, capture and reward for battles in Kurshchyna: the story of Major Kryklyvy	One of the names on the list of awardees is Major Yaroslav Kryklyvy. The officer was awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, II degree. He is currently the commanding officer of the 501st Marine Corps Separate Battalion. ArmyInform tells more about the serviceman. In 2020, Yaroslav Kryklyvy had the rank of lieutenant. During one of the exercises in the Black Sea, the officer was the commander of a marine infantry platoon in the ranks of the 88th separate MP battalion. In 2021, the officer already headed the company and, together with the unit, participated in the international Agile Spirit training. 2022. A full scale invasion. Yaroslav Kryklyvy performed tasks on Zmiiny Island. The battalion was on the island in rotation: a month there, a month at home for retraining. With irony, he says that he met a great war -on a tropical island.- The combatant recalls that on the morning of February 24, 2022, a military observation post reported a warship on the horizon. It was the Moscow missile cruiser. Several more enemy ships followed him. At first, Zmiiny fired at the cruiser -Moscow-, after that the enemy used other ships and aircraft. Yaroslav Kryklyvy became one of those captured by the Russian military at Zmiyny. First, they were taken to the temporarily occupied Crimea, then they promised to take them to mainland Ukraine, but they brought them to the territory where there was frost and a lot of snow. Yaroslav does not know the exact location, he only remembers that it took about 12 hours to fly from Sevastopol. The prisoners were kept in the camp, they were constantly interrogated by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, the attitude of the guards was inhumane, recalls the battalion commander: - The guards allowed themselves to do just what they wanted. There was a rat race. If you want to go, roughly speaking, for a cigarette, you will be released from the cell. They give you time, you start to run away, then they release the dog. Didn't have time - -he will bite you, no problem,- recalls In 2023, Officer Screaming commanded the 501st Marine Separate Battalion. In particular, the military is involved in the operation of the Defense Forces of Ukraine on the territory of the Kursk region. They work effectively. Yes, on September 23, the Navy Command shared video , how servicemen of the 501st battalion capture the enemy in Kurshchyna. Marines of the 501st Separate Marine Corps Battalion continue to help the young Kursk Republic rid itself of Putin's regime and replenish the exchange fund.

Why is the enemy lying about the F-16	Fake information is spreading on the Internet that the Pentagon allegedly believes that Ukrainian pilots are -unfit to perform complex tasks on F-16 fighter jets.- It is because of this that Ukraine has allegedly already lost one plane and does not cross the front line with fighter jets. The authors of the -dump- refer to interview of the commander of the US Air Force in Europe and Africa, General James Hecker, to the Air &amp; Space Forces Magazine. In fact, American General James Hacker did not make such categorical statements. Propagandists deliberately distorted the content of the general's interview in order to once again -cast a shadow- on the Ukrainian military and to quarrel Ukraine with its allies. James Hecker did not say anything about the -unsuitability- of Ukrainian pilots. On the contrary, the publication emphasizes that F-16s are successfully used to destroy Russian cruise missiles and drones. Moreover, according to the commander, Ukrainian F-16 maintenance specialists demonstrate high results. Of course, there is no statement in the original publication that Ukrainian pilots do not fly into the temporarily occupied territories or Russian airspace because of their -unqualification-. The content of the alleged Russian quotes from this interview is a complete lie. Fakers hoped that Ukrainian journalists would pick up this -deza- without checking the original text. But this time it was possible to expose the forgery. However, it often happens that our journalists, in pursuit of sensationalism, rebroadcast enemy propaganda narratives and spread fabrications ordered by the Kremlin. That is why, if the information causes even a little doubt, its sources should be carefully checked.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/25/navishho-vorog-breshe-pro-f-16/	2024-09-24T20:30:51-07:00
-The best we have-. The crew talks about the unique mortar -Rak- based on the APC -Rosomak-	This is the newest technique that has proven itself very well on the battlefield. And yes, in terms of accuracy and maneuverability, there is no time to look for something similar among mortars. The commanders of the crews of these mortars told the correspondent of Armiya TV about the advantages and technical characteristics, as well as combat missions and tasks of -Rak-. We meet with the guys in camouflaged positions during combat duty. Mortars are driven into caponiers, covered with a net and blend into the thick of the forest, but are ready to go out on a combat mission at any moment. -Rak- works on the basis of the -Rosomak- armored personnel carrier and is able to cover with accurate fire the concentration of enemy infantry. Usually our guys work on it at a distance of 5-6 km from -zero-. After receiving a combat mission, they go to the specified position, deploy in a matter of seconds and, after working, return to a relatively safe place of deployment. . Or the way the guys work now: get the target early, get closer, practice and hide back. If you stand on the defensive, close to the skirmish line, without moving, then there is a threat of detection. Therefore, the machines are deployed a little further away, taking turns to perform tasks. -Rosomak- allows you to move quickly, and -Rak- itself does not need special deployment. The guys say that the most time is spent on pointing &#8211; the machine needs some time to -find- itself in space. It happened that the system itself took longer to prepare than the combat work lasted. -In general, I like everything, cool equipment. The main thing &#8211; mobile To be honest, I thought it would last less. But he spends so much time fighting,- &#8211; Mitya admits. The Russians have a special interest in this technique, as in all foreign ones, they hunt for it. The crew commander explains that it is not a static mortar that stands in a specific place: it is not set at zero, and in general it is used very competently. -This is a fat target, the car is so double-decker,- &#8211; says Mitya, casting a proud glance at Rosomak, hidden next to us in the hood. All the fighters of the crew, and there are four of them working on the -Rak-, constantly emphasize that mortars are very important in the current combat realities. -In order to leave, he did the work and hid. So that foreign copters could not burn our positions. When it is stationary, the threat of detection is much higher. And just like here, he came, worked and returned,- &#8211; says fighter Oleg, who in the crew is responsible for supplying mines. In general, the execution of a standard combat task can take 5-10 minutes. Most of the time is spent on the machine -finding- itself on the battlefield before working on an enemy target. -Rak- &#8211; this is a 120 mm mortar that began to be developed by Poland in the mid-zeros. More than ten years passed until this weapon, based on the -Rosomak- armored personnel carrier, entered service with the Polish Army. This is its uniqueness &#8211; the Polish defense company actually developed from scratch and launched practical and modern weapons that are competitive on the world market. It became known in the spring of 2023 that Warsaw would transfer these mortars to Kyiv. The crew commander with the call sign -Bob- recalls: we trained on simple mortars in Poland, and then just during the training it became known that they were giving us -Rak-, so we immediately and switched to them. If we talk about the maintenance of this equipment, our soldiers say, there are no particular issues here either. After the fire, with the help of a compressor, powder gases are immediately blown out and liquid is supplied, which cools the barrel. The guys work on average 5 km from the front line. At such a distance, -Rak- hits very accurately. The TTX indicates that its maximum range is 12 km. But -Bob- says that during the exercises, when it came to such long-range projectiles, even the Poles themselves had not seen them. In general, adds - Mityai-, he can aim -in an apple- at 6500 m. -At this distance hits perfectly. And he can go on and on, pouring and pouring. Maybe the copters will help to hover there a little left and right. And you can take it apart,- &#8211; he explains. If we talk about weather conditions, the car performs well in various situations. Doesn't he really like the swamp? The commander adds that the car is heavy, 24 tons, and can get stuck in a rut in the field in the rain and not get out. Worked fine in the winter. -But on a flat road it goes 100 km/h, we drove like that in the field. It can drive 110 km/h on asphalt,- &#8211; - Mityai- tells not without delight. One of these trips is immediately remembered by -Bob-, the commander of the same -Rak-: we were told that they were already flying after us - Lancet- and -Supercam- had to return urgently. -He gave (gas, &#8211 ; ed.), I was already afraid of the -Supercam-, but the speed at which we were driving. But he is handsome. Inside there, you had to hold on with all your might,- &#8211; says the fighter. Now the guys are working in manual mine feeding mode, although basically in -Rak- it happens automatically. It does not affect the working time, so it is even faster to work out, say the fighters and laugh: maybe the charger sweats more, there is not much space, so it is quite uncomfortable for him. The undoubted technological advantage of the mortar is the -Topaz- digital fire control system. -The machine itself knows where it is. I can move 500 meters to the side, it will adjust the data and continue to work,- &#8211; details -Mitaya-. At the same time, the crew commander points out that it is not worth putting her stationary so that she guards -zero-, because in the era of drones, she will probably be found quickly. Our -Rak- can carry 20 mines in a cassette and another 26 on board. The fighters explain how they work: one machine is loaded while the other works at the position. When the ammunition ran out, it was immediately replaced by the next one, and so on in a circle. The car is good, it cannot be compared with Soviet equipment, the crew members sincerely say: -It has cruise control here , music can be heard in the cabin, even inside the tower. When we've worked it out, and we go back, we drive under a hundred, we turn it on via AUX for ourselves.- When asked if the Russians are afraid of such weapons, the crew says: previously, during combat work, the occupiers simply did not understand what was the matter &#8211; when a couple of mines landed very precisely in each landing. They heard their negotiations, they simply did not understand that this is how mines fall one after another. Mainly, says the commander, they work on foot: - they, the Russians, are constantly trying to advance, then ours detect accumulations of manpower, warehouses in landings, where they are entrenched- . TheRak is a very accurate weapon, both crew commanders agree, and compared to other mortars, it is the best the Defense Force has. -He can attack well, also has a flurry mode &#8211; when three mines in a row are released under different trajectories. We also shot like that, only two, because for the third we need a clear horizon &#8211; it should take off at such an angle that it is too close to the collision line,- &#8211; says -Mitya-. -Bob- says that once a day six left in three crews. Then the Russians wanted to develop active offensive actions, so the mortars had to work on the accumulation of manpower in the landings. About a hundred mines were released in a day. The guys appreciate the training in Poland with gratitude, but they don't use much of what they learned in real combat. They admit that they have to gain experience on the go. They were taught well in Poland, there are no complaints about that, but they don't see the war that way, explains -Bob- and clarifies: they think they can come, deploy, as the book says . For example, during the exercises, the instructors there said that wait for the target until you get the coordinates for the car. But now in our war we don't have time to stand in the middle of the field like that wait, it's unrealistic, adds the commander. In general, -Mitjai- admits, he can now go to Poland himself and tell a couple of secrets about -Rak- . The boys are grateful to the Poles and French, who -put their soul- into the training of our soldiers: -When they saw us off, they cried.- During the conversation, the language I also talked about the fact that some people are afraid to join the Defense Forces, justifying it for various reasons. -Mityai- understands this attitude in some way, and states: yes, there are problems, but this does not mean that one should sit back. -Yes, there is a question. But what to do? Maybe you are right, somewhere there is a lack of a smart commander or something else. But what to do? Well, come, be smart, do something, help. I always question such people, ok, you are right, but what next, what are your actions? Just sit and wait? There is no answer,- &#8211; he explains. The crew commander, a large man with a strong physique, admits that he himself did not plan to be in this place &#8211; I always didn't like -boxes-, although I served since the time of the ATO. -I tell them, I don't want to wear armor. Let's study with a mortar. So he got into the mortar box. But I don't regret being here at all,- &#8211; he recalls his transfer. A mechanic-driver -Rak- with the call sign -Forest- adds that, in his opinion, in the army any experience will be useful: from an IT specialist to a cook, to a technician and a tractor driver. -In short, I don't know except what a janitor in the army can do... Ah, sweep tracks!-, &#8211; he jokes. Our conversation is interrupted by three distinct explosions nearby. The guys say that a few kilometers away, the Russians are -unwinding- the settlement with KABs. According to them, the occupier's usual tactics in this area &#8211; simply erase villages and cities. -Oh, they finish with cassettes. Probably -Hurricane--, &#8211; says one of the fighters. While the occupiers are burning our land with -squares-, the crews of -Rak- self-propelled mortars are returning to combat duty. After all, at any moment they can be called to a task: leave, destroy the enemy with accurate fire, and hide in their capon again. More about the self-propelled mortar -Rak- based on the -Rosomak- armored personnel carrier, watch soon on the Army TV channel, subscribe here so you don't miss it.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/25/najkrashhe-shho-u-nas-ye-ekipazh-rozpovidaye-pro-unikalnyj-minomet-rak-na-bazi-btr-rosomak/	2024-09-24T20:00:54-07:00

A delegation of the Armed Forces of Lithuania visited Ukraine	The Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported this on September 24. The delegation led by the commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Lithuania, Brigadier General Arturas Radvilas, visited higher military educational institutions and training centers, met with the commander of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Oleksandr Pavliuk. The representatives of the Ukrainian side talked about the training of personnel, demonstrated the material and technical base, and shared the experience of conducting combat operations in modern conditions. The delegation of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Lithuania highly appreciated the Ukrainian experience in the use of electronic warfare (EW) and unmanned aerial systems (UAVs), which are an important part of the Armed Forces. In particular, each brigade of the Ground Forces has its own separate units that perform such functions. The guests noted the high level of quality of the training programs that were developed and used in Ukraine for the training of cadets of educational institutions and servicemen of the Armed Forces units. The commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Oleksandr Pavlyuk, noted the readiness to share with international partners the experience of using electronic warfare and air defense systems, acquired during the conduct of hostilities against the Russian aggressor. In particular, the Department of Accumulation and Generalization of Experience has been created within the Ground Forces Command, the activities of which will soon be presented to the military attachés of the embassies of partner countries. The Lithuanian guests also saw the passing of a psychological obstacle course by military personnel undergoing basic military training. This test is important and one of the most difficult stages of every fighter's training. In conditions as close as possible to combat, Ukrainian servicemen, accompanied by experienced instructors, demonstrate tactical training skills, physical endurance and psychological stability. At the end of the visit, Brigadier General Arturas Radvilas visited the Chernobyl zone. It was here in 2022 that one of the routes to the occupation of part of the Kyiv region by the Russian army lay. The consequences of those events were the terrible crimes of the Russians, in particular, the mass murders of the civilian population in the communities of the Kyiv region, which were condemned by the civilized world. Cooperation with Lithuanian partners allows the Ground Forces to become stronger. In turn, NATO member states gain a better understanding of the threat of neighboring an aggressor state and the importance of Ukrainian experience in effectively countering such risks. As reported by ArmyInform, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania visited the fortifications in Chernihiv region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/24/ukrayinu-vidvidala-delegacziya-zbrojnyh-syl-lytvy/	2024-09-24T11:57:25-07:00

He simply could not stay away from that trouble - the TCC officer told about his motivation	combat path of the officer was told by operational command -North-. Yuriy is a teacher by education. He worked by profession, then in local self-government bodies. He was the deputy and then the chairman of the district council. On February 24, 2022, he volunteered for the TCC and SP in Kozel region. At that time, his military experience consisted only of short-term service in the late 1980s. In the early 2000s, he completed training and obtained the rank of lieutenant, military specialty — an officer from the Military Academy. -Like most volunteers, I was motivated by the realization that I had to go to defend my Motherland, my own family. I simply could not stay away from the disaster that fell on our land,- Yuriy Marchenko said. He was immediately mobilized to the security company of the TCC and SP in Kozel region. He was the deputy commander for moral and psychological support. But a year later, on February 24, 2023, he voluntarily enrolled in the ranks of the 407th separate rifle battalion, which was just being formed at that time. Appointed to the position of commander of a rifle company, and a few months later transferred to the position of head of the intelligence group of the headquarters. After three months of training and coordination, in May 2023, the unit went to the place of execution of tasks. Kharkiv Oblast, then Kherson Oblast, Kyiv Oblast. Performed the task of protecting objects on 2-3 lines of defense. In the fall, they received a new task: to advance into Donetsk region in the Avdiyiv direction. -At the end of October, they got to the Avdiiv coke plant. I was the chief of military intelligence, we were engaged in planning. The main thing was establishing cooperation with other units, planning reconnaissance and surveillance of the enemy, and providing information to the command,- Yuriy Marchenko recalled. The enemy constantly attacked the positions of the rifle battalion with various types of weapons - mortars, artillery, tanks, regularly dropped from the planes of the KaBa. Heavy fighting took place when the enemy entered the rear of the Ukrainian units through the extensive system of underground communications in the -Tsarska Okhota- area at the end of January. Then the attack was repulsed, all communications on the territory of the plant were worked out in order to prevent the enemy from entering the territory of the Koksokhim plant this way, the officer says. The main personnel of a separate rifle battalion were withdrawn from the territory of the plant on February 12-13, 2024. -It was planned to move the battalion to another part. Our command post remained in place there. But the situation turned out to be such that we received a command to leave. On the 15th, we left in small groups of five - there were 24 of us. Then we were picked up by cars and taken to Myrnograd,- said the soldier. According to him, at that time they went out on foot in an unknown area, under constant fire and between mines. Then, in two days, he counted almost 250 KABs on the territory of the plant - enemy planes were in the air almost constantly. Captain Marchenko managed to get out without injuries. However, he admits, there were many concussions - no one counted them in those conditions. Although it was difficult, says the soldier, he held on to the belief that everything would be fine. He kept in touch with relatives thanks to the Internet. They also encouraged each other with their brothers who were nearby. From Myrnograd, the unit was taken to Cherkasy region for recovery. Yuriy was treated after the concussions he received and later underwent a medical examination and, according to its findings, was deemed unfit for service in combat units. He took up the relationship and already in April returned to his native Fourth Department of the Kremenchug TCC and SP in the Kozel region. Headed the documentation support group. Works with documents, deals with personnel issues and material support. Emphasizes that in order to win against a strong enemy, the Armed Forces of Ukraine need a motivated replenishment. -If not for us, men, to protect our Motherland, then who? Otherwise, the enemy will come here very quickly - to Poltava region. We have already seen how quickly he can advance when unopposed. I understand how important the work of territorial recruitment centers is in matters of replenishment of the Defense Forces. However, I also see the information press that today goes against the TCC. Because the task of the enemy is to disrupt the mobilization to the ranks of the Armed Forces by all means. And these IPSOs not only scare civilian men, who as a result try to avoid mobilization in every possible way. This also demotivates the soldiers who fight for Ukraine - some of them for three or four years. Military personnel also need time to rest. But who will replace them? The only way out is to postpone all refusals and stand up for Ukraine to everyone,- noted Yuriy Marchenko. As reported by ArmyInform, about such as Serhiy, a fighter of the 81st Slobozhan Brigade, called -Phantom-, it is said that they were born in a shirt. All because the soldier survived after the rupture of an 82-mm mine a few steps away from him.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/24/prosto-ne-mig-zalyshytysya-ostoron-tiyeyi-bidy-oficzer-tczk-rozpoviv-pro-svoyu-motyvacziyu/	2024-09-24T11:36:58-07:00

Are there alternatives to Telegram, the Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Securit...	It should be emphasized that it applies exclusively to military personnel, employees of state authorities and critical infrastructure enterprises, as well as employees of the security and defense sector. Is there a replacement for this popular messenger, do public authorities plan to switch to other popular platforms to disseminate information, and what safety rules should be followed when using messengers on the air of the national telethon Single News told Andriy Kovalenko, head of the Center for Combating Disinformation under the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine. He said that the Anti-Disinformation Center has a Viber channel with almost half a million subscribers. There is also an option to create a channel in the WhatsApp messenger. However, the problem is that a significant number of people are used only to the Telegram messenger, with the help of which it is convenient for them to receive information, so it is uncomfortable for them to switch to some new platforms. — This recommendation is not directly related to banning Telegram itself. Other solutions are needed if we are going to talk about any restrictions on Telegram as a means of receiving news in the future, Andriy Kovalenko emphasized. According to him, at the moment there is no question of the refusal of state authorities to run their own channels in Telegram. Also, those persons whose positions involve the need to do so will be able to use Telegram from work devices. Instead, consider using other messengers like Signal, WhatsApp, Threema, etc. for personal communication. At the same time, it is necessary to take care of personal safety and, if possible, completely refuse to send personal data, documents, photos through any messengers. It is also necessary to have strong passwords for all accounts in social networks. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that servicemen were banned from using Telegram on official duty. devices and explained why the military was banned from using the messenger. ArmyInform also wrote, that not so with Telegram and why information from Telegram - garbage poisons consciousness, and also informed, how the actions of French law enforcement officers against the founder of the popular messenger will help counter Russian aggression.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/24/chy-ye-alternatyvy-telegram-rozpovily-v-czentri-protydiyi-dezinformacziyi-pry-rnbo/	2024-09-24T11:12:34-07:00

They are slowly besieging the city, entering the flanks, and are beginning to mine the roads to Vugledar with drones,- he said. Mykola Voroshnov added that the Russians are conducting offensive actions simultaneously from all directions. -For example, they have a signal at 12:00 and they pushed for Pavlivky, Prychystivky, Vodiany. And it comes to the point that our drones don't just overheat the rotors or batteries, it overheats by itself and I don't want to take off anymore,- he said. However, units of the 72nd OMBr inflict maximum damage on the enemy, the enemy suffered huge losses. -But he steps over the heads of his own scum and continues to try to surround Ugledar with renewed strength.

Telegram can track movement even when geolocation is turned off - NSDO	The head of the Center for countering disinformation under the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyni news- href=-https://youtu.be/j5TqaWCCdUg-> Andriy Kovalenko. -Few people know, for example, that Telegram can track movement even when geolocation is turned off,- he said. The head of the CSDP of the NSDC explained that such a function theoretically allows whoever controls the messenger to track the movements and whereabouts of any person who may be of potential interest. There is no zero chance that Telegram is controlled or accessed by Russian intelligence or other secret services of the occupiers. — We do not know 100% whether Russian intelligence has access and whether Durov is an agent or not an agent of Russian intelligence or whether he will cooperate. No one will give a guarantee, but the risk that your route will be with the enemy is quite high, explained Andriy Kovalenko. He noted that the risks of the Telegram messenger are not sufficiently known to users and poorly communicated in society, which massively uses this platform for news and personal communication. — The head of the State Security Agency, Kyrylo Budanov, constantly clearly says that Telegram poses a threat to national security. Because when the enemy can track your movement very simply using his actual messenger, which can be a tool for his intelligence, this is a threat. Therefore, such dangers must be voiced, the head of the Center for Combating Disinformation emphasized. Andriy Kovalenko also explained the reason why the ban on the use of Telegram on official devices and for sending official information to servicemen and employees of the security and defense sector, employees of state authorities and critical infrastructure enterprises caused a sharp reaction from society. — In my opinion, all because of the fact that now more than 70% of people consume news from Telegram channels. Accordingly, a large enough population is there, he said. In view of this, it is necessary to communicate more actively and explain the risks, threats and consequences that may arise from using the Telegram messenger. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that servicemen were banned from using Telegram on official duty. devices and explained why the military was banned from using the messenger. ArmyInform also wrote, that not so with Telegram and why information from Telegram - garbage poisons consciousness, and also informed, how the actions of French law enforcement officers against the founder of the popular messenger will help counter Russian aggression.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/24/telegram-mozhe-vidstezhuvaty-peremishhennya-navit-pry-vyklyuchenij-geolokacziyi-rnbo/	2024-09-24T10:32:04-07:00

Our contributions are important both for Ukraine's struggle for self-defense and for the everyday life of Ukrainians. Our support for Ukraine is a long-term commitment that is unanimously supported by the Storting. Russia's war against Ukraine is the greatest challenge to security policy of our time. The Ukrainian people are fighting for their survival and freedom. Their struggle for self-defense is also our struggle - for democratic values ​​and European security. That is why Norway will continue to support Ukraine,- said Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Haar Støre.

The Armed Forces stopped 125 assaults: the situation remains tense in two directions	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The enemy is actively attacking, trying to improve the tactical position, our defenders are inflicting significant losses on the enemy in manpower and equipment. On the territory of Ukraine, the terrorist state carried out four missile strikes using four missiles, 55 air strikes, dropping 76 anti-aircraft missiles. In addition, the invaders used 662 kamikaze drones for strikes and carried out more than 3,800 attacks on the positions of our troops and populated areas using various types of weapons. On the Kharkiv direction Russian troops are trying to push our units in the Lyptsi and Tikhoi districts, near the latter a battle is ongoing. Seven times the enemy attacked our positions on the Kupyan direction. In the vicinity of the settlements of Glushkivka, Kucherivka, Kolisnikivka and Stelmakhivka, units of the Defense Forces repulsed seven offensive actions of the enemy. In the Lyman direction, during the day, Russian troops attacked Ukrainian defenders 19 times in the districts of Cherneshchyna, Druzhelyubivka, Nevsky, Makiivka, Dibrova, Torsky, and Dronivka. Battles continue in two locations. The enemy once tried to dislodge our defenders from their positions in the Fedorivka districts on the Seversky direction with assault actions. The attack was repulsed, the enemy did not succeed. In the Kramatorsk direction Ukrainian soldiers repelled four attempts by the invaders to advance near Kalynyivka, Klishchiivka, Bila Hora and Predtechyny. The situation is under control. In the Toretsk direction, where the occupiers attacked our positions near Dachny, Toretsk and Nelipivka 15 times with the support of aviation, nine clashes have already been completed. Fighting continues near Toretsk. The main efforts of the enemy are directed in the direction of Pokrovsk. The aggressor attacked 30 times in the districts of Vozdvizhenka, Marynivka, Myrolyubivka, Novotoretskyi, Mykolaivka, Novogrodivka, Zhuravka, Krasnoy Yar and Zeleny Pol. On the Kurakhiv direction our defenders repelled 21 enemy attempts to attack our positions. The invaders tried to advance near Tsukuryny, Georgiivka, Kostyantynivka, Katerynivka, and Ukrainsk. The fighting is not abating, three combat clashes are currently underway. In the Vremivsk direction the aggressor tried eight times to storm the front edge of the defense in the direction of Pavlivka and Vugledar. Ukrainian soldiers stopped five enemy attacks, three more attacks are ongoing. In the Orikhov direction, one unsuccessful combat encounter for the enemy took place near Novoandriivka. In the Dnieper direction the enemy conducted two unsuccessful assaults and was repulsed. Defense forces of Ukraine continue the operation in the Kursk region. During the day, the enemy carried out 10 airstrikes on Kurshchyna using 14 guided bombs, in addition, it launched six attacks from rocket salvo systems. Soldiers of the 15th operational brigade of NSU -Kara-Dag-, the 414th separate regiment of attack unmanned aviation systems and the 68th separate hunting brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush were awarded for effective combat work in the department. As reported by ArmyInform, the army command of the Russian Federation cares more about equipment than personnel. The soldier is often used as a decoy to identify the positions and means of fire damage of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, which leads to sky-high levels of enemy casualties.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/24/zsu-zupynyly-125-shturmiv-na-dvoh-napryamkah-sytuacziya-zalyshayetsya-napruzhenoyu/	2024-09-23T21:11:28-07:00

Corvettes of the ADA type - what should the enemy be afraid of: about the powerful air defense syste...	Stepan Yakymyak notes that these ships are the latest models of multi-purpose ships of the near sea zone, capable of successfully fighting air, surface and underwater enemies. Corvettes are designed with low-visibility technologies in mind, which can reduce the range of their detection by the enemy. Also, these corvettes have the necessary means of radio-electronic, anti-aircraft, anti-ship and anti-submarine defense. In addition, the ships are equipped with aviation systems that significantly increase the radius of combat influence, and a modern strike missile system for destroying surface targets. These are very successful decisions that significantly expand the strike capabilities of the ship and its contribution to the support of joint forces on land. An analysis of the tactical and technical characteristics of ADA-type corvettes, their main armament and tactical properties demonstrates the significant potential capabilities of these ships. The military expert focuses on the armament of the air defense systems of these corvettes. For example, the joint use of an anti-aircraft missile complex (with a firing range of up to 20 km), a 35-mm anti-aircraft artillery installation (with a firing range of up to 4 km) and two 12.7-mm machine guns should ensure sufficiently dense anti-aircraft defense of the ship. This will make it possible to effectively counter a group of air targets that the enemy is able to form from supersonic land-based, sea-based and air-based anti-ship missiles and attack UAVs. It is expected that the anti-aircraft missiles of the ship complex should destroy the supersonic anti-ship missiles of the Russian Federation. We are talking, in particular, about Onyx-type missiles, which are in the arsenal of Bastion-type coastal missile systems of the Russian Federation. We will remind, several times these missiles were unsuccessfully used by the enemy to hit coastal targets on the Odesa coast. Stepan Yakymyak explains that the presence of modern anti-submarine weapons on corvettes creates significant capabilities in the fight against Russian submarines. - It is assumed that the latest samples of anti-submarine weapons (hydroacoustic complex and torpedo weapons. - Ed.) will ensure the early detection and destruction of modern submarines. Even such as project 636.3, which are in the arsenal of the Russian Federation. Let me remind you that these boats, equipped with cruise missiles of the Kalibr complex, launch systematic missile attacks on objects on the territory of Ukraine. Our corvettes will be equipped with shock missile weapons. If the missile complex will have a range of 150-300 or more kilometers, it will enable our ships to destroy (hit) enemy surface targets at the same distance. This is very important today, because the Russians have a significant number of combat surface ships of the main classes. — Let's simulate the situation. The use of only one ammunition in the amount of 8 missiles under different conditions will allow hitting an average of two to four surface targets. That is, it will be possible to disable 1-2 tactical groups of enemy ships. A military expert says ADA-type corvettes have modern means of communication and a combat information and control system: - This can provide an advantage over the enemy not only in the promptness of decision-making and actions, but also in the so-called intellectual advantage. What tasks will the -Ivan Mazepa- and -Ivan Vyhovskyi- corvettes be able to perform in specific conditions, for example, in the Black and Mediterranean seas or other specified areas? First of all, Stepan Yakymyak recalled the views on the creation and tasks of corvettes for the national navy that existed until now. — As is known, the leadership and specialists of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine throughout the entire recent history of the state provided relevant justifications and strove to have similar ships in the fleet. After all, in 2010, the national corvette of project 58250 was laid down in Mykolaiv. According to the Strategy of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine 2035 (announced in 2018. — Ed.), it was planned to adopt a series of such corvettes during the second stage of fleet development, 2025-2030 . We will remind you that the Strategy was developed together with experts from NATO member countries, including the United States. Actually, corvettes can rely on two blocks of tasks: — If we analyze the hypothetical situation regarding the involvement of corvettes in actions in the conditions of the long war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, then it should be taken into account that the newly built ships are in the Sea of ​​Marmara. They cannot be included during the war in the Ukrainian group of forces operating in the Black Sea. Because according to the Montreux Convention, the Bosphorus Strait is closed to the passage of warships. It should not be forgotten, says a military expert, that Russian forces still have significant capabilities in the fight against surface ships. The enemy has enough power to strike surface targets. the rascals still have air superiority for now. The ratio in anti-ship weapons, i.e. symmetrical means of confrontation at sea and naval combat, is still not in favor of Ukraine. It is because of this that the Ukrainian Navy chose and implemented the concept of asymmetric actions in the war at sea: — Therefore, it would be logical to state that in the current conditions, the hypothetical use of new corvettes in the Black Sea against the enemy is not a rational option. Many domestic and foreign experts claim that in modern conditions, ADA-type corvettes can perform so-called coalition tasks. It is about involvement in joint tasks (exercises) with NATO forces outside the Black Sea: — We will not only demonstrate loyalty to common values, but also really strengthen the Alliance's groupings at sea. And this is in the conditions when significant resources of our partners are spent to ensure combat operations and the success of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the protracted war with the enemy. Stepan Yakymyak emphasizes that the best option for using the newly built corvettes and minesweepers, which are currently based in Great Britain, is to practice joint tasks and exercises with NATO partners outside the Black Sea. — Of course, it should be taken into account that in the event of the deployment of corvettes in the Mediterranean Sea and other water areas, one can expect provocations and, perhaps, even sabotage actions on the part of the Russian Federation. At the same time, if corvettes perform joint tasks as part of NATO forces, the risk of such actions by the enemy will be much lower. The military expert emphasizes: in the future, all possible tasks of corvettes will necessarily take into account probable scenarios of actions and task performance with various units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine and will depend on the enemy's capabilities at sea. It is extremely important to emphasize that the corvettes must learn to act together in the general system of combat use of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. — In particular, with units equipped with coastal missile systems, fighter-bomber aircraft, primarily F-16, naval unmanned and unmanned aircraft systems, reconnaissance assets, in particular, NATO forces in the Black Sea. Therefore, in the opinion of Stepan Yakymyak, the likely prospective tasks of ADA-type corvettes are: If we talk about the Black Sea, then in the future, in the event of a crisis situation and a military conflict, corvettes can be effectively involved in the following tasks: — I emphasize, the effectiveness of actions corvettes in the Black Sea will largely depend on solving the problems of ensuring the stealth and combat stability of these ships. This is the key point. This is necessary, first of all, during the process of deploying corvettes to combat areas and during active hostilities. Further, of course, in the case of returning to the base points and the presence of ships there for recovery and replenishment of supplies.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/24/korvety-typu-ada-chogo-varto-boyatys-vorogu-pro-potuzhnu-systemu-ppo-strategiyu-vms-zsu-ta-spilni-navchannya-z-nato/	2024-09-23T20:52:55-07:00
Under Stepov, he held his position for 5 hours by himself: the story of junior sergeant Volodymyr	What's it like to hold a position all by yourself? And how do their commanders drive the Russians to attack? Junior sergeant Volodymyr told the ArmyInform correspondent about this. — In March of this year, we advanced to Pervomaiske, in the Donetsk region. We were in a Hummer. As soon as we entered the settlement, the enemy began to -cover- us. So the race was very difficult. We were driven to the evacuation point, and from there we had to walk about 200 meters to reach the school where our position was. These 200 meters became -the road of life- for us... They worked on us with both mines and dumps while we approached the school. And we already had one wounded person. We had to replace guys from the 59th brigade at the position. When we entered the school premises, our wounded man was stabilized. Of course, constant shelling of us began. And later, the enemy began to storm. And these assaults were constant, almost non-stop. In the end, the enemy did enter the school premises. The second and third floors of the building were almost empty at that time. Well, we started knocking out the enemy... That day we killed four in the school, another one on the way out. The sixth, most likely, was injured, but managed to escape. Although later we heard from intercepts that he was no longer communicating... We took four walkie-talkies from them. And, of course, they heard what they were transmitting. From the interceptions, it was understood when they would go on assaults. By the way, the enemy is being forced to advance, because none of them wants to go forward. And when they tried to enter the school again, they did not know that we had already put theirs in front of it. And they ask something on the radio, think that they are communicating with their own. We say -Zachody!- in Russian. Well, they also filled up those at the entrance. They all hit me with some kind of cologne... It was there in Pervomaiskyi, by the way, that I was wounded... We had to be changed, and there was a flight next to me. Everything flew out of my hands, I thought that the khan was already mine, but no - I survived. ...I still had a business trip to one of the mechanized brigades. In December 2023. Then we went into position near Stepovoy. This is also the Donetsk region. There were only five of us. They stormed us very hard. At that time, a boy was killed in a night battle. Later, after mortar shelling, one more of our soldiers died. And there were three of us left. Then two of them left under certain circumstances, and I was left to hold the position away by myself. It lasted for five hours. I was told that my sector was for 12 hours, that I was being covered from left to right, I had to hold the landing... Later, the command gave two people to help. They stayed until dusk, and then a group was sent to support me. Until morning we held our position under these enemy assaults, and then we were already replaced. Then I even lost count of how many enemy infantry we destroyed...	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/24/pid-stepovym-5-godyn-trymav-pozycziyu-sam-istoriya-molodshogo-serzhanta-volodymyra/	2024-09-23T20:41:21-07:00
Language inspectors in Frankivsk: propaganda twisted the words of the mayor and caused a scandal	After checking the information at the Main Directorate of the National Police in the Ivano-Frankivsk Region, the Countering Disinformation Center notified, that not a single language-related crime has been committed in the city recently. Similar fakes are actively spread by Russian propaganda in order to create the illusion of a split in Ukrainian society around the language issue. It should be noted that the enemy managed to play the -language card- only in 2014. At that time, it was the disinformation campaign surrounding the status of the Russian language in Ukraine that helped the occupiers seize Crimea and certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. On September 9, Ivano-Frankivsk Mayor Ruslan Martsinkiv discussed the public initiative -Language Inspectors-, which was immediately used by propaganda. The enemy spread a fake that communicating in Russian in Ukrainian cities would be severely punished. After that, the author of the initiative had to go into the public space and justify himself: not language inspectors, but public activists; they will not punish, but will promote the state one. Even Taras Kremin, the authorized person for the protection of the state language, had to intervene in the situation. -I want to warn against one big danger - there have never been and never will be any language inspectors in Ukraine. This is a pure invention of Russian propaganda, which since 2019, when the language law came into force, began to actively use the so-called semantic slurs, which they used to call our institution, calling me -Sprechen-Führer-, and representatives of the commissioner - language inspectors, punishers. This is one of the components of the information field from the point of view of Russian propaganda,- said Taras Kremin.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/24/movni-inspektory-u-frankivsku-rospropaganda-perekrutyla-slova-mera-i-sprychynyla-skandal/	2024-09-23T20:35:38-07:00
Immersion in archeology: about an unusual way of military rehabilitation	In the 12th century, monks started the first hospital center for soldiers here, which later turned into a separate monastery. And today, the -Spiritual restoration through culture- program is being implemented in the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra National Reserve, the purpose of which is to provide moral and spiritual support to the defenders of Ukraine after the most difficult trials of the war through immersion in the cultural and historical space of the Lavra. We are talking about the program with the general director of the National Reserve -Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra- Maksym Ostapenko. — Maksym Anatoliyovych, for the military, especially after the injuries, it is very it is probably useful to immerse yourself in the cultural and historical space of the national shrine through communication, excursions, as well as prayer... — This program of spiritual restoration began its work in 2023. From the feedback we get from the military, — she really works. She has a very positive effect on the military because, actually, a person who is currently in the army, he should receive both psychological and moral support to a large extent. A military man must understand that he is not only saving his own family, his own house, fighting for his immediate environment, but also defending the independence of this state. When he gets to the Lavra, he understands that in this way he helps to protect Ukrainian shrines, which are no less important for the state than everything else that we have. After all, national shrines — are those things that cement any nation. And, unfortunately, Russia tried to take these shrines away from us during centuries For centuries, she tried to influence Ukrainians, our nation, our people through shrines. And now, the military, who participate in studying and diving into these shrines, also feel like defenders of the national heritage. And this is very important, because in this way we combine here the cultural component, the spiritual component and at the same time the psychological rehabilitation of those soldiers who come here. In addition, Lavra herself — span> it is a place of prayer, a place of deep identity and culture that definitely inspires people. Many of those who attend this program are coming to the Lavra, or not for the first time. Few people even know how powerful and outstanding this place is, which has shaped our identity for a thousand years. And when people join these sanctuaries, this incredible territory, they feel a very serious moral upliftment. provision (complex of measures that are carried out with the aim of forming, maintaining and restoring the moral and psychological state of the personnel of the troops (forces) necessary for the successful performance of assigned tasks. — Author). It seems to me that visiting such objects — is exactly what is called moral and psychological support in its purest form. — You recently took part in a workshop in the UK called 'Using Archeology for Restoration'. The main topic of the meeting was the development of methods of psychological rehabilitation and support for combatants and veterans. Tell us more about this meeting. — In June of this year, together with an employee of the reserve, head of the research department of archeology Serhiy Taranenko, we attended a seminar at the invitation of Bournemouth University in Great Britain. devoted to the rehabilitation of military personnel through participation in archaeological excavations. The seminar was attended by six groups engaged in such rehabilitation. One of them was our team. We talked about the experience that has already been implemented during the year in the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, and specialists from Bournemouth University, the Ministry of Defense of Great Britain and several other British universities talked about the experience of involving veterans, military personnel in rehabilitation through immersion in archeology. In Great Britain, the Nightingale program has been operating for about 10 years under the leadership of the leading archaeologist of the Ministry of Defense, Richard Osgood. This is a very interesting program that involves the involvement of veterans and improving their psychological state after participating in hostilities through involvement in archeology. We plan to highlight and expand the archaeological component of our rehabilitation program. The British experience showed us how important it is to organize work with the military at the excavations, and we are ready to apply this knowledge in Ukraine. culture- regarding many points, we managed to achieve what they did for 10 years. After all, they are only now coming to understand that, in addition to archeology, it is necessary to look for the possibility of adding a historical and spiritual component. And the basis of our program is precisely the historical and spiritual component, and archeology was one of the components. We have slightly different starting positions, but the idea of ​​spiritual restoration through involvement in the study of one's own history — this has already become a practice that exists in Great Britain, and perhaps in other countries. It is very nice that Lavra was also able to share her experience, and I think that our experience will be used. Colleagues from universities who study precisely the psychological aspects of such programs were very interested in getting acquainted with our information. I am sure that these contacts and this program will continue to develop. We dream that the program developed in the National Reserve -Kyiv-Pecherska Lavra- together with the Antony and Fedosiy Pechersky Charitable Fund and the Ukrainian Lavra Charitable Fund with the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, so that this program will be scaled to other cultural locations of Ukraine . There are already offers from other museums and nature reserves to join similar events with the participation of the military.

They play the role of bait: the Armed Forces explained the extremely high level of enemy losses in t...	Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . Since the beginning of the offensive in Kharkiv Oblast in May, the occupiers have lost more than 16,000 soldiers. — This is actually the population of a small district center anywhere — whether in Russia or Ukraine. Of course, this is a lot, but the enemy does not count with his losses, he is not interested in the losses of his personnel. He prefers to keep equipment or some sort of weapon rather than his own personnel, the spokesman said. This attitude of the Russian command towards its own soldiers allows them to be used as bait or bait to identify the firing positions of units of the Defense Forces. - Very often people are sent by some incomprehensible storms. People are very often sent on assaults or offensives, using them simply as bait for the Defense Forces to start working on them. In this way, they try to find out our fire system and then inflict fire damage, he explained. At the same time, those Russian soldiers who play the role of bait have practically no chance of survival. - It should be noted that Russia has never won a war with military art or any experience. This is all the blood, flesh and life of our compatriots, Vitaliy Sarantsev noted.

The equipment of the occupiers is Soviet junk, but the enemy makes it a combat unit	However, due to the amount, it can bring results, so it is necessary to deprive Russia of the ability not only to produce, but also to remove from storage and put into service any military equipment and weapons. This was emphasized by the commander of the 92nd separate assault air defense battalion -Achilles- on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon.

In view of this, the enemy retains the ability to saturate the front line with a sufficient amount of armored vehicles. — Today, the enemy copes with this task. Therefore, the technique is used by him from the point of view of military expediency - where it is necessary to have a quick result, the enemy tries to use this technique more intensively. Where he was shot and he has no reserves, of course he will use other means, the military said. Therefore, the main task is to beat the occupier on its territory, destroying the enterprises of the military-industrial complex.

About this informs September 23 SBU. -This time, the crimes of Major General of the Russian Police Yury Zavyalov, the deputy head of the main department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Krasnoyarsk Territory, and his subordinates have been documented,- the report says. According to the case materials, at the request of Gauleiter Saldo in July 2022, the Kremlin -sent- them to Kherson, which was captured at that time, to carry out so-called -cleansing- among local residents. -For the organization of repressive measures, Zavyalov was appointed the head of the occupying -Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Kherson region.- Two more Russian police colonels, Gennady Beryozin and Yuriy Zakavryashin, received the -deputy positions- of the head of the pseudo-institution, the SBU said. These three figures organized squads of Russians who abducted residents of the regional center and escorted them to the occupation torture chamber, which was run by Andrii Spivak, a 38-year-old senior lieutenant of the Russian police. -According to Zavyalov's orders, his subordinate subjected prisoners to cruel torture, including beatings and starving them,- the SBU said. As evidenced by the proceedings, it was on Spivak's order that the 54-year-old ATO veteran was electrocuted to death. During the liberation of Kherson, Zavyalov and his subordinates fled to the Russian Federation, where they received Kremlin awards. In order to hide war crimes, the profile data of the persons involved in the personal files in the Russian Federation were changed. However, such a conspiracy did not help them. SBU employees together with the National Police established the identities of each attacker and their personal data. So far, Zavyalov, Beryozin, Zakavryashin, Spivak and six other defendants have been notified in absentia of suspicion under Part 2 of Art. 28, Part 1 of Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (violations of the laws and customs of war, committed by a group of persons following a prior conspiracy).

- Defense - breaks records: every second ammunition on the front is Ukrainian	The Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov told about this. -We financed Ukrainian production for more than $4 billion. In Kharkiv Oblast, we repelled the Russian army with Ukrainian weapons. It was Ukrainian ammunition that provided the Armed Forces when we did not receive support from the United States,- the head of the defense department said. Today, every second piece of ammunition on the front is Ukrainian-made. If in 2023 the Ukrainian share of ammunition was 18%, then in 2024 it increased to 41%. -During this year, we have increased our long-range capabilities several times. In 2024, the Ministry of Defense alone contracted drones for over UAH 21 billion and ammunition for them for another UAH 9 billion. And together with the State Security Service, we purchased more than a million drones for our army. Thanks to the team of the Ministry of Statistics,- continued Rustem Umyerov.

Today, Ukrainian drones fly more than 1,000 km, reach Murmansk and Nadvolzhye, destroy Russian oil refineries and airfields. Ukraine was the first in the world to introduce the -swarm of drones- technology. In the last year alone, we managed to destroy or damage more than 200 targets on enemy territory. Among them are control points, airfields, ships, air defense systems and locations of Russian military personnel. Rustem Umyerov noted that this forced the enemy to relocate their planes to airfields 250 km from the border. -In the Black Sea, we forced Russian ships to flee from military bases in Crimea to the coast of the Krasnodar Territory. Without a full-fledged fleet, over the past year we have destroyed 10 Russian surface ships/boats and one submarine. Thanks to the DELTA combat system of the Ministry of Defense, we destroyed more than $15 billion worth of Russian equipment,- concluded the Minister of Defense.

The Kursk operation is being carried out and the shelling structure is also changing. For several days now, we have been observing that the enemy has been shelling and using such weapons more precisely in that area of ​​the Kursk region, which is controlled by our Defense Forces. If there are 24 KABs in Sumy Oblast, then they used 27 KABs in one district of Kursk Oblast, he said. For shelling, the occupiers mainly use long-range weapons, which can be used to strike from deep within their territory - guided aerial bombs and shock drones. Instead, the number of artillery and mortar fire decreased. At the same time, the Russians are also forced to strike first of all on their own territory. If the Russian military shelled Chernihiv, Sumy and part of the Kharkiv region 74 times in the past day, the enemy fired 91 times in just one district of the Kursk region. The tactics of enemy shelling on the territory of Russia are no different from enemy strikes on Ukraine — populated areas are completely wiped out. This scares and infuriates local residents, who see with their own eyes that there are no Ukrainian soldiers nearby, but their village is still being shelled. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kurshchyna, the Russians have resorted to the -scorched earth- tactic and are erasing their own villages from the face of the earth. Total from the beginning During the Kursk operation, the Russian military dropped more than 1,300 anti-aircraft missiles on populated areas controlled by the Defense Forces of Ukraine. This made part of the residents of the Kursk region to -see through-, but others still do not believe the reports that the Russian military committed the same crimes on the territory of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/vorog-bye-po-vlasnij-terytoriyi-struktura-obstriliv-na-pivnochi-zminylas/	2024-09-23T05:53:42-07:00

The calm is deceptive, the situation is volatile: the enemy continues fighting in the Kharkiv direct...	Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU, drew attention to this on the air of the Suspilne Novosti telethon. — There are locations where the Russians have gone on the defensive. In particular, this is the direction Hlyboke — Lypci. There, the enemy is currently entrenched in those positions that he still managed to hold. He is reshaping assault groups, building up his communications system and carrying out logistical support measures — all signs that he is preparing to resume assault operations in order to regain the ground he previously lost, he said. The spokesman emphasized that the situation is very changeable and significantly different in different areas - in some places the enemy is defending and building up forces to go on the offensive, in others it has not stopped offensive actions. — The enemy carries out assault actions in Vovchansk. He is also trying to advance in the area of ​​the Tyche settlement, in other directions, the military officer emphasized.

Housing for the military, construction audits, cost optimization — the defense infrastructure reform...	About this informs September 23 Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. -According to the formed vision of the target structure of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the results of the functional audit, the infrastructural direction should undergo a transformation,- noted Stanislav Heyder. The Deputy Minister reminded that his team started taking care of this block a month and a half ago. -We consider infrastructure as one of the key components of our capabilities that must be developed. We have a clear understanding of what to do in the next six months and how to transform this sphere,- said Stanislav Heyder. According to him, work is already underway on the key points of the transformation processes in the defense infrastructure. Among them: In the conditions of war, in particular, constant missile strikes by the enemy, the development of the necessary military infrastructure for the placement of personnel and equipment is of critical importance. Based on the approaches of NATO member countries, a decision was made to form a military infrastructure development function on the basis of one of the divisions of the Ministry of Defense. This feature will be developed over the next two months. Our task is to define clear priorities and directions for wartime defense infrastructure funding before the start of the new budget year. By the end of the year, a number of organizational changes will be introduced that will remove duplication of functions in the direction of infrastructure. The administrative structures that currently deal with issues of construction organization in the Ministry of Defense will be significantly reduced without loss of potential. From January 1, 2025, purchases of secondary housing, modular structures, equipment and certain other items of the Ministry of Defense for a total amount of several billion hryvnias will be transferred to the State rear operator. The result of these actions will be the release of a significant financial resource. For the first time, the Ministry of Defense will conduct a comprehensive audit of military facilities under construction. Over the next 4-6 months, the IOU will carry out an inventory of all current and frozen projects in order to form a holistic vision of how to effectively spend funds in this direction in 2025 and subsequent years. A component of this vision will be a strategic plan for the management of objects under construction. The Ministry of Defense will change the approach to providing military housing. Instead of multi-year construction projects, clear and transparent financial mechanisms and financial support for housing will be introduced. The concept of such changes has already been formed, its discussion with financial institutions and non-governmental organizations has begun. In order to create a transparent electronic record of lands and buildings of the Ministry of Defense, work is underway on the appropriate IT system. A prototype of such a solution has already been created, and the first results of the implementation of electronic accounting are expected by the end of the year. Work has begun on the creation of a civil real estate agency that will manage land and other real estate on a commercial basis. Examples of NATO member countries are taken as the basis for the work of such an agency. In order to save costs for the operation of the infrastructure, the implementation of individual energy efficiency pilot projects has already begun. However, what is needed is a comprehensive policy and implementation of joint energy efficiency projects. Work is underway to launch a partnership project in this direction. During the war, the priority in cooperation with partners was and will be armaments. At the same time, the subject of discussion is also joint projects in the areas of construction, restoration (reconstruction) of defense infrastructure facilities, such as health care facilities, military educational institutions, etc. Bilateral security agreements concluded with partner countries can also become the basis of such joint projects. The implementation of joint projects will strengthen the capabilities of the Defense Forces both for military needs and for development needs.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/zhytlo-dlya-vijskovyh-audyt-budivnycztva-optymizacziya-vytrat-plan-reformy-oboronnoyi-infrastruktury/	2024-09-23T03:37:05-07:00

They can fall anywhere: mines of a prohibited type are used by the enemy in the Kharkiv region	Colonel Vitaliy Sarantsev, the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, told about this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- telethon . - This is a dangerous type of weapon. -We have not yet fully investigated how large-scale their production process is - it can be either industrial or some local batch made with the help of Russian enthusiasts or volunteers,- he said. However, even if we are talking about artisanal production and a quantitatively insignificant batch of such mines, they do not become less dangerous. The power of their not too large explosive charge is enough to maim a person or even take his life if timely medical assistance is not provided. — This ammunition can be dangerous for both the military and civilians because the enemy scatters it in any area. He can drop it in those locations that, in his opinion, can be used by our military as routes for movement, the spokesman emphasized. He said that the occupiers install such mines remotely, dropping them on populated areas. - They can fall anywhere - in the yard, on the roof of the building, somewhere in the garden or in any place, - emphasized the military man. It is difficult to detect such ammunition due to its small size, camouflage color and a small number of metal parts. - It has a maximum of plastic parts, it is very difficult to detect it with a metal detector. If he, wrapped in green tape, falls into the grass, it is very difficult to see him, - explained the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv-. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv region, the occupiers are installing new mines, which are an analogue of the banned PFM-1 -Petal- and explained why do the Russians mine the area with drones.

He reported that the occupiers are trying to break through the Ukrainian defenses with the aim of unblocking the Russian military who are on the territory of the enterprise. — For this purpose, the enemy periodically strikes both with artillery and with the use of a heavy flamethrower system or MLRS. This weapon is not accurate. Therefore, cases of -friendly fire- occur quite often, when the enemy inflicts fire damage on his units, he said. Blocked enemy soldiers are in dire straits, but they still have the ability to hold the defense. - This is a large industrial enterprise. A lot of buildings have been preserved there in some places, a lot of underground communications have remained, in which it is difficult on the defensive side, but it is possible to organize a high-quality defense, he explained. This situation has been going on for several months. The occupiers are trying to deliver the blocked unit with the help of UAVs. — They had their own system in place for deliveries. Therefore, of course, we cannot put up with this for a long time. You can't keep such a hostile person in your rear.

The All-Ukrainian Festival of Veteran Culture was held in Kyiv	Correspondent ArmiyaInform visited the festival. Below &#8211; photo about the event.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/u-kyyevi-vidbuvsya-vseukrayinskyj-festyval-veteranskoyi-kultury/	2024-09-23T00:43:52-07:00
Fire on one's own is the norm for the enemy: what is the reason?	The reason was explained on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- by the commander of the -Achilles- 92nd separate assault battalion. Captain Yury Fedorenko of the brigade named after Ivan Sirk, the basket captain. — The enemy, in the amount of firearms he uses and with the level of training of the personnel, quite often has practice on his own. In particular, due to the use of aviation. This is rather the norm for the enemy, he said. This is primarily about the low level of training of individual Russian servicemen who do not have sufficient knowledge, skills and abilities for combat work with appropriate weapons and military equipment. This is one of the factors that helps the Defense Forces to restrain the offensive attempts of the invaders in the Kharkiv direction. — At the moment, we must say with certainty that, despite all attempts, the enemy is not making any progress in the direction of Vovchansk. Because the defense forces detect in a timely manner, inflict fire damage and fully control the enemy, the officer said. Likewise, the Russian occupiers are not making any progress in the area of ​​the border village of Hlyboke, north of Kharkiv. — The defense forces manage to keep the initiative fully in their hands. To support the initiative, it is necessary to work to the point of exhaustion, but the main thing is to achieve an important result - preventing the enemy from passing through our battle formations, explained the commander of the Ukrainian drones. The situation in the Kupyan sector is more complicated, where the Russians are conducting active offensive actions with the use of a significant number of personnel, weapons and military equipment. — The adversary uses more than the overwhelming number of forces and means in order to reach the left bank of the Oskil River, then gain a foothold by occupying a bridgehead and develop further success, Yuriy Fedorenko reported. However, thanks to the joint coordinated work of the units of the Defense Forces operating on this stretch, the occupiers did not have any significant successes. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Vovchansk the Russians are shelling their own units in the area of ​​the Aggregate Plant from the TOS-1A -Solntsepok- heavy flamethrower salvo system.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/vogon-po-svoyih-dlya-voroga-norma-u-chomu-prychyna/	2024-09-23T00:36:15-07:00
In the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, military personnel undergo -Spiritual restoration through culture-	Its first component — a 10-day rehabilitation for military personnel includes living on the territory of the Reserve, participation in archaeological excavations, master classes in icon painting and pottery, visiting museum exhibits, exploring the territories of the Upper and Lower Lavra and its caves accompanied by specialists of the Reserve, participating in services, communicate with spiritual mentors and monks of the monastery. The second component, called -Day in the Lavra for a military man-, involves immersion in the atmosphere and life of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra for one day for groups of military personnel up to 20 people, accompanied by a tour guide. They explore the territory, listen to tours, join in the activities of the Reserve, visit local shrines and pray with spiritual guides. The general director of the National Reserve -Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra- Maksym Ostapenko told the correspondent of ArmiyaInform that -Spiritual restoration through culture- has a very positive effect on military personnel who undergo this program. — We combine here the cultural component, the spiritual component and, at the same time, the moral rehabilitation of those soldiers who come here. The Lavra itself is a place of prayer, a place of deep identity and culture that definitely inspires people. It is a powerful, outstanding place that has shaped our identity for a thousand years. And when people join these shrines, this incredible territory, they experience a very serious moral upliftment. After all, a person here feels his belonging to a large social organism called the people of Ukraine, the state of Ukraine, Maksym Ostapenko emphasized. Over a year, more than 900 military personnel and their family members have been through the program as part of the -Day at the Lavra for Military- component, as well as 26 chaplains and 102 military personnel in the ten-day recovery program. Currently, the program is planned, various units, all types and branches of the military, military chaplaincy services are involved. Fighters are encouraged, selected, and formed into groups. Lieutenant Colonel Volodymyr Samoilyk, chief specialist of the Department of Organization of Military Chaplains' Activities of the Military Chaplaincy Service of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told about this. — The project is extremely important because the guys are in different conditions when they perform their combat duties. And this time, although it is small, is extremely important. It is important to stay in a holy place, a prayerful place, where soldiers can be not only alone, but also with a military chaplain who is in constant communication with them, explains, sometimes helps, sometimes instructs. And this is a good project, which we hope will work more powerfully in the future, Volodymyr Samoilyk said. — I expect, first of all, that the servicemen will rest spiritually and physically after coming here. And they will enjoy this rest, because now is a very active phase of hostilities. And people get very tired. Most of the people here are after injuries, serious injuries. Perhaps someone has not yet been to the Lavra. And I believe 100% that they will find such a corner for themselves here, which will be something good for them, will be remembered and will help them in the future to carry out military service in the defense of our Ukraine, - shared his vision of the group leader, chaplain service lieutenant , military chaplain of the 23rd Engineering and Position Regiment of the Support Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Taras Gordiychuk. For the first time, he organized the brothers to visit the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra. — Last week we had a group of servicemen of the National Guard of Ukraine who returned from captivity together with their families. This is a new category for us because we have mainly worked with military personnel either active duty or rehabilitating from hospitals. And we have not yet encountered the captives, but we are sure that this group of people is perhaps the most in need of support now in such facilities as the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, because their psychological and moral condition requires deeper work. After all, these people went through very difficult tests, very heavy stress, and I am sure that a place like the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra can help many of them, - summed up Maksym Ostapenko. Today there is a constant demand for spiritual support and emotional support for military personnel, their families, families of the dead, prisoners of war, as well as military personnel undergoing rehabilitation and treatment in military hospitals. Next year, the renovation of building No. 55 of the National Reserve -Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra- is expected to be completed for the long-term stay of the military on the principle of pilgrim life. Rest rooms, rooms for master classes, and a library are planned to be installed in the center for the spiritual recovery of military personnel. Such practices, taking into account the possibility of scaling innovative models of spiritual restoration through culture and the support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, will be gradually implemented on the bases of other historical and cultural reserves of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/u-kyyevo-pecherskij-lavri-vijskovosluzhbovczi-prohodyat-duhovne-vidnovlennya-kulturoyu/	2024-09-23T00:23:31-07:00

80,000 dead and the freezing of war: fakes are not only Russian	So, on Friday, during a meeting with journalists, Volodymyr Zelenskyi had to deny the information of The Wall Street Journal, which wrote that the alleged losses of Ukraine in the war amounted to 80,000 soldiers. -80 thousand? This is a lie. The real figure is much lower than what was published. Significantly,- said the President of Ukraine. Let me remind you that on September 17, the American newspaper The Wall Street Journal wrote that the number of killed and wounded Ukrainians and Russians participating in the war allegedly reached 1 million people. In particular, as the journalists claimed, 80,000 Ukrainian servicemen and 200,000 Russians were allegedly killed during the military operations. It is worth noting that the New York edition has recently come under severe criticism, in particular, due to the -global purge of editorial departments and the creation of a politically correct workforce.- Unfortunately, this is not the first time that the Western mass media have played along with the Russians, publishing in their materials information about Ukraine that does not correspond to reality. Just recently, the German tabloid newspaper Bild wrote about Ukraine's alleged readiness to -freeze- the war, referring to the Victory plan of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi. Journalists assured that the plan allegedly prescribes Ukraine's -readiness- to accept a -local ceasefire on certain areas of the front-. Zelensky was forced to react, assuring that Bild had spread a fake. No one will give the Russians Minsk-3 or any other format of freezing the war. Ukraine is categorically against this and the authorities at all levels are talking about it. It is important for us that the United States of America, which is able to ensure its implementation, supports the Victory Plan of Ukraine, and not capitulations or freezes. That is why it is always worth trusting official, and not anonymous sources, which are often used by the creators of information -dumps-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/80-tysyach-zagyblyh-i-zamorozka-vijny-fejky-buvayut-ne-lyshe-rosijski/	2024-09-22T22:06:05-07:00

In the Toretsk direction, the occupiers stormed six times in the districts of Dachny, Toretsk, Shcherbinivka, and Nelipivka. Enemy bomber and attack aircraft were active. Fighting continues in two locations - the enemy is pressing, trying to advance in the areas of Nelipivka and Shcherbinivka. The enemy is intensively attacking the Ukrainian defenders on the Pokrovsky direction. During the day, he carried out a total of 27 assault and offensive actions. The Russian occupiers are most active in the Marynivka and Novotoretska districts. Fighting continues near Myrolyubivka. According to preliminary calculations, our soldiers eliminated 145 and injured 163 invaders. The BM-21 -Grad- anti-aircraft missile system, six artillery systems, a tank, BMP, two anti-tank vehicles, five cars and three motorcycles of the invaders were destroyed. 13 artillery systems, two tanks, BMP and 12 vehicles were also damaged. On the Kurakhiv direction there were 11 combat clashes. Russian troops tried to advance in the areas of the settlements of Hirnyk, Tsukuryne, Zhelanne Druge, Katerynivka and Kostyantynivka. In the Vremivsk direction one attack by enemy units was repulsed, three battles are taking place in the Vugledar area. The enemy stepped up in the Orichivsk direction, where during the day he made two attacks near the village of Robotyne. There was no success. In the Dnieper direction the enemy assault failed. Operation in progress in Kursk region. Enemy aviation continues to attack its territory with guided aerial bombs. At the moment, 16 air strikes with the use of 27 KAB are known. In other areas, there have been no significant changes in the situation. The department also honored Ukrainian soldiers from the 10th separate Edelweiss mountain assault brigade and the 28th separate mechanized brigade named after the Knights of the Winter Campaign, who steadfastly restrained the onslaught of overwhelming enemy forces on the eastern front. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian military from the TOS-1A -Solntsepok- heavy flamethrower salvo system in the Aggregatny Zavod area, where their own military personnel are stationed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/121-bojove-zitknennya-syly-oborony-ukrayiny-strymaly-natysk-okupantiv-na-vsih-napryamkah/	2024-09-22T21:08:26-07:00
There are problems in Russia: why did Putin increase the size of the army	— First of all, let's analyze what was in the Russian Federation in terms of the number of all personnel before the large-scale invasion. The entire personnel, together with civilian personnel, was estimated at around one million 100 thousand. No more, plus or minus. In two and a half years, the Russian Federation lost more than 630,000 personnel. These are fantastic figures since the end of World War II. There was nothing like that. Let me remind you that the Soviet Union lost 15,500 during the entire war in Afghanistan, over 10 years. Russia is experiencing a serious problem of lack of manpower in the war. She has to compensate for the significant losses. Therefore, the Russians have no particular choice. Plus there is a so-called anticipatory extermination. What is it? The average rate of destruction of the enemy for us per month, especially during this summer, is 34-36 thousand. As of this minute, according to the full-time mobilization that the occupiers are carrying out, they are putting 32-34 thousand people in line. This backlash of 2,000 raschits seems to be small, but in fact it is very decisive. Therefore, they have no other choice but to increase the number of troops. — Is it a lot, plus 180,000 personnel. To some extent yes. The initial contingent of the Russian Federation that invaded Ukraine was about 180-200 thousand. But if you proceed from the opposite and understand that now the entire line of combat confrontation has approximately 600 thousand Russian invaders, then in order to really break something (our line of defense - ed), you need to double or triple this figure. The expert believes that with that type of mobilization in the Russian Federation, this is impossible. Do they have a mobilization resource from which to draw -cannon fodder-? Yes it is. It is up to three million men. But in order to actually change something on the battle line, the Russians need to go beyond the figures of 40-50 thousand per month. Will they go for it? I think not. Why? Because it will be a real social tension. And Putin is afraid of rebellion from below like fire. True, an uprising from below is impossible in itself, but it can be provoked by just one of the -Kremlin towers-. Everything the enemy does is logical. But I would not say that there is something mega unexpected from their side. And I am of the position that increasing the number of the army by 180 thousand to change the course in this phase of the war will not be decisive. No one in Russia has ever thought about training, emphasizes Petro Chernyk. For the Kremlin, Russian conscripts have always been just -cannon fodder.- — We understand that the enemy acts according to a very simple logic. You can learn to use a Kalashnikov assault rifle in 5 days. And they never cared about more serious tactical training there and never will. Therefore, it is not necessary to ask the question that, allegedly, the staff is poorly trained and this should somehow make our life easier. But remember that they just take a huge amount. I had personal experience in one of the tactical areas of the battlefield already this year. In 12 hours of assessing losses on our side and their side, we lost one killed, and they lost 24. This is so that we understand how much the Rashists do not respect personnel. If we take the two main categories of providing units and units of the Russian Armed Forces - artillery and armored vehicles - then the enemy does not have a single unit that is 80% manned, emphasizes Petro Chernyk. — If the enemy has security within 60%, it is already very good for him. But I emphasize once again, the Russians now mainly, in addition to massive artillery strikes, which have also significantly decreased in contrast to the summer of 2022, are betting on large infantry ramparts. Let me remind you that more than 100 million Kalashnikov assault rifles were produced. Of course, there are no 100 million in Russian warehouses, but there are millions. 37 million Mosin rifles were produced, 9 million RPG-7, the most massive hand-held anti-tank grenade launcher, 1.5 million RPG-18 Mukha, a reactive anti-tank grenade, 15 million Simonov self-loading carbines, and there are still up to 8 in Russian warehouses millions of Shpagin submachine guns and Sudayev submachine guns since World War II. And if the enemy needs them, they will be taken from there. It must be correctly emphasized, this number of 180 thousand Russians is purely for the provision (replenishment of losses - ed.) of these large infantry ramparts. That is, theoretically, this contingent of the enemy is for 5 months of ensuring the war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/na-rosiyi-problemy-navishho-putin-zbilshyv-chyselnist-armiyi/	2024-09-22T20:58:42-07:00
Mobilized in NATO camouflage: fern on helmet and combat makeup on Interflex	The correspondent of ArmiyaInform told about what methods of camouflage according to NATO standards are taught to Ukrainian mobilized during basic combined military training within the borders of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. The forest is moist and guarded. The wet krill, which wandered into the forest almost close to my shelter, still felt the danger and ran away. It is not easy to deceive a forest animal - on its side, hearing, sight, smell and knowledge of the area are sharp. However, now our task is not hunting - we have to hide in the forest from the enemy. At the next PPE class at Interflex, we learn basic knowledge, acquire skills and practice the skills of choosing, arranging and masking a shelter. The behavior of animals and birds is one of the signs that can betray us to the enemy. The screeching hum of a frightened flock of birds or, on the contrary, a bristling unnatural silence in the forest can indicate the presence of a person. However, there are almost no birds in our forest. Like, by the way, insects too - every once in a while you will encounter a beetle or be lucky enough to come across an anthill. Mosquitoes and flies, so annoying in Ukraine, are practically absent - probably due to the special island climate or the time of year. The escape of the rabbit looks quite natural - the timid animal could react to anything. So we can hope that the enemy lurking on the other side has not detected our presence due to the behavior of the animal. It is really not easy to notice us from the side of the field, because in addition to the usual camouflage form - most of us have a Ukrainian pixel, but there are also -British- - we have taken additional measures for camouflage. Some of these techniques are exclusive to the instructors, so it's not worth reporting them - let it be a surprise for the enemy. Others are quite obvious and widely used, so you can talk about them openly. There are several masking classes, they take place at different times and in different ways. The teaching method allows you to combine knowledge, abilities and skills from previous theoretical explanations and practical exercises and independently construct something new. This is the advantage of the teaching methods of foreign instructors. What we are taught is not an absolute unbreakable dogma, but rather the details of a constructor, each of which we must personally incorporate into our actions during the task. It is impossible to predict absolutely everything that will await you on the battlefield. But it is quite possible to work out certain modules and action algorithms, the combination of which in different combinations will allow you to adapt and use any conditions as efficiently as possible. Choosing from the acquired knowledge what fits the most right here and now, we put the elements of the acquired knowledge into the general puzzle of actions within the limits of specific conditions, creating a unique mosaic of combat. Among the basic elements of preparation for combat operations in the forest is the application of camouflage paint on the face. We start the preparation for the imitation of a combat exit with the morning make-up, painting the face with green, black and brown paints. For this, we have a special cosmetic bag with rich dyes, where dense green predominates. It is the main background on which we apply brown and black colors, creating the impression of a play of light and shadow among trees, bushes and weeds. It is not possible to paint the face too richly, because we will have the opposite of the desired effect - a bright grass-colored face with charcoal streaks and spots will sparkle in contrast among the vegetation and will be visible from afar even in the forest. Therefore, we apply paint in barely noticeable layers. -Commando in the jungles of Indochina,- someone quips. After wearing camouflage, we really look like American special forces somewhere in the area of ​​approaches to the Ke-San base. For those familiar with the history of the US war in Vietnam, there are indeed many parallels, from combat makeup to jungle warfare tactics. It is noticeable that the military of NATO countries deeply study the experience of all previous military conflicts, developing appropriate tactical techniques on its basis. The next step is to modify the spherical shape of the helmet using the tools at hand. In the forest, it immediately attracts attention, because in the natural environment, something close in shape to a perfect sphere is almost never found. So we attach to the helmet small twigs and ferns, with which the edges of the forest are covered. Now, if we carefully crawl from the depths of the forest into the fern thickets, we will be practically invisible to those looking at the forest from the side of the open field. We check the weapons and equipment once more, paying special attention to the combat make-up and the helmet-mounted spears - they must be strong enough. When the preparation is completed, we go to the edge of the forest to choose observation positions. About eight in the morning. It's been a little over three hours since the start of another training day, so we still have about 15 hours to master this element of the martial art. The intensity of the BZVP within the confines of the Interflex training mission in Great Britain is poisonous. From former civilians, we are increasingly turning into real soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/mobilizovanyj-u-maskuvanni-nato-paporot-na-sholomi-ta-bojovyj-makiyazh-na-interflex/	2024-09-22T20:50:34-07:00
Fighter against underwater threats: NATO ordered unmanned robots to neutralize mines	As stated in the official release of ECA Group, which is the founding company of Exail, the amount of the concluded contract reaches €60 million. And the main consumers of the future automated minesweepers will be the Navy units of Belgium and the Kingdom of the Netherlands, ArmyInform reports. The agreement, in particular, provides for the direct supply of K-Ster C underwater mine disposal equipment, K-Ster CT training vehicles and related equipment to the Alliance military. The K-Ster blocks will be assembled on Exail's production lines at its Belgian plant in Ostend. The factory, due to open in 2022, is already producing a number of drones for the Belgian and Kingdom of the Netherlands navies as part of a program to modernize their mine countermeasures capabilities. -We are very pleased to continue our support to the Navy of Belgium and the Kingdom of the Netherlands and NATO allies with our advanced demining technology. This new contract is a testament to our commitment to providing innovative and reliable solutions for MCM operations. In Ostend, we have all the necessary manufacturing infrastructure to produce these new systems,- said Anthony Penn, Commercial Director of Exail. The K-Ster C is a single-use unmanned underwater explosive countermeasures vehicle designed for effective mine clearance. Outwardly, it is somewhat similar to a classic torpedo. The device has a compact design that ensures easy deployment and operation, and is also equipped with a powerful cumulative charge that can effectively neutralize all types of mines. Its high maneuverability and advanced guidance system allow it to accurately target and detonate enemy infernal devices, ensuring safe and reliable minefield clearance. For its part, the K-Ster CT is a special version of the drone, created for training purposes and equipped with an inert warhead. This allows for realistic and effective training of Navy personnel without the risks associated with live ammunition. Remotely controlled underwater vehicle K-STER has a mass of 50 kg, a length of 1.5 m, a hull diameter of 230 mm, a speed of 6 knots, the duration of the task up to one hour. A special feature of the K-STER device design is a bow compartment with a combat charging compartment that can be rotated in the vertical plane. The turning angles of the nose compartment are from −90° to +90°, the mass of the explosive is 6 kg. This ensures the optimal angle of impact on the mine with a cumulative jet. The power plant of the K-STER device includes a lithium-ion battery and four reversible thrusters. The K-STER device is equipped with an omnidirectional hydroacoustic station with a range of operating frequencies of 500–1200 kHz and a range of 40–100 m. In addition, the device is equipped with a color video camera and a light. The K-STER device is controlled via a fiber-optic cable. As note the authors of the Naval News portal, in addition to units of the Belgian Navy and the Dutch Navy, these anti-mine devices have also been chosen and used by the defense forces of about 20 countries.

Four km under drones for 5 hours: the soldier - Fighter - told how he and his comrades evacuated the...	In the Armed Forces - from July 2023. This year, in the Zaporozhye direction, he participated in several successful trips as part of the evacuation group. How is it 4 kilometers to carry the body of a brother and hide from enemy drones every minute? What is the most important thing for a driver transporting a seriously injured person? But what injuries are currently the most common on the front? -Boyets- told our correspondent about this. I remember my first visit. We had to evacuate the body of our fallen brother. It was in the Verbovoy district, in the Zaporozhye direction. Then at 5 o'clock in the morning we left. At first they were on the BMP, because they still had to bring water to the boys at the position. We are just approaching, and they immediately start firing at us with a mortar. The enemy noticed us. I immediately hid. They waited a little and followed the body of their brother. They carried him back for about five hours. The distance covered was more than four kilometers. While they were carrying them, they periodically listened for drones and hid from them. There were four of us, but it is difficult to carry when the deceased weighs more than 100 kg. As soon as they heard the drone, they ran in different directions, immediately covered themselves with a branch or something else, or hid in a chance. We walked like this for two kilometers and met a guy from the 82nd brigade. He was the -three hundredth-. Our brother helped him, applied a tourniquet. Then we took his machine to make it easier for him to go, and he went ahead of us. He had a wound in his hand and some shrapnel. So he went out with us then. Finally, we reached a point where there were no enemy drones. The next exit was at my place, when a wounded person was taken away. The boys followed him, and I had to pick them up in the car. At that time we had a T4 bus. When you are a driver, in such cases it is important to think that you have to return from this exit alive. When I was leaving, I prayed as I should, I told myself that I must be alive and well, and that I must get my brothers out. Our guys, who were carrying this wounded man to the car, wanted to take a smoke break because they were tired. But they still decided to deliver it as soon as possible. Then it was necessary to drive very quickly, because the wounded person was bleeding profusely. If I had arrived 15 minutes later, this guy would not be alive. We immediately took him to the hospital. And they said that we were on time. The hospital was located nearby. And I constantly gave gas while driving. And dear, you understand what it is like there. The third exit, I remember, the injured person was not very difficult. But it had to be taken away very quickly. At that position, the enemy burned the dugout. In addition to the wounded, I took his brothers, because they were also affected a little. They immediately took him to the hospital again. Two drivers always go on such trips, because anything can happen. But this time I had to go myself. When I arrived at the point, the boys were already waiting for me in the bushes. We were going back, then there was a flight in our direction, about 50 meters nearby. It didn't affect me, I turned around and gave even more gas to get there faster. Then took them out. Now, as far as I know, everyone is alive and well. &#8230;As a rule, the front lines of all injuries are hands, feet, and eyes. Because enemy mortars and drones work there most often. I want to say this to the new recruits who are currently joining the army: if the instructors teach you something, then try, don't be lazy. Freebies are not an option here. Obey the commanders. And most importantly, study. Because it will make sense only if you prepare well. This will save your life on the battlefield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/chotyry-km-pid-dronamy-protyagom-5-godyn-voyin-boyecz-rozpoviv-yak-z-pobratymamy-evakuyuvav-tilo-zagyblogo/	2024-09-22T20:30:19-07:00

From Solntsepok to their own units: in Vovchansk, the Russians are shelling their own	Volodymyr Chernyak, officer of the -Rubizh- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, told about this on the air of the Yedyni Novyny telethon . - Probably, they decided to ease the suffering of the Russians, who are currently blocked at the Aggregate Plant. Indeed, it is not the first time that the Russians have fired at the Aggregate Plant and the surrounding areas, since we did not fire them, he said. The aggregate plant turned into a trap for the Russian military. — There are now quite a small number of Russians there, many of them are already incapacitated. Their logistics are disrupted, they are trying to use drones to compensate for the lack of drinking water, food and ammunition, the military explained. With cautious optimism, he announced possible good news from Vovchansk, in particular from the area of ​​Aggregatny Zavod. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Vovchansk was shelled from Solntsepok: Aggregate Plant district under attack by the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/z-solnczepoka-po-vlasnyh-pidrozdilah-u-vovchansku-rosiyany-obstrilyuyut-svoyih/	2024-09-22T10:42:32-07:00

An officer of the -Rubizh- brigade of the National Guard told about the city battles in Vovchansk on the telethon -Yedini Novyny- Volodymyr Chernyak of Ukraine. - Now we are slowly forcing the Russians to attack less and defend more. However, this does not mean that there are any counteroffensive actions. Large-scale counteroffensive actions are still a long way off, as the Russians still have an advantage in manpower and weapons, he said. Vovchansk is almost completely destroyed, which complicates the actions of both the soldiers of the Defense Force and the invaders. — Vovchansk is almost completely destroyed, this does not benefit either side, as shelters are becoming fewer and fewer. Street battles are mostly hiding and maneuvers that take place almost constantly from building to building, even for each entrance you can fight for a week, - explained the soldier. However, he noted, the situation is slowly but steadily leaning in favor of the Ukrainian defenders, although it is too early to talk about any significant successes. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the north of Kharkiv Oblast, the occupiers were forced to abandon assault operations — the enemy is evacuating casualties and regrouping.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/za-pidyizd-mozhna-bytysya-tyzhden-miski-boyi-u-vovchansku-opysaly-v-sylah-oborony/	2024-09-22T10:27:35-07:00

On rusty -motorcycles-: in the Kharkiv direction, the occupiers use outdated Soviet armored vehicles	This was explained by a military officer from with the callsign -Stig- is an officer of the 2nd separate detachment of the Special Purpose Center -OMEGA- of the National Guard of Ukraine. -The occupiers are using armored vehicles for logistics, to replenish personnel at the forward positions,- he said. According to the military, the enemy cannot use it during assaults. — This is more about replenishing some logistics and advanced positions with personnel. Because almost the entire territory of the battle line is controlled by UAV strike groups. And if it is not impossible to drive in an armored vehicle just like that, then it is very close to it, he explained. The officer noted that these are primarily outdated samples of Soviet equipment, which the Russians do not regret. — They use this technique in one way. That is, it is not some kind of advanced technology. These are old Soviet models, such as MTLB, BMP-1, BMD and so on. They simply send one, two, sometimes three units of armored vehicles to the position and understand that this vehicle may not even reach the position, he explained. Similarly, Russian commanders do not spare their own soldiers. -And if it reaches the position, it does not have time to unload and is destroyed literally before the occupier can even disembark with this equipment,- said the military officer. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast the Russians throw recently mobilized prisoners on -meat assaults-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/na-irzhavyh-motolygah-na-harkivskomu-napryamku-okupanty-vykorystovuyut-zastarilu-radyansku-bronetehniku/	2024-09-22T09:31:20-07:00
The DSHV showed the work of one of the most important areas of modern warfare	This is reported by command of the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Reb is one of the most important areas in modern warfare. After all, it is UAVs that pose one of the biggest threats to our fighters,- the message says. In particular, reconnaissance drones target artillery, missiles, and anti-aircraft missiles. FPV strike drones are weapons that deal significant damage to Ukrainian infantry. -EW tools are our shield. Thanks to the work of the workshop of the 77th brigade, it is possible to make effective devices that protect the infantry. And what is very important is to make them cheaper and faster than on the market,- noted the command of the DSHV. According to one military officer, with the help of UAV-reconnaissance, with which radio-electronic warfare is fought, the enemies target both -shahedis- and all their missiles. Therefore, it is very important to know how to protect yourself from FPV drones. -Each EW means is a power supply, interference generation and radiation (antenna) systems. And also plastic cases to protect them. Chinese antennas are usually of very low quality, so we make them ourselves. It takes about 8 hours to make one antenna housing. A set of three antennas is a day,- the defender said. He noted that the cost of one antenna (cables, connectors, plastic) is about 1,000 hryvnias, and to buy a similar one requires from 3 to 4 thousand hryvnias. -In terms of characteristics, our antenna is even better because we know what we are making it from and check it at every stage. We invest about 50,000 hryvnias in one EW device, manufacturers sell from 120,000 hryvnias per analogue,- the military officer explained.

The occupiers are changing the ways of protecting armored vehicles	About this on the broadcast of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- told the crew commander of the UAV -Kara Nebesna- UAV of the -Rubizh- brigade - officer Andriy Otchenash. - They had a period of time when they completely sheathed their equipment that could not move the turret and used it as a -taxi-. Currently, they are trying to somehow modernize their methods of defense against FPV copters so that the tank can be used directly as a tank, and at the same time, to be able to transport personnel with quality, he said. Therefore, the Russians are trying to preserve the maneuverability and firepower of their armored vehicles. — Heavy equipment and transports enemy personnel and sometimes even manages to withdraw without casualties. There were moments when they drove up close to our positions, shot at our positions and had the opportunity to drive away, the officer said. In his opinion, this indicates that the occupiers are using powerful EW tools. - This is a sign that they are using high-quality electronic warfare systems because our FPV drones simply cannot fly up, said the drone commander. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Russians trenches are dug by suicide soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/get-mangaly-ta-sarayi-okupanty-zminyuyut-sposoby-zahystu-bronetehniky/	2024-09-22T08:50:26-07:00

Enemy Motorized Infantry: Advantages and Disadvantages explained in Defense Forces	The advantages and disadvantages of the use of motorcycles by the Russian occupiers, as well as why the enemy resorts to their use, on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- explained a military man with the call sign -Stig- - an officer of the 2nd separate detachment of the Special Purpose Center -OMEGA- of the National Guard of Ukraine. - First, a motorcycle is a light, maneuverable, high-speed, highly mobile target. When there are many of them, it is very difficult for even strike UAVs to engage several targets at once. Therefore, some of them reach their destination, he said. At the same time, the use of motorcycle equipment also has a number of disadvantages. -The disadvantage of this tactic is that this target is not armored,- he explained. Due to the lack of any protection, even during an inaccurate hit of ammunition next to an enemy motorcyclist, debris can either injure or even eliminate the occupant, and completely disable his vehicle. — We have already worked on these goals and are well acquainted with such tactics. They have been using it since at least this spring, the military said. He explained why the Russians resort to the use of motorcycles. - First of all, armored vehicles often simply do not reach places that can be reached by motorcycle. They have to carry out their replenishment, logistics, and they do it on motorcycles, because sometimes there is simply no other way for them, said the officer. Another drawback is the low carrying capacity of motorcycle equipment, but the occupiers even try to evacuate the wounded on motorcycles. -We saw a group of four motorcycles evacuating moderately injured people,- Stig said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the north of Kharkiv Oblast, the -rats on mopeds- did not get there - the biker occupiers blew up the mines.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/motoczykletna-pihota-voroga-perevagy-ta-nedoliky-poyasnyly-v-sylah-oborony/	2024-09-22T05:48:19-07:00

The corresponding video was released on September 22 by the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops. -Sniper is a profession that requires calm, balance. I can't count how many of them I've killed. I'm counting how many I've lost here. That's more important to me. It's productive for me, not when you kill 5, 6, 7 there, but when you make sure that yours are not killed. This is the most important thing,- assures the female sniper. According to her, there are no people there for her. -Only creatures that have human form. So first, tenth, twentieth, it doesn't matter. The main thing is for him to leave our land,- she says. Another sniper notes that he always thinks about destroyed villages and cities before going out. He says that he will never forgive this. -The enemy will learn about the fact that the group was working in a certain area along the line of combat contact, counting their losses,- the Khortytsia OSU emphasizes.

-Disposable slaves- in -zombieland-: suicide soldiers are digging trenches for the Russians	The crew commander of the -Kara Nebesna- UAV crew of the -Rubizh- brigade told about this on the air of the Yedyny Novyni telethon - officer Andriy Otchenash. — The Russian Federation has one of the most powerful engineering forces in the world, unfortunately. Due to the fact that they have conditionally slave soldiers, no matter how ridiculous it sounds. They have whole units of -disposables- that are launched to dig trenches, to dig positions. Unfortunately, they do it very quickly and very qualitatively, he said. The officer reported that the defenders of Ukraine had repeatedly observed cases when such -disposable slaves- of the enemy entered the positions without weapons. - There have been several situations where they start groups even without weapons. Maybe in armor, helmets, but without weapons - with shovels, picks, all means to dig out positions. And they just dig 24/7, said the soldier. Enemy soldiers, realizing that they can save themselves only by digging in as deep as possible, dig trenches with maximum intensity. In some cases, enemy positions are equipped even by persons who are not dressed in military uniform. - They are dressed in ordinary black robes, not like military personnel. They don't have weapons, but they dig, and after a day or two or three you see that there are actually lines of trenches that appeared out of nowhere, Andriy Otchenash said. Such a tactic gives the enemy, who does not count on any losses, the desired result. - You seem to throw ammunition at them, you seem to destroy the personnel. And they just send new -meat-, which continues to dig. It looks like a zombie land, but unfortunately it's an effective zombie land, he said. Sometimes the enemy soldiers assigned to equip the positions do not have any individual protection. - We have repeatedly seen that military personnel enter sometimes even without armor, without helmets and absolutely without any weapons. They really only go there to dig, - said the officer. The military assumed that in this way in the Russian army they can be punished for some crimes. - Sometimes they are punished like this, it is a punishment: if you survive - well done, if you do not survive - not well done. But the very fact that this is such a widespread phenomenon is extremely surprising. Unfortunately, it is surprising with its effectiveness, said the drone commander. At best, 50% of such -disposable- suicide bombers survive, but the other half still digs out chances and arranges sufficiently high-quality dugouts, which are then entered by soldiers of the Russian army prepared for combat operations. Earlier, ArmyInform reported on attacks -on foot- by the dead- — the -murderous tactics- of the Russians in the Kharkiv direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/odnorazovi-raby-u-zombilendi-u-rosiyany-okopy-kopayut-soldaty-smertnyky/	2024-09-22T04:32:17-07:00

Six Russian fighter jets were found over the Baltic Sea in two days	This was reported by the Air Force of Latvia. According to their reports, violations were recorded on September 20 and 21. Russian planes did not turn on their transponders and did not provide a flight plan. Eurofighter fighters of the German Air Force, involved in the NATO mission to protect the airspace of the Baltic countries, were taken into the air. The fighters warned the Russian pilots and escorted them to the border. As the online edition reminds Delfi, the Ministry of Defense of Latvia has increased surveillance of the airspace after the incident on September 7, when a Shahed drone fell in the Haigalivska Volost of the Rezekne Region. Russia actively uses these Iranian-made drones in the war against Ukraine. The activation of Russian aircraft increased after the Russian Navy exercises -Ocean-2024-, during which Russian and Chinese warships conducted joint exercises from September 10 to 16, which are part of Russia's largest naval exercises since the time of the Soviet Union. However, as the head of the intelligence center of the Estonian Defense Forces, Colonel Ants Kiviselg, noted at the press conference, the exercises were less extensive than expected. -Part of the training took place in the Baltic Sea. Russia stated that 90,000 personnel and 400 ships would take part in them, however, according to our assessment, the exercises were on a much smaller scale and took place at a low level. First of all, flights of strategic bombers and some reconnaissance flights were carried out,- &#8211; he said. The General Staff of the Estonian Defense Forces reported that the Baltic Fleet's share of activity was insignificant. The exercise culminated in local actions by the various fleets and was more of a demonstration than a real training process. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/shist-rosijskyh-vynyshhuvachiv-vyyavyly-nad-baltijskym-morem-za-dva-dni/	2024-09-22T03:49:05-07:00

The defense forces do not allow the Russians to use equipment in the Sumy direction — OTU -Siversk-	The spokesman of the -Siversk- group, Vadym Mysnyk, told about this on the air of the Yedyny Novyni telethon. Yes, last day Glukhivsk community came under the attack of KABs and FPV drones. The regional center of Sumy is also under fire. -They hit residential buildings, critical infrastructure facilities, and farms. They do not stop such tactics, but as a result of the transfer of hostilities to the territory of the Kursk region, the Russians are forced to shell their own territory,- said Vadym Mysnyk. So, two days ago, the enemy dropped 17 anti-aircraft missiles on the territory of the Sumy region, and on the Kursk region &#8211; 21, and in the last day - 13 KABs in the Sumy region, and 31 - in the Kursk region. -That is, we see that as a result of the actions of the Defense Forces, the enemy is forced to spend its arsenals on strikes on its territory,- &#8211; the spokesman added. Also, the Defense Forces of Ukraine constantly monitor the situation at the border. As Vadym Mysnyk noted, the Russians are actively mining the border from their side, creating fortifications. Also, the activity of DRGs has decreased, as the Armed Forces have effective tactics against such groups. -Thanks to such tactics, the Russians cannot use heavy armored vehicles - tanks and BMPs are actively destroyed on the approach. Therefore, they have to work in small infantry groups, but this does not give a full-fledged result,- the spokesman explained.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/syly-oborony-ne-dayut-rosiyanam-zastosovuvaty-tehniku-na-sumskomu-napryamku-otu-siversk/	2024-09-22T03:25:39-07:00

But mostly the boat performs the functions of guarding the base point, stays at sea for weeks without using weapons. -Therefore, it cannot be said that this missile carrier is used as a carrier.

Gives a second life to radios: the story of the signalman Phoenix	Maksym was born in Boryspil district near Kyiv and has the nickname -Phoenix-. After all, it gives a second life to technology. He was involved in electronics almost all his life, his father gave Maksym a soldering iron for his 10th birthday, and even then he became interested in repairing household appliances. That is why the boy managed to find a job in the army. Currently, he repairs and restores communication equipment that is out of order after enemy fire. He joined the Defense Forces on the first day of the large-scale invasion, while the boy notes that he planned to go not to the army, but to the enterprise of the military-industrial complex. — But on February 24, they brought me a summons, and already at 6:00 p.m. I was in the unit. At the beginning, he served in the security company of the Boryspil TCC. There were tasks. And for a person who had never encountered the army, it was both difficult and difficult, and sometimes scary. And already in December 2022, he was transferred to the 110th separate mechanized brigade, says Maksym. Currently, -Phoenix- is the head of the repair shop at the field communications center, and together with his brothers, he provides communications to the headquarters and rear units. At the same time, his work is not limited to the 110th brigade, the young man explains that communication must also be provided to other units that are in the Pokrovsky direction. There is no big difference between civil and military electrical engineering, says a military officer. Therefore, he does not experience any additional difficulties during work. However, due to the dynamism of the war, it is quite often necessary to change the style of work, to get used to something new. — Yesterday we could also use Baofeng, but now we have completely forgotten about them. The work of the same FPVs, WEB frequencies also changes. The enemy started calculating the launch location of the Mavic, we rewrote the firmware so that there was no longer a link to the launch location. Changes take place extremely dynamically. And this adds a lot of work, but we are working, - added Maksym. Last year, the military man spent a lot of time at zero, and the tasks were diverse. It was necessary to deal with the towers, install transmitters for work to mislead the enemy or eavesdrop. -Phoenix- also launched broadcasts calling on the Russians to cease fire or offer to surrender. He also went to Avdiivka several times, which, according to the boy, he managed to bypass -along and across-. During the serious assaults on the city, Maksym worked alone in the workshop, and 10 Starlink terminals were brought to him almost every day. Then the boy slept for 3-4 hours, but he understood the importance of work. According to Maxim, the best way to explain the importance of communication in the military is by analogy with civilian life. When an ordinary person does not pick up his phone in the morning, does not start reading the news, watching various videos, then by the evening he will begin to feel a certain vacuum. — A vacuum, because she does not know what is being done in the white world, and what is being done behind the fence. And work chat, and with family, and so on. And now we're just adding to all of this a potentially life-threatening thing. Life is in danger, and you don't know which side the danger is coming from, the soldier explained. He clarifies that when there is communication, personnel can be warned of an enemy attack and this will help prepare for battle. Maxim calls the old -tapik- (military wire communication. — Ed.) the most secure means of communication in the army, which, although, according to him, has a large number of shortcomings, it cannot be eavesdropped by the enemy, which is very important during the war . — There was no modernization of all of this, the 1958 model -tapiks- were used. It can be made much smaller, it can be made much more interesting. Nevertheless, the warehouses are full of this good, it was picked up, washed a little, cleaned - and it works, said -Phoenix-. At the same time, he again emphasized that the war is changing rapidly, and that is why on the front -tapiks- are almost not used, and Motorola communication devices can be seen more often. - As for me, just subjectively, it seems to me that the hardest thing is when we move from one area to another and we have to simply lay everything out from scratch. There is such a thing that masters, like crayfish, carry the workshop with them under their tails. No matter how banal it is, but after the third move, everything is already unified for me. I have a folding table, I have a folding chair, everything is minimized. There shouldn't be too much in the workshop, the boy said. And the presence of the workshop itself makes it possible to save time when other fighters are forced to involve civilians in the repair of certain equipment. At the same time, -Phoenix- is also aware of the enemy's state of affairs. He specified that almost all Russian brigades work on the same equipment, but the quality of specialists is questionable. Also, a significant part of the occupiers, who are sent for meat assaults, are not provided with means of communication at all. However, the guy does not underestimate the capabilities of the Russians, because the occupying special forces have good means of radio-electronic warfare and radio-electronic intelligence. Maksym explained that at first glance it may seem that he is doing nothing, he is sitting in a chair in front of the computer, there is a soldering iron on the table, and there are various monitors in front of him. However, after the battle, the soldiers with whom he worked come to him and express their gratitude. This is the best reward for him. — For example, when guys from the front line come and say: -everything is clear on the communication.- This is very nice. When no one quarrels, that there is no connection, when the boys hear each other, then this is the most gratifying, the soldier added. The army taught Maxim more responsibility for himself, as well as for his subordinates, because in war mistakes are measured by people's lives. That is why, when he undertakes some work, he does it qualitatively and quickly. After the end of the war, -Phoenix- first of all wants to get on his motorcycle and ride 800 kilometers without stopping. The guy called his bike the best psychologist. — I really want that. I miss him so much. Sometimes such trash, so heavy. This is my desire after the war - to get on my bike and go on a motorcycle trip somewhere for at least a week. In the Carpathians, and maybe by the sea, somewhere where there are few people and only nature, Maxim emphasized.

How the Russian peace fell into a fire trap in Belarus: a half-thousand-year history	Volodymyr Hutsul, associate professor of the Department of Archaeology, Ecology and Cultural Studies of the Uzhgorod National University, told ArmiyaInform about the famous Battle of Orsha in 1514, in which the armies of European and Asian military traditions met. — The mention of the 510th anniversary of the Battle of Orsha is included in the -Ukrainian military-historical calendar for 2024-. However, this battle took place during the war between Lithuania and Muscovite on the territory of modern Belarus. A person who is not sufficiently familiar with Ukrainian history may have a question - what is Ukraine here for? - It is important to remember that Ukrainian history did not take place in a spherical vacuum. The processes that took place in Central-Eastern Europe in the 16th century influenced Ukrainian history and, accordingly, Ukrainian history had an impact on European history. Therefore, we should abandon Ukrainian historical isolationism and understand Ukrainian history in the context of European history. The Battle of Orsha in September 1514 is the culmination of the confrontation between two military and political powers in Eastern Europe, which gained strength at the beginning of the 16th century - the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Then the Muscovites were on the rise, practicing good old Mongol expansionism combined with the ideas of Byzantine imperialism. At that time, the Ukrainian lands were at the center of the confrontation between these two powers, therefore the Battle of Orsha relates directly to Ukrainian history, is a part of it. —However, at least according to my observations, few people outside the professional community of historians know about the Battle of Orsha. Why so? Why was little attention paid to it before? — This is an old Soviet totalitarian historiographical tradition — to keep quiet not even certain events that are relevant for the history of Ukraine, but even entire periods. Or to present them as unimportant marginal plots from the point of view of Soviet totalitarian history. With such an approach, Moscow's defeats were tried to be hidden and not mentioned again. On the other hand, in the Belarusian national historiographical tradition, the Battle of Orsha is well known and quite popular. Not only because the events took place on Belarusian territory, but also because the battle is an important plot of the modern Belarusian national idea, which separates Belarusian history from Moscow history. —From what sources do we know about the Battle of Orsha? How informative are they? — Like most large-scale battles of the 16th century, the Battle of Orsay is fairly well documented. We can name several types of historical sources that inform us about the causes and background of an event, its participants, course and consequences. First of all, these are the military and fiscal documents of the Jagiellonian Court, which tell us about the expenses for the campaign of 1514: mercenaries, artillery, etc. In the so-called archive of the Radzyvils, we have a list of parts of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that were sent on the campaign of 1514. Then we have the earliest reports of the Battle of Orsha, which is the Jagiellonian diplomatic correspondence with European and non-European monarchs. The most interesting, in my opinion, are visual sources. Several unique images have reached us about the Battle of Orsha. This is a woodcut from a eulogy in honor of Andrzej Krytski, published in Krakow in 1515, which contains the only portrait of Prince Konstantin Ostrozki during his lifetime. We also have a large painting depicting a battle, painted in the first third or perhaps even the first quarter of the 16th century. It is currently kept in the Warsaw National Museum. It is a large, original visual narrative of the battle, featuring up to a thousand characters. There are also visual sources of Moscow origin in the so-called Lytsovo Chronicle Vault - there are more than 10 illustrations dedicated to the Battle of Orsha. So we have a complex of sources both from the side of the losers and from the side of the winners. - What were the troops that gathered at Orsha? - We know much more about the Jagiellonian army than about the Moscow army. Based on documents, images and narrative messages, we can say that the Jagiellonian army was organized according to the latest European fashion. At that time, the military fashion in Western Europe was defined by the so-called Italian Wars - the conflict between the Valois and the Austrian Habsburgs over Italian heritage. It was these wars of the late 15th and mid-16th centuries that became a kind of laboratory of military technologies. Their main trend was to combine old-style heavy shock cavalry with small arms units. There is a stereotype that hand firearms almost immediately supplanted, destroyed or nullified the importance of knightly cavalry. In reality, this was not the case. It was the combination of firepower and shock cavalry that ensured the effectiveness of armies in the 16th century. If we talk about the formation of the army of that time in different countries, then the Grand Duchy of Lithuania relied on the common movement - the general military duty of the nobility. Nominally, at the request of the Grand Duke of Lithuania, every landed gentry had to join military service. However, at the beginning of the 16th century, this system did not work very effectively. It is this ineffectiveness of the system of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that is the main reason for the series of defeats of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the war with the Muscovites, when Lithuania suffered significant territorial losses. On the other hand, in the Polish crown at that time, processes were taking place that balanced the general movement of the mercenary army - military specialists. At that time, this was also a pan-European trend - to supplement in different proportions or to try to replace the nobility common movement with mercenaries. - And what was the Moscow army like at that time - did it also develop according to European trends or did it have any peculiarities? - The Moscow army consisted mainly of the so-called local cavalry. These were also people who had military service for land grants from the Moscow prince. However, more than half - 50-60% - of the Muscovite army consisted of so-called combat serfs, or servants. These were dependent unfree people who were taken to the war by the landowners - the so-called boyar children. Compared with Europe, in particular with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland, the Moscow military elite had practically no rights and freedoms. Combat serfs did not even have what boyar children had. This greatly influenced both the worldview of representatives of the Moscow military community and their combat traditions and tactics on the battlefield. - That is, it directly affected tactical techniques? - As for military technology, the Moscow army was mainly composed of horse archers. It was borrowed from Eastern, Mongolian and Tatar tactics. The combination of shock heavy armored cavalry with fire infantry of the Muscovites to the extent that it was common in Europe was not practiced. Instead, the Jagiellonian army combined heavily armored plate cavalry, lighter cavalry with melee weapons - so-called hussars, mounted riflemen, light infantry and field artillery. This led to a wider range of tactics that such an army could use on the battlefield. - What was the number of troops on both sides? - There is a debate about this. There is an old narrative tradition dating back to the 16th century to count the Jagiellonian army at 30,000, and the Moscow army at 80,000 combatants. These figures are greatly exaggerated, because neither the Moscow principality at that time had such a resource, nor the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Polish crown. If we turn to the military and fiscal documentation, we can count about 12,000 soldiers in the Jagiellonian army near Orsha. There were about 7,000 boyar children in the Moscow army, each of whom had to be accompanied by at least one combat serf, that is, we have at least 14,000. At the same time, we have every reason to believe that there were more serfs - 2-3 with each boyar child. Accordingly, the total number of the Moscow army increases approximately twice - to 28-30 thousand. — However, with a numerical advantage, the Russian army lost the battle. How did this happen? — The battle began with a Moscow attack, then continued with a counterattack by the Lithuanian commonwealth movement. Attacks and counterattacks continued until the Jagiellonian army managed to lure part of the Muscovites under the muzzles of the fire infantry, which Prince Konstantin Ostrozky had prudently placed in an ambush. This ultimately determined the outcome of the battle. However, one should not forget the importance of heavy armored cavalry, the effectiveness of the new trend of combining it with fire infantry, and the combination of various battle tactics. All this tipped the scales in favor of the army under the command of Prince Konstantin Ostrozky. - Was this battle significant in the short and long term? - The main goal of the Jagiellonian campaign was not achieved - Smolensk was not recaptured. On the other hand, it was a heavy and even catastrophic defeat of the Moscow army, which had enormous moral significance. Both for the social capital of the Jagiellonian monarchy and for the political capital, it was then believed that God himself sided with the victors, granting victory in the battle. The third point was that after the battle of Orsha, the Muscovites avoided open clashes with the Jagiellons in the field for a long time, until the Livonian War. The war after the Battle of Orsha lasted until 1522, but no more major battles took place in the field. Many representatives of the Moscow military elite died and were captured in the battle. The nobles of the Grand Duke of Muscovite—the elite part of the Muscovite military—suffered heavily. Another part of Muscovites was captured and transported around Europe, showing the European rulers a kind of traveling circus or a menagerie of captured savages from the East. Thanks to this, the Europeans were able to see the wild Muscovites with their own eyes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/yak-russkij-mir-u-bilorusi-potrapyv-u-vognevu-pastku-pivtysyacholitnya-istoriya/	2024-09-21T20:41:00-07:00
Ratification of the Rome Statute: benefits and risks for the military	Actually, the path from signing to ratification of the Rome Statute in Ukraine was quite long - almost 25 years. And all this time, passions around the document did not abate. First, the President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma, who ordered the signing of the Rome Statute, already in 2001 submitted an appeal to the Constitutional Court with a request to declare it unconstitutional. The Constitutional Court of Ukraine then came to the conclusion that the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, signed on behalf of Ukraine on January 20, 2000, does not correspond to the Constitution of Ukraine, in the part that refers to the provisions of the tenth paragraph of the preamble and Article 1 of the Statute, according to which the -International Criminal Court- ; complements the national bodies of criminal justice-. Subsequently, after the signing of the Association Agreement with the European Union in 2014, the ratification of this document became one of Ukraine's direct international obligations. However, the Ukrainian authorities were in no hurry to fully join the work of the International Criminal Court. ArmyInform asked lawyers to tell more about the International Criminal Court and explain what the ratification of the Rome Statute means for Ukraine and what risks it entails, in particular, for the Ukrainian military. — The idea of ​​creating an international court as a tool to prevent military conflicts and quickly punish the guilty arose after the Second World War, says Honored Lawyer of Ukraine Yevhenii Solodko. — After negotiations, the case did not move for almost 50 years, but the brutal war and genocide in Yugoslavia and Rwanda became a kind of catalyst for the process. At the UN diplomatic conference held in Rome on July 17, 1998, 120 states agreed to create the International Criminal Court. The document that regulates the work of the ISS became the -Rome Statute-, which was signed by the representatives of these states. The ICC was supposed to punish genocide, crimes against humanity (systematic murders, torture, kidnapping, etc.) and war crimes (attacks on civilian infrastructure, humiliation of the enemy, depriving prisoners of war of the right to a fair trial, etc.). A total of 137 countries have signed the ICC Statute, and 124 countries have ratified it. The ISS is located in The Hague, it began its work four years after the signing of the Charter, when it was ratified by the first 60 states. Yevgeny Sweetko says that there are countries that have even withdrawn their signature under it. This, for example, was done by the USA in May 2002. President George W. Bush said at the time that the International Criminal Court threatened the U.S. military and violated national sovereignty. China, India, Turkey, Egypt and Israel have also not signed or ratified the statute. Currently, the -Rome Statute- has been ratified by Ukraine, but the question arises - what does this ratification mean for us? — The International Criminal Court will be able to bring a Ukrainian to justice only if the national law enforcement system -cannot- or -does not want- to do it properly, explains Yevhenii Solodko. — If there is already a verdict of the Ukrainian Themis regarding a specific war crime - guilty or acquittal - then international justice is of no use here, because in Article 17 of the -Rome Statute- contains a list of reasons when an international court cannot accept a case for its proceedings. The main one is if the case is already being investigated by national law enforcement agencies. But the ICC can recognize that a national investigation was conducted improperly or specifically for the purpose of -protecting a person from persecution.- In this case, the international court can accept the case before its proceedings. He is convinced that states unfriendly to Ukraine, primarily the Russian Federation, will try to -throw- at the ISS with hundreds of statements against the military of the Armed Forces. Despite the fact that in November 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin banned the ratification of the Rome Statute by decree. This happened after the ICC prosecutor's office began a preliminary investigation into the situation in Ukraine after 2014. Let me remind you that in 2008, when the Russian Federation started a war against Georgia, it submitted statements against Georgian political and military figures to the International Criminal Court. The Georgian authorities, in turn, filed lawsuits against Russia. The court spent 10 years investigating the situation, and ultimately punished only three officials of the unrecognized South Ossetia, but not Russia, which controlled them. Certainly, the ratification of the -Rome Statute- is one of the conditions for further European integration of Ukraine. All members of the European Union are members of the ISS. -This is a clear signal that Ukraine shares the principles of the international order based on laws and rules, and is fully ready to act in accordance with these principles,- Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said. He also emphasized that Ukrainian prosecutors already cooperate with the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on a daily basis, and ratification will only strengthen this cooperation. After completing the procedure of joining the ICC, Ukraine will have the right to appoint its own judge to this international body, participate in prosecutor elections, and approve the distribution of the court's budget. Full participation in the ICC will make it easier for Ukrainians to access the court's special trust fund and increase the chances of receiving compensation for victims of Russian crimes. Lawyer Oleksiy Novikov names five main advantages of the ratification of the -Rome Statute-: Oleksiy Novikov explains: In general, our experts agree that the ratification of the Rome Statute is an important step for ensuring international justice and protecting human rights.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/ratyfikacziya-rymskogo-statutu-perevagy-j-ryzyky-dlya-vijskovyh/	2024-09-21T20:30:39-07:00
Fake -confessions-: propaganda has once again started the old trick about drug addicts	The Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security reminds us of this. In order to record the desired -picture-, the prisoners are forced under pressure and threats to voice the dark propaganda. This time, propagandists spread lies about narcotic substances that dull fear, reduce pain and increase courage. Drugs allegedly used by the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are supplied to the Ukrainian army, including from the United States. This is a very old propaganda fiction. Do you remember the -spiked oranges- of the Orange Revolution and the fakes about the drug-addicted President of Ukraine that have been circulating since 2019? Now, allegedly from the words of a Ukrainian prisoner of war, propagandists are spreading lies about Ukrainian drug-addicted soldiers. But in this case, the fake was launched on behalf of an unidentified person (surname, rank, type of military, affiliation to a military unit, etc. are missing), so it may not even be a real prisoner of war, but a dummy person. By spreading such nonsense, Russian propaganda tries to discredit the Armed Forces in the eyes of conscripts and Ukrainian society in general.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/fejkovi-ziznannya-rospropaganda-znovu-zavela-staru-sharmanku-pro-narkomaniv/	2024-09-21T20:25:49-07:00
Rustem Umerov on the transfer of F-16: We will be able to announce the results soon	This was stated by the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov on the air of the telethon. According to him, Ukraine is currently negotiating with allies, explaining how many aviation brigades and planes we need. The authorities also tell partners about what weapons are needed to strengthen the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Last year we focused on training pilots, obtaining platforms and building infrastructure. This year, we are working on achieving an advantage in the sky,- Rustem Umyerov said. The head of the defense department noted that Russia currently uses up to 300 aircraft and the same number of helicopters in the war against Ukraine, which poses a serious challenge to the Ukrainian military. Rustem Umyerov also emphasized the importance of scaling up negotiations with partners regarding the increase in aviation, informing about solutions currently being worked on. -There are already agreements on the transfer of F-16 and Migare. Negotiations are ongoing regarding the Gripen and Eurofighter Typhoon fighters. Soon there will be results that we will be able to announce,- the Minister of Defense emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukraine plans to produce several million drones by 2025. First of all, so that Russia does not have the opportunity to lead in this component.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/21/rustem-umyerov-pro-peredachu-f-16-skoro-budut-rezultaty-yaki-my-zmozhemo-anonsuvaty/	2024-09-21T12:39:02-07:00

The head of the defense department noted that even this year our country will purchase more than a million drones. Rustem Umerov estimated his own production at several million. -For our part, we did not say how many drones we can produce. But it's a few million. Of which some things are financed by the state budget, some money we find from partners. That is, our capacity is several million drones, we are able to do it. Next year, we will not let the enemy bypass us, so we will produce several times more,- the Minister of Defense noted. As reported by ArmyInform, for the first time Ukrainian companies will be able to take part in the Drone Coalition's tenders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/21/ministr-oborony-u-2025-roczi-ukrayina-perevershyt-rosiyu-u-vyrobnycztvi-droniv/	2024-09-21T12:23:37-07:00

Scorched earth tactics: in Kurshchyna, Russians wipe their own villages from the face of the earth	Vadym Mysnyk, the spokesman of OTU -Siversk-, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- . — They have such a tactic that they do not distinguish at all which is Ukrainian territory and which is actually Russian. Their only tactic is simply scorched earth — they erase settlements from the face of the earth and they cannot use any new tactics, he said. He said that over the past day, the Russian military dropped 17 anti-tank missiles on the territory of the Sumy region and 25 anti-tank missiles on the part of the Kursk region controlled by units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. — Such ratios are practically preserved. That's why we moved the hostilities to their territory, the spokesman said. He also emphasized that the Kursk operation made it possible to protect the border regions of the Sumy region from shelling from mortars and artillery. Unfortunately, the Russians can launch more long-range weapons, primarily attack UAVs and anti-aircraft missiles, from deep within their own territory and hit Ukrainian populated areas in this way. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that part of the residents of the Kursk Oblast -have become enlightened- and they no longer believe Russian propaganda.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/21/taktyka-vypalenoyi-zemli-na-kurshhyni-rosiyany-styrayut-z-lyczya-zemli-vlasni-sela/	2024-09-21T11:24:59-07:00
-Vrut on TV!- - part of the residents of the Kursk region -seemed-	This was told by Vadim Mysnyk, the spokesman of OTU -Siversk- on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- . — Russia reflects in its propaganda what it does and has done. By turning it over, they show it and want to turn it over to the Defense Forces of Ukraine, to Ukrainian soldiers. But it no longer works here, he said. Most of the -heroes- of materials fabricated by Russian propagandists are well known to the Ukrainian military. - The fact is that we know a lot about all the characters in these edited videos, because we communicate a lot with the local population, - the spokesman explained. In order for Russian propaganda to stop working, it is enough to show it to those who can see the real state of affairs on the ground with their own eyes. This is exactly what is happening to local residents in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that residents of Kurshchyna are considered traitors in the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/21/vrut-po-tyelyevizoru-chastyna-meshkancziv-kurskoyi-oblasti-prozrily/	2024-09-21T11:11:24-07:00

He emphasized that these well-aimed strikes significantly affect the course of the war, because they destroy Russian stockpiles of weapons used for terror against Ukraine. -We are able to bring the war back home, to Russia,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi noted. According to him, the Armed Forces, the Security Service and all those involved in this work are making significant progress in destroying the enemy's arsenals. Particularly effective were the strikes on the caches of tactical missiles and guided aerial bombs, which the Russians use to attack Ukrainian cities and positions. The head of state emphasized the importance of supporting partners, in particular in the provision of long-range weapons, which can significantly speed up the end of the war. Ukraine continues to convince global partners of the need to provide means to protect against Russian terror. The President also noted the bravery of Ukrainian units fighting both on the front line and on enemy territory, in particular in the Kursk region of Russia. He expressed special thanks to the 46th separate airmobile brigade, the 68th Yeger brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush and the 425th separate assault battalion for their bravery in the Pokrovsky direction. Volodymyr Zelenskyy added that the next week could be decisive in the fight against Russian aggression, calling on partners to take decisive action to achieve victory and return to normal security. -Our clear strategy will be on the partners' table. With the President of the United States,- he summed up. As reported by ArmyInform, the Defense Forces of Ukraine two military arsenals and a North Korean echelon hit Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/21/prezydent-vidznachyv-uspihy-syl-oborony-u-znyshhenni-rosijskyh-arsenaliv-taktychnyh-raket-ta-kabiv/	2024-09-21T10:50:07-07:00
The Ministry of Defense plans to recruit civilian psychologists to the ranks of the Armed Forces	Acting head of the Department Valentyn Obolentseva told about the department's key plans for the coming periods. -We aim to introduce quality psychological selection at the TCC level to determine where a soldier can best prove himself and which brigades will be most suitable for his service. This will help to use human capital effectively,- said Valentina Obolentseva. It is also planned to attract civilian psychologists to the ranks of the Armed Forces. According to Valentina Obolentseva, such specialists will be retrained to work as military psychologists, after which they will be able to hold officer positions. -This is an important step to provide our units with skilled psychological support,- she added. The development of psychological support in the Armed Forces involves a combination of civilian and military practices to increase the moral and psychological stability of defenders of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense launches a pilot project of complex rehabilitation servicemen.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/21/u-minoborony-planuyut-zaluchyty-czyvilnyh-psyhologiv-do-lav-zsu/	2024-09-21T10:29:02-07:00

The prosecutor's office named who was behind the torching of military vehicles	spokesman of the Prosecutor General's Office Nadiya Maksimets told about this. According to her, there is every reason to believe that enemy special services are behind the order to set fire to the cars of servicemen and volunteers with the aim of destabilizing the internal situation in the country, especially in the frontline regions. Curators look for performers through Telegram channels and at first give an easy task, for example, to put up flyers. And then they proceed to the arson order. The vast majority of performers, about 90%, have a selfish motive - the desire for easy money. For such crimes, they offer from 700 to 3 thousand dollars. But I don't remember a case where the performer received the offered amount. Law enforcement agencies promptly respond to such cases. 196 criminal proceedings have already been initiated and 169 paliyams have been notified of suspicion. Nadiya Maksimets emphasized that prosecutors take a principled position both during the selection of a preventive measure and directly during the hearing in court, demanding the harshest punishment for committing such crimes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/21/u-prokuraturi-nazvaly-hto-stoyit-za-pidpalamy-avtivok-vijskovyh/	2024-09-21T08:44:55-07:00

Vadim Mysnyk, the spokesman of OTU -Siversk-, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- . — We constantly communicate with the local residents of Kurshchyna. The Defense Forces of Ukraine provide them, in accordance with international humanitarian law, with everything they need for their lives, including food, medicines, drugs, doctors' access to them, and so on, he said. At the same time, informational work was organized for those local residents who said they knew nothing about Russia's attack on Ukraine and the crimes of the Russian occupiers on the territory of Ukraine. — While communicating, we immediately began to explain, to show those who said that they do not know what is happening in Ukraine, what kind of war it is. They were shown photos and documentaries about what they did, what crimes were committed on our territory, the spokesman said. The reaction of the residents of Kurshchyna was different - some categorically did not believe what was shown and refused to look at the evidence of war crimes by the Russian military. - They couldn't believe it, some were in hysterics, some didn't want to watch at all. Apparently, they still knew, because they have family ties in Ukraine. Now they can't believe it, because they were completely brainwashed by propaganda, said Vadym Mysnyk. However, there are also more conscious local residents who are able to be critical of Russian propaganda, especially when it comes directly to themselves. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that more than 1,300 corrected aerial bombs have been dropped by the Russian military on the part of the Kursk region controlled by the Defense Forces of Ukraine since the beginning of the offensive operation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/21/bylysya-v-isteryczi-na-kurshhyni-misczevi-ne-poviryly-filmam-pro-zlochyny-rosiyan-v-ukrayini/	2024-09-21T08:12:27-07:00

That is why they try to constantly keep this pace. After all, this is the main direction of the enemy, where he throws significant resources,- said -Phoenix-. According to the paratrooper, in the last 2-3 days they have been using a large number of armored vehicles, which has not happened in the last month. -They use their latest tanks, BMP-3, and support all their offensives with equipment. The front line is constantly changing one way or the other,- he noted. In addition, the enemy does not have time to gain a foothold and build defensive structures, which makes it quite vulnerable. The occupiers suffer very heavy losses and do not make significant progress.

The military said that the enemy's tactics remain unchanged, so the same thing that the Russians are doing on the territory of Ukraine, they are doing in Kurshchyna. - The local residents are very surprised why the Russians are beating them so much, because, for example, yesterday, in one day, it was the Russians who dropped 21 anti-tank missiles on an area controlled by our Defense Forces.

The investigation confirmed the participation of the Russian Federation in the shelling of the Red C...	This is reported by the Office of the Prosecutor General. Under the procedural leadership of the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor's Office, a pre-trial investigation is being conducted in criminal proceedings initiated on the grounds of violation of the laws and customs of war, combined with intentional murder (Part 2 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). We will remind you that on September 12, 2024, the Russian army committed another war crime in Donetsk region. The troops of the aggressor state with barrel artillery hit 3 vehicles of the International Committee of the Red Cross in the village of Virolyubivka of Kostyantynivska MTG during the distribution of humanitarian aid. As a result of the shelling, 5 employees of the International Committee of the Red Cross were injured. Three men died immediately at the scene of the attack. Two of their colleagues suffered shrapnel wounds and mine-explosive injuries. The law enforcement officers established two places of impact of artillery shells and one place of impact of an attack UAV. Fragments of the mentioned ammunition and the remains of the unmanned aerial vehicle were removed from the scene. Based on the results of investigative actions, inspection of the scene, expert examinations and witness interviews, it was established that the artillery shelling was carried out by 2 high-explosive artillery shells of 152 mm caliber and the Lancet unmanned barrage munition, which is only in the arsenal of the Russian Armed Forces. The 152 mm projectiles were used in tandem with a drone that has a laser range finder and autonomously detects and engages the target. This not only explains the wreckage of the -Lancet- UAV found at the scene, but also indicates the deliberate nature of the attack on vehicles and personnel of the International Committee of the Red Cross, General Prosecutor Andriy Kostin noted. Taking into account the traces of damage to the surrounding buildings and cars, as well as the recorded locations of ammunition hits, the direction of the flight was determined in advance. According to the investigation, the firing positions of the artillery units were probably located in the area of ​​the village. Yagidne, Bakhmut District, Donetsk Oblast, a territory currently occupied by Russian troops. On the occupied territory, from which the shot was fired, the following are participating in the hostilities: These units are armed with artillery systems for firing 152 mm shells and Lancet attack UAVs. On September 18, 2024, with the aim of preventing similar incidents of shelling and the possible death of people during the delivery of humanitarian aid, the decision of the Defense Council of the Donetsk region introduced a ban on the movement of representatives of charitable organizations in the front-line communities of the region without the appropriate approval of the OVA. The pre-trial investigation in the criminal proceedings continues. As reported by ArmyInform, the Red Cross Office in Dnipro will suspend operations after the attack on the mission in Donetsk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/21/slidstvo-pidtverdylo-uchast-rf-v-obstrili-misiyi-chervonogo-hresta-na-donechchyni/	2024-09-21T03:50:29-07:00

In addition, one unit of special equipment, eight artillery systems and two cars of the occupier were damaged. Nineteen times the enemy attacked the positions of the Ukrainian military in the Kupyansk direction in the areas of Stepova Novoselivka, Synkivka, Stelmakhivka, Kruglyakivka and Lozova settlements. Three skirmishes are ongoing. In the Lymansky direction, the Russian invaders tried 18 times to advance near Cherneshchyna, Grekivka, Druzhelyubivka, Nevsky, Novosadovo, Terni, and Zarichny. Defenders of Ukraine repelled 17 enemy attacks, another battle continues near Druzhelyubivka. On the Siverskyi direction, our defenders successfully repelled the enemy's attack near Vyimka. With the support of assault aircraft in the Kramatorsk direction, the occupiers carried out six assault operations in the Chasovoy Yar, Ivanovsky and Bila Hora areas. The situation is under the control of units of the Defense Forces. In the direction of Toretsk, the occupiers, with the support of bomber aircraft, attacked nine times near Dachny and Toretsk. On the outskirts of Shcherbinivka, the battle is still going on. In the Pokrovsky direction, there is a high intensity of hostilities. The number of skirmishes has increased to 32. The invaders continue to attack the battle formations of the defenders of Ukraine near Zeleny Pol, Marynivka, Krasnoy Yar, Vozdvizheneka, Novotoretsk, Myrolyubivka, Grodivka, Chervonoy, Selidovy, and Novogrodivka. Our defenders repelled 30 enemy attacks, two combat clashes are still ongoing. It is the hottest today in the Novogrodivka district, where nine combat clashes took place today. The previous losses of the aggressor amounted to 264 occupiers killed and wounded, and the exchange fund was replenished with two prisoners. In addition, one tank, five artillery systems, nine units of automobiles, one unit of special and ten units of motor vehicles were destroyed. In addition, six units of automobile equipment and seven artillery systems were damaged. At this time of the day, there are 52 combat clashes in the Kurakhiv direction. The occupiers tried to advance in the areas of the settlements of Tsukuryne, Zhelanne Pershe, Georgiivka, Dalnye, Oleksandrivka, Katerynivka and Kostyantynivka. 44 attacks have been repelled, eight more are still ongoing. Today, the aggressor stormed the front edge of the defense in the areas of Vugledar, Prechistivka and Bogoyavlenka 12 times in the Vremivsk direction with the support of aviation. Two enemy attacks are still ongoing. Today, the aggressor tried six times to break through the defenses of our defenders near Malaya Tokmachka, Lobkovo and Novodanilivka in the Orihiv direction. In the Dnieper direction, three enemy attempts to seize the positions of our soldiers failed. Ukrainian defenders are confidently holding back the onslaught of the Russian occupation forces. Today, it is worth noting the soldiers of the 25th separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade, the 110th separate mechanized brigade named after Colonel-General Mark Bezruchka, and the 13th operational brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, who courageously hold their positions, skillfully repulse enemy attacks, effectively use means of fire damage against manpower and equipment, causing significant losses to the occupiers. As reported by ArmyInform, a third of all enemy attacks fell on the Kurakhiv direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/21/vorog-zastosuvav-67-kabiv-ta-majzhe-700-droniv-kamikadze-genshtab-zsu/	2024-09-20T21:02:44-07:00
A wild boar was released on a minefield: Germany introduced an armored vehicle for neutralizing infe...	As informs the official portal of the manufacturing company, at the military training ground in Bergen, Germany, representatives of this well-known company, in particular, in the Armed Forces, conducted a practical demonstration of the capabilities of its new highly protected armored demining vehicle Keiler NG, ArmiyaInform reports. More than 100 military and defense industry representatives from different countries attended the event. Keiler NG cleared the site at a speed of up to 250 meters per minute. Keiler NG, which means -wild boar-, is based on the chassis of the Kodiak armored engineering vehicle, and therefore belongs to the Leopard 2 family of tanks, which are detailed our agency told. This use of a well-known platform makes it possible to reduce logistics costs. The main tool of the machine is a Pearson mine plow more than 4 meters wide and with a speed of 250 meters per minute on loose soil. The machine is also equipped with the Plofadder remote demining system from the Rheinmetall division of South Africa Denel Munition, which works similarly to MICLIC. It allows making passages 160 meters long and 9 meters wide. As noted defense market researchers from IKK Defense Express, an important feature of the machine is the possibility of its transformation into a remote controlled drone An interesting feature is the ability to quickly convert the machine: instead of a plow, a bulldozer blade can be installed, which gives the Keiler NG additional options for clearing anti-tank obstacles, filling trenches and creating fortifications. Reviewers from the European Security and Defense portal write that the demonstration of the Plofadder detonating cord system, developed by the Rheinmetall Denel Munition company, attracted special attention. Two Plofadder systems on one Keiler NG can effectively deal with even deep mine barriers. According to Rheinmetall, Plofadder destroys 90-95% of the mines along the way, while those that remain will be degraded. Once launched, the Keiler NG will advance along the path, plowing through the terrain softened by the explosion. The Keiler NG is also equipped with a second-generation demining duplicating magnetic signature device in front of the plow, which greatly improves demining safety. The Pearson Pathfinder Clear Lane Marking System is installed to mark the safe area behind the machine. She installs special pennants, visible both at night and during the day, as the car moves forward. Rheinmetall Denel Munitions explosive charges are placed in the upper rear of the hull. An engineering crane with a hydraulic drive is installed in the center of the case. It can be used, in particular, to quickly replace a mine plow with a bulldozer dump, and if necessary, remove any obstacle. For remote activation of electronic mines, the machine uses a special magnetic complex. Despite the weight of 63 tons, the Keiler NG develops a speed of 65 km/h, can overcome obstacles 90 cm high, overcome slopes of 60% and cross trenches more than 2.50 m wide. The Keiler NG crew consists of two people, the workplaces of both soldiers are located on the left side of the car. To strengthen the protection in the center and on the sides of the machine, additional reservation is installed. At the request of the customer, active protection complexes can be installed on the car. For self-defense, the Keiler NG is equipped with a ROSY rapid cloaking system and a Natter remote-controlled weapon station with a 12.7 mm machine gun. In addition, the concept of the machine provides for the possibility of remote deployment and installation of active protection, which makes it maximally adaptable to different combat conditions. Basic characteristics: Plofadder detonating cord system: In the future, after passing all the tests, the new mine defuser should replace the obsolete Keiler, created on the basis of the M48 tank. It is also being considered to equip it with an active protection system and a sophisticated interface for digital operations. Rheinmetall improves its combat vehicle fleet with the next generation Keiler armored vehicle.

-Vkyd- for more than five million: the Russian Federation wants to repeat the tragedy of Okhmatdyt	The Countering Disinformation Center reminds that this may indicate that the enemy is preparing another terrorist attack on civilians the projects The author of the fake is the foreign intelligence service of the aggressor country. It is her statement that Ukraine is allegedly preparing -a staging of a Russian missile attack on a children's institution- -at the behest- of the United States, which is being spread by propaganda resources of the Russian Federation. Such -throw-ins- by the Russians have nothing to do with reality and may indicate that the enemy is preparing another attack on civilian objects. Ukrainians have had the opportunity to see this more than once. With such actions, the enemy is trying to sow panic among Ukrainians, bring division and distrust into our society, and justify their own crimes. After all, Russia tries to blame Ukraine for all war crimes committed by its own army without exception. Thus, Russian propaganda stubbornly calls the mass killings of civilians in Buch and other Ukrainian cities that were under occupation a -provocation and staging-, and the rocket attack on the -Okhmatdyt- children's hospital a -hit by an anti-missile missile of the Kyiv Air Defense Forces-. Don't let the enemy mislead you.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/21/vkyd-na-ponad-pyat-miljoniv-rf-hoche-povtoryty-tragediyu-ohmatdytu/	2024-09-20T20:37:09-07:00
-We were just landing and throwing grenades-: how -Tokha- and -Dobry- captured the Russians	— He was the -three hundredth- at our platoon base&#8230; The enemy in that area entered between the positions, we were not told their exact number. As if they saw five. Therefore, in the morning we were assigned the task of going in to clear (landing. - Ed.) and pick up the wounded man, he could not walk, - recalls the soldier with the call sign -Good-. According to the words of serviceman Anton, he and -Dobry- in the -two- then went ahead with the landing: - We were clearing, and there were a lot of -beds-, positions. We just moved along the landing and threw grenades, because the landing was very dense: the leaves constantly shimmered when the sun broke through. It seemed that someone was sitting behind every bush. We fired, threw grenades, and moved as fast as we could to capture part of the landing. - -Toha- (Anton. - Ed.) says: -Do you see the enemy? Shove him.- The enemy then realized that it would not be very successful to fight with us, -Dobry- notes. Anton adds that the enemy was really confused: - Besides, they had no reinforcements. When I ran out and saw them, they just raised their hands. The only thing they kept shouting was -don't kill, don't kill!- -Dobry- clarifies that they were confronted by four Russians: - And the fifth escaped from them at night. The captives said that he threw the machine gun down the road to the position. As Anton points out, it was clear from the Russians that they did not really want to fight: - I understood that they had reached this landing and were waiting for reinforcements, because they did not understand where to go next. During the time they talked, they said that they were abandoned and forced to come here. They said that they have no use here at all. Although, according to the documents, there were also contract workers from 2018. Maybe the actors are good. The question arose, how to tie them, because I didn't have any tape or anything. I saw that one of them had a tourniquet on his bulletproof vest. He tied it with him&#8230; In the end, four were captured and very quickly took their fellow, the -three hundredth-, who was waiting for us. Anton says that the adventures did not end there. When the wounded man was brought to the evacuation point, the enemy noticed the car that was supposed to pick up our soldiers. — And the mortar shelling began. It was very hot, a -120- flew nearby and hit the car and the driver with the call sign -Timoha-. We very quickly jumped into the pickup truck and at a speed of 140 kilometers per hour we flew in the trunk across the field under heavy fire, Anton recalls. -Good- confirmed that our wounded man survived and is now in the hospital.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/21/my-prosto-jshly-posadkoyu-j-kydaly-granaty-yak-toha-i-dobryj-rosiyan-u-polon-vzyaly/	2024-09-20T20:30:23-07:00
-Queen- from an RPG: how an FPV drone is taught to fire a grenade launcher. Experience of the unit -...	His responsibilities included the practical implementation of ideas and their direct technical implementation. Now he directs all his experience to the effective destruction of the enemy. An ArmyInform correspondent visited the -Bulava- strike drone unit, which was created on the initiative of the drones themselves in February 2023, and saw with her own eyes a new development - the -Queen of Hornets- drone, armed with a hand-held anti-tank grenade launcher. — We do a dark thing for a bright purpose. Most of us grew up on futuristic movies, Terminator is the same. And here is the year 2024 - an iron bird is flying, squealing from the air, - says the warrior. The work of the unit requires ingenuity, perseverance and imagination. And in this creative process there is an important goal - to use every opportunity where you can risk the life of a drone, and not the life of a person. Almost the entire team has infantry experience. These guys know from their own experience what defense in the trenches is like, and they deeply value the lives of their fellows. — The drone does not cost much. In any comparison. No matter how cynical it may sound, everything in war has its own price - a tank shot, a drone, a soldier's life. And I would like those who do not let it all pass through their hearts as much as we do, at least from a financial point of view - to lose a drone is cheaper than to lose a person, - says -Boas-. Discussion of that , how to try to shoot with a drone from a hand-held anti-tank grenade launcher, started in the unit a year ago. Everything rested on a platform capable of carrying the required weight, maneuverable and suitable for the price/quality ratio. — We had agricultural drones, but it was not so easy to set the right angle for them. Even if you are a super pilot, the risks of losing a drone are high, and this is a very expensive story. And then the -Queen of Hornets- appeared, which opened up a lot of possibilities. The idea has been in my head for a long time, and not only with us. We just took it and tried it, - says the fighter and adds: - The important point is that no one interfered with us. Ideas, developments, implementation. When your eyes are burning and you don't put sticks in your wheels, then there will be efficiency. -Queen of Hornets- is the largest Ukrainian FPV drone already in use on the battlefield. It was developed at the request of K-2 battalion commander Kirill Veres to create a relatively cheap and affordable FPV bomber. Due to its high carrying capacity, the drone can perform a number of tasks, in particular, increasing the range of other FPV drones by 25 km. The trigger mechanism for the RPG drone was developed by Serhiy, who has been designing UAVs since 2015. For a long time, he made drones for the front as a volunteer, and then he came to the unit as a soldier. - Our first dialogue was: -Oh, finally I see who assembled the same drones in the kitchen- - -Yes!- . I say: -Believe me, you'll stay here for a week and you'll see that the possibilities for creativity are unlimited,- Udav remembers their meeting with a smile. , in addition to the drone, assemble the jet installation. Colleagues kindly joke about the fact that sometimes an engineer finds an unexpected practical application for things that others would have left in the landfill. From the next room of the secret -creative center-, the duty watchers watch the course of events on monitors. at the front, how crews work. They identify problems in time and participate in the search for solutions. — You can get in touch quickly — wait, it's not like that, or don't fly there, because there is a EW. If, for example, we see that there is a large consumption of BC in the first half hour, then, without waiting for the command, we already pack — and in an hour the additional stock is ready. It's all by itself, by feel. As one organism. Time is very important in war. Roughly speaking, the problem has not yet been announced, but it is already being solved. This is experience, interaction, the full involvement of everyone and the desire to work for the result, - says -Udav-. Regarding the discussions about unified and non-unified components, the guys say that it is two in one - tasks and conditions for their constant fulfillment change, flexibility is needed. Each such unit must have a workshop and specialists capable of reworking the standard BC. — The factory line is unified, it goes without saying, but for specific tasks that may require solutions on the spot, there must be a workshop and SVP engineers. By the way, such a VOS exists, and our specialists are worth their weight in gold. The boys are mostly all self-taught. They traveled to the experienced grandfathers and learned. Any innovative development, in order to be scaled at the state level, must go through the seven circles of hell. The device is clumsy, so a lot hangs on such creative hubs. The power is in making it all work. Both above and below. Then there is a chance to effectively confront the enemy, - says -Uvad-. The pilots in the team are different - there are those who clearly make resets, there are those who -hit- (hit with FPV drones) masterfully at a moving target , feels the wind. On the day of training, we all felt the wind - the gusts knocked us off our feet, even though we were in -armor-. Usually they don't fly in this weather, but the guys said that the -Queen- will handle it. The pilot with the call sign -Skif- shot back and landed the bird near us, maneuvering between gusts of wind. As for the tactics of use, the creators of the flying RPG see it as effective in urban battles, supporting assaults and finishing off equipment. — When the drone returns, it takes less than two minutes to equip it. Taking into account the range, recharging, it's all very fast and convenient. When the situation is such that in one front room it is ours, and in the other it is ****, then it is possible to give people the opportunity to move away, take cover, sneak into the floor where the enemy has planted. Udav dreams that during drones with RPGs and assault rifles became the cover group for the assault. — Do you often come forward to shoot back when several of these are maneuvering around you? Let them hit aimlessly, but they will make them lie down. Or -rolling- goes, you stop it by various means. The equipment remains battered, but not destroyed. It takes several FPV flights to finish it off. You can spend 5 -birds-. And here such a repeated story can come in handy. When asked about criticism, -Udav- says with a smile that no development can do without it. Both a critical view and certain discussions are part of the process of improving anything. And already during constant combat use, new questions and new solutions will arise. He reminds that at the beginning of the use of FPV drones there was also a lot of criticism, and many points were changed and honed already in practical work. > — At one time, we began to waste time not because of a good life, but because we had few drones, and a lot of enemy equipment was in position. It was necessary to somehow stop them, scare them away from the infantry. In the summer of 2023, there was one position where, roughly speaking, there were 5 drones for one and a half pilots, and we were able to stop 12 pieces of equipment. Yes, we did not destroy them all. Rather, they were driven away from us by skid steers with a wheel mechanism. Not all self-propelled guns worked, but speed and skill did their job. We saved the lives of the infantrymen, - recalls -Udav-. We decided not to discuss the details of the constructive solutions, although the engineers state that absolutely everything we invent, the enemy will repeat in one way or another. — This is not a super closed technology. All components are easy to get. Both they and we have been doing this for years. The once narrow circle of amateurs and specialists has now become wide. I read their posts as much as they read ours. They have their own progress and their own troubles. Of course, there will be copying. No matter how vile the enemy, we must remember that they are not morons. They are better at scaling effective products. The same FPV. We were the first. Instead, they were filled with them at some point so that they all flew, it was clear that they did not regret it, as if from a conveyor belt. But they are less flexible than we are. This is my vision, - says -Boad-. The boys laugh - if you give them a notebook and a pen, not all of the virtuoso pilots will pass the theory easily, although they can do miracles with their hands. The unit is actively sending soldiers to pass exams for the flight VOS, so let's touch on a sore topic. In the military, there are situations when those who have been flying for more than a year have a bunch of confirmed damage to enemy equipment, awards, and the VOS is still the hundredth and the position is not related to the actual type of tasks. We regularly have to hear stories when some commanders send such specialists to -zero- as shooters. Which again raises the problem to the outside — in areas where there should be an effective system, the human factor dominates. - Everything is clear with us. The sector of responsibility is given. We are going on a reconnaissance. We choose where we can work effectively. Specialists are valued, promotion of self-improvement is maximum. For this to happen, there must be healthy vertical communication, the willingness of staff officers to learn the art of war, and we have been lucky with that. Well, the backbone of the unit is volunteers from February 2022, motivated. It happened differently, but we made our way to it, - the fighters say about their work. - We are open to other divisions to share experiences, we are interested in seeing this develop. Maybe someone will come up with something else. Maybe better. We will only be glad, - adds -Boa-.

They were surprised - two occupiers disguised themselves as a pile of shit and tried to attack	The video appeared on September 20 on the brigade channel. It shows how two occupiers crawled under the camouflage net, took with them a EW and in this form crawled across the field to our positions. As long as our pilots were able to suppress their surprise and laughter, the Russians were able to get very close, but the disappointing end of their plan was the hit of the reset. After that, the invaders went about their usual business: they died long and painfully. -They adapt, trick, try their best, but everything fails. Is it a robot? Dog? Or maybe a saboteur? No! This is a Russian occupier!-, the brigade commented on the video.

More than a thousand shots and each one hit the target - the story of a locksmith who became a gunsm...	The report about the soldier was released on September 20 on the Airborne Assault Forces channel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -These were fierce battles, the Russian infantry, under the cover of a tank, started moving towards our units. I was brought up. Shot. Then another one. The first was stopped, the second was completely destroyed. When I looked at my calculations, it turned out that that shot was the anniversary, the thousandth shot,- Mudryi said. According to him, he has been counting the number of his shots since the beginning of his service. At first I wanted to count only effective ones, but then it turned out that the professionalism of the crew allows almost every shot to be effective. -I am a contractor. He deliberately joined the army in 2021. I passed the basic general military training, special training, coordination, and I met the -big war- trained and with a fully formed team that knew what to do. That is why my crew has thousands of tons of burned Russian iron and a considerable amount of enemy infantry,- Mudry assured. Before serving in the Armed Forces, he worked as a locksmith at one of the Zaporizhzhia factories. -If I hadn't left in 2021, I would certainly have joined the ranks of the Armed Forces in 2024. I don't understand why men sit at home and watch how p..ors (Russians of Putin's orientation, - ed.) destroy everything in their path, how they kill people are mocked. This is not the norm. This needs to be countered and countered as a group. Now part of my native Zaporizhzhia region is under occupation, so I understand very well why and for whom I am here now,- Mudryi said. His parents are waiting for him at home. The elder brother, as well as Mudry, is in the ranks of the 25th brigade. And almost all friends and relatives. There are no dodgers among relatives. -And for those who are hiding, who are trying to overstay, and especially for those who are -not my war-, I want to explain! Realize that there is a war in the country. You will either voluntarily join the army, or you will wake up one morning as Russian slaves. For now, you have this choice — to stand side by side with us and drive the enemy beyond the borders of our country. So don't wait! Join in!-, urged the Wise.

The Office of Defense Innovations of the EU - Rustem Umyerov - was opened in Ukraine	About this the head of the defense department announced on his Facebook page. -This is a new stage in our relations with the European Union in the field of defense technologies,- Rustem Umyerov emphasized. The main focus of this cooperation is to combine efforts to strengthen defense capabilities. Special attention is paid to joint developments in the field of IT and weapons production, which will be decisive for defeating Russian aggression. Strengthening the technological capabilities of Ukraine, the IT coalition has already attracted more than 70 million euros from 13 participating countries, creating a secure IT infrastructure for the Defense Forces. -Our drone coalition, which includes 16 participating countries, has provided more than 500 million euros in funding and transferred thousands of drones to Ukraine,- Rustem Umyerov said. The minister emphasized that over the past 2.5 years, Ukraine has rapidly become a world leader in drone technology.

The Akhmat subdivision was transferred to Kharkiv Oblast: what does this indicate?	About this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon told the commander of the battalion of shock air defense systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault Captain Yury Fedorenko of the brigade named after Ivan Sirk, the basket captain. — On the Kharkiv section, the enemy transferred units such as -Ahmat-. When does -ahmat- come? -Akhmat- comes in when it is necessary to put everyone — cooks, technicians, and so on — into service in the Russian occupation forces, he said. The military explained that the -Akhmatians- have the actual permission and ability to take any action against servicemen of all other units of the Russian occupation forces with the aim of forcing them to unquestioningly obey all command orders, no matter how absurd or dangerous they may be. - They impose discipline, punish physically, send them into battle in case of non-fulfillment of tasks and end the life of the Russian occupier by firing squad, can beat them with sticks and many other things, - Yuriy Fedorenko explained. He emphasized that this shows that the enemy does not give up its initial intentions and will try to complete the task at any cost. -If we talk about Hlyboke, this is the maximum approach to the administrative borders of the city of Kharkiv, and accordingly, in one way or another, they will increase the ability to conduct shock and assault operations with the aim of advancing to the city of Kharkiv itself,- said the Achilles commander. The plans of the occupiers in Vovchansk also remain unchanged - they consist in the complete capture of the ruins of the city, which was practically wiped off the face of the earth by enemy artillery and aviation. — On the Kupyan section, the enemy is more active, they use a significant amount of manpower and equipment. Aviation with guided air bombs is used very intensively, the officer said. Here the enemy rushes to the left bank of the Oskil River. — It is fundamentally important for them to occupy a bridgehead there with its further expansion and, as a result, the occupation of the Left Bank of Kupyanshchyna. But at the moment, the Defense Forces managed to significantly stop the advance of the enemy, Yuriy Fedorenko said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the enemy dropped an aerial bomb on Kup. Yanshchyna: two people died.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/pidrozdil-ahmat-perekynuly-na-harkivshhynu-pro-shho-cze-svidchyt/	2024-09-20T10:29:37-07:00

The Kadyriv commander was convicted of brutal treatment of civilians during the occupation of Kyiv r...	This was reported by the Office of the Prosecutor General. The verdict of the Borodyansky district court of the Kyiv region sentenced the commander of the unified detachment of -Kadyrivtsi- to 11 years of imprisonment. Prosecutors proved in court that the convicted person participated in the attack of the aggressor state on Kyiv in February-March 2022. During the occupation of a part of the Kyiv region, together with his subordinate unit, he attacked a civilian object — the Borodyansky psychoneurological boarding school with a geriatric department. The civilian population was there, including the elderly, people with disabilities who need constant care. After searching the premises of the boarding school and making sure that there were no Ukrainian soldiers, the convict forced the director of the boarding school at gunpoint to give a videotaped testimony of gratitude to the President of the Russian Federation for the alleged release from the Nazi regime. Under the threat of death, the commander of the -Kadyrivets- forbade civilians to leave the premises of the boarding school. At the same time, contrary to the requirements of international humanitarian law, he did not take any measures to provide the civilian population of the medical facility with food, water, medicine, and heating equipment. Because of this, several wards of the boarding school died. In addition, after forbidding the staff and patients to leave the premises of the boarding school, the convict used civilians as human shields, since combat equipment was placed near the institution - the BM-21 -Grad- rocket salvo fire system, a self-propelled artillery installation, from which fire damage was carried out on the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The trial was conducted according to the rules of special court proceedings.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/komandyra-kadyrivcziv-zasudzheno-za-zhorstoke-povodzhennya-z-czyvilnymy-pid-chas-okupacziyi-kyyivshhyny/	2024-09-20T04:03:58-07:00

To obtain intelligence, the occupiers recruited a 22-year-old demobilized conscript who had previously served in one of the military garrisons of Ukraine. The young man came to the attention of the military intelligence of the Russian Federation through his parents, who live in the temporarily captured part of the territory of the Zaporizhzhia region and cooperate with the Russian special service. In May of this year, he retired to the reserve and settled in the regional center. Later, a personnel employee of the 316th Intelligence Center of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (better known as the game) based in Sevastopol approached him remotely. The identity of the occupier has already been established by SBU employees. -At first, the enemy intelligence officer requested from his agent the coordinates of the combat units and logistics warehouses of the military unit in which the former conscript was serving. Then, on the instructions of the Russian army, the traitor began to go around the front-line city, where he secretly recorded the locations of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the bridges through which they move in the direction of the front line,- the SBU said. &nbsp; The enemy planned to use the intelligence to prepare strikes against the Defense Forces using guided aerial bombs, kamikaze drones and heavy artillery. The security service acted in advance and arrested the agent -in the act- when he was conducting reconnaissance near a military facility. At the scene, a mobile phone was seized from the detainee, which he used to communicate with his Russian curator. On the basis of the received evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed the detainee of the suspicion under Part 2 of Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The perpetrator is in custody. He faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property. As ArmiyaInform reported, the Security Service detained an agent of the Russian military intelligence in Kharkiv. The intruder was correcting Russian rocket-bomb attacks on the front-line city and nearby territories.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/u-zaporizhzhi-zatrymaly-demobilizovanogo-strokovyka-zsu-yakyj-pochav-praczyuvaty-na-rozvidku-rf/	2024-09-20T00:49:30-07:00

Broke the enemy's plans: a paratrooper held a position in Kurshchyna for a day alone	The story of a brave warrior was published by the command of the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Five of us entered the position, but after a while only three remained - two fighters had to withdraw to another position, and at dawn the attack began,- says machine gunner Volodymyr. It was very hot, because the enemy -poured- everything - heavy infantry weapons and artillery. Enemy drones hung in the sky almost constantly, some of which were conducting reconnaissance and adjusting fire, and others were dropping ammunition on the defenders of the position. -I saw how my brother suddenly bent down. I started calling him, but he didn't move. Later, he realized that his comrade was already dead, because a bullet or shrapnel had hit him in the head. And in a few minutes, the commander of the position was wounded, so he had to be urgently evacuated,- the machine gunner recalls. Volodymyr held the position himself for almost a day. As soon as the enemy's infantry started to move, they immediately opened fire, and the infantrymen were forced to retreat to their starting positions. Later, their own broke through to Volodymyr. Now he is sure that his faith helped him to persevere. -I am a person of faith, so I prayed that God would help me pass this test. And I also did what I had been taught for so long — I destroyed the hated enemy with my machine gun, carrying out the given order,- the fighter states. Earlier, ArmiyaInform told a story about a chef from the Russian Armed Forces, who turns burnt tanks into -candies-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/zlamav-plany-voroga-desantnyk-dobu-samotuzhky-trymav-pozycziyu-na-kurshhyni/	2024-09-20T00:09:18-07:00

-Wings- with artificial intelligence: automatically bringing the enemy to destruction should be scal...	About this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- told the commander of the BPAK shock battalion -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket captain Ivan Sirk, captain Yuriy Fedorenko. — The state of Ukraine has made extremely strong progress in terms of the development, production and combat use of a number of drones, in particular the long-range -wing- type, he said. The military said that it is gradually possible to saturate Ukrainian units with such UAVs along the entire line of combat. — At the beginning of 2023, these tools were used exclusively by individual divisions. It was effective enough, but not as intense as the demands of the front required. Corresponding improvements were made, and most units of the Defense Forces today effectively use wing-type strike weapons, the Achilles commander said. He explained the benefits of AI-equipped drones. - Equipping with artificial intelligence - automatic proofing in this case - makes it possible to bypass the enemy's electronic warfare and, when capturing the target, enter it clearly. In this way, the effectiveness of the application increases many times, the officer said. He emphasized that such UAVs make it possible to destroy valuable enemy equipment, the loss of which not only costs the occupiers financially, but also critically undermines their combat capabilities. This deprives the occupiers of forces and means to conduct hostilities and, accordingly, helps save the lives of Ukrainian defenders. — They preserve life, give the opportunity to knock out, in particular, the enemy's anti-aircraft defenses. This is extremely important, because the less the enemy has anti-aircraft means, the more opportunities for our intelligence to fly further, said the military. Thanks to this, it is possible to detect the enemy on the distant approaches to his advanced positions in the deep rear. — The more we destroy the enemy in the areas of their accumulation, the less of them will reach the front line. These -wings- objectively make it possible to perform such a task at the expense of destroying anti-aircraft defenses, the commander of the Ukrainian drones explained. He noted that in this way it is possible to effectively destroy the occupiers, including across the line of the state border of Ukraine on the territory of the Russian Federation. ArmyInform previously reported that syurpryzy/->Ukrainian drones promise the enemy new unpleasant surprises for him already in the spring of next year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/kryla-zi-shtuchnym-intelektom-avtomatychne-dovedennya-voroga-do-znyshhennya-slid-masshtabuvaty/	2024-09-19T23:57:15-07:00
Where and how buffer zones have already been created: foreign experience	What are buffer zones, how they were used during conflicts between other countries and whether they can guarantee security, ArmiyaInform tells. Zones created with the purpose of separating one territory from another are called buffer zones. In international relations, they are most often represented in the form of demilitarized zones. This is done with the sole purpose of stopping the killings and the possibility of striking neighboring territories. This practice is not new. Yes, after a series of wars, or as they were shamefully called in the international community, conflicts, such zones were created. On July 27, 1953, North and South Korea signed an armistice agreement and established a demilitarized zone along the entire border (248 km), 2 km wide on each side. On both sides of the zone there are minefields and there are significant groups of troops. On May 31, 1974, after the October 1973 war, better known as Doomsday War, a UN Security Council resolution created a 75 km long demilitarized zone near the Golan Heights between Israel and Syria. The UN mission monitors the territory's buffer status to this day. On August 16, 1974, after the end of hostilities between Cyprus and Turkey, a UN Security Council decision created a buffer zone 180 km long and up to 7 km wide, separating the Republic of Cyprus from the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The UN mission monitors the ceasefire regime. On March 26, 1979, Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty, according to which the Sinai Peninsula became a buffer zone where the deployment of armed forces was limited. On April 3, 1991, following Operation Desert Storm, the UN Security Council established a demilitarized zone along the border between Iraq and Kuwait. The zone is surrounded by barbed wire and is 200 km long. Until 2003, a UN mission was stationed in this zone. So, as we can see, the creation of such zones in some cases managed to stop the bloodshed. At one time, Israel was able to establish silence on the northern border for a while. It was in the 1980s, after the so-called First Lebanon War in 1982. In the late 1970s, the north of Israel became the target of continuous Palestinian terrorist attacks. Palestinian terrorists who infiltrated from the territory of Lebanon committed large-scale terrorist attacks in Israel - taking hostages and killing 21 schoolchildren in Maalota, an attack on bus passengers on the Tel Aviv - Haifa highway, which led to the killing of 38 Israelis. From the territory of Lebanon, the Palestinians, using MLRS received from the USSR, continuously bombarded the northern regions of Israel. An independent terrorist -republic- emerged on the territory of Lebanon, which is directly adjacent to the Israeli border, and was named after the main Palestinian terrorist organization -Fatahland-. Terrorist leader Yasser Arafat took advantage of the civil war in Lebanon and effectively seized power in the border areas. Tens of thousands of terrorists were concentrated in Arafat's territory of Lebanon, in numerous camps and training centers gang formations continued to be trained for further attacks on Israel, huge arsenals were created. Arming, training and political cover for Arafat's terrorists was led by the USSR. The Kremlin hoped, with the help of Arafat, to expand its influence in the Arab world, which was greatly shaken after the total defeat of the satellites of the USSR - Syria and Egypt in the wars of 1967 and 1973, and therefore did not skimp: a stream of Soviet weapons went to the Palestinians: tanks, artillery, small arms. According to the German magazine Spiegel, the Soviet weapons received by the Palestinians would be enough to arm a 500,000-strong army. The chief military advisor to the Syrian Defense Minister was Colonel-General Hryhoriy Yashkin, who arrived in Syria from the position of Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. Thousands of Soviet officers were at all levels of command of the Syrian troops, from batteries and companies to the Syrian Ministry of Defense. Syrian troops under the command of Soviet military advisers occupied strategically important areas of Lebanon. The final straw that broke Israel's patience was the assassination of Israeli ambassador to Great Britain, Shlomo Argov, by Palestinian terrorists on June 3, 1982, after which he miraculously survived but was left disabled. -Shlom al-Galil- (Peace of Galilee) - that's how the General Staff of the IDF called the operation of Israeli forces in Lebanon, which began on June 6, 1982. During the lightning operation of the Israeli Air Force, almost all Soviet air defense systems and dozens of aircraft were destroyed. The ground operation also achieved its goal. The Israeli victory also marked the technical backwardness of Soviet weapons, which were significantly inferior to Israeli and American weapons, as well as combat technologies, and, in addition, showed all the viciousness of Soviet air warfare tactics and the construction of air defense systems. After the end of hostilities, a certain strip of South Lebanon remained under Israeli control - the IDF (Israel Defense Forces - Author) retained control over a 19-kilometer (12-mile) buffer zone, which was held, in particular, with the help of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA). In 1985, Hezbollah, a Lebanese radical Shiite movement sponsored by Iran, called for an armed struggle to end Israel's occupation of Lebanese territory. When the civil war in Lebanon ended and other rival groups agreed to disarm, Hezbollah refused to do so. Fighting with Hezbollah weakened Israel's resolve and led to the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon in 2000. But the truce did not last long - in 2006, the Second Lebanon War began, after which Hezbollah suffered significant losses, and the border was quiet for a while. But now, after the operation in Gaza, launched in October 2023 on the northern border, shelling continues again. Since the escalation of the conflict, more than 60,000 people have been evacuated from Israeli border towns and settlements inland. According to the data of the international organization Organization for Migration, which keeps records of migration flows in the world, approximately 90,000 residents from the Lebanese side left their homes in the south of the country. Hezbollah began using Burkan missiles against Israel, which can carry up to 500 kilograms of explosives and have a range of 800 to 1,200 kilometers, depending on the modification. According to many analysts, another war is only a matter of time. So, as we can see, the creation of buffer zones does not always guarantee safety.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/de-ta-yak-uzhe-stvoryuvalysya-buferni-zony-inozemnyj-dosvid/	2024-09-19T23:44:20-07:00

NATO anti-drone training: Ukraine took part for the first time	This was reported by the NATO press service. From September 10 to 20, more than 450 participants from 19 NATO member states and three partner countries gathered in the Netherlands to test the ability of commercially available counter-drone systems to work together. During NATO's annual C-UAS Technical Interoperability Exercise, more than 60 counter-drone systems and technologies, such as sensors, drone guidance systems, jammers and cyber interceptors, were tested in real-world conditions. Ukraine's first active participation in these exercises is part of the Ukraine-NATO Innovative Cooperation Roadmap, approved by the leaders of the Alliance countries and Ukraine at the Washington Summit. -Exercises such as C-UAS TIE provide a unique opportunity to jointly address pressing issues such as the autonomy and interoperability of drones, as well as to study Ukraine's combat experience in combating small unmanned aerial vehicles,- the statement said. The integration of counter-drone technologies into NATO's Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) is essential to strengthening the Alliance's deterrence and defense capabilities. At the 2024 Washington Summit, Allies took steps to further improve the readiness, response and integration of NATO's IAMD and agreed to support the development and implementation of an integrated air and missile defense architecture for Ukraine. As ArmiyaInform reported, the chiefs of general staffs of the armed forces of NATO countries held a meeting in Prague on September 13-15 to implement the decisions of the Washington Summit and discuss how The Alliance will strengthen deterrence and defense while increasing support for Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/navchannya-nato-z-protydiyi-bezpilotnykam-ukrayina-vpershe-vzyala-uchast/	2024-09-19T20:47:38-07:00
The enemy's factory of fakes has been exposed: what the enemy is lying about	Media workers received a leak of internal documents of the -Social Design Agency-, which works on behalf of the administration of the President of the Russian Federation and created almost 40,000 units of fake content in 4 months of 2024. Serhiy Kiriyenko, the first deputy head of the administration of the President of Russia, is called the curator of the agency's activities. Among the fake documents, in particular, a document allegedly from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was found: the order of the Deputy Ministry of Defense N. Kalmykova to the heads of units and departments of the Armed Forces not to confirm - information about the presence of prisoners of war for exchange on board- Il-76, which crashed in the Belgorod region of Russia in January 2024, and fake quotes from representatives of the IOU about the -insignificance of these losses-. The purpose of these fakes, according to the accompanying documents, is to accuse the Ukrainian military leadership of censorship and concealment of the truth about the disaster. In fact, the Il-76 was transporting S-300 missiles, which Russia uses to fire at Ukraine. And Russia used this incident to sow discontent among Ukrainians and undermine Western aid to our country. Also, in the -register of fakes and falsehoods- there is a forgery of the alleged order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi equating the capture of military personnel with treason . The purpose of this fake, as stated in the description of the task of the Russian agency, is -discrediting the military-political leadership of Ukraine and demoralizing the Armed Forces of Ukraine-. In addition, among the agency's -accomplished tasks- are fake quotes from Oleksandr Syrskyi, manipulation of the population points and regions from which the fighters of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are allegedly called up the most. To split Ukrainian society, the Kremlin fakers actively used the difficult relationship between Volodymyr Zelenskyi and his predecessor Poroshenko, the mayor of Kyiv Klitschko, as well as the former commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Zaluzhny. span> For according to the editor and presenter of Radio Liberty's -Schemes- project Nataliya Sedletska, this investigation is unique in that it exposes and documents in detail how thousands of fakes about the war in Ukraine were created, aimed both at Western audiences states, as well as Ukrainians. Some of them were shared by influential people and were even taken seriously.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/vykryto-vorozhu-fabryku-fejkiv-rf-pro-shho-breshe-vorog/	2024-09-19T20:19:43-07:00
What awaits Ukraine in winter: an expert on the Kremlin's missile and drone terror	Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmiyaInform about this: -In a strategic sense, I do not think that this winter will be anything unique in terms of tactics from the Russians, especially missile and drone attacks. Yes, they somewhat managed to raise the total number of missile strikes. The last missile salvo by the enemy, which took place in August, was 127 missiles. I will decipher it, why you should not look in the direction of some absolute disaster, because they say that this is the biggest blow. Yes, he is the biggest. The previous one was in December of last year and had 102 missiles then. That is, they raised (rocket volley — Ed.) to 25 rockets. But if you take a calculator and multiply the carriers with which they can strike, then they have at least 20 Tu-95MS aircraft. And they can take on board up to eight Kh-101 missiles, so we already have 80 missiles. The Russian Federation has up to ten missile carriers of various classes in the Black Sea. For example, small missile ships of the type -Buyan-M-, -Karakurt- and the patrol ship -Vasiliy Bykov- are equipped with Kalibr missile systems. The Russians also have two more operational frigates of the Admiral Gorshkov type. Each carrier ship can carry eight missiles. If we add missiles from Tu-95 aircraft and ships, then we already have up to 160 missiles. Of course, there are also Iskander-M launchers and S-300 complexes, which the enemy has switched to surface-to-surface mode of operation. Let's add the coastal missile complexes -Bastion- and -Val-, etc. That is, if you put everything together, the enemy theoretically should have, well, at least 300-400 missiles. And what is not? And it won't. Why? The occupiers are at the highest point of missile production. Since they started somewhere in the middle of 2023 to produce 120-130 missiles per month, a maximum of 140, they are standing still. They cannot produce more. Indeed, in August of this year, the use of an abnormal number of Shahed drones, almost 800, was recorded. But even for this indicator, they will no longer come out. That is, as these last volleys took place, so they will continue to be. The hit rate on our side for -shaheeds- sometimes even reaches 100%, for rockets varies from 85 to 95 percent. These are very high figures. Good news for us. If until the middle of last summer, even autumn, the Americans produced 20-21 missiles for the Patriot air defense system, then it has already been confirmed that in August of this year they produced plus 20 missiles. And this is already 40 pieces per month. And production will increase. That is, our covering of the sky will increase. Germany will transfer 17 new IRIS-T systems to strengthen Ukraine's air defense. This is a strengthened division, it is very good. Let me remind you that the IRIS-T complex has an impressive accuracy rate of 95 percent. Each launcher has 8 missiles. That is, 10 systems - 80 missiles. Finally, we have F-16 planes. They have a unique AIM-9 Sidewinder missile on board. It is an American air-to-air missile with a short range of up to 20 kilometers. By the way, this is the most massive air-to-air missile in the world. More than 200 thousand of them were produced. Spain has announced that it will send to Ukraine a complete battery of the Hawk anti-aircraft missile system, which contains 6 launchers. One launcher is three missiles, the radius of application is up to 40 kilometers. Again, this is the most massive rocket that exists in the world in this class. More than 40 thousand of them were produced. We have to look carefully at this winter, of course there will be difficulties. The winter will not be easy, because our energy infrastructure is destroyed by 40-50 percent. But the absolute disaster that our enemy is counting on will not happen either. Why? After all, we get more than half of the electricity generation from nuclear power plants. Plus there is good news - this is the construction of another nuclear power plant in Ukraine. This is a powerful answer. Let's add here the so-called small generating capacities. Starting from the mass installation of electric solar panels and wind turbines and ending with ordinary generators for own households and institutions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/shho-chekaye-na-ukrayinu-vzymku-ekspert-pro-raketno-dronovyj-teror-kremlya/	2024-09-19T20:13:35-07:00
What is the new DOT-Chain system and how to use it: step-by-step instructions	Among other things, the quality of execution of combat tasks by units, and the motivation of personnel, and globally, national security in general, depend on the speed, efficiency, quality of the supply of products to military units and the complete absence of a corruption component during these processes. So, a week ago, another digital product for the military was launched in Ukraine. On September 11, the State rear operator presented DOT-Chain, an innovative IT system for managing the rear needs of the Armed Forces. This IT system from the State operator of the rear should fundamentally change the processes of providing food to the Armed Forces. The system digitizes key processes: from product orders to invoice processing, thereby reducing delivery times by four. So now all the stages, from the application filled out by the head of food service to the payment to the supplier, are collected in one place. All necessary documentation and signatures of each of the parties are also collected in one place. Creation of DOT-Chain has become the largest digital project in DOT. A team of IT specialists of the State Rear Operator worked on the development for half a year. The Ministry assures that this innovative solution will be able to completely eradicate corruption. The budget for rear support of the Armed Forces currently amounts to 96 billion hryvnias. DOT-Chain's primary mission is to simplify processes, increase awareness, and strengthen support for both the military and suppliers. During the presentation of the system, Alyona Zhuzha, the IT advisor of the State Rear Operator, responsible for the project development, says the following about the key advantage: — After everyone learns to use the system and we work out all the processes in it, it is expected that we will be able to do even more reduce delivery time. Before that, 30,000 paper documents were generated to provide food for one military unit. This is just one week of one military unit. There is no need for that now. According to her, from now on the system shows all the statuses of procurement and delivery documents, and expense invoices are immediately uploaded to the system. At the same time, the State operator of the rear, having electronic signatures from the military unit and the supplier, can immediately pay the application. Information from the system will also be used by the Ministry of Defense to adjust the needs of the military in accordance with the data. See in detail in the video instructions step-by-step recommendations-tips on how to use the DOT-Chain system. At the moment, the functionality of the system extends only to food. In the future, it is promised to be scaled up for purchases of other categories of goods. — I'm sure that each of you has seen posts on social networks that somewhere there are problems with food, and somewhere the situation is critical. The DOT-Chain system allows us to understand exactly where the situation is in real time, to make decisions and take responsibility for what is happening on the ground, says the head of the State Rear Operator Arsen Zhumadilov. Changes brought by the DOT-Chain IT system:	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/chym-korysna-nova-systema-dot-chain-i-yak-neyu-korystuvatysya-pokrokova-instrukcziya/	2024-09-19T20:00:33-07:00

The FPV drone with thermite set fire to part of the landing with the positions of the occupants, after which the wooden roofs of the dugouts caught fire. -This is a very effective practice of smoking out enemies. It was hardly possible to destroy anyone with that fire, but personal belongings, ammunition, special equipment and many other interesting things were definitely burned by the fire of revenge. Having personally been in the burning landing, I can say that there is not much pleasant there, there is nowhere to look, it is simply impossible to breathe, and the eyes constantly sting and water from the smoke. So I'm sure that the orcs liked it),- commented the pilot of -Sharp Kartuz- on the video.

Muramasa pilots note that the enemy is not stopping and moving forward. Sometimes he pauses to regroup and directs the main strike force towards the city of Kurakhove. During this pause, enemy aircraft and missiles destroy bridges and all important strategic objects of our cities. -At this time, we are working 24/7 to improve enemy logistics. It is not always possible to do this, there are many reasons. One of the essential ones is a powerful EW (both ours and the enemy's). But, despite this, we are good at cutting their logistics paths with drones,- the Muramasa pilots commented on their video. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the Muramasa strike unmanned aerial vehicle complex company of the 109th separate brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed a large number of various enemy vehicles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/grad-tank-i-kupa-transportu-dronari-z-teroborony-zapalyly-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2024-09-19T11:22:32-07:00

The Russians have a clown - our stormtroopers interrogated a captured traitor	The video of the conversation appeared on September 19 on the battalion channel. The prisoner, a native of Donetsk, rose to the rank of lieutenant with the occupiers. -Before you is a typical character who in 2014 chose the path of treason and became part of the so-called -Ruskov measure-. Now, as a result, he is in our captivity. He is a traitor for Ukrainians and cannon fodder for Putin-oriented Russians! To be captured by stormtroopers is to draw a lucky ticket! Replenishment of the exchange fund, which our battalion constantly conducts, will certainly help in the return of our Heroes from Russian captivity!-, the battalion commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, during the fighting in Toretsk, the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle helped the fighters of the 425th Skala assault battalion to approach the high-rise building occupied by the enemy and clean her.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/kloun-u-rosiyan-nashi-shturmovyky-dopytaly-polonenogo-zradnyka/	2024-09-19T11:10:57-07:00
Drones of the Defense Forces told when it is possible to overcome enemy EW	An officer of the Separate Detachment of Special Purpose Unmanned Systems -Kryla- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- Omega- of the Special Purpose Center of the National Guard of Ukraine with the call sign -Storm-. He said that the Russian occupiers use various EW systems to suppress the control signals of Ukrainian drones. - Usually these are some mobile REBs in the form of backpacks. The infantry takes them for themselves, advances in a certain direction and tries to gain a foothold there, he said. However, such EW means require constant power supply, which is difficult to provide at the forward positions of the enemy. — Some logistics also work in them. They used their drones to deliver various batteries, food, so that their enemy force could hold out in a certain direction as long as possible. This is usually not very effective because constant power is required for these BERs. It can work for a certain time, and then, due to the fact that it is no longer working, it is possible to carry out various types of damage, the officer explained. At the same time, the enemy is also trying to strike Ukrainian defenders with the help of UAVs. — Recently, the number of applications of FPV drones has increased. But, taking into account the fact that we use REBs, their effectiveness drops to a minimum. In the same way, they are trying to calculate our EW system and use aerial reconnaissance drones. There are not so many of them in the directions, but they are also used, said the UAV operator. He emphasized that the fighters of the Defense Forces also do not stand still and use various types of EW as efficiently as possible to suppress enemy drones. Earlier, ArmyInform showed how Ukrainian drones destroy the enemy in Kharkiv Oblast in a variety of ways with the help of FPV, skids and -dragon- drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/koly-mozhna-podolaty-vorozhyj-reb-rozpovily-dronari-syl-oborony/	2024-09-19T11:07:03-07:00

During the day, snipers destroyed 20-40-50 people - company commander Serhiy Varakin	The conversation with the officer was broadcast on September 19 on the channel of the -Return Alive- foundation. The most valuable thing for Serhii is his subordinates, whom he gently calls family. In March, Serhiy Varakin lost a soldier for the first time in 9 years of service, an enemy FPV hit one of the company's pickup trucks. -I always tried to hold back - I'm a man. But sometimes you can't help it: you stand and roar,- Serhiy explains. The war is changing, which forces Serhiy Varakin, as a commander, to resort to non-standard solutions. One of these is the mastery of kamikaze drones by snipers. -If we can't get the enemy from the ground, then we will get him from the sky,- says Serhiy Varakin. As reported by ArmyInform, a sniper of the 77th separate airmobile brigade of the Russian Air Force with the call sign -Wolf- told how to prepare and what is important during combat work. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/v-den-snajpery-nyshhyly-po-20-40-50-cholovik-komandyr-roty-sergij-varakin/	2024-09-19T10:44:12-07:00
AK-74 for -noise isolation-: in Kharkiv Oblast, enemy soldiers are poorly trained and equipped	An officer of the Separate Detachment of Special Purpose Unmanned Systems -Kryla- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- Omega- of the Special Purpose Center of the National Guard of Ukraine with the call sign -Storm-. — If we take the trend of combat training of infantrymen, then in recent times these are usually people who signed a contract six months to a year ago. Of course, they had some training, they were not immediately sent to the front, he said. However, the level of education of the occupiers is extremely low, they have not mastered even small arms. -In most cases, they just use weapons to make some noise isolation so that we think they are trained in something,- the officer explained. The occupiers are primarily armed with AK-74 assault rifles, but they also have newer weapons. - In terms of equipment, in most cases there were no special forces or military personnel with greater experience. These are ordinary infantrymen who serve literally up to a year. Therefore, in terms of skills, they have a very low level, the military said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that during attacks in Vovchansk, the enemy steadily loses up to 70% of attack aircraft - barely a third survives.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/ak-74-dlya-shumovoyi-izolyacziyi-na-harkivshhyni-vorozhi-soldaty-pogano-vyshkoleni-j-osnashheni/	2024-09-19T10:31:43-07:00

-Tamara and I are behind bars as a couple-: two collaborators were detained - a teacher and an offic...	This was notified by the Security Service of Ukraine. Two collaborators cooperated with the occupation administrations of the Russian Federation in Luhansk region and Kharkiv region. One of the figures was the -deputy director of the lyceum of the LNR-, which the Rashists created on the basis of the captured school in temporarily occupied Luhansk. -According to the investigation, the collaborator obliged the lyceum teachers to teach the history of Ukraine exclusively according to the -methodology- of the Russian Federation, in which the facts of the formation of our statehood were completely falsified. The collaborator also praised Putin and the full-scale invasion of Russia, which she regularly spoke about in front of the school community,- the SBU said. In August of this year, the defendant arrived in Kyiv via EU countries to resolve social issues. She planned to stay hidden in the city for a while, and then return to Luhansk. SBU employees located her and detained her in a rented apartment. According to the investigation, the suspect is a 42-year-old resident of Luhansk region, who in 2014 went to cooperate with the enemy. Before being appointed to the -position-, she underwent -retraining courses- in Rostov-on-Don. Another collaborator was detained in Kharkiv region. -The accomplice of the aggressor turned out to be a 58-year-old resident of Kupyansk, who after the capture of the city joined the local occupation administration of the Russian Federation. There, she was appointed to a -position- where she drew up documentation on the technical maintenance of military barracks and the occupation authorities of the Russian Federation,- the Ukrainian special service added. So far, the investigators of the Security Service have notified both detainees (in accordance with the crimes committed) of suspicion under Part 2 and Part 3 of Art. 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (collaborative activity). Investigations are ongoing. The perpetrators face prison terms. Earlier ArmyInform reported about a 22-year-old unemployed resident of the village of Geniivka, Slobozhansk community, Chuguyiv district, Kharkiv region, who collected data on the deployment of units of the Defense Forces on the territory of the district and reported them to Russian curators.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/my-z-tamaroyu-za-graty-paroyu-zatrymaly-dvoh-kolaborantok-vchytelku-ta-chynovnyczyu/	2024-09-19T09:21:25-07:00

In his first battle, he defeated the enemy's armored personnel carrier - the story of the Phantom fi...	said about the soldier on September 19 Airborne assault troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And although the soldier is still undergoing rehabilitation, he is already planning to return to the army, because in Bilogorivka, where he was seriously wounded, his comrades continue to fight the enemy. -It is extremely difficult to maintain the defense in Bilogorivka. Digging a trench there is a challenge with an asterisk, because there is almost no land - solid chalk that cannot be dug,- says Serhiy. According to the paratrooper, chalk not only makes it difficult to set up positions: it also poses another threat to soldiers. The fact is that fragments from mines and shells are not absorbed by the ground, as happens when a trench is dug in ordinary soil, but bounce off the hard rock and scatter chaotically in different directions, finding victims among our defenders. -My brother, who was standing not far from me, was hit by a shrapnel just like that when we were repelling an enemy assault,- Serhiy recalls. According to the brave paratrooper, the situation is complicated by the fact that the enemy considers Bilogorivka as the -key- to the defense of Siversk, so they will spare nothing to capture this village: bullets, artillery shells, mines and anti-aircraft missiles - all this deadly irony the enemy sends tons every day in the position of stable fighters. But no iron is able to break the will of the paratroopers of the 81st brigade to resist. The story of a brave fighter with the call sign -Phantom- is a vivid example of this. He will remember his first fight and what preceded it for the rest of his life. -At the position, we walked seven kilometers, carrying 45 kg of cargo. It was difficult, but there were still -flowers-. When the orcs started storming us, it became a real test,- says the paratrooper. According to the soldier, after the mortar shelling, with which the enemy -processed- the positions of the Ukrainian defenders, the assault of the enemy's infantry, supported by a tank and an armored personnel carrier, began. At the same time, the appearance of the tank was a surprise for the soldiers. -He descended from the tericon at neutral speed, so he could not be heard. When he started climbing the mountain, we couldn't see him then, but we already heard the roar of the engines and realized that something serious was going on. We saw the tank only when it left, as they say, -under our noses,- Serhii recalls. The unit went into battle. Serhii grabbed the RPG-7 grenade launcher and started firing at the armored personnel carrier, which also came within range of the shot, and his brother engaged the tank. -I don't remember when I knocked out an armored personnel carrier, because I fired five shots from a grenade launcher. I know for sure that I hit more than one cumulative grenade. I remarked about myself that I would shoot him, as if in a shooting range,- says Serhiy. The tank was also knocked out by a well-aimed shot of his comrades. The infantry was partially killed - only those who managed to escape in time survived. Recalling the first and subsequent battles in which the brave paratrooper participated, he says that he understood how important the professional training of a soldier is. -I was taught well at the training center: I could freely handle a machine gun, a machine gun, and a grenade launcher, so I felt confident in battles, because my actions were brought to automatism,- Serhii assures. Those who are still hesitating, the brave soldier understands a little, because he himself did not immediately join the army: he adjusted himself for several months, but in the end he made his conscious choice. But now he says that he needs to overcome his emotions: -Don't be afraid. Yes, it's scary, but we need to go to war, because we won't have a future if everyone doesn't come to their senses and go to protect their relatives, our Motherland. And before this war has come to your home, come to your senses and join the army, there will be work for everyone,- says the paratrooper. As reported by ArmyInform, a fighter of the 505th marine infantry battalion yakyj-72-dni-byvsya-u-krynkah/-> with the call sign -Fartoviy- signed a contract at the age of 22, celebrated his 23rd birthday in the dugout to the sound of air raids at the training center of the ZSU, and his 24th birthday in Krynkah. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/u-pershomu-svoyemu-boyu-pidbyv-btr-protyvnyka-istoriya-bijczya-fantoma/	2024-09-19T08:54:37-07:00
Threat of ecological disaster: Russians mined dams in the Belgorod region	This was reported by the spokesman of the operative-tactical group -Kharkiv-, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. According to him, the Russians are not only actively building defensive fortifications around Belgorod, but also actively mining general and special purpose hydraulic structures. -This can be seen as a 'bookmark' for the future - if, for example, the situation changes dramatically and the Russians have to blow up dams to slow the advance of the Defense Forces of Ukraine,- he suggested. The spokesman also noted that the Russians could also use mines to carry out an -operation under a foreign flag- - to blow up dams in order to later blame the Ukrainians for this. -It can also be assumed that the Russian Federation is preparing provocations at hydrotechnical facilities in order to further accuse Ukraine of environmental and humanitarian consequences,- said the spokesman of Kharkiv Technical University. He added that such actions can be used to mobilize the local population of the Belgorod region and to divert the attention of Russians from internal problems. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv region, the occupiers were transferred -to foot fodder-, as a result of which Russian soldiers were poisoned due to a lack of quality provisions, and in Vovchansk, a third of the fighters in the enemy's assault groups survive - the enemy steadily loses up to 70% of its assault troops.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/zagroza-ekologichnoyi-katastrofy-u-byelgorodskij-oblasti-rosiyany-zaminuvaly-damby/	2024-09-19T08:34:38-07:00

From a miner to a hero-defender: the story of soldier Mykola Savinykh	on September 19 operational command -North- told about the fighter. At first, Mykola served as a mechanic-driver of BTR-80, where together with his unit he was on combat duty in the southern direction for almost half a year. Then he was in the Izyum direction of the Kharkiv region, where he held the defense and did not allow the enemy to establish a pontoon crossing across the river. Ordered to move forward to meet the column, his unit came under heavy enemy fire from tanks, mortars, and artillery. Mykola managed to take 23 fighters out of the shelling in his combat vehicle. For his bravery and heroism, he was awarded the Order -For Courage- of the 3rd degree. Under the onslaught of overwhelming enemy forces, Mykola together with his unit held the defense for several more days. All this time, the man was evacuating personnel, bringing in reinforcements and ammunition. During one of the air raids after the FABU explosion, he received a concussion, the consequences of which he did not feel at first and continued to perform combat tasks. Later, during another flight on a combat mission, he felt that he could not feel one side of his body. He was forced to undergo treatment, then surgery and rehabilitation. Due to his health, Mykola was unable to continue his service in the combat units and was sent to the Boryspil Regional Territorial Center for Staffing and Social Support in a guard platoon.

Espionage for the Armed Forces, the Russian IPSO, fakes: what is known about the General Staff	informs the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine about this. Experts examined about 27 thousand units of media content published from June 8, 2018 to July 26, 2024. In particular, in its activities, the channel focuses on the following operations: Analysis of the content of the enemy Telegram channel was conducted by the Strategic Communications Center in cooperation with the Cyber ​​Department of the Security Service of Ukraine and the Main Communications Department of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is noted that since 2014, the Russian Federation has been waging a hybrid war against Ukraine, which includes information operations. -Russian informational aggression includes campaigns aimed at discrediting the Defense Forces of Ukraine, falsifying the events of the Russian-Ukrainian war, and depriving Ukrainians of the will to resist,- the report says. Russia also carries out information manipulation and interference both openly and covertly, often masking its actions under the guise of Ukrainian initiatives. In particular, he creates pseudo-Ukrainian pages in social networks and messengers in order to subtly influence the Ukrainian audience. One such resource is the National Headquarters Telegram channel, which is moderated by Russian intelligence services and specializes in topics related to the Defense Forces and is aimed at the military. Therefore, -NachStabu- is part of the Russian information campaign aimed at weakening Ukraine through information attacks, and performs the role of an instrument of hybrid warfare.

The first hit immobilized the tank, and the second FPV drone set it on fire. -First we stop, and then we finish!-, the battalion commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the Svobody volunteer battalions of the -Rubizh- offensive brigade of the National Guard showed how a Russian attack aircraft fled on all fours and it didn't help.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/oj-chyj-to-tank-goryt-nashi-dronari-urazyly-vorozhu-tehniku/	2024-09-19T06:37:58-07:00
A third survives: in Vovchansk, the enemy steadily loses up to 70% of attack aircraft	An officer of the Special Purpose Center -Omega Wings- of the National Guards of Ukraine with the call sign -Storm-. - As you can see the tactics of our enemy, he does not spare his manpower. The main technique is to move by 3-4 people. If someone is able to make it to a certain point, they are pinned and waiting for the next batch. Thus, for 20 people, only 7-6 people who hold a certain plot are able to reach. In this way, they accumulate their strength and spread across the front, he said. Accumulating in sufficient numbers for the next advance, the occupying soldiers try to move on, again losing about 2/3 of their personnel. - Since this is a city, the enemy tries to use the buildings. Lately, he has resorted to the tactic of single use of manpower. The enemy moves singly and accumulates at appropriate points in order to spread across the front and gain a foothold in certain areas of the terrain and push back our forces, the officer explained. In order to gain a foothold, the occupiers use basements and ruins of buildings, in which it is quite difficult for them to inflict fire damage. In order to deliver the personnel to the assault lines, the enemy uses fast maneuvering equipment - buggies. They are just as difficult to hit with drones. — There are also moments of movement on some kind of equipment. These can be buggies, quite maneuverable equipment, it is very difficult to follow. We usually try to use FPV drones, but it is very difficult at such a speed, where the equipment just flies by in a second and it is very difficult to catch it, - explained -Storm-. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that In Vovchansk, the enemy's rigging teams suffered losses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/vyzhyvaye-tretyna-u-vovchansku-vorog-stabilno-vtrachaye-do-70-shturmovykiv/	2024-09-19T06:22:38-07:00

The man did it both out of ideological convictions and for money. He began collecting information for representatives of the Russian Federation no later than February 2024. He was promised to be paid for completing the received tasks related to the collection of data on Ukrainian defenders, but the accused never received the money. The man also acted out of ideological convictions — he was an active participant in pro-Russian chat rooms. There he left comments in which he called for the seizure of power and the -annihilation of the Nazis.- The illegal nature of the accused's statements was confirmed by the conclusion of the forensic linguistic semantic-textual examination. The man sent information about the deployment of units of the Defense Forces in the messenger in the form of text messages indicating the relevant coordinates. The enemy used the data collected by the man to plan targeted strikes on the territory of the district. Law enforcement officers exposed the man at the end of July this year. At the request of the prosecution, he was remanded in custody. He will be tried on the facts of treason committed under martial law and deliberate actions aimed at violent change or overthrow of the constitutional order or at the seizure of state power, with the use of mass media. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast a militant from -Somalia- who took part in the occupation of Veliky Burluk was sentenced to 13 years in prison.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/zaklykav-unychtozhat-naczystov-ale-zdavav-pozycziyi-syl-oborony-cholovika-sudytymut/	2024-09-19T05:39:21-07:00

-Cosmic- level of treason: Kyiv engineers restored Russian oil refineries destroyed by drones	The Security Service of Ukraine informs about this. The security service exposed the management of the leading research and design institute of the oil profile in Kyiv in cooperation with the Russian Federation. Among those detained are the chairman of the board, two heads of specialized departments, as well as the chief engineer and one of the engineers of the capital institution. According to the case materials, they helped the aggressor restore their oil refineries, which were significantly damaged as a result of Ukrainian drone attacks. -At the request of the Russian Federation, officials prepared design and construction documentation for the reconstruction of three key refineries. The total cost of Russian -contracts- amounted to almost half a billion hryvnias. This amount also included remote support by designers of the technological processes of restoration and modernization of damaged refineries of the aggressor country,- the SBU says. During the searches of the office and residential premises of the persons involved in Kyiv, Lviv and Kharkiv, mobile phones, system units, laptops, flash drives and draft records with evidence of cooperation with the Russian Federation were seized. On the basis of the received evidence, SBU investigators notified the five detained officials of the project institute of suspicion under part 1 of Art. 111-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (assistance to the aggressor state). Currently, four of them are already in custody. The investigation is ongoing. Offenders face up to 12 years in prison with confiscation of property. As reported by ArmyInform , the SBU detained a Russian-recruited man from Kharkiv, who was coordinating strikes in the city.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/kosmichnyj-riven-zrady-kyyivski-inzhenery-vidnovlyuvaly-rozbyti-dronamy-rosijski-naftopererobni-zavody/	2024-09-19T05:09:46-07:00
Training of Ukrainian fighter pilots and defense cooperation: meeting of representatives of Ukraine ...	As informsIOU, this was discussed at the meetings of the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for European Integration, Oleksandr Balanutsa, with representatives of the leadership of the Swedish Ministry of Defense, as well as research and educational institutions. -Ukraine strives not only to adopt the experience of our partners, but also to share its own best practices. The war is transformed every day, and the Ukrainian military pays a high price for this experience,- Oleksandr Balanutsa noted during a visit to the Swedish Defense Research Institute in Stockholm. According to him, the MOU wants their knowledge to help allies form an understanding of modern warfare. Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine and head of defense policy of the Swedish Ministry of Defense Victoria Malmer also discussed cooperation with Ukrainian research and innovation institutions for joint development of new defense policies and doctrines. An important part of the visit was an introductory meeting with representatives of the Swedish Air Force Combat Simulation Center, where the Ukrainian delegation learned in detail about the process of training Swedish pilots on aviation simulators. The Ukrainian side expressed interest in training its pilots and other Air Force specialists in Sweden. In addition, they discussed the status of the transfer of ACS 890 air reconnaissance and control aircraft to Ukraine, their integration into the Ukrainian air defense system, as well as the issue of cooperation with Ukraine's existing combat aviation. -Cooperation between Ukraine and Sweden in training and exchange of experience is a key element in the training of our specialists. This will not only increase the effectiveness of combat operations, but will also help provide a better understanding of modern warfare,- Oleksandr Balanutsa concluded. As reported by ArmiyaInform, a delegation of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine headed by the Deputy Ministers of Defense of Ukraine Oleksandr Balanutsya and Yuriy Dzhigyr visited Sweden for participation in political-military consultations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/pidgotovka-ukrayinskyh-bojovyh-pilotiv-ta-oboronna-spivpraczya-zustrich-predstavnykiv-ukrayiny-ta-shvecziyi/	2024-09-19T04:59:07-07:00
From now on, the main intelligence agency is also in art: a wall painting -The wise man rules over t...	The creation of the mural was initiated by the Suchasna Ukraine Charitable Foundation with the support of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. And the artistic project was realized by the artist Volodymyr Manzhos, recognized in Ukraine and the world. The artist depicted the successful operations of the GUR on the mural: — The story in my author's style about the activity of the GUR of the MOU in the Black Sea. We see here a personified collective image of intelligence - the GUR symbol, a sea drone, a surf as a reference to a sea drone, a battered -Russian warship-, the hand of someone wise ruling over the stars. This is the slogan of GUR, the author shared his idea. This is the seventh work from a series of his mural works about historical, fateful events in Ukraine. — I created my first job in India in 2015. Then there were jobs in Kyiv, Poland, and Paris. All these works in one way or another reflect the events we are witnessing. Finishing each of them, I sincerely believed that this was the last work of this series. And the next mural will reflect our victory, peace and prosperity. Therefore, now I wish that the next mural would be just like that, Volodymyr Manzhos concluded. The president of the -Modern Ukraine- Foundation, Volodymyr Havrysh, said that before the large-scale war, one of the initiatives planned by the benefactors was the murals of modern Ukraine. The goal then was to unify the country. Murals were to be created in each area to promote the idea that we are one. — But in 2022, a full-scale invasion began and we realized that in addition to systematic aid to the front (more than 150 million hryvnias have been provided to date), cultural diplomacy plays an important role. Today you see a mural that shows the power of Ukrainian intelligence, our defenders, destroying ships in the Black Sea. And the task of this presentation is also to collect 10 million in order to purchase the Magura V5, which will destroy naval targets, ships, so that the Ukrainian people live under the free Ukrainian sky, Volodymyr Havrysh said. He also shared plans to create murals in other countries. -These murals will be the gratitude of the Ukrainian people to all partner countries, the civilized world and the people who help Ukrainians today to resist and defeat the enemy,- the philanthropist noted. Andriy Yusov, a representative of the Ukrainian State Educational and Cultural Organization, thanked the author, the public, and volunteers for the implementation of this creative initiative. — This time the mural — owl, Magura, sea — is dedicated to the destruction of the enemy's potential on the Ukrainian sea and the liberation of our territories. Actually, it is not only support of fighting spirit. This is real art. We did not influence the creative process in any way, apparently, but conceptually, of course, this is joint work, - Andrii Yusov said. — Russian aggression is, of course, a terrible evil, but the struggle of the Ukrainian people continues. And it must be supported, supported by motivation. And, actually, such art projects are very important support. At the same time, despite the fact that we are talking about repelling Russian aggression at sea, this is a very bright artistic project, a bright picture, like the entire struggle of the Ukrainian people. The work of Volodymyr Manzhos is, without exaggeration, a cultural phenomenon. We are grateful that the Main Directorate of Intelligence is now both in art and on the streets of Kyiv. Andriy Yusov joked that today the largest owl in Ukraine has settled in Kyiv, and this owl is certainly inextricably linked with the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, with the work of special forces and group 13 - Magura V5 operators. He conveyed the thanks of the soldiers to the author and everyone present and emphasized how important such recognition of their work is. — But, in addition to the fact that it is a beautiful work of art, it is also a large charity fundraiser for Ukrainian Magura attack drones, which effectively destroy the enemy Russian fleet. That's why it's great when art helps the Security and Defense Forces, Andrii Yusov summarized. The ceremonially opened mural is a continuation of the -GURKIT from GUR- campaign, within the limits of which at the beginning of September the computer game -Gurkit on the Swamps- was presented, where everyone can try themselves in the role of the operator of a modern Ukrainian surface drone and donate to its purchase. At the presentation, a limited edition of the own brand was distributed based on the motifs of the mural with the author's signature, as well as an exclusive -skin- for Monobank cards and a themed merch drop of the SYNDICATE brand with an image of the mural. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/golovne-upravlinnya-rozvidky-vidteper-ye-j-u-mystecztvi-v-kyyevi-vidkryly-stinopys-mudryj-panuye-nad-zirkamy/	2024-09-19T04:41:36-07:00

A militant from -Somalia- took part in the occupation of Kharkiv Region: the terrorist was convicted	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informed about this. No later than October 2019, a 30-year-old man voluntarily joined the 1st separate battalion tactical group -Somalia-. As part of it, the militant took part in combat operations against Ukrainian defenders on the territory of the Donetsk region. After the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine, the terrorist of the pseudo-republic moved to Kharkiv Oblast, where he took part in the occupation of the village of Velikiy Burluk, Kupyan district.

Ukrainian howitzers -Bohdan- are financed from profits from the frozen assets of the Russian Federat...	This was spoke the Ambassador of the European Union to Ukraine Katarina Maternova in an interview - European truth-. According to her, the production of Ukrainian howitzers -Bohdan- has already been paid for with this money. Katarina Maternova reminded that half a year ago, the EU approved the scheme for using the income from frozen Russian assets - the interest -dripping- on them - for the benefit of Ukraine, and in August the first 1.4 billion euros were allocated from them. In particular, several member states received funding for new arms supplies. She emphasized that it is much more important that 400 million of this amount will go to Ukrainian defense enterprises. It was Denmark that came up with such a system. It was the first country to contract and pay for the production of Bogdan howitzers for the Armed Forces. -So, we poured 400 million euros through Denmark into the Ukrainian defense industry. Agree, this is quite a significant amount&#8230; And that's such exquisite justice, isn't it? With the funds of Russian frozen assets, you make howitzers,- the ambassador said. Katarina Maternova noted that Denmark contributed some of its own funds to the amount of 400 million euros of rockets and thus placed a large order at the Ukrainian military plant. According to the ambassador, in the next tranche of the frozen Russian assets, they want to pledge an even larger amount to finance the production of weapons directly by the Ukrainian defense industry. -From the next tranche, an even larger amount will go directly to the Ukrainian defense industry. Because you produce products of the same quality for less money, you do it faster, you have lower transport and logistics costs, and in addition, manufacturers pay taxes in Ukraine and help support the economy,- she said. The ambassador added that this is something she is particularly proud of, as she was one of the most ardent defenders of this idea. As reported by ArmyInform, the delegation of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine headed by the Deputy Ministers of Defense of Ukraine Oleksandr Balanutsy and Yuriy Dzhigyr -politychno-vijskovi-konsultacziyi-ta-spivpraczya-z-ukrayinoyu/->visited Sweden to participate in political-military consultations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/ukrayinski-gaubyczi-bogdana-finansuyutsya-z-prybutkiv-vid-zamorozhenyh-aktyviv-rf/	2024-09-19T03:23:58-07:00

-Orlan-, Zala, Supercam: why it is difficult to shoot down enemy reconnaissance drones	Why it is difficult to shoot down enemy reconnaissance drones explained on the live broadcast of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- the spokesman of the National Guard Ruslan Muzychuk of Ukraine. — When we talk about shooting down, it is, of course, primarily the detection of such UAVs. This task is not the most difficult - to directly detect various types of aircraft, in particular, such as -Orlan-, -Zala- or -Supercam-. Another issue is their downing, because we see, for example, there was quite a lot of activity in Kharkiv Oblast last month, and on the northern border UAVs are used specifically for reconnaissance, he said. However, detecting an enemy spy drone is only the first step. After that, there is a danger that the process of shooting down a Russian UAV will capture another enemy aircraft, which will allow the occupiers to discover the positions of units of the Defense Forces and fire at them. - There is a possibility that another aircraft or with the help of other means can detect the place from which the strike was carried out - whether it was some kind of anti-aircraft system or, if the circumstances allow, small arms, - the spokesman explained. In view of this, it is not always possible to open fire and it is safe for soldiers of the Defense Forces units to shoot down an enemy drone. — Much of the work is now being done to land such drones with the help of electronic warfare. Now we also see that there are cases when our pilots-operators of FPV drones shoot down such enemy aircraft with the help of FPV drones in the air, Ruslan Muzychuk said. The spokesman also reported that last day fighters of the National Guard of Ukraine shot down two UAVs of operational-tactical level -Orlan- in the South. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the enemy increased the number of flights reconnaissance drones in the Vovchan direction - in recent times, the occupation's air reconnaissance activity has increased here by 40%, and also explained, why the destruction of enemy reconnaissance UAVs is the key to reducing the number of strikes by KABams.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/orlan-zala-supercam-chomu-skladno-zbyvaty-vorozhi-drony-rozvidnyky/	2024-09-19T00:51:45-07:00
The SBU detained a man from Kharkiv recruited by Russia, who was coordinating attacks on the city	About informs the Security Service of Ukraine. The priority targets of the enemy were the temporary base points of the Ukrainian troops involved in hostilities in the Kharkiv direction. In order to direct guided aerial bombs and missile weapons to the locations of the Defense Forces, the Russian special service remotely recruited a 42-year-old unemployed man from the regional center. The man came to the attention of the occupiers because of his pro-Kremlin posts in Telegram channels. There, he was approached by a staff member of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces (better known as the game) and offered cooperation. On the instructions of a Russian intelligence officer, the agent regularly went around the city and secretly recorded the location of the Defense Forces. Then he marked the corresponding coordinates on Google maps and sent a -report- to his Russian curator via messenger. SBU employees exposed the agent at the initial stage of his intelligence activity, which made it possible to secure the positions of Ukrainian troops in a timely manner. After documenting every step of the suspect's criminal actions, he was detained in his own apartment. During the searches, a mobile phone was seized from the agent, which he used to photograph military objects and communicate with the Russian game. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed him of the suspicion under Part 2 of Art. 111 (treason committed under martial law) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. The criminal was remanded in custody without bail. He faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property. Complex measures were carried out by SBU employees in the Kharkiv region under the procedural guidance of the regional prosecutor's office.

A collaborator from Luhansk region fantasized about concentration camps in Kursk region	One of such -generators of lies- is the traitor of Ukraine, ex-director of the Luhansk regional state television and radio company Rodion Miroshnyk. He is known, in particular, for the fact that in August of last year he spread a false order of the commander of military unit A7052 (Kherson) regarding the creation of mobile crematoria for Ukrainian soldiers. Rodion Miroshnyk of the special assignment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation published a report -on the situation of the civilian population in the populated areas of the Kursk Region captured by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.- According to his data, -the Ukrainian military has created concentration camps in the border zone-.

Miroshnyk's fantasies are another example of -mirroring- information tactics, when the Russians try to accuse Ukraine of war crimes similar to those they themselves have committed since the beginning of the war. As you know, the system of filtration concentration camps was invented and actively used in the occupied Ukrainian territories by the armed forces of the Russian Federation. They imprison and torture Ukrainian citizens who threaten Russian control over Ukraine, including anyone with pro-Ukrainian views. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/kolaborant-z-luganshhyny-nafantazuvav-koncztabory-na-kurshhyni/	2024-09-18T20:27:10-07:00
About the fried enemy tank and the capture of the Russian commander: the war of Kombat Olefirenka	The major of the Armed Forces of Ukraine told the correspondent about episodes of combat work of tankers in a large-scale war, as well as about the preparation of the unit ArmyInform . Artur Olefirenko currently commands the 1st tank battalion of the separate Siver tank brigade. He started his military career back in 2014. Then he served as a mechanic-driver and fought against the Russians near Luhansk. Later, he decided to become an officer and entered the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Peter Sahaidachny. In 2019, after graduating from university, I took the position of tank platoon commander in the 1st separate tank Siver brigade. - All my service - from platoon commander to battalion commander - I have served in the First Tank and this I'm proud! - says Artur Olefirenko. At the beginning of the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Artur Olefirenko commanded a tank company. They were on the border with Belarus. But later they received an order to retreat to Chernigov and take up defense there. The first tank defended the city together with the 58th brigade named after Hetman Vyhovsky, which fought on the approaches to Chernihiv. At that time, Artur Olefirenka had a group of four T-64BV tanks. I had to work almost around the clock. Huge convoys of Russian vehicles and the practice of tankers against the enemy were remembered. In one of the battles, Artur destroyed a Russian T-72B tank, as well as an enemy BMP. The infantry fighting vehicle burned down along with the crew and landing party. And the crew of the tank was captured. In this tank was the commander of tank battalion 35 of the separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Russian Federation, Major Leonid Shchotkin. Schotkin's crew managed to distinguish themselves by shelling a residential building in Chernihiv, for which the Russian major was later sentenced to 11 years in prison. — After the loss of command, the fighting spirit of the Russians disappeared somewhere, and the offensive was stopped, - recalls Artur Olefirenko. For the defense of Chernihiv at that time, Captain Artur Olefirenko was the commander of the 8th tank company of the 3rd tank battalion - received the award -Honorary Citizen of the City of Chernihiv- and the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky III degree. After the battles for Chernihiv, the company underwent reconstruction and received Bulat tanks. And again into battle. They fought in almost all areas of the front — near Kharkiv, in the Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions. — The battles for Lysychansk and Lyman are the most memorable. Then we worked together with paratroopers of the 25th and 81st brigades. There, the company shot down a large amount of Russian equipment — Russian BMP-2s and tanks were on fire, Artur Olefirenko recalls. In 2024, he took command of a tank battalion. - As for a commander, the main thing for me is the motivation of the personnel. So that the tankers understood each other with half a word, so that they were friendly. Our battalion is a big military family. Senior soldiers train the new arrivals, they are helped in this by the battalion management. And we give 100%. It happens that newcomers don't do everything right away, but over time they make up for it, - says Artur Olefirenko. According to him, many soldiers of the battalion who were in battles were awarded both departmental honors and state awards. Replenishment takes place both at the expense of training centers, and they themselves periodically select tankers. In any case, all newcomers undergo training even in the unit itself. - For us, the main thing is to expel the enemy from our Ukraine and for our children to grow up without war, - adds Artur Olefirenko.

Stalker goes to sea: US shipbuilders presented an unmanned surface ship	As stated on the portal of the American manufacturer, Swift Sea-Stalker The S3 is an unmanned (remote or autonomous) small unmanned surface vehicle (sUSV) with high endurance, a strong aluminum hull and a super-powerful diesel engine, according to ArmyInform. Designed for surveillance and interception missions, the S3 USV is designed to operate in difficult waterways in conflict zones, including the Gulf of Africa and South China Sea regions. The S3 can be operated remotely or operate autonomously, providing flexibility and efficiency in maritime operations. Equipped with four AGM-179 Air-to-Ground Missiles (JAGMs) combined in one installation, this maritime drone represents a significant advance in the US Navy's unmanned maritime capabilities. The maritime drone has a top speed of more than 56 km/h, an effective range of 1,000 nautical miles, and the ability to continuously perform tasks for about 40 hours, ensuring long-term operational capabilities. These features enable it to effectively monitor and respond to threats along its coastlines, increasing security at sea. The Yanmar 4LV230 230hp (3800RPM) engine provided for this craft is available in two different powerplants: propeller driven and jet powered. It complies with NATO standardization agreements (STANAG) 4586 and the protocol of the common architecture of unmanned aerial vehicles systems (JAUS). The Marine UAV is capable of carrying a maximum payload of 1,500 pounds (680 kg). For control, the Swift Sea-Stalker S3 drone is equipped with radar/EO/GPS/AIS/ and COTS sensors. Swiftships recently received a contract from the Pentagon to manufacture the S3 USV. -We are proud to support the US Department of Defense's mission to protect its waters and protect vital maritime interests,- Swiftships said. -The delivery of the S3 USV is a significant step forward in achieving future maritime security goals.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/stalker-vyhodyt-v-more-sudnobudivnyky-ssha-predstavyly-bezpilotnyj-nadvodnyj-korabel/	2024-09-18T20:10:09-07:00
The F-16 is invincible in air combat, but there was one exception	ArmyInform tells about which plane was able to confirm the downing of an F-16 during a real aerial battle. The circumstances of the incident were reconstructed, so the dogfight can be viewed on video. Reconstruction of air battle between Greek and Turkish fighter jets The battle took place on October 8, 1996 in the context of the Aegean dispute - a conflict between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty and adjacent rights in the Aegean Sea and airspace spaces above it. Read also: F-16s were in Ukraine long before August 2024: Americans piloted together with Ukrainians However, for a long time none of the parties officially recognized the fact, and only more than one and a half ten years later, Turkey acknowledged the loss of one of its F-16s as a result of a Greek fighter jet being shot down by a missile. On the other hand, Greece has never officially acknowledged the downing of an F-16 fighter of the Turkish Air Force. It is known from open sources that the incident occurred during the Greek-Cypriot -Nikiphoros- exercises and the simultaneous exercises of the Turkish Air Force. It is reasonable to assume that the exercises were deliberately conducted simultaneously to disrupt the armed forces of a neighboring country. Read also: How the F-16 shot down the Russian -Sushka-: about the historic battle and why Kursk is here During the Turkish exercises, four F4 Phantom bombers moved to the southwest in the area between the islands Chios and Samos of the Aegean Sea. The bombers were accompanied by a pair of F-16 fighters. When the Greek military saw Turkish planes on radar, they raised a pair of fighter jets to identify and intercept the identified targets. Ultimately, this led to the downing of one of the Turkish F-16s. Read also: Two F-16s collide during simulated combat, one pilot survives: from NATO history When a pair of Hellas fighters went out to intercept, one of the Turkish F-16s, according to some claims , entered Greek airspace in the area of ​​the island of Chios. One of the Greek pilots immediately attacked, firing an R550 Magic II -Mazhik- missile at the intruder. The Magic R.550 is a close-range air-to-air missile from the French company Matra. It was developed in 1965 to compete with the American AIM-9 Sidewinder missile. Read also: F-16 -stormed- so fast that slow electronics couldn't cope: test video explains everything Magic R.550 made compatible with Sidewinder launch equipment, so it could be launched, in particular, from F-16 fighters. However, this time the missile was launched by another air fighter. It was as French as the missile, the Dassault Mirage 2000, a fourth-generation multirole jet fighter. Developed in the 1970s by Dassault Aviation, it became the main combat aircraft of the French Air Force in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Read also: Accidentally flew into the air. The incident that could put an end to the F-16 project Greece purchased from France and put the Mirage 2000 into service in the late 1980s, so by the mid-1990s Greek pilots already had many years of experience operating these fighters. After the defeat, one of the Turkish pilots died, but the second was able to eject successfully. Later, he was picked up by Greek rescuers. In Turkey, the fact of the loss of an F-16 fighter as a result of a battle with a Greek Mirage 2000 was recognized only in 2012. This was done by Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Yilmaz. In response to a parliamentary inquiry, a Turkish official said that on October 8, 1996, a Turkish F-16D Block 40 was shot down by a Greek Mirage 2000 using an R.550 Magic II missile. Despite the fact that Greece did not recognize the fact that the F-16 was shot down by a Mirage 2000 missile, in Turkey, the relatives of the dead F-16 pilot sued the Greek officer who piloted the Mirage 2000. This caused one of the many exacerbations in Greek-Turkish relations, about which was written with indignation in the media of both countries. The French began promoting their Mirage 2000 fighter as -the only plane that can shoot down an F-16.- Earlier, ArmyInform reported that France will provide Ukraine with Mirage 2000 aircraft and provide staffing of the Ukrainian army brigade.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/f-16-neperemozhnyj-u-povitryanomu-boyu-ale-stavsya-yedynyj-vynyatok/	2024-09-18T20:06:00-07:00
Battle for Pokrovsk: about fortifications, enemy losses and what does the weather have to do with it	What are the possible scenarios of the development of events in this direction and will the Ukrainian defenders be able to crush the offensive potential of the occupiers? Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmyInform about this. — Is the task before the Russians to seize the Pokrovskoe-Myronograd agglomeration in a strategic sense? Of course, there is such a task. Why? This is the next link in the strategy that they are considering - access to the administrative borders of Donetsk region and Luhansk region. Indeed, they are somewhere within 10 kilometers of Pokrovsk. In fact, the enemy already has full-fledged barrel artillery there. Let's say the D-30 howitzer has a strike range of 15 kilometers, while their longest-range systems such as Hyacinth, Msta B, Acacia work at 28 kilometers. Yes, indeed, heavy artillery duels are already taking place on this part of the front. — But there are several important nuances. Let's recall Bakhmut. The active phase of the Battle of Bakhmut is 10 months. That's a lot. One PVK -Wagner- lost about 22 thousand killed there. If, relatively speaking, the battle begins in September-October, it will be long-lasting, heavy and bloody for the occupiers. Why? The so-called wet weather season is approaching, rains are expected in autumn. The enemy will not be able to use heavy tracked vehicles, such as tanks, BMP from flanking positions, from the field. There will be only large infantry ramparts. And large infantry ramparts are very, very difficult even for Rashist infantry to move on a wet field. Also, mining the terrain on our side. This is all they have to go through. The expert adds that the same reasoning applies to Avdiivka. Avdiivka was stormed by the Russians for almost 10 years, starting in 2014, just as the war in Donbas began. And this year alone, the active phase of fighting for this Ukrainian city lasted more than four months. During this period alone, the Russian army lost almost 50,000 soldiers. Petro Chernyk emphasizes that battles can be lost. Even if we have to leave Pokrovsk, it will not be a disaster. — I really like historical parallels. The Battle of Poitiers is one of the greatest victories of the English in the Hundred Years' War, which was won in 1356 over the French. Then the English captured the French king, but in the end, England just lost the war. And there is one more nuance. The enemy now has a huge personnel problem. He is able to mobilize up to 30-32 thousand per month, but he can't do more at the moment. During this summer alone, the Defense Forces of Ukraine destroyed more than 107,000 Russians. And here, as I call it, the pre-emptive extermination of even 2-3 thousand enemy personnel is a very important and principled issue. I do not cancel the battle for Pokrovsk. It (this battle. - Ed.) is extremely important, but I don't think it will be an easy walk for the occupiers. Perhaps the battle for the Pokrov-Myrnograd agglomeration will be the battle that will ultimately undermine the combat potential of Russian troops. How the Germans once undermined their strategic offensive potential during the ten-month standoff with the French at Verdun in 1916. Of course, time will tell. — In the spring, the government allocated more than 20 billion hryvnias for the construction of fortifications of defense lines. Defense lines continue to be built near Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad. The expert adds that -this is a continuous process.- Of course, the construction of fortifications, with problems, with human factors, mistakes and the like, is not without this, but they are still being built. And the enemy will have to reckon with it. — In addition, the process of saturating the units of the Defense Forces with weapons is currently underway. Chernyk says, at the beginning of the Great War, the Americans produced 14,000 shells of 155 caliber per month. And now they have already confirmed that now, for the fall, they reached the figure of 50 thousand shells. This is a very good step forward. Also, the Czech armed initiative to help Ukraine was fully operational. — Recall that at the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the ratio of artillery volleys was 1 to 10, 1 to 15, and sometimes 1 to 20. Now even the Russians say that there are moments and locations when we (Ukrainian Defense Forces . — Ed.) in parity, and sometimes there are more artillery volleys than they have. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/bytva-za-pokrovsk-pro-fortyfikacziyi-vtraty-voroga-ta-do-chogo-tut-pogoda/	2024-09-18T20:00:05-07:00
They were scared by a drone, shot with a machine gun - a trap for the enemy from our fighters	The video appeared on September 18 on the group's channel. The assault group of Russians hid in a barn. Our FPV drone flew there. After the explosion, those Russians who could walk ran away. Two invaders ran right at our machine gun and were shot at close range. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of Tactical Group -Adam- made a selection destruction of Russian attack aircraft that never reached our positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/nalyakaly-dronom-zastrelyly-z-kulemeta-pastka-dlya-voroga-vid-nashyh-bijcziv/	2024-09-18T12:07:34-07:00
The Russians use UAVs for delivery in the Kharkiv Region: the Armed Forces oppose	Vitaliy Sarantsev, the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv-, told about this on the air of the nationwide telethon -Edyny Novyni- . — The opponent is trying to apply it. In particular, this was also the case in Vovchansk, when with the help of drones they deliver provisions and ammunition to blocked servicemen on the territory of the Aggregate Plant. They also tried to provide those units that perform tasks near Lyptsi or Lukyantsi, he said. The spokesman explained that these are mostly UAVs capable of carrying a certain load weighing up to several kilograms. Thus, the enemy is trying to carry out logistical support measures, that is, to deliver water, provisions, and ammunition. -However, it is going very badly for him, at least in the direction of Hlyboky-Lyptsy, because there we have strengthened certain measures and, in connection with this, logistical support of the enemy's forward positions is almost not happening,- the spokesman said. He noted that he will not reveal all the secrets live, but noted that the Defense Forces are effectively countering the enemy in this regard. At the same time, the occupiers intensified aerial reconnaissance with the aim of finding new supply routes, places of possible basing and setting up positions, as well as identifying units of the Defense Forces and subsequently inflicting fire damage on them. — As for the location and the direction of Liptsi-Hlyboke, we notice a certain lull in the enemy's activity there, but this does not mean that he has abandoned his intentions. He is strengthening there, he is carrying out fortification equipment for his positions, he is bringing in additional personnel there, - Vitaly Sarantsev said. This means that the enemy has not given up its aggressive intentions and plans to resume offensive actions. — The most difficult situation remains in Vovchansk itself, where fighting is constantly going on where the enemy is trying to advance in different areas of the city. In particular, in the areas of high-rise buildings, he is trying to carry out assaults in some places with the support of light armored vehicles. However, he does not manage to do all this, said the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Vovchan direction, the occupiers increased the number of reconnaissance drone flights, increasing air reconnaissance by about 40% compared to the previous period.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/bpla-dlya-postachannya-zastosovuyut-rosiyany-na-harkivshhyni-zsu-protydiyut/	2024-09-18T11:57:01-07:00

But the assault of the Russians ended before it had even begun. First, the enemy was hit by FPV drones and drops. Those who remained alive tried to escape, but in vain. One of the invaders decided to pretend to be dead, but our drones did not believe him. Then the Russian -helped- himself with early demobilization with his own machine gun. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 24th mechanized brigade named after King Danylo filmed the remains of Chasovoy Yar, which the Russians continue to storm and erase from the face of the earth with all possible types of weapons: artillery, mines, rockets, kamikaze drones and anti-tank missiles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/forsuvaly-kanal-potrapyly-na-toj-svit-znyshhennya-voroga-bilya-chasovogo-yaru/	2024-09-18T11:46:10-07:00
Mines are dropped from drones: the Armed Forces explained why the Russians mine the area in the Khar...	Does this indicate the enemy's refusal of offensive operations on the air of the nationwide telethon -Edyny Novyny- explained the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Vitaly Sarantsev. — They are not mining a continuous territory, but are conducting reconnaissance of possible routes for the advancement of our forces, and on these possible routes they are dropping mines. They are dropping a PFM-1 mine, the so-called Petal, he said. Recently, the fighters of the units of the Defense Forces also discovered new anti-personnel mines, which were probably made in an artisanal way. - Recently, it was noticed that they are trying to use a new type of ammunition - a mine, the body of which is made on a 3D printer. It is made of plastic, that is, it does not have increased electromagnetic sensitivity. Inside it is filled with TNT, has a detonator, the spokesman said. It is precisely such mines that the Russian occupiers scatter on the routes of the possible advance of units of the Defense Forces. — This is done with the help of UAVs. I won't say it's a systemic thing, but it means the opponent needs more time to prepare for a counterattack. In this way, they are trying to restrain the possible advance of units of the Defense Forces, Vitaly Sarantsev explained. At the same time, he emphasized that the Russian occupiers have not given up their aggressive intentions. They move and accumulate personnel, reform and reformat assault groups, attempt to establish a system of command, communication and supply in order to build up forces and resume offensive operations. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that occupiers began to scatter anti-personnel mines of a new type in the north of Kharkiv region, which in principle, the actions are similar to the prohibited PFM-1 -Petal- mine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/miny-skydayut-z-droniv-v-zsu-poyasnyly-navishho-rosiyany-minuyut-misczevist-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-09-18T11:32:09-07:00

Fake chatbots mimic the Chief Intelligence bot	The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informed about this on September 18. -The enemy is trying to mislead Ukrainians living in the temporarily occupied territories by creating bots that, by their description, name and visuals, reproduce the official chatbot of the GUR -Main Intelligence Bot-, the message says. It is dangerous to transmit any information through such bots. GUR reminds that the official chatbot of the Main Directorate of Intelligence is located at the following link: https://t.me/gur_official_bot.

Transferred -to foot feed-: in Kharkiv Oblast, the occupiers poisoned themselves due to a lack of pr...	The reasons for the mass poisoning of the Russian occupiers on the air of the national telethon -Edyni Novyni- explained the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Vitaly Sarantsev. — The reasons are quite simple. For several days, the personnel of the enemy, who are in the forward positions, will not receive either provisions or water. Because of this, he is forced to switch to foot feed, he said. Forced to feed themselves, the occupiers often consume poor-quality water and food. - He is forced to drink water from streams or from wells. Earlier, we reported that in some places the enemy does not take away their dead, due to which there is a complication of the sanitary-epidemiological situation, the spokesman explained. So the situation is complicated by the fact that in some places the enemy does not evacuate irreversible losses, so the bodies of the dead Russian soldiers decompose and poison the area. — A certain amount of something gets into the ground, into the water. This is all the enemy is trying to consume. This leads to the fact that the personnel who drank or used this water, where there are other needs, develop gastrointestinal disorders. There are no corresponding medicines either. This worsens, in addition to everything else, the enemy's morale, which is why we note cases of more frequent surrenders, - said Vitaly Sarantsev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that massed stomach disorder knocked off the feet of the occupiers in Kharkiv Oblast and that zdavatysya-v-polon/->logistics -in manual mode- forces the Russian invaders to surrender as prisoners.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/perevely-na-pidnozhnyj-korm-na-harkivshhyni-okupanty-potruyilysya-cherez-nestachu-proviziyi/	2024-09-18T10:49:12-07:00
An analogue of the forbidden -Lepestka-: the occupiers are installing new mines in Kharkiv Oblast	This was notified in Kharkiv OTU. These are pressure mines that have a body printed on a 3D printer. Inside the case is a detonator and a plastid charge. -In terms of size and principle of action, the new mines are similar to the PFM-1 -Petal- mine banned by international conventions. Their small size and unpredictable nature make them extremely insidious,- Kharkiv OTU emphasized. There are currently no reliable data on the scalability of the production of these mines in the Russian Federation. It can be assumed that the appearance of such mines may be the result of the private initiative of individual manufacturers. Despite the relative ease of making such mines, they pose a serious threat to the lives of our defenders. In connection with the new danger in the -Kharkiv- OTU, they called for increased caution in the combat zones and in the liberated territories. Earlier, ArmiyaInform reported that the Armed Forces of Ukraine explained why are Russian inhumans executing Ukrainian prisoners.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/analog-zaboronenogo-lepestka-na-harkivshhyni-okupanty-vstanovlyuyut-novi-miny/	2024-09-18T10:44:16-07:00
From raising children to aiding the occupiers: a kindergarten worker was convicted in Kharkiv	This was notified in the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office. An employee of one of the Kharkiv kindergartens has been an active participant in pro-Russian chats in the Telegram messenger since September 2023. There, the woman wrote comments in which she denied the armed aggression of the Russian Federation and discredited the defenders of our state, claiming that they are the ones who strike the civilian infrastructure of the regional center. In addition, while communicating with an acquaintance who lives in the Russian Federation, the woman gave him information about the locations of the Ukrainian military on the territory of Kharkiv. This information was not published in open access. Law enforcement officers exposed the woman at the end of March this year at her place of residence and seized evidence of her illegal activities. The accused was awaiting trial while in custody. During the trial, she fully admitted her guilt and repented of what she had done. The court found the woman guilty of disseminating information about the location of military formations formed in accordance with the laws of Ukraine, committed under martial law, as well as manufacturing and disseminating materials that contain denials of armed aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine.

The authors of the gun convoys with explosives: traitors from Luhansk region will be sentenced in ab...	This was notified by the Security Service of Ukraine. There, they collected the evidence base for three more collaborators who cooperate with the Russian Federation on the temporarily captured part of the territory of Luhansk region. We are talking about Yevgeny Katsavalov, the head of the occupation administration of the -MNS LNR- and his two -deputies- - Vitaly Kucherov and Roman Kochetov. After their appointment to -positions- in 2023, the individuals involved began to follow the instructions of the Kremlin regarding the logistical support of the occupation groups of the Russian Federation fighting on the eastern front. In particular, they organized the transfer of combat FPV drones from Russia to the occupiers on the front lines. To disguise military routes, the collaborators carried out the transportation of UAVs by trucks under the guise of -humanitarian aid- for the civilian population of the frontline areas. At the same time, enemy accomplices transported ammunition and military ammunition to the Russian troops in such -gumconvoys-. -In addition, the collaborators organized the production of explosive devices for drones, which the Rashists use to attack advanced units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. Collaborators often -report- about this during speeches on the airs of rosZMI, where they also call on the civilian population of the temporarily occupied areas of Luhansk region to support the war against Ukraine. For his cooperation, Putin awarded Katsavalov the rank of -Lieutenant General of the Internal Service- by decree, the SBU said. On the basis of the received evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed all three collaborators in absentia about the suspicion under Part 5 of Art. 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (voluntary occupation by a citizen of Ukraine of a position related to the performance of organizational-administrative or administrative-economic functions in illegal authorities created in the temporarily occupied territory, including in the occupation administration of the aggressor state). Comprehensive measures are underway to bring perpetrators to justice for crimes against our state. As reported ArmyInform, the Security Service detained another FSB agent in Donetsk region.

A new food supply model for the Armed Forces: what is known	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informed about this on September 18. The principle and goal of the new model is to reduce logistics in delivery and increase quality control. The MOU studied the practice of partners from Great Britain and involved expert opinions from other NATO agencies, the USA and Canada in order to implement the best practices in the Ukrainian model. -We are introducing a two-tier quality control system. The additional stage is at the distribution centers,- said the Deputy Minister of Defense. According to him, representatives of the DOT, the Ministry of Defense and suppliers check the quality of products. Only after that they are sent to military units. -For the first time, the State operator of the rear will select producers of 75% of the catalog food product through so-called signal tenders on the Prozorro system. That is, those products that are most often used are ordered by military units,- Dmytro Klimenkov said. According to him, these are meat, fish, canned goods, cereals, dairy products, etc. Suppliers will sign contracts with manufacturers. -DOT-Chain will implement a so-called black list, where suppliers who do not properly fulfill their contractual obligations will be noted,- he added. This model will be launched as a pilot project from February 2025 and will operate within a year in Kyiv, Vinnytsia, as well as in Zhytomyr, Cherkasy, Kyiv and Kirovohrad regions. No additional funds are required for this pilot project. It will be implemented exclusively with the money provided for the purchase of food products for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. One of the goals of this model is transparent reporting. Each stage of the procurement and supply process will be recorded in an electronic system. All processes and responsibilities of each party will be written there: from the customer to the contractor, from the application to the fact of delivery. -This will allow, first of all, to monitor and quickly respond to challenges and problems. The second is that it will contribute to the prevention of corruption, it will increase the responsibility of each party, and most importantly, we will receive information, analytics on the volumes and terms of supply,- Dmytro Klimenkov explained. As reported by ArmyInform, DOT-Chain is a unique digital system for managing food supply processes for the army. The system shortens the product supply cycle by 4 times and improves quality control.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/nova-model-postachannya-harchovyh-produktiv-dlya-zsu-shho-vidomo/	2024-09-18T09:24:34-07:00

The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informed about this on September 18. -We have completed the first stage of procurement reform for the Armed Forces.

According to him, today employees of the State rear operator conduct bidding in the Prozorro system, sign contracts with suppliers on a regional basis. -Earlier, food products, let's say, moved together with the movement of a military unit from one region to another region, which complicated logistics. -Today, the supplier is responsible only for its region and for those military units that are there now and that are arriving there,- said the Deputy Minister of Defense.

The Ministry of Defense told about updated sleeping bags for the military	About this informs the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. -The updated sleeping bag has several key improvements. In particular, it is lighter, has a water-repellent cover and is comfortable to use in any temperature. The weight has become less compared to the previous model and should not exceed 3.8 kg,- said Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. For example, the previous version of the sleeping bag was single-layer. Instead, the new version has three parts: an inner sleeping bag, a liner and an outer water-repellent cover. The liner protects the sleeping bag from the inside from dirt and natural moisture of the human body. The outer water-repellent and vapor-permeable cover helps protect the military from rain, snow, fog or wind. The modular system of the updated sleeping bag allows you to use it in different temperature conditions. For example, in a room, a soldier can sleep only in an inner bag, and on the street - in a full set. Also, the new sleeping system is made of a three-layer fabric with a membrane that provides high vapor permeability and retains heat. Thanks to the compression bag of the new model, the sleeping bag can be additionally pulled down and attached to the backpack together with the field carpet.

Overwhelm -Orlana-: how we manage to destroy Russian UAVs	Military expert Petro Chernyk answered this question. — The enemy has now begun to lose many more unmanned aerial systems, especially high-altitude ones, which fly at an altitude of several kilometers. First of all, it is about their most massive reconnaissance unmanned complex -Orlan-10-, the expert notes. And he adds that a really breakthrough moment happened in the middle of this summer: - Our radio electronic struggle increased by an order of magnitude. The phenomenon consists in the fact that we managed not only to increase the production of the required amount (of REB means - Ed.), but also to greatly reduce its cost. The breakthrough did happen. And the state should be thanked for the fact that, by law, a number of restrictions were removed from the components that come to Ukraine. The second reason for the increase in the enemy's losses of operational-tactical UAVs is the improvement of the operation of portable anti-aircraft missile systems of various classes and types. — These are the same FIM-92 Stinger or excellent RBS-70 complexes, which have proven themselves very well&#8230; And we should mention one more unique thing - kamikaze drones: we have learned to use them to climb to great heights to enemy UAVs and destroy them, says a military expert. And he concludes that the three components he listed are what allowed our Defense Forces to raise the enemy UAV destruction rate so high. But Petro Chernyk advises not to be enchanted: — Because in the area of ​​radio-electronic warfare, the enemy has the second school in the world. He also knows how to work with REEs. And microelectronics can be obtained on world markets. He learns and learns quite quickly&#8230; At the same time, the expert notes that the level of destruction by our Defense Forces of such a number of operational-tactical level enemy UAVs is a truly unique phenomenon that has not yet occurred in this war. — If I had been told a year ago that it would be possible to approach the Orlan-10 with the help of another drone, and a smaller one, it would have only made me smile.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/zavalyty-orlana-yak-nam-vdayetsya-nyshhyty-rosijski-bpla/	2024-09-17T20:33:14-07:00
29 months of captivity. The history of the struggle, capture and return of the Hero of Ukraine Vikto...	During the battles for surrounded Mariupol, on April 11, 2022, Viktor Ivchuk was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine by the Decree of President Volodymyr Zelenskyi. And the very next day, April 12, Ivchuk was captured by the Russian Federation. The story of the officer's combat journey and resilience, 29 months of captivity and his return home is in the ArmyInform material. A military man originally from Vinnytsia. Studied at Mykola Pirogov Vinnytsia National Medical University. 2014 year. An officer in the 95th separate airborne assault brigade of the Armed Forces participated in battles in the east of our country. At that time, he was the head of the medical service. The fighting was heavy and intense, so Ivchuk, together with his comrades, provided first aid to wounded soldiers and civilians, and carried out their evacuation. On July 27, 2014, during the assault on the Savur Tomb, the officer received a shrapnel gunshot wound to the right hand. But, despite this, he organized a real special operation, thanks to which it was possible to evacuate 60 wounded from the battlefield. For this, Ivchuk was awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky III degree. For several years, he held the post of deputy head of the military hospital in Dnipro, while simultaneously studying for a master's degree at the Ukrainian Military Medical Academy. A month before the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, Colonel Ivchuk was transferred from Kyiv to Mariupol and appointed to the position of commander of the 555th military hospital. The hospital continued its work even after February 24, 2022, despite constant shelling by Russian troops. Until March 16, when the last building of the institution was destroyed by bombing at the same time as the Mariupol Drama Theater, where hundreds of civilians were hiding. Thanks to the efforts of hospital doctors, hundreds of lives of the defenders of Mariupol and its residents were saved. They worked despite everything, although operations had to be carried out under fire, in basements, in helmets and body armor. In March 2022, a bomb hit the hospital - the facility was targeted by the enemy. All the medical personnel, together with the wounded, divided into two groups. The first one was to join the Ukrainian military at Azovstal. The other, including Commander Viktor Ivchuk, went to the Ilyich metallurgical plant. On April 11, 2022, the head of the Mariupol military hospital, colonel of the medical service, Viktor Ivchuk, was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine with the award of the -Golden Star- order. -On April 11, 2022, by the decree of President Volodymyr Zelensky, my husband was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. In the morning, I received telephone greetings, and I knew nothing about the decree - it was not at all before that. The next day I received a message from an unknown number: -We are being taken prisoner.- I had a mixed feeling. On the one hand, she was happy that her husband was still alive, albeit in captivity. At that time, no one even imagined what Russian captivity was. On the other hand, it was very infuriating that the occupiers, contrary to the norms of international humanitarian law and the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, forcibly deprived the doctors of their freedom. They should have let them go! But no. They said they would trade them for their military,- recalls Victoria Ivchuk. The wife remembers the last phone conversation with her husband at the beginning of April 22nd - he was saying goodbye to her and her son. What followed were 29 long months of enemy captivity. According to his wife (and she was told this by military men who had been released from captivity earlier), the leadership of the colony in Olenivka allowed our medics, including Viktor, to treat and care for the wounded, whom they took out of Mariupol. But when the terrorist attack happened, they were not allowed to join the victims. People were burning alive, but no one was saving them. And a year after that tragedy in Olenivka, his wife Viktoria received a letter with a stamp of the Russian post office on the envelope. In the envelope was a piece of paper with a few lines: -I'm fine.- She recognized Victor's handwriting. But there was no date in the letter - it was difficult to understand when it was written. As it turned out later, shortly after the prisoners were taken from Olenivka to Stary Oskol, the colony distributed to everyone the same pieces of paper with the identical text: -Everything is fine with me.- Victoria, together with the families of captured and missing doctors, created the public organization -Military Doctors of Ukraine-, which included relatives of prisoners from Kherson region, Donetsk region, and Kharkiv region. Together, they gathered all the information related to the prisoners, which was transmitted by the relevant authorities. The NGO cooperates with governmental, human rights and public organizations. Has its own site. In June of this year, Victoria and other women, whose relatives defended Mariupol and are illegally held in Russian torture camps, had an audience with the Pope and asked him to facilitate the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war. During the meeting, Victoria Ivchuk presented the pontiff with a symbolic medical gown with photos of captured doctors. The officer returned to Ukraine after the exchange on September 13, 2024. His son, wife, parents and brother were waiting for him. Photos from Victoria Ivchuk's personal archive and from open sources	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/29-misyacziv-nevoli-istoriya-borotby-polonu-j-povernennya-geroya-ukrayiny-viktora-ivchuka/	2024-09-17T20:21:49-07:00
Wounded in battle: about payments to defenders during treatment	ArmyInform explains when and what wounded defenders can receive and why payments may stop. By the way, currently all social guarantees also apply to those military personnel who perform combat missions outside Ukraine - on the territory of the aggressor state. In the event of injury to a military serviceman, the payment of financial support for the last position held for the entire period of treatment is preserved. Currently it can continue not more than 12 consecutive months. Here we are talking about the time a military man spends in hospitals or hospitals, as well as medical leave. This usually takes several months. If there is a need for longer treatment, then no later than 4 months after the start of treatment, you need to undergo VLC. It is on the basis of this decision that the payment of financial support should continue in the future. Tip: During the entire period of treatment or medical leave, stay in touch with your immediate commander and report any changes. Our own experience shows that this prevents payment problems. This payment is included in the list of additional rewards. In the army, it is better known as -combat-. She is also a wounded soldier assigned. But there are certain nuances. When is it paid? Now about the nuances. The basis for this payment is a certificate about the circumstances of the injury (injury, contusion, mutilation), so-called form 5. It must be provided in a military unit. And it must be stated that the injury is related to the defense of the Motherland. If there is no such wording in the certificate, then the money will most likely not be credited. The certificate must also state that the serviceman was wearing personal protective equipment, did not commit a criminal offense, did not attempt to injure himself, and was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs. All the listed items are grounds for refusing to pay additional compensation. One more nuance. After discharge from the hospital, the -combat- 100,000 should continue to be paid only if you are sent on leave for treatment due to a serious injury. This should be spelled out in the conclusion of the VLK. If the injury is not serious, then the payment of 100,000 is stopped. It is also worth remembering that this additional reward is calculated in proportion to the number of days. That is, as well as -combat- (for example, if you were in the hospital for 20 days, then the additional reward will be approximately 65 thousand hryvnias). If additional reward after wounding is not paid, then a report should be written in the name of the commander for inclusion in the order for payment of additional reward and a copy of the certificate of wounding should be attached to this report. If the payment is refused, and you consider it illegal, you can contact the hotline of the Ministry of Defense or lawyers. Case law shows that, as a rule, military personnel are still credited with all guaranteed benefits, if there are grounds for this. Wounding of servicemen is one of the grounds for the payment of material assistance for solving social and household issues. This is defined by decision of the Minister of Defense dated September 16 January 2024. Such assistance may be paid once a year in the amount of a monthly allowance. More about how to get this help can be read here. If the injury resulted in disability or partial loss of working capacity, in this case you can also count on one-time cash assistance. Its size depends on the established disability group and the subsistence minimum for able-bodied persons, which is revised every year. If the disability occurred as a result of an injury during the performance of military service duties, then the following payment amounts have been established in 2024: One-time assistance is provided not only in the event of injury during the performance of military service duties, but also , who received a disability during military service as a result of illness or injury. The amount of the benefit also depends on the set disability group: A one-time benefit is provided in case of partial disability. The Medical and Social Expert Commission (MSEK) must establish the degree of disability in percentage. The amount of payment will depend on the established degree. For servicemen who are partially disabled due to injury (contusion, trauma or mutilation), illness during the performance of military service duties, the basic amount from which the amount of payment will be calculated is 211,960 hryvnias. For example, if the MSEK established a 20% loss of working capacity for you, then the one-time benefit amount will be UAH 42,392. Finally, one more piece of advice: keep all medical documents (form No. 100, conclusions of VLK, MSEK, certificate on the circumstances of the injury, etc.). Without them, it will be very problematic to prove your right to payments later.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/poranennya-v-boyu-pro-vyplaty-zahysnykam-pid-chas-likuvannya/	2024-09-17T20:13:59-07:00
There is fake creativity in the swamps again: screenshots of fake orders of the Ministry of Defense ...	So, recently, a photo of order No. 274t dated September 4, 2024, allegedly from the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, has been circulating on the Internet, in which, with the aim of -following European values-, they order to create special conditions of service for -servicemen representing LGBTQ+-. Also, full-time psychologists of military units are supposed to conduct testing of personnel for belonging to these communities. The so-called document is fake, as is its content. First, the -order- does not meet the requirements of official record keeping. Secondly, the Chief of the General Staff cannot sign the order of the Ministry of Defense. Thirdly, the content of the fake document contradicts at least the Constitution of Ukraine and several laws. In addition, this is not the first time that Russian fakers have tried to ridicule and humiliate LGBT+ representatives, including the military. In the face of a large-scale invasion, Russia describes itself as a territory for everyone who believes exclusively in -traditional values.- And Ukraine is trying to be shown as a country where the authorities are forcibly engaged in -LGBTzation- of citizens. In this way, the aggressor country demonstrates its disdain for the democratic system, opposing it to the -Russian measure-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/na-bolotah-znovu-fejkokreatyv-v-soczmerezhah-gulyayut-skriny-pidroblenyh-nakaziv-minoborony-pro-lgbt/	2024-09-17T20:00:25-07:00

Proof that their main goal is scorched earth all over the world. It is not for nothing that the Kremlin does not allow international missions to the Kursk region so that no one sees how their aircraft and artillery destroy empty houses, and sometimes with local citizens inside,- Khorne group commented on the video.

He flew in and demined — drones help our advance	The video of the combat work was released on September 17 on the unit's channel. Our aerial scouts noticed anti-tank mines installed by the enemy on one of the roads, which made movement impossible. To demine the road, a drone was sent to the site, which landed directly on one of the mines and triggered the detonation of the ammunition. After that, the road, although it lost the quality of asphalt, became safe for movement. As reported by ArmyInform, the soldiers of the 501st separate battalion of marines thanks to one FPV drone stopped another attempt of Russian invaders to storm Ukrainian positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/17/pryletiv-i-rozminuvav-dron-dopomagayut-nashym-nastupaty/	2024-09-17T11:37:21-07:00

One hundred thousand hryvnias and you... a criminal - the swindlers made suspects out of evasions	This was reported by the State Bureau of Investigation. The DBR employees informed about the suspicion of the elder of one of the districts of the Radyvyliv city council and the law enforcement officer, who organized earnings from the evaders. The elder issued summonses to summon men to the military commissariat. During the issuance of subpoenas, he hinted that he could help with evasion. -The scheme consisted in the fact that a law enforcement officer he knew artificially opened criminal proceedings against a conscript, for which he could be given a suspended sentence. During the investigation and while serving the sentence, the -clients- avoided mobilization,- the SBI said. The law enforcement officers note that the service&#8221; cost an average of 100,000 UAH The Starosta and the law enforcement officer were notified of the suspicion of obstructing the activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by a prior conspiracy by a group of persons, obtaining an unlawful benefit by prior conspiracy, combined with extortion (Part 2 of Article 28, Part 1 of Article 114-1 and Part 3 of Article 368 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine).

For the first time, Ukrainian companies will be able to participate in tenders of the Drone Coalitio...	About this informs September 17 Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The series of tenders includes two lots: for the production of advanced FPV drones and interceptor drones. Ukrainian companies are invited to participate in these tenders for the first time, which is an important step to support domestic production. To participate in the tender, manufacturers must register on the website Ministry of Defense of Great Britain and submit your applications. Proposals for FPV drones are accepted until October 14th and for interceptor drones until November 11th. All submitted applications will be reviewed by members of the Drone Coalition, after which the winners will be selected. The companies that win the tenders will receive orders for the production of drones for further testing and evaluation. If the test results are successful, a large-scale order of FPV drones from the winning companies is planned. -The goal of this coalition is to ensure the industrial production of FPV drones in order to create a technological advantage over the enemy in the long term,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Digitalization. According to her, it is important not only to scale up production in the West, but also to support Ukrainian companies capable of producing such equipment. Therefore, the MOU for the first time involves domestic manufacturers to participate in tenders. We remind you that the Coalition of Drones was created in February 2024 during the 19th meeting in the format -Rammstein-. The initiative is proposed by Latvia and coordinated together with Great Britain. The Coalition includes 16 partner countries that already supply Ukraine with drones. With accumulated funds in the amount of 50 million euros, it is planned to purchase another 20-30 thousand drones.

-I will not step back-: Stalin's order is read to the occupiers in the Kharkiv region	About this in an interview for ArmyInform told the spokesman of the -Kharkiv- OTU, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. — In the Kharkiv direction, cases are known when the commanders of the occupiers read order No. 227 in front of the formation, using it as an additional motivational tool, he said. According to the spokesman, this indicates that Russians identify the events of the Second World War with modern aggression against Ukraine. They believe that they are continuing the heroic struggle against fascism and Nazism. - They connect all this into a single whole with modern events. This simplifies the perception of the conflict by Russians, as they are forced to believe that Ukraine is not a victim of aggression, but a continuation of the same -fascism- that their grandfathers fought against, Vitaly Sarantsev explained. More about it read in ArmiyaInform's long interview with Vitaliy Sarantseva.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/17/ny-shagu-nazad-stalinskyj-nakaz-zachytuyut-okupantam-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-09-17T10:44:16-07:00

The Armed Forces explained why Russian inhumans execute Ukrainian prisoners	About this in an interview for ArmyInform told Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, spokesman of the Kharkiv Technical University. The occupiers closely monitor the reaction of Ukrainians to the war crimes of the Russian military, collect comments, and then show their own servicemen what they are called to do with them in captivity. — The case with the 155th Marine Infantry Brigade of the Russian Federation, when they put the head of a Ukrainian soldier separated from his body on a stake and bragged about it on video, proves just that. Of course, this provoked quite outrageous comments on social networks, with calls for the same treatment of Russian prisoners. The propagandists of the Russian Federation collect all these posts (made, in particular, not by Ukrainians themselves, but by Russian bots) and use them for information and propaganda work both among civilians and among the Russian military. In this way, they show, they say, this is what will happen to those who surrender to captivity, the spokesman explained. In addition, the Russians hope to provoke or stage similar war crimes already on the part of the Ukrainian military in order to influence both the Russians and Ukraine's foreign partners with the goal of depriving Ukrainians of international support.

Oleksandr Zavitnevich told what the Kursk operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is for Putin	About it on Facebook wrote the head of the Committee of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on National Security, Defense and Intelligence Oleksandr Zavitnevich. -Russia understands only force - one of the main conclusions that the Ukrainians in alliance with their partners proved during the years of the great war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Another conclusion, which Ukraine knows well from the history of interaction with an aggressive neighbor, is that the indecision of those who possess this greater power to force the Russian Federation to accept the proposed conditions for the cessation of aggression motivates Moscow in any way to look for an opportunity to freeze the final and fair resolution of the problem. And all this in order to wait for the right opportunity and implement all their insidious aggressive plans, rejecting all previous agreements,- &#8211; the post says. According to Oleksandr Zavitnevich, all the peace-making rhetoric of the Kremlin is the art of quackery and quackery. It can make a certain impression, but at the level of a political show. -The Kursk operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is a real political knockdown of Putin, it highlighted the entire current state of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, the management system. Even in the information space of the enemy, sometimes, albeit short-lived, signs of intelligence - the leadership of the Russian Federation is not so wise and far-sighted and that under his tenure, the Russian Federation is in for a disaster. Right now is the right moment to beat the enemy, not to give him a chance to recover, to recover, to end this war on fair terms by signing them at the Second Peace Summit initiated by Ukraine-, &#8211; the head of the Committee notes. And he adds that it is important that the partners finally agree to President Volodymyr Zelenskyi's proposal to give Ukraine permission to use long-range weapons deep into the territory of the Russian Federation: -The national resistance of Ukrainians did everything possible to ensure that the Europeans avoided trenches and air strikes. In order for the heroism and sacrifices of Ukrainians not to be in vain, so that the Russian beast does not invade Europe, only one thing is needed - the appropriate decisions of our partners in support of Volodymyr Zelenskyi's proposals-.

Conscripts are replacing stormtroopers: the Russians have found a way to replenish losses on the fro...	Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv-, reported this on the -Suspilne Novosti- broadcast. -In order to take personnel from secondary tasks, the enemy replaces stormtroopers or those who are capable of conducting assaults at all with conscripts who perform secondary tasks,- he said. Instead, those servicemen who were freed due to such rotations are redirected by the Russian command directly to conduct offensive actions. At the same time, conscripts who perform special tasks to ensure logistics on the territory of the Russian Federation are in the same risk zone as any other servicemen of the Russian army. — We inflict fire damage on the enemy, wherever he is. And if his forces and means appear in the range of our FPV drones or artillery, then, accordingly, they are destroyed even at the stage of advancing towards the Ukrainian border, the spokesman noted. The military man emphasized that, as a result, conscripts of the Russian army are also dying on Russian territory. In addition, Vitaly Sarantsev reminded that in Russia there is a practice of enlisting conscripts into combat operations after 4 months of service. — They are agitating conscripts who have served certain terms to switch to contract service. They are promised a powerful social package so that they have already moved to another status and they can be involved in directly conducting hostilities, the military explained. So, despite the fact that Russian conscripts currently perform tasks of a secondary nature, they are already participating in hostilities and are a legitimate military target. Earlier, ArmyInform told, how the Russians use strokoviks in the Kharkiv direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/17/strokovykamy-zaminyayut-shturmovykiv-rosiyany-znajshly-sposib-popovnyuvaty-vtraty-na-peredovij/	2024-09-17T02:31:54-07:00

Logistics - in manual mode - in Kharkiv Oblast forces the occupiers to surrender	Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv-, reported this on the -Suspilne Novosti- broadcast. Cases when the enemy surrenders in the Kharkiv direction have become more frequent. Yesterday, there were two Russian prisoners in the north of Kharkiv region, and today four occupiers surrendered. — The adversary is forced to find new routes for logistics, to change logistics methods. If earlier he used the technique in some places, now he does all this exclusively in manual mode, that is, he carries everything by hand, he said. This situation arose as a result of the successful actions of the Defense Forces, primarily fighters from the UAV units, who broke the supply chains in the enemy's near rear with the help of bomber drones and kamikaze drones. — An opponent who has been in advanced positions for a long time does not receive adequate support. We manage to break the logistics chains and, accordingly, they sit without food, without water. Of course, this in a certain way affects their moral and psychological state and they prefer to surrender themselves to captivity than to return to their commanders, to the inhumane treatment that is organized in them directly in the places, the spokesman explained. The military emphasized that the motivational measures for the personnel of the Russian occupying forces by the enemy command have the opposite effect to what the Russians wanted. — They only contribute to the enemy losing faith in the military and political leadership and, accordingly, they choose the right path for themselves in terms of surrendering, — Vitaly Sarantsev concluded. The spokesman said that cases of desertion of the Russian military are currently observed in several areas of the Kharkiv direction - in the Vovchansk region, near Hlyboky and Lukyantsi. -The personnel have a certain percentage of demoralization and refuse to follow orders, refuse to carry out combat missions, refuse to carry out special tasks of casualty evacuation or logistical support,- he said. The military expressed hope that this trend will continue and strengthen. The Ukrainian military is interested and takes the necessary measures to make the enemy understand that his only chance to stay alive is surrender. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Kharkiv direction to surrender the occupiers are being captured by hopelessness, recently the number of captives has increased.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/17/logistyka-v-ruchnomu-rezhymi-na-harkivshhyni-zmushuye-okupantiv-zdavatysya-v-polon/	2024-09-17T01:47:29-07:00

On this emphasized the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Vitaly Sarantsev in an interview with ArmiyaInform. — The Institute for the Study of War is an authoritative resource that analyzes the situation based on open data. However, its reports are often based on a large amount of information from various sources, which may change or be incomplete. At the same time, ISW does not distinguish between official and unofficial sources and very often uses propagandistic Russian materials in its analysis, he said. Voiskovy emphasized that credit should be given to the Institute's analysts, because they always refer to sources of information, providing a list of everything they used during the preparation of the report. At the same time, he noted that the Ukrainian media often unjustifiably perceive the Institute's messages as a definitive fact, thus presenting society with a distorted picture of events. — This undermines our work, the work of the official communication channels of the military-political leadership of the state, the work of communicators of the Armed Forces and Defense Forces as a whole. We are conducting a defense operation in which every action, including informing the public, must be subordinated to the interests of defense. Using unverified information, even taking it from such a powerful resource as the Institute for the Study of War, one can unknowingly play along with the enemy, the spokesman emphasized. More about the information space of modern war read in the great interview of Vitaly Sarantseva ArmiyaInform.

A cavalcade of diplomats to China, the Taliban and why the collapse of the Russian Federation: an ex...	These questions were answered by military expert Petro Chernyk. — The process of finding a formula for exiting this phase has begun. The most striking sign and argument for this is the so-called summit in Switzerland. A lot of countries gathered there, they simply wouldn't have gathered if they didn't understand some logic of the development of events, says the expert. And he notes that this process cannot be fast: - I really like historical parallels. Let's say the Americans have been negotiating with the Taliban for more than a year. Agreed, but it lasted over a year! This is despite the fact that the stakes in Ukraine and the US stakes with the Taliban are completely out of proportion. Chernyk calls the huge cavalcade of diplomats from Europe to China a second serious sign that the process of finding a way out of this war has begun. — And most importantly, Lavrov recently made a series of statements that they do not need foreign territories, that they are fighting for some Russian people who speak Russian, for the so-called Russian peace. But could there be a trap (in possible negotiations. — Ed.)? Maybe, says a military expert. And he notes that history knows many similar cases: - The brightest, the closest to us, is the Cyprus problem of 1974. Then the Turks invaded Cyprus, formed their own republic, which no one recognizes. And two large countries, primarily the United States and Great Britain, resolved this issue. But the conflict was not resolved by itself, there is no solution to it until now. Can something similar happen with the Ukrainian issue? According to Petr Chernyk, maybe. — I really don't like the word -freeze- because our conflict cannot be frozen for such a long time. There is a high probability that some new demarcation formula will be found. Of course, no one recognizes those territories in the civilized world. A large international contingent is also possible. Why not? It is only important that there are not many Russian proxies there, because they are, say, on the African or Latin American continents, the military expert emphasizes. According to him, in the future, as soon as Russia enters a breathing mode, sanctions may be partially lifted from it, and the possibility of the next Russian-Ukrainian war is only a matter of time: - But again, there is one more very important nuance. This is dangerous and not the best scenario for us, but the Russians have not achieved the most important goal. They did not liquidate Ukrainian statehood. Ukrainian state to be&#8230; And we will truly calm down only when the Russian Federation breaks up into 25-30 states, their nuclear weapons are taken away, they are cut off from free resources in Siberia, and the population that will remain around Moscow undergoes the so-called sanitization - ideological cleansing. The same as the Nazis went through after World War II. Chernyk names our further accession to NATO or the formation of a direct military alliance with the USA as an option. — If this does not happen, even if we find a very acceptable formula for us, then the issue of the Russian-Ukrainian war will only be a matter of time. As Bolshevik Lenin said: -Losing Ukraine is like losing your head.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/17/kavalkada-dyplomativ-do-kytayu-taliban-ta-do-chogo-tut-rozpad-rf-ekspert-pro-ryzyky-myrnyh-peregovoriv/	2024-09-16T20:30:32-07:00
How reports are prepared at OTU -Kharkiv-: about Telegram, news reports from the front line and the ...	The modern war of Russia against the Ukrainian people and the state of Ukraine is sometimes called the most documented and represented in the media in the history of mankind. Media coverage of hostilities plays a colossal role in shaping public opinion about the war in Ukraine and abroad, and influences public attitudes and policies of foreign partners. ArmiyaInform spoke with Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, spokesman for the operational-tactical group -Kharkiv-, about the information component of modern warfare. The first part of the interview: Kharkivshchyna as a friend of Syria: the spokesman of the OTU -Kharkiv- called the most despicable purpose of the application KABs. — On the Telegram channels of Ukrainian units and individual military units, and following them in the Ukrainian media, videos are often shared not only of destroyed equipment or positions of the occupiers, but also of liquidated enemy personnel. On the one hand, this is a demonstration of the effectiveness of the combat work of the defenders of Ukraine. On the other hand, there are accusations about the inhumanity of the distribution of such videos, and in some cases they even try to talk about violations of international law, laws and customs of war. How justified are such criticisms of the Ukrainian military? Can the published video recordings be used against the Defense Forces of Ukraine? - Several main points should be taken into account here in order to maintain a very shaky balance between the appropriateness of placing this or that publication and the impropriety, so to speak. On the one hand, the video that demonstrates the effectiveness of our defenders is a kind of message to society that the army is fighting and winning. This is also a kind of report to our citizens who help the Defense Forces with donations. Also, these videos show the average Russian occupier that he could be the next victim. At the same time, posting on information resources video clips depicting the bodies of the dead or the suffering of the wounded may be considered a violation of international humanitarian law, in particular, norms on respect for human dignity or rules for treating the wounded. Everyone who is involved in the work in the information sphere, be it television, news sites, or channels in social networks, has a special responsibility for how they talk about war, because the constant promotion of such content can lead to the desensitization and normalization of violence in society. It should be remembered that every word, every photo, every video frame has weight, especially in wartime. Before disseminating any information, the media person should be aware of its potential consequences. Can it be used by the enemy and how? Will it harm the morale of our defenders? Will it cause panic among civilians? We must be responsible for every word, because not only our reputation, but also the fate of the country depends on it. — I agree, but sometimes one gets the impression that accusations of inhumanity or violations of international law against the Ukrainian military are excessively scrutinizing, especially against the background of what the Russian occupiers openly indulge in and brag about — murders, torture, indiscriminate shelling, or even special targeting destruction of residential buildings, educational and medical facilities, energy facilities etc. One gets the impression that the aggressor is allowed to do everything - he and the aggressor, his crimes have already become a general characteristic of the occupier, and therefore no one is interested. Whereas Ukrainians are forced to fight -in white gloves- - there is such meticulous, increased attention to us. - Indeed, a certain cognitive disparity is visible: on the one hand, we feel the war crimes of the Russian Federation, which has already become the norm for everything of the world, and on the other hand, increased demands are being made to Ukraine regarding compliance with international humanitarian law. For many, this gives rise to a sense of injustice and double standards. But it should be remembered that one of the rules of International Humanitarian Law is non-reciprocity or non-response to wrongful actions of the enemy. This means that respect for the laws of war does not depend on the actions of an enemy who does or does not follow the same rules. The laws of war must be respected at all times, regardless of the actions of the enemy. That is, if the Russians shelled Okhmatdyt, it does not mean that we have the right to shell some children's hospital in the Russian Federation. The rule -an eye for an eye- does not apply here. Therefore, our task is to spread true information about the war and the crimes of the Russian Federation, involve foreign media, involve international organizations in the investigation of these war crimes. In any case, we must adhere to international humanitarian law, even in spite of provocations by the enemy, because, among other things, this is also an important factor in obtaining international support, including military aid. - One more related question. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are hitting enemy positions, including across the border, on Russian territory. But sometimes we get the impression that our territory is being hit regularly, constantly, a lot, and we do not strike back or hit very little, because we were forbidden by the Western allies, we were not given ammunition, etc. Is it even necessary to talk about the fact that the armed forces are also inflicting fire damage on the territory of the Russian Federation? - The enemy must be destroyed wherever he is. Russia has attacked us and is waging an aggressive war of aggression under a fictitious pretext. the Russians seek to destroy the Ukrainian state and the Ukrainian people. We know how cruel the enemy is in his actions, without any moral and ethical restraints. Therefore, it should be destroyed, in particular, on its own territory. According to international law, every state has the right to self-defense. Russia is the aggressor and is fully responsible for all the destruction and casualties on both sides. And of course we have to talk about it. — Quite often, Ukrainian media disseminate information about the situation at the front with an appeal to foreign sources, which are perceived as more authoritative and reliable than Ukrainian ones. For example, reports citing the daily reports of the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) as a primary source have become very popular since the beginning of the large-scale invasion. At the same time, it is not difficult to notice that in many cases the institute's report is reduced to a simple recording and transfer of information from open sources, including official data of the Defense Forces of Ukraine — operational information regarding the Russian invasion of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, information messages of operational-strategic and operational-tactical groups troops, speeches of officially authorized spokespeople, etc. Why is this happening, why do our media people often cite ISW as a primary source even where the institute's report simply repeats official reports? - The Institute for the Study of War is an authoritative resource that analyzes the situation based on open data. However, its reports are often based on a large amount of information from different sources, which may change or be incomplete. At the same time, ISW does not distinguish between official and unofficial sources and very often uses propagandistic Russian materials in its analysis. To the credit of its analysts, they always cite the sources of information, providing a list of everything they used in the preparation of the report. But some of our media probably need to be scolded in this matter, because they perceive the information reported by the Institute as a given. For some reason, it is believed that if certain information is published by ISW, then it means that it has real confirmation and acquires official status. As a result, they sometimes present society with a distorted picture of events. I believe that this is unacceptable. In addition, it undermines our work, the work of the official communication channels of the military-political leadership of the state, the work of communicators of the Armed Forces and the Defense Forces in general. We are conducting a defense operation in which every action, including public information, must be subordinated to the interests of defense. Using unverified information, even from such a powerful resource as the Institute for the Study of War, can unwittingly play along with the enemy. - Can you open the veil of secrecy a little, how a regular daily information message is prepared in Kharkiv OTU? - During the day, we receive information from the areas of the front, from all the brigades that perform combat tasks in our operational-tactical group . Of course, we also work in units during trips. We work with data provided by intelligence. It should be taken into account that the war is very dynamic, the course of hostilities is very fluid. Therefore, in order not to harm our troops, certain information, of course, does not go to the general public, but we organize other information into a daily summary. We may provide some information with a delay, for example, it refers to those moments when we have made some progress or reached new milestones. — And do you take information from any Russian propaganda resources? Do you monitor them? - Of course. Monitoring of the information space, including that of the enemy, continues around the clock. We intercept all information related to the course of hostilities. We, of course, analyze how the enemy presents news and what he talks about. Now we can conclude that the depopulation of Ukrainians — and not only the military, but also civilians — on Russian propaganda resources has reached the point where calls for the total genocide of the entire Ukrainian people are already being presented as something completely commonplace and something that should not arouse in Russians no objections. -Nazis- for Ukrainians is perhaps the most moderate option, there are many much worse ones. The use of such radical images not only incites hatred, but also creates a hostile atmosphere that makes genocidal actions against Ukrainians acceptable in the eyes of Russian society. — But these media can be read by Ukrainian media professionals and ordinary readers. What advice would you give them when they accidentally or purposefully go to an enemy resource? How to work with the information received from there? - The most important thing is that you don't have to go there at all. There are many interesting and useful information resources, both domestic and foreign. Russian ones do not belong to them. But if you still got there, then I advise you not to fall into -betrayal-, because the entire information module on Russian propaganda resources is built in such a way that it can cause panic in an unprepared reader. It should be understood that these channels are propaganda, that they present a distorted reality, and it will be very difficult for an untrained reader to read this or that information. In general, it is important to maintain critical thinking and observe certain rules of safety and media hygiene. —Most of the Russian propaganda resources available to the Ukrainian reader work on the Telegram platform. Since the beginning of the large-scale war, there has even been a certain phenomenon of the so-called Zyu-voenkors, who, of course, are not any military correspondents, but act purely as propagandists of the aggressive war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, providing its media support. Telegram is very popular in Ukraine, but it has a lot of frankly manipulative channels and hostile propaganda, so it is increasingly believed that it can be dangerous for the national security of Ukraine. So what to do with Telegram in Ukraine? - In my opinion, we should not abandon Telegram or ban it. Banning such platforms may resemble the actions of authoritarian regimes, where control over information is used to suppress dissent. However, its status needs to be determined. Is it messenger or media? If it is a media, then its activities must comply with Ukrainian legislation that regulates the media sector. This means that it must comply with requirements regarding the reliability of information, countering propaganda and protecting national security. This issue needs to be clearly defined at the legislative level to avoid abuse and to ensure both freedom of speech and safety. In addition, a clear definition of the status will make it possible to establish who is responsible for the content that is distributed through Telegram channels. In general, in matters of the functioning of not only Telegram, but also social networks, Ukraine should -show its teeth- more often. We must have strong legislation and tools to monitor, regulate and, if necessary, control platforms that can be used to undermine our country's sovereignty or spread harmful information. —You mentioned the Kursk region, and in continuation of the information topic, I also want to ask about the Russian prisoners of war who were captured by the Defense Forces. It is noticeable that Russian propaganda has strengthened allegations that Ukrainians treat prisoners cruelly, on the one hand, and is trying to increase hatred of the Russian military among Ukrainians, on the other. - This is true. The case with the 155th Marine Corps Brigade of the Russian Federation, when they set the head of a Ukrainian soldier on a stake and bragged about it on video, proves just that. Of course, this provoked quite outrageous comments on social networks, with calls for the same treatment of Russian prisoners. The propagandists of the Russian Federation collect all these posts (made, in particular, not by Ukrainians themselves, but by Russian bots) and use them for information and propaganda work both among civilians and among the Russian military. In this way, they show, they say, this is what will happen to those who surrender to captivity. Such work with the Russian military has certain fruits - some of them prefer to self-destruct - shoot themselves, blow themselves up with a grenade or even strangle themselves with an Esmarch tourniquet - than surrender to captivity. - But at the same time, there are reports in the Ukrainian media from brigades about how wounded Russian servicemen surrender as prisoners - Yes, this happens, and it has been happening, in particular, in our direction, since May more than 50 Russian occupiers surrendered as prisoners. Among the vivid cases, there was a report from the -Charter- brigade about how Ukrainian fighters, with the help of a drone, threw water and a note with instructions on how to surrender to a wounded Russian to a wounded Russian. Then he was taken to Ukrainian positions by drone, and everything was fine with him. In general, Ukrainians treat prisoners in a civilized manner, this cannot even be compared with the conditions in which our prisoners of war in the Russian Federation find themselves - it is enough to compare the appearance of prisoners during exchanges. —In fact, sometimes it is very surprising when Russian propagandists and Russian users of social networks are outraged by reports about the rescue of Russian soldiers, about the fact that they are being taken prisoner. Why does it cause such hatred in them that the Ukrainians saved their military man? - Here, probably, it is a matter of their mentality as a whole. Heroic death is cultivated in Russia. This goes back at least since World War II. A prime example is Stalin's infamous Order No. 227 -let's take a step back.- Surrender is considered something shameful, if a person surrendered even wounded and unable to continue fighting, they still consider him a traitor and a criminal, even his closest relatives disown him very often. This attitude towards prisoners in Russian society also prompts their soldiers to die or lay hands on themselves, but not to surrender. The Russian command constantly warms this attitude. It is in our Kharkiv direction that cases are known when the commanders of the occupiers read order No. 227 in front of the formation, using it as an additional motivational tool. This, by the way, shows that the Russians identify the events of the Second World War with the events that are happening now. They believe that they are continuing the heroic struggle against fascism and Nazism, etc. They connect all this into a single whole with modern events. This simplifies the perception of the conflict by Russians, because they are forced to believe that Ukraine is not a victim of aggression, but a continuation of the same -fascism- that their grandfathers fought against. The very reports about our humane treatment of Russian prisoners destroy the image of bloodthirsty -Nazis- they created for Ukrainians. When it turns out that this is not true, it makes them extremely angry. This breaks the picture that Russian propagandists have been creating for their fellow citizens for decades about Ukraine and Ukrainians. — In your opinion, do the Ukrainian media cope with keeping the propaganda blow from the Russian Federation and at the same time competently informing the Ukrainian society? Do we win this war information or do we lose more? On the one hand, most Ukrainian media resist the flow of misinformation by the Russian Federation. For example, factual initiatives and independent journalistic projects significantly reduce the impact of Russian narratives within the country and beyond. It is also worth noting a certain increase in the level of media literacy of Ukrainian citizens. On the other hand, Russian propaganda, which has huge financial resources and media platforms, continues to be a threat, especially at the international level. As for the question of whether we win the information war, the answer is difficult. In many aspects, Ukraine has won important victories, in particular in shaping a positive international image and coverage of the truth about Russian aggression. However, Russian propaganda still affects certain audiences, especially in the west and in countries where Russian media have a strong position, so we all have a lot of work. By the way, literally it became known that the USA, Canada and the United Kingdom have launched a joint diplomatic campaign against sources of Russian influence in the world. In addition, the United States has imposed sanctions on the Russian propaganda channel of Russia Today and one of the main mouthpieces of the Kremlin Dmitry Kiselev. You can only congratulate these decisions, as this is another step towards our victory.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/17/yak-gotuyut-zvedennya-v-otu-harkiv-pro-telegram-vidosy-z-peredovoyi-ta-instytut-vyvchennya-vijny/	2024-09-16T20:19:49-07:00
the Russian IPSO attacks: why does the enemy lie about payments for the status of a child of war	Yes, since the beginning of September, a video has been circulating there, which talks about the alleged entry into force of the new law No. 4995 on the status of -children of war-, according to which from September 1, 2024, children will receive 15 thousand hryvnias each month for three years. The video shows the website of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and screenshots from the Diya portal about the status of a child of war. The service identifier is 01199. In fact, this information is not true, it is distributed with the aim of misleading the public and increasing the degree of social tension in our state. Law No. 4995, which is referred to in video, was adopted back in 2017 and concerns the provision of housing for families of fallen ATO soldiers. In addition, according to with the service identifier 01199, it is indeed possible to obtain the status of -child of war-, but this only applies to persons who are citizens of Ukraine and who were less than 18 years old at the time of the end of the Second World War (September 2, 1945). State Propaganda Russia's apparatus uses TikTok to broadcast Kremlin narratives, spread disinformation, and IPSO. At the beginning of 2024, the social network even introduced restrictions on the distribution of content from the accounts of Russian propagandists. One of the most famous examples of Russian IPSO in TikTok, which is aimed at demoralizing Ukrainian society, are videos with allegedly Ukrainian military personnel and demotivating comments in them. . Text messages or a voiceover blame the Ukrainian authorities for all problems, not the Russian Federation, which is waging a terrorist war against our country. In this way, the enemy is trying to create a split within the society. In some cases, the Russians decorate real Ukrainian videos from the front in their own way, in others they try to pretend that they are showing servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, applying stickers in the form of chevrons, etc. The peak of the next wave of distribution of such videos coincided with the beginning of the mobilization campaign, so their goal was and remains the disruption of mobilization. Research shows that almost 20% of search results on TikTok contain fake or information that misleads users. Because of this, several countries around the world have already taken the initiative to ban this social network.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/17/rosijske-ipso-atakuye-navishho-vorog-breshe-pro-vyplaty-za-status-dytyna-vijny/	2024-09-16T20:12:29-07:00
Two in one: Poland has developed the newest UAV — a scout that can be an artilleryman	As claim the developers of the aircraft from the Polish company WB Electronics, this UAV significantly expands the user's situational awareness, while giving him the ability to safely observe rapidly changing situations on the battlefield or in other environments, ArmyInform reports. One of the main features of X-FRONTER is the use of a military-grade encrypted communication line to control it. This technology provides stable communication protected from jamming attempts, which allows the drone to effectively perform reconnaissance and strike missions at a distance of several kilometers from the operator. With this level of protection, infantry units can rely on the X-FRONTER to conduct surveillance and precision attacks in difficult combat environments. The X-FRONTER is capable of carrying a small explosive payload, including thermobaric, fragmentation, and cluster warheads. This ability makes it not only a reconnaissance tool, but also an effective means of inflicting point strikes on the enemy. In addition, the design of the drone allows it to be easily adapted for different missions, including additional modules such as: infrared markers, devices for installing smoke curtains and other technical innovations. Another important technology implemented in X-FRONTER is the capability for swarm operations. This drone can work in a group with other drones, dividing tasks among themselves. For example, several X-FRONTERs can perform reconnaissance, while other drones equipped with explosives act as mobile artillery, striking the enemy. This greatly expands the tactical capabilities of infantry on the battlefield. The design of the drone from the Polish manufacturer in the folded state resembles a PET bottle in size and shape, which allows you to easily carry it with you. The drone is capable of reaching a speed of up to 60 kilometers per hour and a height of up to 300 meters. In the unfolded state, the X-FRONTER is quite a classic quadcopter, that is, a four-rotor aircraft with symmetrically located -shoulders- around a cylindrical fuselage. Its -hands- with stationary engines and propellers are hidden right in the hull, thanks to which both transportation and preparation for flight take place quickly and without problems, and the absence of protruding elements prevents them from being damaged during transportation. Flight time is up to 40 minutes, which gives infantry units considerable operational flexibility. This flight duration allows the drone to perform long missions, providing reliable support to troops in various situations. X-FRONTER is a versatile tool that can significantly increase the combat capabilities of infantry units. Thanks to its compact size, high mobility, encrypted communication and the ability to operate in swarms, this drone becomes indispensable for a wide range of tasks on the battlefield. The Polish developer presented a new compact and deadly X-FRONTER infantry drone.

This is directly the city of Vovchansk and the settlements adjacent to it. There, the enemy continues to attack the city, conduct street battles. There, he continues to try to wedge himself into the depth of our defense systems and inflict fire damage using a variety of weapons, he said. However, the occupiers face persistent resistance from units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, which inflict losses on the enemy and force him to abandon his tasks. Thanks to the successful actions of the Ukrainian defenders, the Russian invaders were forced to reduce their activity and refuse to carry out assault actions in separate areas in the north of Kharkiv region. — If we take other directions, in particular, Staritsa, Liptsi, Hlyboke, Lukyantsi, the enemy is not currently conducting any active actions there. But this does not mean that he left and gave up the offensive. No, he is building up his forces, he is conducting an internal rotation of units. Where it is possible, he is trying to carry out logistical support measures, build up the communication system, build up the management system. This is evidence that he is still preparing to carry out offensive actions in certain directions with the aim of restoring the lost position, the spokesman noted. He emphasized that the Defense Forces, under favorable conditions, are trying to advance and advance, and also regularly inflict effective fire damage on the occupiers. — We are improving our own tactical position and little by little we are liberating our land from the Russian occupiers, Vitaly Sarantsev concluded.

The first is the identification of units of the Defense Forces with the subsequent task of fire damage on positions and our forces and assets. The second issue is reconnaissance of movement routes for own units. He monitors this or that area and tries to draw up an optimal route for moving both personnel and equipment, he said. Another task of enemy air reconnaissance is to find routes for safe movement in the nearest enemy rear for the purpose of establishing logistics. — He is trying to find new routes for logistical support activities. Because our FPV drones do not allow us to live peacefully, do not allow us to move peacefully for any purpose - whether for assaults or for delivering provisions or ammunition to advanced positions, the spokesman said. Despite this, the Russians are still trying to use equipment for logistical support and personnel transportation. Defense forces effectively counter such attempts. — Yesterday evening, the enemy tried to bring personnel to Vovchansk with the help of vehicles. But the equipment was discovered, it was damaged and it was partially destroyed along with the crew and the landing party that it was carrying to reinforce units in Vovchansk, Vitaliy Sarantsev reported. Earlier, ArmyInform informed that destruction of enemy reconnaissance UAVs long range is one of the keys to reducing the number of anti-aircraft missile strikes on Ukrainian territory, and also reported that in the area of ​​Aggregatny Zavod in Vovchansk, the enemy hit their own units with anti-aircraft missiles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/posylyly-na-40-vorog-aktyvizuvav-povitryanu-rozvidku-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-09-16T02:41:38-07:00

Over time, of course, it will become clear whether this was a targeted attack or not. However, this does not change the fact that the Russians targeted a civilian vessel, regardless of whether it was the result of the irresponsible use of inappropriate weapons or a targeted attack, the spokesman emphasized. Russians hit a civilian ship with wheat from Ukraine for Egypt with the Kh-22 Burya anti-ship missile. - This is a rather outdated type of weapon. It is anti-ship, but given that it was immediately designed for a nuclear warhead, an error of 50 kilometers was not a problem for it. But when it is used with another warhead, it can become a problem for it - not only for it, but also for everyone who is in the radius of flight of this missile, Dmytro Pletenchuk noted. He reminded that this missile should be called -50 for 50- - launched more than 50 years ago, it may not hit the target, deflecting at a distance of more than 50 kilometers. The spokesman also noted that the Russians launched a missile from a Tu-22 strategic aviation bomber. -This shows that the Russians do not dare to come close to our coast using tactical aviation,- he emphasized.

-From fire to flame-: the Russians made an unpleasant choice in the Black Sea	Such a well-founded assumption was made by the spokesman of the Navy of Ukraine, Captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk, . - This may indicate the fact that at some point the Russians felt uneasy at their base of Novorossian and had to choose, as they say in Russia, -from fire to flame,- he said. The occupiers had little choice - either to stay at the base, where they could be hit by Ukrainian long-range weapons, or to go out to sea, where Ukrainian naval drones stalk enemy ships. — As a result, they chose to go out to sea, where they can meet Ukrainian drones. Why did they make this choice? We'll probably find out sometime soon. But most likely, their choice was not very pleasant, the spokesman suggested. Obviously, it became even more dangerous for the occupier ships to stay at the base in Novorossiysk than to go to the open sea. - The tactic of hiding at the Novorossiysk base for the past many months is understandable, because it is easier to organize defense there than in the open sea. Therefore, such a choice leads to similar conclusions, Dmytro Pletenchuk noted. On the other hand, he emphasized, it is hardly possible to claim that going to sea is connected with the possible use of ship-based missile weapons by the Russians. Earlier, ArmyInform explained, what could threaten the mass withdrawal of Russian missile carriers to the Black Sea, and reported that due to logistical problems, the occupiers will increase the transport load on the emergency Crimean Bridge.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/yz-ognya-da-v-pol%d1%8bmya-u-chornomu-mori-rosiyany-zrobyly-nepryyemnyj-vybir/	2024-09-15T23:15:55-07:00

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine honored the soldiers of the 46th Separate Airmobile Brigade, the 25th Separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and the 151st Separate Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who are effectively destroying the enemy, causing him significant losses in manpower and equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/na-siverskomu-napryamku-nashi-voyiny-vidbyvaly-12-nastupalnyh-dij-protyvnyka-genshtab-zsu/	2024-09-15T21:08:45-07:00
Mobilized in Britain: -cloak-coat- and -dragon fire- on -forest exercises- Interflex	We are camping near the lake. In the morning, fog hangs and swirls on the surface of the water. Today is the last day of the -forest- trip, and we are finally lucky - for the first time in three days, the rain subsided, and then the rain stopped. As soon as the sun rises over our -Sherwood- forest, thick steam rises from the ground, grass, trees and wet clothing. The rays burn as mercilessly as the cold rain poured down before it. Such is the climate and weather of the British Isles in the middle of the sea. For the next lesson, instructors gather at our branch on the lake shore. We wait for several minutes until the other departments come up - they are a little further, so they have to go longer. At this time, we are quizzed to find out how well we remembered the content of yesterday's lessons. I catch myself thinking that it is easier to do the task correctly than to explain how and why exactly you do it. It's not a language barrier - our translators do an excellent job. The point is in the nature of the memorization itself - it happened at the bodily level of muscle memory, so in order to realize it, it is necessary to first reproduce the sequence of actions. Some rush not to tell, but to show. Instructors do not deny that in battle you need to do, and not explain how you do it. Doing the task is better than talking about it, and the teachers are happy with the students, which is what they wanted. In the end, the whole platoon gathers on the shore and we are shown the content of the next lesson. The instructors remind once again that a good soldier must always take care of himself. Good health and physical fitness, sufficient sleep and rest, adequate nutrition and comfortable living conditions determine the combat effectiveness of personnel, and therefore the effectiveness of combat missions. The instructors note that in the rain we all got soaked. In addition, they explain, during the hostilities we will have to overcome water obstacles one way or another, which is why we were gathered on the shore of the lake. So now there will be hands-on training with elements of immersion in reality and we will be taught how to dry quickly even if we get wet even worse than we already got wet in the rain. The hint becomes more than transparent - we guess that now at least part of the lake will have to be waded along the shore. -Hell, I think, why get up an hour before the official climb and dry my uniform - I'd rather sleep.- The next thought is about where the children's clock goes - I have an ordinary office clock and in the rain it has already fogged up from the inside from excessive moisture, although the hands are still moving. Diving would leave him no chance of survival. The intrigue is intensifying, but we still haven't received an order to swim across the lake or even enter it. Realizing exactly what we are afraid of, the instructors look at each other conspiratorially and smile. I watch how the second hand crawls behind the fogged glass, and I decide to drown the watch for good. The house, the mountains and the barn burned down - we had to buy a waterproof one. I don't want to get into the water in a dry form, but I'm already mentally ready for that. Everything is resolved unexpectedly - another one of the instructors just swims up to us from the depths of the lake. For at least 20 minutes, he watched us from the cold water near the shore. Now, using his own example, he will show us how to quickly dry thoroughly soaked clothes and shoes. We will dry our already wet uniforms - there is no need to get into the lake for this. The technology of self-drying is simple - we have already described it and shown it a little earlier. In about the same way, I dried myself before waking up. However, the instructors now show and describe important details that we might not have paid enough attention to. The basic things you need for drying are a fire source and dry fuel, ours is FireDragon - -dragon fire- or -dragon fire- as you prefer. It is desirable to also have some kind of stand on which you can place a mini-fireplace, but in extreme cases, an ordinary stone or a fragment of a brick will also do. The most interesting element is the -cloak-coat-, which we just called - a poncho, a tent, a cape, and a cover. The variety of names is due to the versatility and multi-functionality of this rectangular sheet. With the help of a -cloak-coat-, you can arrange the simplest shelter - a mini-tent or a cover. You can simply cover your gear and supplies with it, or wrap yourself in it. A camouflage-colored waterproof -cloak-coat- is necessary so that no one notices you during a stop. It is able to protect both from a heavy downpour and from the scorching rays of the sun. And during drying, the -cloak-coat- helps to create a special microenvironment around the fighter dressed in thoroughly soaked clothes, in which the high temperature allows for rapid warming, and the intense evaporation - to expel moisture from the clothes. The main thing is to be careful not to burn the -cloak-coat- with -dragon fire-. But this is already a matter of vigilance and the minimum necessary skills. The instructor easily advises on this, as long as his colleague explains the best way to dry the shoes. Read also: The General Staff showed what equipment Ukrainians receive during training in Great Britain Finally, we they ask if we noticed the newcomer from the lake before they invited him out. We did not notice - under some branches hanging from the shore and natural debris, the instructor was extremely well camouflaged. Careful local camouflage will be one of our next lessons. The Interflex Intensive continues with another action-packed day.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/mobilizovanyj-u-brytaniyi-plashh-palto-ta-vogon-drakona-na-lisovyh-navchannyah-interflex/	2024-09-15T20:20:18-07:00
Combat Boat 90: the expert talked about the advantages of combat boats that Ukraine will receive fro...	The purpose, tactical properties and combat capabilities of the SV90, as well as the likely scenarios for the use of these boats, in particular in the Azov-Black Sea region, were told to the ArmyInform correspondent by the officer of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, retired captain 1st rank, candidate of military sciences Stepan Yakymyak. It is known that these boats are the best in their class, as evidenced by their use by many countries, including the United States. It is no secret that the so-called -great maritime power- of the Russian Federation also at one time purchased several samples of such boats from a Swedish manufacturing company and built one and a half dozen such boats. Swedish SV90 combat boats were produced in different versions and for various tasks, but during their design and creation, the main task was the rapid deployment and landing of amphibious assault groups on the coast. This is evidenced by the special bow gear, the ability to transport a relatively large number of people in a special protected room and the small draft of the boat (0.8 m), which allows a direct approach to the shore. According to Stepan Yakymyak, these boats are primarily capable of quickly and safely delivering personnel over considerable distances and covertly evacuating them. — For example, in the conditions of hostilities on rivers 2 km wide, a group of six such boats can transfer a company of paratroopers in full equipment from one bank to another within 1.5-2 minutes. In sea areas, this unit can be overturned by the same group of boats over a distance of more than 400 km in about ten hours with the mandatory condition of providing combat support for this group and support, primarily from air strikes, Stepan Yakymyak noted. Other advantages include increased maneuverability and the ability to approach directly to different types of coasts (rocky, sandy, marshy, etc.). — In addition to amphibious, assault, and special operations, combat boats of the SV90 type, if used by the Defense Forces of Ukraine, can be used to lay mines, to perform patrolling tasks, transport troops and property, and evacuate the wounded. Also, these boats can perform tasks in the protection of sea and river communications and in combat support of forces operating in river and sea areas and on the coast. In the case of operations along the sea coast and ensuring greater stealth of operations, the task of transferring several special-purpose groups to the coast controlled by the enemy can be successfully accomplished. When using such boats, it is necessary to carefully plan reconnaissance, surveillance and cover them from the air against the strikes of UAVs and enemy fighter-bomber aircraft. So, the range of tasks, taking into account the actual areas of operation of the Defense Forces of Ukraine on rivers, estuaries and the Black Sea, is actually very wide. However, as Stepan Yakymyak adds, a much larger number of such boats is needed, which is due to the scale and scope of the areas of military operations and the combat capabilities of the enemy. If their number is sufficient, they could perform up to 40-60% of the main combat tasks of the surface forces of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at sea and rivers. By the way, about the options for the use of these boats told the spokesman of the Navy, captain of the third rank, Dmytro Pletenchuk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/combat-boat-90-ekspert-rozpoviv-pro-perevagy-bojovyh-kateriv-yaki-otrymaye-ukrayina-vid-shvecziyi/	2024-09-15T20:09:33-07:00
Stolen icons, hanged children and a shot train: fakes about Kurshchyna, with which the Kremlin scare...	In August, screenshots of ads allegedly posted on the OLX service appeared on z-channels. They depict Orthodox icons that were allegedly taken by the Ukrainian military from the Kursk region. The most common selection published by Telegram scammers includes five allegedly stolen icons. >Estonian resource provereno.media found the originals of these images. As it turned out, the icons come from Konotop, Zaporizhzhia, Kyiv, Kremenchuk and Lviv Oblast. One technical detail unites all the fake images: the top line shows the location — Kursk Oblast and Kursk. But everyone who uses the Ukrainian OLX service knows that only Ukrainian regions can be selected there. Kyiv and Kirovohrad regions, as well as Crimea (ARC) are represented on the site under the letter K. The purpose of spreading this fake is obvious — to accuse the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of looting. ArmyInform already wrote about the -reflection- tactic, which Russian propagandists actively use when talking about Kurshchyna. This is how they try to accuse Ukraine of war crimes similar to those committed by the Russians in 2022 in Buch, Mariupol, Izyum and other Ukrainian cities and villages. Recently, propagandists have been terrorizing their citizens with particularly brutal -units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine- , formed from Georgian, Polish, French and American mercenaries-, who -hanged 8 children in a barn-, or that -The command of the Armed Forces during the attack on the Kursk region ordered to shoot a passenger train.- In Ukraine and in the West, such lies no longer work, because many representatives of foreign, influential and truly independent media have already visited the occupied Armed Forces territory of the Kursk region. In their reports, foreign media persons claim that they did not see traces of -atrocities- similar to Russian prisoners, as well as to civilians — that is why Moscow is so nervous about uncontrolled mass media in a territory it does not control. In addition, it was the Kremlin that refused to provide a humanitarian corridor for the evacuation of civilians from the territory of Kurshchyna, which is controlled by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. That's why many questions about Putin and his managerial vertical arise already in Russia itself. After all, the Kremlin dictator uses Russian citizens in the war only as consumables.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/vykradeni-ikony-povisheni-dity-ta-rozstrilyanyj-poyizd-fejky-pro-kurshhynu-yakymy-kreml-lyakaye-svoyih-gromadyan/	2024-09-15T20:00:59-07:00

Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the details of Ukraine's victory plan	The head of state told about this in interview CNN. -I will personally speak with Joe Biden before the Peace Summit about how to strengthen us so that we are in a strong position. Because diplomatic solutions are good if you are strong. Otherwise, Putin will not even participate in this. And I think that under other circumstances they would not be interested in stopping the war,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President noted that victory for Ukraine means being very strong and being ready for strong diplomacy. -And that is why I have prepared several points. Four of them are the main points. Plus one that we need after the war. I will share them with President Biden. It is about security, geopolitical location of Ukraine, very strong military support of Ukraine. And about the fact that we should freely decide how to use this or that thing. We are talking about decisions on economic support,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He added that he is ready to accept proposals for this plan from Joe Biden's team if they strengthen the peace plan and Ukraine's position. -I think it will be fair and proper to share this plan with both candidates for the presidency of the United States - Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. And a lot also depends on the decisions of the US Congress, so we would like to share with Congress as well. After these steps, we are ready to share the plan with everyone,- said the President of Ukraine. Earlier, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine is asking the United States to grant permission to use long-range weapons to attack Russian airfields, but not received it yet.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/volodymyr-zelenskyj-rozpoviv-podrobyczi-planu-peremogy-ukrayiny/	2024-09-15T09:11:35-07:00
Vovchansk is under fire control: the occupiers are hiding in the woods	A military man with the call sign -Stig- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- - officer of the 2nd separate detachment of the Special Purpose Center -OMEGA- of the National Guard of Ukraine. — The city is almost completely destroyed, there is not a single whole building. We are right now in the suburbs of Vovchansk, so I can confidently tell you that there is not a single whole building in the city, he said. The degree of destruction of Vovchansk is catastrophic - the battles are taking place right in the urban development. — The city is completely under fire control both from the enemy's side and from our side. Right now, an artillery duel is going on, the city is being covered by enemy artillery, our artillery is working, our strike drones are working, the military said. The occupiers do not stop trying to advance and gain a foothold in the city ruins. — The enemy is trying to advance with reconnaissance groups, small infantry groups to some new positions. However, it faces resistance from the Security and Defense Forces and loses its offensive potential. But he will not stop trying to move forward through the city, the officer said. At the same time, the occupiers cannot set up positions in the city, so they mostly entrench themselves in the surrounding forests. - They try to hide mostly in the forests. Very good vegetation here, very good terrain from the point of view of shelters. Therefore, most of them hide in dense forests. -Unfortunately, this is a problem, because even in winter, if it is a coniferous forest, it is very difficult to recognize and hit the enemy,- explained the Ukrainian drone commander. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Vovchansk, the occupiers are resorting to single infiltration tactics , and fights in the city take place just inside high-rise buildings a>.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/vovchansk-pid-vognevym-kontrolem-okupanty-hovayutsya-v-lisah/	2024-09-15T08:58:16-07:00

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this in interview with CNN. -Everyone is waiting for the decision of the US and after that they make their decisions. We would love to use this weapon and attack aircraft on military bases. Not civilian infrastructure, but military bases,- emphasized Volodymyr Zelenskyi. The President emphasized that planes from these airfields are used not only for launching missiles, but also for anti-aircraft fire. -These planes drop 4,000 guided aerial bombs every month only in the east of Ukraine. With these guided bombs, they destroyed 80% of our energy infrastructure,- the head of state said. He added that in meetings with partners, he warned about waiting too long, because of which the Russians began to move their planes to a greater distance. -Now Russia has begun to withdraw its planes to a distance of 300-500 kilometers. And now we need more permissions. But we still don't have them,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the Russian army struck in Kharkiv, the occupiers fired at least six KAB in Kharkiv, at least 35 victims are known.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/prezydent-litaky-rf-shhomisyaczya-skydayut-4-tysyachi-kabiv-nam-potriben-dozvil-byty-po-aerodromah/	2024-09-15T08:48:30-07:00

The key to reducing the number of KAB strikes is the destruction of enemy reconnaissance UAVs	A military man with the call sign -Stig- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- - officer of the 2nd separate detachment of the Special Purpose Center -OMEGA- of the National Guard of Ukraine. — The enemy makes very extensive use of strike and reconnaissance drones. There are already fewer reconnaissance units, but there are more and more shock units, he said. He noted that combating the enemy's reconnaissance UAVs helps reduce the number of UAV strikes. — In the Vovchan direction, the activity of the use of anti-aircraft missiles has decreased a little over the last week or two, because the Russians lost a lot of long-range reconnaissance UAVs, which corrected the use of tactical aviation, including when using anti-aircraft missiles. In the last two weeks, they have not used the KABs much. And for the last week, reconnaissance UAVs do not even fly into the deep rear during the day, - said the military man. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the number of downed enemy reconnaissance drones in Kharkiv Oblast has exceeded a hundred, however polotiv-rozviduvalnyh-droniv/->occupiers are trying to increase aerial reconnaissance in the Vovchansk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/zaporuka-zmenshennya-kilkosti-udariv-kabamy-znyshhennya-vorozhyh-rozviduvalnyh-bpla/	2024-09-15T08:21:45-07:00

Pointed Russian missiles at Kharkiv: the enemy informant was sentenced	The sentence became known from the sentence of the court register, the identity of the convicted installed Kharkiv Anti-Corruption Center (KHAC). According to the HAC, it is about Yuriy Panfilov, who was accused of disseminating information about the deployment of the Armed Forces and justifying Russian aggression. The court recognized the man as an informant of the Russian special services, who adjusted Russian airstrikes against the critical infrastructure of Kharkiv. Among the main targets of the enemy were strategically important enterprises, in particular the defense-industrial complex. For greater effectiveness of missile and drone attacks, the Russians expected to receive from Panfilov the geolocation of Ukrainian air defense. In case of receiving such information, the invaders hoped to -bypass- the air defense systems of the Armed Forces of Ukraine or carry out a targeted attack on them. To collect intelligence, the convict found the places of -arrivals-, and then took hidden photos and videos there. The man forwarded all the information he received to several chat rooms of pro-Kremlin Telegram channels controlled by the special services of the aggressor country. Also, in September 2023, he videotaped the consequences of the Russian shelling of the state-owned enterprise Kharkiv Armored Plant. The convict began transmitting data to the enemy in the fall of 2023. Before that, Panfilov distinguished himself by publishing posts and comments on Facebook in which he tried to discredit Ukrainian defenders and admired the aggressor state. In addition, he denied that residential buildings in Kharkiv were being shelled by the aggressor state, and he called the tragedy in Buch, which was staged by the Russian military, a theater and a fake. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that law enforcement officers reported the suspicion to the Russian general, who ordered the capture of -Kharkiv in 5 days-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/navodyv-rosijski-rakety-na-harkiv-vorozhyj-informator-otrymav-vyrok/	2024-09-15T07:33:10-07:00

The General Staff of the Armed Forces: the enemy concentrated its efforts in three directions	This is stated in operational information of the General Staff ZSU as of 16:00 on the 15th August In the Kharkiv direction the enemy unsuccessfully tried to storm the positions of our units in the Vovchansk area. At the same time, in the afternoon, enemy aviation from the territory of the Russian Federation struck the civilian infrastructure of the city of Kharkiv with guided aerial bombs. On the Kupyansk direction the enemy stormed the positions of our units 14 times in the area of ​​Synkivka, Petropavlivka, Kolisnikivka, Hlushkivka, Kruglyakivka, and Lozova. Five clashes are still ongoing. Ukrainian soldiers continue to maintain their defense. In the Lymansky direction, during the day, the invading army carried out 16 attacks on Ukrainian positions near Druzhelyubivka, Kovalivka, Tverdokhlibovo, Nevsky, Makiivka, Terny, and Novosadovo.

The head of the IOU GUR considers Russia's statements about a new escalation to be myths	This was stated by the head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov, during a panel discussion at the annual meeting of the Yalta European Strategy (YES) in Kyiv, ArmiyaInform reports. -I have been hearing all these myths about escalation since 2014. What is escalation when we are fighting a fully conventional, all-out war? Absolutely all types of weapons that exist in the world have already been used. Well, how else can the situation be escalated?- said the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Kyrylo Budanov rejected the seriousness of the suggestion that the president of the Russian Federation would provide much more aid to countries and groups in the Middle East with the aim of escalating the war there. -How can he help when he himself asks for help from others? How will it help globally? Yes, you can send a special forces unit, no problem. You can transfer, for example, 50 MANPADS. But what next? Everything is fighting here, the entire Russian army, everything that is produced goes directly from the assembly line to the front. Everything they buy - by the way, no one gives them anything for free - everything goes to the front. How will they help?-, the head of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense argued his position. -Globally, they cannot do anything as long as the war in Ukraine continues,- Kyrylo Budanov concluded. As reported by ArmyInform, from the summer of 2025 in Russia serious problems will begin in the economy and there will be a need for mobilization, which can undermine the socio-political situation in the aggressor country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/nachalnyk-gur-mou-vvazhaye-mifamy-zayavy-rosiyi-pro-novu-eskalacziyu/	2024-09-15T06:52:07-07:00

In Russia, the issue of under-recruitment in the army is becoming more and more acute - Kyrylo Budan...	These conclusions with reference to secret Russian data in the framework of the discussion panel during the 20th meeting of the Yalta European Strategy (YES) shared Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov. The head of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense pointed to the fact that Russia predicts that -all their problems will begin in the summer of the 25th year-, as both the financial and economic factor and the socio-political factor will combine. According to him, the Russian Federation is currently struggling with the deterioration of the economic situation, because it understands that the recession, which is already noticeable and painful, continues. According to the head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense, the issue of shortage of personnel in the army is becoming more and more acute in Russia. -During this period (in the summer of next year 2025, - ed.) they will face a dilemma: either to announce mobilization, or somehow it is necessary to reduce the intensity of hostilities a little bit, which may ultimately be critical for them,- the Ukrainian leader said military intelligence. Kyrylo Budanov believes that -war fatigue exists in Russia, no matter what anyone says, because the war has already affected a large section of the Russian population.- He said that the Russians are frankly happy that the aggressor has already managed to capture more than 30% of the territory of our country, and they are also satisfied with the high salary in the Russian army. However, the number of volunteers is decreasing, which has prompted an increase in one-time payments upon signing a contract to 2 million rubles (equivalent to $21,993). The head of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense added that the socio-psychological state of the population of the aggressor country was also affected by Ukraine's efforts to transfer hostilities to the territory of Russia, deep into it. As reported by ArmyInform, earlier Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov said that attacks deep in Russia have an important impact on the citizens of the aggressor country, and they also somewhat changed people's outlook in as a whole	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/u-rosiyi-dedali-gostrishe-zvuchyt-pytannya-nedoboru-v-armiyu-kyrylo-budanov/	2024-09-15T05:06:45-07:00

This is what the officer told on the air of the Espresso TV channel. -Now the Russians don't have much choice regarding logistics to the occupied Crimea. Ferries are not operating. When they will work is not clear. One ferry is at anchor, and the other is waiting for repairs. Therefore, they do not have much choice. There is currently no verified information that the Russians have launched a railway through the temporarily occupied territories to Crimea. That is why the logistical load on the Crimean bridge will increase. This is a process that cannot be avoided,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. According to the spokesman of the Navy, the Crimean bridge needs repair, and due to the increase in logistical load, it will begin to collapse even more. -the Russians will be forced to increase transportation through the Crimean bridge. They have no choice and they will not avoid it. Accordingly, due to these loads, the Crimean bridge will begin to crumble even more,- the officer concluded.

This is from the head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defensesaid during a panel discussion within the XX meeting of the Yalta European Strategy (YES). -As the head of intelligence, I can directly say: the fact that they deliver ballistic missiles there is unpleasant for us, but it is not the volumes, but in terms of ammunition, it is critical for us,- the head of military intelligence emphasized. -Unfortunately, I can say that we cannot do anything about it yet. This is such an unfortunate truth,- stated the head of the GUR MOU. According to Kirill Budanov, the stockpile of weapons inherited from the Russian Federation from Soviet times is running out. And the current volume of manufactured aircraft and armored vehicles cannot have any decisive importance on the battlefield. Another issue is the production of weapons of mass destruction, in which the occupiers have advanced, added the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. For example, as Kyrylo Budanov emphasized, the Russian Federation has made significant progress in the production of Iskander missiles, and the production of guided aerial bombs, which are a huge problem for Ukraine, has also increased. -I will not scare anyone, several times, let's say so,- summed up the head of the GUR MOU.

This was stated by the head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense during a panel discussion within the XX meeting of the Yalta European Strategy (YES). The presenter asked the head of the IOU GUR how he assesses the possibilities of Ukraine to transfer the war to the territory of Russia. Kyrylo Budanov replied that, as a citizen, he would like more. However, -you have to look at things realistically-, so the head of military intelligence would focus on long-range strikes against the enemy. -Ukraine was a little weaker, that must also be recognized. And it's the fact that it's been almost three years of full-scale, and ten years of our war in general, and we're still holding on,- he said. The head of the GUR MOU noted that at the beginning of the Russian Federation's large-scale aggression against Ukraine, -we were definitely dealing with one of the most powerful armies in the world,- and the Russians failed to break us. -This is despite the fact that Russia has a large stockpile of weapons and equipment accumulated during independence, inherited from the times of the USSR and received from other states, such as the DPRK. Our ability to transfer hostilities to the territory of Russia — here I would place more emphasis on the ability to strike deep into the territory of the Russian Federation. This is the first. And on the very philosophy of it. It changed the outlook a little,- said the head of the GUR MOU. Kyrylo Budanov drew attention to the fact that the myth of their invincibility and security was destroyed for the population of the aggressor country after the strikes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on objects deep in Russia. This greatly affected their social and psychological condition. He noted that previously Russians were convinced that their country was one of the strongest in the world, but this myth was destroyed with the first explosions in Moscow. As the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications noted, -he undermined the entire foundation.- Kyrylo Budanov believes that this is the main achievement of these long-range strikes - breaking the faith of the people that they live in safety. When asked by the moderator of the discussion whether more such strikes are needed, the head of military intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine answered that -while the war is going on, everything must be done to the maximum. And when you can do more, you have to do more.- As reported by ArmiyaInform, on September 11, 2024, Nobody, Chimera, Aratta, Raven Group units and the 2nd special operations unit named after Vladyslav Peleshenko of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine with the support of -Group 13- and the 10th mobile border unit -Dozor- of the State Border Service of Ukraine They carried out raid near the coast of Crimea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/pislya-udariv-zsu-po-obyektah-vglyb-rosiyi-dlya-naselennya-krayiny-agresorky-zrujnuvavsya-mif-pro-yihnyu-neperemozhnist-i-bezpeku-kyrylo-budanov/	2024-09-15T02:50:43-07:00

The US Army intends to conduct another test of hypersonic weapons by the end of 2024	According to information profile resource Defense News, the head of the procurement department of the US Army, Doug Bush, made a corresponding statement. ArmyInform reports. Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB, -Common Hypersonic Glide Body-), which is a universal projectile developed jointly with the US Navy, was successfully tested at the beginning of 2024. The Navy envisions using the munition to be launched from ship-based launchers, while the US Army plans to integrate the munition for a land-based launch station. Defense News reports that the US Army has long worked with Leidos' Dynetics with the goal of creating an industrial base for the Common Hypersonic Glide Body, which will enter the armament of both the ground forces and the Navy. Previously, American private business had never been involved in the development of hypersonic weapons. -Following the Navy tests, we need to make sure that we have a full end-to-end test as close as possible to an operational test that will be successful,- Bush told reporters at a Pentagon briefing. The official also added that it is necessary to have confidence that weapons can be safely transferred to a unit that -may have to go to war.- The Army has yet to conduct fully successful trials. But, as Bush said, the military hopes that such a test will take place this year. If the tests are successful, the service will be able to transfer the hypersonic unit to the first unit as an initial operational capability as early as next year. Hypersonic missiles are capable of reaching a speed of Mach 5 (about 6,000 km per hour). The glider unit can maneuver at altitude, which makes detection by anti-missile systems difficult. According to the Pentagon, the battery of the ground complex consists of a command and staff vehicle and four heavy transporters with two containers on each with hypersonic missiles. The project range of the missile is 2775 km. The first US Army unit to receive hypersonic weapons (with the exception of universal munitions) was the 5th Battalion, 3rd Regiment, 17th Field Artillery Brigade at Joint Base Lewis-McChord (Washington State). The unit is part of the 1st multidisciplinary task force. The delivery took place two days before the scheduled commissioning date at the end of the 2021 fiscal year. The C-HGB consists of a warhead, a guidance system, cables and a protective heat shield. In August, Lt. Gen. Robert Rush, director of the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office, said the Army was -really close- to deploying hypersonic weapons. But he cautioned that more tests would need to be conducted before any decision could be made about the future of the ground-based hypersonic missile. In May 2024, the US Navy conducted flight tests of an industrially produced missile in Hawaii. The tests were highly anticipated after a series of failed or aborted Common Hypersonic Glide Body tests. In 2023, the army and navy had to interrupt flight tests three times due to problems with the preparation of the missile for launch. As General Rush pointed out, it usually takes about ten years to develop missiles, but the hypersonic weapons program took only five years. According to him, it is necessary to make sure that -everything works-. If a decision is made to introduce a new weapon, there are strong strategic reasons for this.

In the Vovchansk direction, the enemy is increasing the number of reconnaissance drone flights	About this in broadcasts of the national telethon -Edyni Novyni- on September 15, the official representative of OTU -Kharkiv- Colonel Vitaly told Sarantsev. -This intensification of the use of enemy UAVs can be attributed to two factors. The first is to identify the location of positions of the Ukrainian Defense Forces for further strikes and intensification of further offensive actions. And the second is to work out routes for the movement of our own forces,- said Colonel Sarantsev. At the same time, according to the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU, it is in the Vovchansk direction that there has been an increase in the number of desertion cases in the ranks of the occupying forces from the side of the soldiers of the invaders' army. -We have received information that such cases have become more frequent. Russian soldiers refuse to obey the combat orders of their commanders. Thanks to the successful actions of the Ukrainian military, which disrupted the logistics of the Russians, some of their units remain without the most necessary supplies: food, water, and ammunition,- Vitaly Sarantsev emphasized. At the same time, he emphasized the fact that in the Vovchan direction, the rotational actions carried out by the enemy do not always lead to the strengthening of the Russian army. Untrained recruits who do not understand elementary combat tasks get to the front line. As reported by ArmyInform, in Kharkiv region increased captured Russians. Also conscript soldiers of the army of the Russian Federation engaged to perform tasks north of Kharkiv region. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/na-vovchanskomu-napryamku-suprotyvnyk-zbilshuye-kilkist-polotiv-rozviduvalnyh-droniv/	2024-09-15T01:26:46-07:00

-Double blow-: on the army and the economy. Expert on the consequences of damage to enemy refineries	What is the effect of these attacks, how will it affect Russia's economy and its ability to continue to maintain the Russian Army's combat capability to wage a war of aggression against Ukraine? Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmyInform about this: -We will divide this issue (strikes on the oil industry of the Russian Federation - ed.) into two parts. The first is the political and ideological part, and the second is purely technical and economic. In the political part, the myth that it is impossible to strike on the territory of Russia is finally dispelled. That is, a nuclear state cannot be struck, because it is not known what will happen. There is already the experience of the successful Kursk operation, and we have been hitting their oil industry for a good year and no nuclear apocalypse has happened. So, it turns out that it is possible to inflict fire damage on a nuclear state. To be fair, this is not the only case in history, as there are some experts who say it never happened. But, as it turns out, a similar situation has already happened, in 1982 non-nuclear Argentina attacked nuclear Britain, and Britain did not respond with nuclear weapons. By the way, the same Soviet Union survived an attack from the Chinese on Damansky Island in 1969, and no disaster happened either. That is, this ideological factor that it is possible to carry out complex strikes on their territory not only for military purposes, but especially for oil purposes, is very important.- We understand that as long as Russia sells oil abroad, as long as it lives as a country. That is, 40% of their budget is formed exclusively thanks to revenues from the oil and gas sector. The more strikes there, the less they will sell oil to foreign markets and receive hard currency. In this context, it is important to note that the Iskander-M missile has 27 foreign-made parts in its configuration. The Kh-47 -Kinzhal- missile has 130 foreign-made parts. And their most massive reconnaissance drone -Orlan-10- is half-equipped with foreign-made parts. That is, the less currency the Russians have, the less they will be able to purchase the necessary parts from which weapons will be made. Plus, fuel itself, as such, is one of the key aspects in today's war between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. After all, this is a war of military equipment, primarily heavy. Let me remind you that a T-90 tank consumes up to one ton of fuel and up to 100 kilograms of lubricant per day. If the enemy has around three thousand tanks along the demarcation line, then the Russians need three thousand fuel, in particular diesel, per day. Plus, the most elementary thing that worries us at the moment is enemy aviation. The same Su-34, Su-25, Su-24, Su-30 and so on. And plus enemy helicopters can also refuel with aviation kerosene. That is, to provide all this equipment, the occupiers need a lot of fuel resources. The most powerful blow that the Defense Forces of Ukraine inflicted was when an oil depot in the Rostov region of the Russian Federation burned for more than 9 days. There, first of all, tanks with aviation kerosene burned out. Of course, it is still a little early to say that the Ukrainian strikes will really affect their entire oil-refining sector of the Russian economy. After all, they have 30 large factories and 50 small ones, which is a lot. And in the area of ​​oil refining, Russians are definitely among the top three countries in the world. But the fact that this process (destruction or damage to enterprises of the oil and gas industry of the Russian Federation - ed.) is increasing and that each time they have fewer and fewer resources, for example, for oil processing, this is extremely important today. I will give an interesting example. If today there is a question of buying microelectronics, it can, of course, be bought on world markets in such a way that no one will understand who is buying it. Because it can be implemented, relatively speaking, through 5-10 procurement chains. Let's take a company from Iran. It ordered the necessary microelectronics from somewhere, say, Mexico, and the documents show that it is for household appliances. Then it (microelectronics - ed.) was taken and bought from the Americans and it got back to Iran. Who will control them? This is impossible to do. However, if a company in Paraguay were to come to Denmark, France, Germany and say -sell us the oil equipment- that has now burned down in Russia, it will become obvious to everyone who is the ultimate beneficiary and who is the ultimate buyer. Therefore, Russians will no longer be able to buy the necessary equipment on these global markets. And they cannot produce them themselves, especially atmospheric-vacuum pipes, where the distillation of oil and corresponding oil products takes place. Therefore, this (hitting Russian oil and gas industry enterprises - ed.) is simply a fantastic, wonderful, asymmetric response to our enemy. It (the answer - ed.) should grow and it will eventually give results. My favorite historical parallel. Hitler's Germany really fell when the Americans and the British destroyed 12 German plants for the production of synthetic gasoline. That's when things got bad for the Germans. Sooner or later, things will get bad for the Russians too.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/podvijnyj-udar-po-armiyi-ta-ekonomiczi-ekspert-pro-naslidky-urazhennya-vorozhyh-npz/	2024-09-14T20:30:27-07:00
Church Laundry Lies: Enemy Propaganda Does Not Fear God	Recently, fake information began to spread in social networks and on various pro-Kremlin Telegram channels that a laundry was allegedly opened in Lutsk in a church selected by the MP. As -evidence-, a photo of the church is attached, at the entrance of which the inscription -Clean - and Laundry- can be seen. StopFake investigators discovered that this is a photo of the bell tower of the Greek-Catholic Church of the Sending of the Holy Spirit in the city of Terebovlia, in the Ternopil region. A social laundry was opened there last year. According to notification of the Terebovlia City Council, the Greek Catholic parish was the winner of the mini-grant within the framework of the project -Development of social services for community cohesion to support IDPs and vulnerable groups at the parish level-. Parishioners monitored the situation in the community, drew up a map of needs and identified vulnerable categories of the population. They came to the conclusion that there is a need for a social laundry in Terebovla. After all, there are many seriously ill people in the community who need such a service and cannot take their clothes to Ternopil or Chortkiv. That is why they decided to implement such a social initiative. But the Russian agitprop decided to use this initiative to create another fake about the alleged -oppression- of the Moscow Patriarchate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and the -religious apocalypse- in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/brehnya-pro-pralnyu-u-czerkvi-vorozha-propaganda-ne-boyitsya-boga/	2024-09-14T20:11:20-07:00
What is known about one of the first F-16 pilots: the story of the fallen officer Oleksiy Mesia	&#8230; The year is 2022. ZSU pilots Oleksiy Mes and Andriy Pilshchikov meet with American government officials to convince them: the Ukrainian army needs fighter jets. To strengthen the position of the pilots, they were then joined by Hollywood actor Sean Penn. &#8230; 2024 year. Already on board the F-16 in the sky of Ukraine, Oleksiy Mes repels a massive Russian combined air and missile strike. He destroyed three cruise missiles and one attack UAV — saving Ukrainians from enemy weapons. But, unfortunately, at the cost of his own life. What kind of officer was Mes and how he helped our state to become stronger and more effective in beating the enemy - in the ArmyInform material. Born on October 20, 1993 in Shepetivka, Khmelnytskyi. There he studied at a local school, which he graduated with a gold medal. Subsequently, he studied at the Kharkiv National University of the Air Force named after Ivan Kozhedub. Graduated from university in 2016. It is interesting that Mes and Andriy Pilshchikov with the call sign -Jus- were peers and studied together at KhNUPS. And died with a difference of 1 year and 1 day. -This is our issue, of which the whole of Ukraine and the Air Force are proud. I was lucky to be the instructor who gave him a ticket to the sky on the MiG-29 aircraft,- said Brigadier General Serhiy Golubtsov, Chief of Aviation of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, at Oleksiy's farewell. Back in 2014, Mes went to Norway - at that time he was studying in the fourth year of KhNUPS. Told partners about participation in the OOS, exchanged experience, etc. And then there is the military service under the contract. He was enrolled in the personnel of the military unit in the position of squadron support commander - deputy commander of the operational group. In September 2022, the pilot was awarded the medal -For military service to Ukraine- - for personal courage and selfless actions shown in the defense of the state sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, loyalty to the military oath. The nickname -Moonfish- (-Fish-moon-) Mes got because of one of the curious cases, about which the man chose not to tell. As of June 2022, Mes was the commander of a squadron of Ukrainian MiG-29 fighters. At the age of 29, he had the rank of lieutenant colonel. Mes lobbied for the transfer of F-16 fighters to Ukraine. Pilots traveled to the United States, talked with the media and officials. He was fluent in English and could equally argue the need to protect the sky. -Moonfish- became the real face of Ukraine's F-16 lobbying campaign. Yes, back in June 2022, Ukrainian pilots flew to Washington to meet with members of the US Congress. There they spoke with Senator Mark Kelly, a former pilot and astronaut. After all, Moonfish was one of the first eight Ukrainian pilots to learn to fly the F-16 in Denmark in the fall of 2023. In September 2023, the Armed Forces wrote that an officer with the call sign -Moonfish- was undergoing F-16 training in Great Britain. He is one of those pilots called media. And after Juice and Moonfish met in Washington with Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger, he introduced the Ukraine Fighter Pilots Act to the US House of Representatives. Moonfish was also one of the first Ukrainian pilots who went to the United States to learn how to fly the F-16. In September 2023, his training moved from the simulator cockpit to a real F-16 aircraft. At one time, Mes told about the training of Ukrainians on Western fighter jets on the air of a national telethon: -I would compare our planes that we have in our arsenal with the F-16 - it's like switching from a push-button phone to a 16th iPhone.- On August 26, 2024, the Russians launched another massive air-missile strike. Pilot Mesy on board the F-16 managed to destroy three cruise missiles and one attack UAV. -Aleksii saved Ukrainians from deadly Russian missiles. Unfortunately, at the cost of his own life. Oleksiy Mes was a strong and devoted soldier, a high-class pilot, a leader on earth and in the sky, a good friend, a loving son, father, husband, patriot of his country,- said the message of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The soldier was buried on August 29. During the farewell ceremony, a pair of MiG-29 fighter jets paid tribute to the fallen pilot - Mesia's native MiGs, on which he began his pilot career. The pilot is survived by his wife Yulia, daughter, mother, father, sister. -His name was Oleksiy Mes, and he was the best pilot in Ukraine. He managed the entire F-16 project, he actually replaced the functional air attaché, he was a very funny guy and he loved his daughter very much. He was an excellent student who wanted to be a nuclear physicist and defended a research paper at the National Academy of Sciences about some incredible technology in dentistry,- recalls the officer, public activist Melania Podolyak. By order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, lieutenant colonel Oleksiy Mesy was posthumously awarded the military rank of colonel. The reasons for the crash of the F-16 plane piloted by Oleksiy Mes are currently being investigated.

Hopelessness forces the occupiers to surrender: in Kharkiv Oblast, the number of captured Russians h...	Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — The number is growing little by little. We report this in our daily summaries. This indicates that the enemy's personnel understands the complete hopelessness of their position and it has begun to dawn on them that in order to save their lives, they still need to raise their hands and surrender to the Ukrainian military, he said. The military emphasized that Ukraine strictly adheres to all norms of international law regarding the treatment of prisoners of war and called on Russian soldiers to surrender. — Unlike the Russians, we respect international humanitarian law. We treat prisoners normally and nothing terrible awaits them in captivity. Therefore, of course, we tolerate the enemy's decision to surrender and call on those who have not yet made a final decision to take an example from their comrades, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that fighters of the 13th Special Forces Brigade -Charter- of the National Guard of Ukraine once again captured Russian servicemen in the Kharkiv direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/bezvyhid-zmushuye-okupantiv-zdavatysya-na-harkivshhyni-pobilshalo-polonenyh-rosiyan/	2024-09-14T12:03:52-07:00
Russians are fighting with people at public transport stops in the South	spokeon the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyny- about the terror against civilians, which the invaders staged in the South of Ukraine. a> spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, Captain Dmytro Lykhovii. — the Russians are already overstepping their bounds when they just plainly go to war with the civilian population just because they can. Over the course of yesterday, in addition to Kherson, they shelled 9 more settlements in the Kherson region. As a result, one civilian was killed, and 7 more civilians were injured, he said. Three more civilians were killed today as a result of an attack on an agricultural enterprise in Gulyajpilsk community in Zaporizhzhia. Also, civilian houses, private buildings, high-rise buildings, a school, a hospital canteen, a bus, and civilian cars were damaged as a result of enemy shelling. — In fact, they are fighting with public transport stops when a drop drone or an FPV drone or an impact drone flies there. Since he can't go back, and they don't see military goals there, they just attack civilians, in violation of all the Geneva Conventions, the spokesman said. The response to the terror of the Russian occupiers against civilians should be strengthening the means of radio-electronic warfare, strengthening anti-aircraft defense, and strengthening countermeasures against Russian UAVs. Also, the line of combat should be pushed as far away from Kherson as possible, so that the Russians have as few opportunities as possible to shell the regional center. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kherson two people were injured as a result of the Russian shelling.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/iz-lyudmy-na-zupynkah-gromadskogo-transportu-voyuyut-rosiyany-na-pivdni/	2024-09-14T11:49:56-07:00
In the north of Kharkiv Oblast, the enemy was terrorized by FPV drones	Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — The extreme activity of our FPV drones prevents the enemy from making any movements, providing logistical support to units. The enemy there in the forward positions does not receive provisions or water, does not replenish ammunition stocks, he said. As a result, desertion and refusal to obey orders are becoming more common among enemy personnel, because it is extremely difficult for the occupiers to carry out any tasks due to the effective actions of Ukrainian drones. At the same time, the spokesman noted that the Ukrainian defenders do not have a complete advantage over the enemy in the use of drones - it is more about parity. — Both sides quite actively use this type of ammunition. We have 30 to 40 strikes per day, which are done precisely with the help of FPV drones. Therefore, it is difficult to say about any advantage in the air, it would be more correct to note that this is a certain parity in this armament, said Vitaly Sarantsev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that ->in the north of Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian drones put the invaders on starvation rations, resulting in extremely high losses Russian soldiers increasingly resort to desertion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/na-pivnochi-harkivshhyny-voroga-zakoshmaryly-fpv-dronamy/	2024-09-14T11:32:53-07:00
Summonses are being prepared to be served automatically: what is known	the head of the Department of Information Technologies of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Oleg Berestovy told about this in DOU Podcast. -How are subpoenas being issued now? They are written out by hand, printed, and then the stack of paper comes to the head of the TCC, who must sign them, put a seal, and then the summonses are distributed. This is an inefficient process. That is why we have now created a function so that the summons can be generated in the -Oberig- registry, signed with the electronic signature of the head of the TCC, and not even printed directly in the TCC. It will go immediately to centralized printing, from there to Ukrposhta, it will deliver it, and we will have information on where the summons is located: whether it was delivered or not, whether it was lost somewhere, how long it took for delivery, etc.,- explains Oleg Berestovy . According to him, the process will be transparent and -it will allow the military-political leadership to have more relevant information than is available now.- -In order to understand the -funnel-, at which stage we are and what needs to be decided in order to expand the -funnel- in the end,- emphasizes Oleg Berestovy. And he adds: -Accordingly, when you sign this summons with an electronic signature, there won't be any signature signature; and you should be sure that you were not sent some kind of phishing or something, and that your TCC did indeed sign this subpoena. Therefore, Rezerv+ will have a function: how to use a QR scanner to check whether the head of the TCC really signed this summons, whether it is legal, valid, legal and no one else signed it on the way to the bus stop. This is a function that will allow to protect a person as a conscript.- Also, Oleg Berestovy emphasized once again that there will be no summons to Reserve+. -We are not planning this. We have a backlog until the middle of spring - there are no subpoenas. But we are planning to develop functionality to at least slightly automate and civilize the delivery of summons with the help of Ukrposhta and certain automated processes on the backend,- summarized the head of the IT Department of the Ministry of Education and Culture. As ArmiyaInform wrote, users of the Rezerv+ application will be able to check the authenticity of the written summons received from the TCC and SP.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/povistky-gotuyutsya-vruchaty-avtomatychno-shho-vidomo/	2024-09-14T11:15:56-07:00
The nightmare of the occupiers - how the bomber's calculation works -Baba Yaga-	A video about the work of the air strike reconnaissance units was published on September 14 on the detachment's page. -Coordinated calculation work of the unmanned aircraft complex -Vampire- is one of the most effective methods of destroying the enemy in the dark. Our calculations, thanks to impeccable coordination and high skills, skillfully use advanced technologies - as a result, -Baba-Yaga- strikes enemy positions with maximum accuracy, even in conditions of limited visibility,- the detachment commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, -Baba Yaga- buried the Russians in their hideout in the Pokrovsky direction .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/strashnyj-son-okupantiv-yak-praczyuye-rozrahunok-bombera-baba-yaga/	2024-09-14T10:50:33-07:00
The stigma of the captive: why Russians choose suicide over captivity	The reasons for the reckless behavior of the occupiers on the battlefield on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon explained by the commander of the BPAC shock battalion - Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket chieftain Ivan Sirk, captain Yury Fedorenko. According to him, Russians surrender only when they have no other choice and they cannot even commit suicide - shoot themselves or blow themselves up with a grenade. One of the main reasons for this behavior of the occupiers is intimidation by Russian propaganda, which tells about the fictitious abuses that Russians allegedly suffer in Ukrainian captivity. - This shows that the Russian occupier has very, very much, and, I will emphasize once again for the third time - very much! — the propaganda machine is working powerfully. They either do not see or do not want to see how, for example, exchanges of prisoners of war take place. What Ukraine gives - with such well-fed faces, polished teeth and in the body, so-called. That is, they deal with people. And who are given to us — tortured, murdered, emaciated, where the occupier deliberately works to deprive them of their health and, as a result, after release from captivity, so that a person loses his life as well, - said the military man. As a result, Russians are simply afraid to surrender. Having believed the false propaganda, they believe that the Ukrainians will mock and abuse them. — Accordingly, the propaganda machine in the Russian Federation works in such a way that the occupier is objectively afraid to surrender, because he thinks that we do not follow international rules and norms, in particular the convention. That we will face. This is not true, - Yuriy Fedorenko emphasized. The second reason for the reluctance of Russian soldiers to surrender is even more interesting. It consists in the fear of returning to Russia for exchanges and being condemned and abused already there. -It is scary enough for the enemy to surrender, because he understands that even after the exchange, he will be abused already on the territory of the Russian Federation,- explained the commander of the Ukrainian drones. This is what forces the occupiers to choose suicide between captivity and suicide. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Kharkiv direction, the Russian command involves military personnel in the conduct of hostilities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/tavro-polonenogo-chomu-rosiyany-obyrayut-samogubstvo-zamist-polonu/	2024-09-14T10:43:02-07:00
In the Zaporozhye direction, the enemy lacks forces for assault operations	The reasons for the decrease in the offensive activity of the enemy in the Zaporizhzhia direction on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- explained the spokesperson of the OUV - Tavria- captain Dmytro Lykhovii. - The number of combat clashes and assaults on the part of Muscovites can be counted on the fingers of one hand. For example, today until 4 p.m. they were not there at all. Yesterday, there were also none for the whole day, and in the three previous days there were only four of them, he said. The reason for the relative calm, compared to a number of other directions, is a significant lack of resources and reserves for the occupiers to storm in several directions at the same time. — Of course, Pokrovsky and Kurakhiv directions in the Donetsk region are now a priority for them. In addition, they have a huge area of ​​responsibility and, for many reasons, they need to transfer units to the Kursk direction, where they strengthen their forces in order to somehow respond to the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the spokesman said. In view of this, the occupiers were forced to transfer their forces from the Zaporozhye direction to other, more important for them directions of hostilities. — From the Zaporizhzhia region a few weeks ago - you can say she acted as a donor - they partially took units at the level of battalions, regiments, and brigades. That is why they are undergoing a certain reorganization, such an operational pause, Dmytro Lykhova said. At the same time, this does not mean that hostilities in Zaporozhye have completely stopped. The calm there can only be considered relative against the background of other directions. — The enemy is actively using all types of damage — artillery, missile weapons, attack drones, anti-aircraft missiles. Yesterday, 10 guided aerial bombs and 50 unguided aerial missiles flew in the direction of Orihiv. Today, the enemy has already carried out 2 airstrikes in the direction of Orihiv, closer to Zaporizhzhia, and, unfortunately, the civilian population and civilian infrastructure are suffering. Three civilians were killed today as a result of an attack on an agricultural enterprise in the Gulyajpil community, said the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that ->in the South, the occupiers rush to the Dnipro - attack with a whole zoo of brigades and regiments.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/na-zaporizkomu-napryamku-vorogu-brakuye-syl-dlya-shturmovyh-dij/	2024-09-14T10:33:24-07:00
One step before assaults: how conscripts are used in the Russian army in the Kharkiv direction	Exactly how the Russian command uses them on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- explained the spokesman of the OTU -Kharkiv- Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. — The adversary began to use conscripts, this is indeed confirmed by intelligence data and other sources. But this does not mean that there are massive use of military personnel and that they throw them on assaults. These are conscripts who perform logistics tasks, serve as drivers or perform some other task, he said. Currently, there are no conscript soldiers of the Russian army directly on the contact line in the assault units in the combat zone. -But they are located in territories that border on non-attacked areas, they perform territory control tasks, communication tasks and many other tasks that are not directly related to the conduct of hostilities,- explained the spokesman. At the same time, he noted that the personnel of enemy units involved in hostilities in the north of Kharkiv Region have an extremely low level of training and motivation. In particular, we are talking about servicemen of the Russian Federation, who replenished the losses in the Vovchansk region. — They don't have enough experience, they don't even know how to orient themselves in a certain way in the local area. This indicates that the adversary is already trying to squeeze everything he has into this direction that is important to him. He tries everything to plug his holes both in defense and in those units that engage in active offensive actions, Vitaliy Sarantsev emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Kharkiv direction, the Russian occupation forces began to recruit conscript soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/za-krok-do-shturmiv-yak-vykorystovuyut-strokovykiv-v-armiyi-rf-na-harkivskomu-napryamku/	2024-09-14T10:18:06-07:00
Digital recruiting will be launched in Ukraine: the first details from the Ministry of Defense	the head of the Department of Information Technologies of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Oleg Berestovy told about this in DOU Podcast. -Now, for example, it is possible to sign contracts directly with military units. For this function, we are currently doing digital recruiting in Reserve+. We want to gamify this story a little - there will be swipes, a match with brigades (smiles - ed). But first there are more urgent tasks - and then we will gamify,- said Oleg Berestovy. The pre-release stage of digital recruiting, according to the head of the IT Department of the MoU, should be -from week to week.- As ArmyInform wrote, as of the beginning of September 2024 -profesiyi/->there are about 4,000 vacancies in the Defense Forces of Ukraine. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/v-ukrayini-zapustyat-czyfrovyj-rekrutyng-pershi-detali-vid-minoborony/	2024-09-14T10:03:08-07:00
Mass withdrawal of Russian missile carriers in the Black Sea: the Navy explained what this threatens	The spokesperson of the Navy of Ukraine stated this in -Suspilne.Novyny- air captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. -Probably, if the eighth missile carrier was not currently undergoing repairs in Novorossiysk, they would have taken it out to sea as well. But I can't say that this somehow affects the security level now,- he said. However, according to him, these are missile carriers, so the threat of their use remains. It should be taken into account. -But it was also preserved when they were directly at the Novorossiy base. Because it is a matter of a few hours to go to an external raid and shoot. This does not affect the overall distribution of forces and the situation. At least I haven't seen such reasons yet,- assured Dmytro Pletenchuk. The spokesman of the Navy noted that later we will find out the real reasons why the leadership of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation made such a decision. He explained that Russia usually uses Kalibr from the Black Sea in order to maximally load Ukrainian air defense units. -The technical characteristics of these missiles actually no longer allow them to be used as a separate weapon. That is, the Ukrainian air defense has learned to fight them skillfully. The last shot down of the use of such missiles was 100%. There were more than 20 of them,- the Navy spokesman recalled. As reported by ArmyInform, on September 14, the occupiers took an unusually large number of ships into the Black Sea, including Caliber carriers. In the Black Sea there are 16 enemy ships, 7 of which are carriers of Kalibr cruise missiles with a total salvo of up to 48 missiles. There are 5 enemy ships in the Mediterranean Sea, four of which are -caliber- carriers with a total volley of up to 24 missiles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/masove-vyvedennya-rosijskyh-raketonosiyiv-u-chorne-more-u-vms-poyasnyly-chym-cze-zagrozhuye/	2024-09-14T09:53:25-07:00
In the South, the occupiers rush to the Dnipro — they attack with a whole zoo of brigades and regime...	informed about the current situation and the forces that the occupiers threw at the assaults in the Dnieper direction on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- /a> spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, Captain Dmytro Lykhovii. — From the beginning of this day until 4 p.m., two assaults took place, which were unsuccessful for the enemy. There were 5 storms yesterday, he said. Obviously, the spokesman suggested, the enemy is trying to get as close as possible to the Dnieper and take control of its main course. — He throws additional forces there. It can be observed that Russian units from the 144th Motorized Rifle Brigade, 205th Motorized Rifle Brigade, 337th Airborne Assault Regiment, 28th Motorized Rifle Regiment, 126th Separate Coastal Defense Brigade and the 61st Marine Brigade are participating in these battles for the islands. This is how a variety of Russian security forces from different structures of their occupation army are involved in solving certain tasks on the Left Bank of the Dnieper and on the islands, Dmytro Lykhova said. The spokesman suggested that the aim of the occupiers is to get closer to Kherson in order to further increase the shelling of the city. Earlier, ArmyInform reported on a sharp escalation in difficult terrain near the Dnipro: 60 enemy assaults took place over the past week.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/na-pivdni-okupanty-rvutsya-do-dnipra-atakuyut-czilym-zooparkom-brygad-i-polkiv/	2024-09-14T09:42:11-07:00

Polish tanks crush the Russians – PT-91 Twardy successfully repulse -meaty- assaults	This is discussed in the ArmiyaTV story. The PT-91 Twardy battle tank is a licensed version of the Soviet T-72M1, which was produced in Poland. It is noted that, unlike the Soviet prototype, -Twardy- received several modernizations. According to the commander of the vehicle, when the Russians once again resort to meat assaults, it is the -Twardy- that drives them away, equipped with new armor and a modern fire control system. In particular, Polish developers installed new gun stabilizers and a gunner's thermal sight. One of these tanks was given the call sign - -Grandfather-. When asked by a journalist how the PT-91 Twardy differs from the T-72, one of the crew members answers: -The difference is in the engine, it is more boosted and more powerful than the 72's. Well, you can see for yourself by the active armor: this is not -Kontakt-1-, not -Kontakt-2-. This is Polish armor, which they patented here,- says the army man. Our military learned to manage these units in Poland for 40 days. The targets on which our tankers work are mainly enemy infantry. -They arrange enemy assaults, attack with infantry. They crawl like locusts. Therefore, on foot. -Shooting- with a high-explosive fragmentation projectile is a -hooray,- comments a military man.

The Ministry of Defense is preparing to launch automated postponements of mobilization	the head of the Department of Information Technologies of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Oleg Berestovy told about this in DOU Podcast. -Automated deferrals are a hot topic. I understand that this is necessary, first of all, out of respect for those people who need it. And for release from work, which can not be done in the TCC. For example: people with disabilities. If the state knows about you that you have a certain group of disabilities and you are not suitable for service a priori, then why reconfirm, regularly pass the VLK? It is necessary to regulate both normatively and technically. We are working on it. We know how to do it, and in the coming weeks we will approach it,- said Oleg Berestovy. Also, according to him, automated deferrals will apply to guardians of three or more children. And also — deferrals for people who are studying, getting their first higher education. In addition, Oleg Berestovy called online military registration another important and popular function. As ArmyInform wrote, at the end of August the Verkhovna Rada supported in general draft law No. 11391 on expanding the range of conscripts who have the right to postpone conscription for military service during mobilization.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/minoborony-gotuye-zapusk-avtomatyzovanyh-vidstrochok-vid-mobilizacziyi/	2024-09-14T08:22:52-07:00
We are fighting for the security of the entire European continent — Rustem Umyerov	He informs about this14 September in social networks. -We are fighting for the security of the entire European continent, and our needs remain the same. First of all, this is an acceleration and increase in the amount of military aid: equipment, projectiles, long-range ammunition, mines and demining means, EW systems, spare parts,- he said. According to him, a critically important topic is the strengthening of Ukrainian air defense forces to protect critical infrastructure from Russian terrorist attacks. -We need not only more air defense systems, but also a reliable supply of ammunition for them,- Rustem Umyerov emphasized. He recalled that in August, Ukraine used F-16 aircraft for the first time to repel a massive air attack. The Minister of Defense of Ukraine hopes for the expansion of pilot training programs and the timely replenishment of the stocks of guided air missiles. -Also, more and more of our partners share the position of giving Ukraine the opportunity to strike with long-range Western-made weapons at military facilities on the territory of the Russian Federation. I thank the organizers and participants for their constant support of Ukraine on the way to victory,- he summarized. Earlier ArmyInform reported that the Minister of Defense of Ukraine met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania.

Vadim Mysnyk, the spokesman of OTU -Siversk- drew attention to this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- . — During the past day, the enemy carried out 82 shellings on the territory of Chernihiv and Sumy regions. And on the territory of the district of the Kursk region, which is controlled by the Defense Forces, there were 127 shellings, including 37 anti-aircraft missiles, he said. This indicates that one of the tasks of the Kursk operation has been achieved - the enemy is forced to strike more intensively on its own territory, instead of shelling Ukrainian settlements. True, the Russian aggressors did not completely abandon the tactics of shelling the Ukrainian border. For this purpose, the enemy mainly uses weapons that can strike from deep within the territory, because units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine do not allow him to approach the border. — As for the Sumy direction, there are certain results of the Kursk operation. The enemy is trying to increase the intensity of shelling, but we also take our measures in response and do not allow him to hit our territory, the spokesman emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Defense Forces forced the enemy to practically abandon the use of DRG in Sumshchyna, their zajmayutsya-drg/->detected with the help of UAVs and other technical means of monitoring the area. Therefore, Russian saboteurs on the northern border focused on mining area.

Suicide on the battlefield: Russians shoot through -akhmat-	How is this related to the frequent suicides of Russian soldiers on the battlefield in the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon broadcast explained the commander of the battalion of shock air defense systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket captain Ivan Sirk, captain Yury Fedorenko. The military said that the professionally trained -Akhmatians- do not fight on the front line. Instead, the appearance of -akhmat- units in a certain direction indicates a low level of motivation and discipline among regular Russian occupation troops. - Where -Ahmat- appears - there are problems in the troops, which they have to solve at the expense of a system of coercion, humiliation and destruction of servicemen of the Russian occupation forces, actually carrying out punishment directly on the battlefield, he said. As a result of such a system, it is easier for Russian soldiers to shoot themselves than to retreat without completing the task, because in the near rear they will be abused, tortured or even executed by the -Akhmatians-. — That is why you can often see a video published on social networks, when the occupier, having received an insignificant injury, for example, to the lower limbs, commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. It is easier for him to die on the battlefield than to return without completing the task to the rear. This result is ensured by the -Ahmat- unit, Yuriy Fedorenko explained. He noted that the Russian soldiers had only two options left - either to die on the battlefield or to be executed by the -Akhmatians-. - How long will the Russians tolerate that this very unit can do whatever they want with them, like with dolls - it's their choice, to die in Ukraine or at the hands of the -Akhmatians-, - concluded the drone commander. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv region, the Russians attack with -barracks- according to the Donetsk scenario, but the Defense Forces destroy 90% of the enemy's armored vehicles and 60-70% of the infantry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/samogubstvo-na-poli-boyu-rosiyany-strilyayutsya-cherez-ahmat/	2024-09-14T02:50:42-07:00

In the Dnieper direction, the enemy made five unsuccessful attempts to storm the positions of Ukrainian soldiers. There were no significant changes in the rest of the directions. The Defense Forces of Ukraine continue to conduct operations in the Kursk region. -Today, the soldiers of the 79th Separate Tavrian Airborne Assault Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine should be recognized for their effective and professional combat work, who effectively destroy the enemy, causing him losses in manpower and equipment. Glory to the Ukrainian soldiers! -Glory to Ukraine!- - said in a message from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Kurakhiv direction fell almost a third of all enemy attacks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/protyvnyk-zastosuvav-73-kaby-ta-567-droniv-kamikadze-genshtab-zsu/	2024-09-13T21:05:18-07:00
-Fin- and his Norwegian Leopard: battles in Zaporizhzhia, tricks of the Russians in the East and the...	During the war, -Fin- worked in the banking sector for the third year, before the large-scale invasion of Russia. After the mobilization, he took part in the Kharkiv operation, fought in Zaporozhye during the counteroffensive last year, and now he is in Donetsk region, together with his comrades, destroying the enemy on Leopard 2A4 tanks. -Fin- was among the first tankers who started working on German tanks that arrived in Ukraine last year from Western partners. ArmyInform tells its story on the occasion of Tank Troops Day. — I encountered a large-scale invasion at home in the Buchansky district of the Kyiv region. Heard how they started bombing Gostomel airport. The first explosion occurred at approximately 5:30 am. -Then I ran out into the street, and within a few minutes I learned from the news that the war had begun,- the serviceman recalls. -Fin- studied banking and graduated from the military department as a tank platoon commander. After studying, he worked in a bank, and already in October 2022 he was mobilized and assigned to the tank platoon commander, then still in the 4th tank brigade: - At first, they worked with T-64 and T-72 tanks. These were our main tanks, working in the Kharkiv direction. Later, -Fin- was offered to go to study on foreign equipment, while at first they were not even informed that it would be Leopard tanks. - Later we were already informed that we were going to study on foreign equipment, namely on Leopard 2A4 tanks. The training took place in Poland for about 40 days. -Fin- assures that this term is enough to master new tanks, because all servicemen already had significant combat experience. — Many who passed through Bakhmut took part in the Kharkiv operation. Tanks almost all go the same way. And it was very easy for us, as we just started studying, adds -Fin-. In Poland, he was trained on a Polish tank, and when he returned to Ukraine, he got one of the Leopards that Norway gave him. Currently, a whole tank coalition of countries is working, which transfers tanks of various modifications to Ukraine. — Tanks from different countries are slightly different in equipment, have different machine guns. There is also a difference in the devices, -night lights-, some of which have rear view cameras. But in general, the differences are not such that they cannot be understood or require additional training, explains -Fin-. His unit has been working at Leopards for a year and a half. -Fin- received one of the first such tanks that arrived in Ukraine. — I had my first combat use on this tank during a counteroffensive in the Zaporizhzhia region in 2023, the settlement of Mala Tokmachka. They went on the attack, started working. The enemy fired heavily at us, using FPV drones a lot. In the end, we completed the task and retreated to more advantageous positions to save the lives of the crew, save the equipment, the tank remained intact, - recalls -Fin-. After such an attack, many traces of artillery shells remained on the equipment. Tankers say that the Russians, on the one hand, are afraid of the Leopards, but on the other hand, they also hunt them, consider Western equipment a priority target. — There were cases of drone strikes, the commander of a tank with the call sign -Chechen- was killed in mine. He was hit by a -lancet- directly in the commander's hatch, he died on the spot. The crew survived, but the commander died, says -Fin-. Currently, the tanks of the 33rd brigade are performing combat tasks in the eastern direction and are holding back the advance of the Russian invaders. — the Russians are constantly trying to trick us. But we are not the first day in the war, so we know their tricks. -Leopards- are used precisely in tank battles, we engage in direct fire so that the target is 2.5-3 kilometers away, - notes -Fin-, and about Russian -analogovnet- tanks, such as the T-90M -Proryv-, says the following: — Tanks are all destroyed, all are burning. The key is knowing where to shoot. Crews are officially paid for each destroyed unit of enemy equipment. It's also an added motivation to destroy them more. — One of the crews destroyed two BMPs at once. They left and worked very quickly. -Leopard- has an excellent sight, sees far, plus speed. They just saw two BMPs in an open area and immediately stopped them with two shots. After that, they immediately rolled back -into a hole- so that neither artillery nor drones could catch up. We work at speed: there is a task, there is a goal, we worked quickly and hid, explains -Fin-. He adds that the Soviet tanks, which are also in the armed brigade, mainly work from closed positions, that is, as artillery and cover. — Nowadays, we often conduct training, because we do not know what will await us in the future. We may have to ford or ford a river. Bridges are often blown up, and we have to be ready for that, says the tank company commander. Currently, the 33rd brigade is also actively recruiting, in addition, experienced commanders can already train new arrivals themselves. — There is still a lack of highly qualified personnel, namely tank commanders. We have guys who were anti-tank fighters who joined us. We ourselves trained them on the training grounds, and now they skillfully perform combat tasks. That is, they were anti-tankers, but they became tankers. Tankers who work on foreign equipment constantly exchange experience in the operation of tanks and their use in combat operations. — My colleague studied in Britain on Challenger tanks, and we constantly exchange information about what we or they are better at, what are our weaknesses. We support the contact. -Fin- emphasizes that an important quality for a tanker is the ability to work in a crew. — The crew is one unit, they must work together. There has to be trust between them in order to move out and complete the task. And you also need perseverance to study, to learn the technique. Constantly working and training. There are no longer any height requirements. -I have a platoon leader who is 192 cm tall and he's quite comfortable,- adds -Fin- with a smile.

Distinguishes drones from birds: what is known about the radars that the Netherlands will transfer t...	As reported ArmyInform, the corresponding contract was arranged by the Ministry of Defense of the Kingdom with Robin Radar Systems in The Hague. Robin Radar Systems radars are designed to detect small drones, distinguishing them from other objects such as birds. A unique feature of certain radar samples from the Dutch manufacturer is their ability to work while driving on a vehicle, which ensures increased operational capabilities. The mobile nature of these radars makes them difficult for adversaries to detect and neutralize, providing continuous detection of air threats. These radars will play a crucial role in countering Russian drone attacks, providing a significant defense capability for Ukraine. The MAX, ELVIRA and IRIS radars offered by Robin Radar Systems provide advanced drone detection and tracking solutions suitable for a variety of environments. With its 360-degree 3D coverage, the MAX radar can detect and track thousands of moving objects simultaneously, providing real-time updates and accurate data through rapid rotation. Designed for airports and wind farms, it is particularly suitable for environments where flight safety is critical. ELVIRA, a 2D radar specifically designed for drone detection, uses advanced technologies such as micro-Doppler classification to effectively distinguish UAVs from other objects while offering easy integration with command and control systems. Robin Radar Iris® is a short-range X-band 3D radar designed for drone detection and identification. It is a frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar with two independent radio frequency systems, two pairs of antennas diametrically opposed to transmit and receive. IRIS is a lightweight 3D radar that deploys in less than 15 minutes and can detect drones at speeds of up to 100 km/h, making it ideal for rapid deployment in the field. The weight of these radars is 29 kg, they deploy in 15 minutes and provide a circular view, the instrument range of which is up to 5 km. The systems can detect UAVs weighing 3 kg from a distance of 4 km and 1.4 kg from 2 km. -This three-coordinate radar operates in the X-Band range, that is, at a wavelength of 3.75-2.5 cm and at a frequency of 8-12 GHz. The beam width is 6 degrees and the scan speed is 1 second, the analysts said. -As for the ability to work while driving, speeds up to 100 km/h and angles up to 10 degrees are allowed.- Also exists project integration of Robin Radar's IRIS with OpenWorks Engineering's Vision Flex CUAS optical autonomous surveillance system, which increases the effectiveness of target detection and recognition. Experts from IKK Defense Express believe that these small-sized installations will be an ideal addition to the work of small fire groups , which are engaged in identifying targets. They can also come in handy for cover from threats during marches, experts emphasize. In the context of the war in Ukraine, where drones are increasingly being used for reconnaissance and attacks, these radars will help provide valuable capabilities to counter the aerial threat. Their ability to quickly detect, track and classify drones will allow Ukrainian forces to better anticipate and neutralize drone attacks, strengthening their defenses against airstrikes.

Throw a shadow on NATO to hide its hybrid attacks: how and why Russia lies about UAVs	The purpose of this narrative is obvious — to show the Russians as if they are fighting against the entire -Western world- and to accuse Ukraine's partners of escalation. Information is being actively circulated in the Russian information space that the territory of NATO countries is allegedly being used by the Armed Forces to launch UAVs. For example, during the drone attack on the Murmansk region on September 11, Russian information launderers spread the news that one of the Ukrainian UAVs had arrived from the territory of Norway, a NATO member. The Kremlin has long sought to involve NATO in a war in order to lose not only Ukraine, but the entire -collective west-. According to the Kremlin dictator, such a reason for the unsuccessful completion of -svo- should have satisfied the domestic Russian audience. That is why Russian drones and missiles have repeatedly invaded the airspace of at least five NATO member states and two other European states. Moldova, which is particularly suffering from the consequences of Russian attacks, has repeatedly recorded cases of missile and drone debris falling on its territory, and Romania even activates the air alarm signal during Russian air attacks and has built shelters in border areas. On September 7, the Russian-Iranian -shahed- fell for the first time in Latvia, as a result of which the country announced the strengthening of air defense on its eastern borders. It is no secret for Ukraine that Russia has been waging a hybrid war against the entire civilized world for a long time. This is manifested in cyber attacks, systematic violation of airspace by fighter jets, particularly over the Baltic Sea, aggressive propaganda through the media and the church, funding of pro-Russian organizations and individual politicians. And the West's accusations of escalation, which periodically come from the Russians, are just an attempt to shift responsibility for their actions onto someone else.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/kynuty-tin-na-nato-shhob-pryhovaty-svoyi-gibrydni-ataky-yak-i-chomu-rosiya-breshe-pro-bpla/	2024-09-13T20:13:32-07:00
Utility discount in a few clicks: how to issue a discount remotely	ArmyInform tells who can use this service and what needs to be done. Previously, beneficiaries had to submit several applications. The first is about registering a war veteran, and the second is actually about assigning a benefit for housing and communal services. Currently, one application is submitted. And it's simplified. The point is that a significant amount of data is now collected automatically through electronic information exchange between public registries. By the way, family members of a veteran can apply for benefits. This can be done both by those who have already retired from the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, and by those who are still serving. For the latter, such an option can come in handy, because it is not so easy to personally visit various government institutions during service. Vacations are not big enough to waste time on. The result of the application review can be tracked in the section -My applications- - -application status-. Currently, the benefit for the payment of housing and communal services is provided in cash. By default, the Pension Fund can open an account in Oschadbank and inform the beneficiary about it. And the beneficiary must sign the bank account agreement. If you want the money to be transferred to an account in another bank, you need to apply to the territorial body of the Pension Fund. For registration, you need to provide your account, where the money will be deposited. It usually takes some time for registration and billing. But later the money comes. In general, the benefit involves the following process - you pay the full amount for housing and communal services, which are indicated in the payments. But you receive funds on the card in the form of compensation. It should be remembered that if you do not pay for the utility bill, the benefits may stop. We would like to remind you that the discount on the payment of housing and communal services is not the only benefit provided to the participants of hostilities. More about social guarantees read here. If you have not yet registered the status of a combatant, but there are grounds for its registration, we also wrote about the options how UBD can be issued now.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/znyzhka-na-komunalku-v-dekilka-klikiv-yak-oformyty-pilgu-dystanczijno/	2024-09-13T20:00:45-07:00
In Poland, the NATO-Ukraine JATEC Center - Ministry of Defense officially started its work	About this reported on September 13 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The decision to create JATEC was approved at the NATO summit in Washington in July this year. The center is located in the Polish city of Bydgoszcz. -The joint center with NATO will help Ukraine not only to implement procedures, approaches and standards, but also to share its own experience. Interoperability is one of our main goals and we are taking concrete steps for it. We have submitted our proposals for the implementation of the projects and are waiting for substantive decisions,- Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Stanislav Hayder commented on the event. Assistant Secretary General of the Alliance Thomas Goffus, Commander of the NATO Strategic Command for Transformations General Philippe Lavin, First Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces, Major General Karol Dymanovsky, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for European Integration Oleksandr Balanutsa took part in the negotiations in Poland. The parties legally established the creation of the Center and outlined its main tasks, structure, roles and functions of the management team. The work of JATEC is aimed at achieving interoperability of the security and defense institutions of Ukraine with the relevant institutions of the Alliance, improving the quality of education, increasing the analytical component and training personnel. The parties agreed that the establishment of the Center should be formally completed in October-November of this year. -The opening of a joint center with NATO is a real step towards the integration of Ukraine into the structure of the Alliance. Membership in NATO is not a political slogan, but the implementation of specific projects. We are gradually moving towards becoming a full-fledged part of the bloc, and the opening of JATEC brings us closer to this,- Oleksandr Balanutsa said during the event. Another topic of negotiations is ensuring the work of the Center, namely the need to provide resources from NATO for the implementation of measures and the development of an information and communication network. Representatives of Ukraine and NATO also agreed on the need to launch projects within the framework of JATEC as soon as possible. In particular, the Ukrainian side handed over a list of 70 projects for joint work and suggested which of them should become priorities. As reported by ArmyInform, the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Stanislav Hayder during a meeting in Kyiv informed experts of the European Union about the course and results of reforms in the field of defense.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/u-polshhi-oficzijno-rozpochav-robotu-czentr-nato-ukrayina-jatec-minoborony/	2024-09-13T12:11:01-07:00

Exposure, suspicion, special investigation: law enforcement officers in the Kupyan region worked har...	The law enforcement officers exposed a 49-year-old woman who worked as a clerk in the occupation administration. During the capture of the village of Dvorichna in the Kupyan District, a local resident voluntarily supported the Russian invaders. She assumed the position of -executive chief specialist of the paperwork sector of the Dvurechan territorial administration of the Temporary Civil Administration of the Kupyan district of the Kharkiv region.- The woman organized the documents and their further verification, formed cases and handed them over to the leadership of the occupation administration. Also, an official of the occupation administration was engaged in the formation of applications from local residents for further payment of -material aid- in Russian rubles. After the liberation of the district from the Russian invaders, the accomplice of the occupiers tried to avoid legal responsibility, but she was exposed. Also, the prosecutor's office in absentia notified about suspicion due to the fact of collaborative activity to a 37-year-old man who helped invaders to -legally take- Ukrainian enterprises into the property of the Russian Federation. During the occupation of the city of Kupyansk, he voluntarily agreed to cooperate with the Russian invaders, and in July 2022 he deliberately assumed the position of -executive chief specialist of the Department of Economic Development of the Military-Gradient Administration of the Kupyan District of the Kharkiv Region.- The man, on the instructions of the occupation leadership, carried out an inventory of communal and state enterprises, and also drew up -reports- based on its results. On the basis of these -documents-, the occupiers have already illegally transferred captured Ukrainian enterprises to the property of the aggressor state. Before the de-occupation of Kharkiv Oblast by the Defense Forces of Ukraine, the collaborator fled to the Russian Federation together with the Russian military. Law enforcement officers raised the issue of declaring him wanted. Also, the prosecutors completed a special investigation and sent to the court an indictment against the Kupyan city council member for the fact of collaborative activity. During the occupation of the city by the armed forces of the Russian Federation, she voluntarily cooperated with the Russian occupiers. In July 2022, the invaders appointed a woman to the position of -and. at. chief physician of the communal enterprise -Kupyanskoe territorial medical association- of the Ministry of Health of the Kharkiv Oblast Regional State Administration. Before the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine, the woman worked as a cardiologist, so she had relevant work experience and skills that she used when working for the invaders. The newly minted -leader- coordinated the work of subordinate employees, followed the instructions of the occupation leadership and even managed to appear in a Russian propaganda video. In the video, the -chief doctor- talked about receiving the so-called -human aid with medicines- from the Russian Federation, thus creating a positive image of the aggressor country. The woman performed her duties until the moment of deoccupation. She is currently hiding from Ukrainian law enforcement officers. The accused has been declared wanted, she will be tried in absentia. A woman faces up to ten years of imprisonment with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for a period of up to fifteen years and confiscation of property. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that this week, according to the materials The court of the State Bureau of Investigation sentenced 5 defectors, indictments were sent to the court against 3 collaborators, 4 more persons were notified of suspicion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/vykryttya-pidozra-speczrozsliduvannya-potrijno-vidpraczyuvaly-pravoohoronczi-na-kupyanshhyni/	2024-09-13T11:43:34-07:00

Putin's subject spied on the Armed Forces in Kharkiv: -shtirlitsa- will be tried	This was reported by the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office. In addition to official work in a banking institution, the man additionally spied for the benefit of the Russian Federation. Recruited by the Russian intelligence services, he established contact with a person who, in his opinion, had access to the state secret service in order to collect classified information. These data were necessary for the enemy to launch strikes on documentation storage sites with the aim of destroying them and, as a result, opposing the recovery of critical infrastructure that had already suffered from shelling by the aggressor state. In addition, the man collected information about the deployment locations of personnel and military equipment of Ukrainian defenders on the territory of Kharkiv. While moving around the city, the accused recorded, including with the help of a video recorder, the location of the armed forces. He transmitted the collected intelligence information to his curator via Telegram. The data obtained from the spy is necessary for the enemy to plan massive attacks. Thanks to the concerted and coordinated actions of the law enforcement officers, the spy was exposed and arrested in July 2024. During the search of his place of residence, mobile phones, flash drives, computer equipment, a video recorder, etc., as well as a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation and an improvised explosive device were seized. The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office approved and referred to the court an indictment on the facts of espionage, dissemination of information about the movement, movement, location of the Armed Forces, committed under martial law, with the purpose of providing such information to the state, which is carrying out armed aggression against Ukraine, as well as on the fact of acquisition, carrying and keeping an explosive device without a statutory permit. The man will be held without bail. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that banker-spy was detained in Kharkiv.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/piddanecz-putina-shpyguvav-za-zsu-u-harkovi-shtirlicza-sudytymut/	2024-09-13T11:12:15-07:00

GUR: Every operation to capture the enemy is a rescue of brothers who are in Russian captivity	Andrii Yusov, a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, shared the details on September 13 on the air of -Social News-. Today is the 56th exchange during the period of the full-scale invasion. 49 of our defenders have returned. Among them are the National Guard, the National Guard, the Armed Forces, the border guards, who were illegally convicted by the Russian invaders. We meet today at our homes. They are now provided with the first necessary medical assistance, psychological assistance, and initial examination. Next, of course, is a long rehabilitation process,- Andriy Yusov said. The representative of the GUR commented on the return from captivity of the defenders of Azovstal. -For Ukraine, the return of every defender from all divisions is an important task and everyone must return. But Russian propaganda pays special attention to individual units, individual episodes of the shameful Russian genocidal war against Ukrainians. However, no matter how difficult it is, we return ours. And the defenders of Azovstal were returned last exchange. Then they were conscripts. And this exchange we also have good news for the Mariupol garrison. And it will continue,- stated the representative of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. According to Andrii Yusov, the large-scale replenishment of the exchange fund during the Kursk operation also played a huge role in the exchange. Although each operation to capture the enemy is a separate difficult job and additional risks for our defenders, they save the lives of their brothers who are in Russian captivity. How ArmyInform reported earlier that 49 soldiers and civilians, including the Hero of Ukraine, returned home from Russian captivity. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/gur-kozhna-operacziya-po-zahoplennyu-voroga-u-polon-poryatunok-pobratymiv-yaki-v-rosijskij-nevoli/	2024-09-13T08:29:22-07:00

The President of Ukraine answered whether the operation in Kurshchyna was a mistake	He told about this during his participation in the 20th annual meeting of the Yalta European Strategy. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also noted that thanks to the Kursk operation, it was possible to stop the enemy in the Kharkiv direction and slow down the advance of the Russians in the Donetsk region. After the operation in Kurshchyna, the backlog of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for shells near Pokrovsk decreased from 1:12 to 1:2.5. -In Kurshchyna, the Russians began their rapid offensive. About 60-70 thousand people want to apply. We know about 40,000 are already there,- the President noted. The President noted that it is a pleasant fact that not only Ukraine is talking about the deoccupation of its territories, but also Russia. In addition, Volodymyr Zelenskyi answered the question whether the Kursk operation was a mistake. The head of state recalled the Russian offensive in the Kharkiv direction, which is also a very important center of the eastern part of Ukraine. -You saw that they broke through our defenses, wanted to capture Kharkiv, in addition to their official messages regarding the construction of some buffer zones along our entire border, and they would not have finished with the East,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The President noted that we later received intelligence from our partners. -In the north of our state, starting from Sumshchyna, from the east to the north of our state, plans were being prepared to create appropriate buffer zones, and with one or another military success, they wanted to capture the centers of these regions. This is what the Kursk operation gave,- the head of state summarized. In the opinion of Volodymyr Zelenskyi, the operation gave the results that everyone was counting on. -The enemy has been stopped in Kharkiv Oblast, its advance on Donetsk Oblast has slowed down, although it is very difficult there, and there is still a long way to positive things there. However, they withdrew their forces from Kharkiv Oblast, Zaporozhye and other groups that were preparing in the north for the occupation of our territories. The enemy began to move all this to the Kursk direction. This is what happened,- added the President.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/prezydent-ukrayiny-vidpoviv-chy-bula-operacziya-na-kurshhyni-pomylkoyu/	2024-09-13T07:09:04-07:00

Enemy armored assaults have become more frequent in Kharkiv Oblast: how to counter them	How this can be countered told on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon, the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU Vitaly Sarantsev. — Last day, the enemy tried to storm the units of the Defense Forces in Vovchansk and used two BMPs for support. Both machines were detected already during the approach to our positions and were hit by fire from FPV drones. One of the cars was destroyed, the other was damaged, he said. Despite heavy losses of the occupiers, they do not stop trying to storm in the future, which indicates the importance of the Kharkiv direction for the Russian military and political leadership. In order to continue the offensive, the invaders are trying to change tactics and approaches to carrying out combat missions. On the other hand, the Russians are not sending any significant reinforcements to Kharkiv region and are forced to storm with available forces. — The enemy conducts constant rotations, accumulates forces that carry out assaults in the city itself. He rotates these units internally and is constantly trying to strengthen them. As for any global accumulation, it is currently not observed either in the direction of Vovchansk or near other settlements, in particular Hlyboky, Lyptsi or other locations on the Russian-Ukrainian border, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that ->in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian drones put the occupiers on starvation rations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/vorozhi-broneshturmy-pochastishaly-na-harkivshhyni-yak-vdayetsya-protydiyaty/	2024-09-13T06:26:23-07:00

As a border guard - Schumacher - overtook enemy drones on bends	About Andrii with the call sign -Malyuk- said on September 13 on the website of the State Border Service. The first rotation of -Malyuk- — to the combat zone in the Kharkiv region. There he had to drive various armored and non-armored vehicles, deliver and pick up personnel from positions, transport the wounded, deliver ammunition and necessary property to the soldiers, etc. -With a night vision device, he drove at a speed of 120-130 km per hour at night. When the enemy FPV drones started to fly, it was even necessary to drive at a higher speed so that they did not catch up,- -Malyuk- recalls. Adrenaline, says the border guard, was over the top. However, they went to any challenge. And if at full speed in the dark they flew into ravines from enemy anti-tank vehicles and shells, then they simply pulled out the car, repaired it and drove on. Previously ArmyInform told about 43-year-old Serhiy, a soldier of the 78th separate airborne assault regiment and his experience of brutal battles in the Toretsk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/yak-prykordonnyk-shumaher-na-virazhah-obganyav-vorozhi-drony/	2024-09-13T05:57:48-07:00
President of Ukraine: We need long-range capability to change the course of the war	He emphasized this during a speech within the XX meeting of the Yalta European Strategy. The head of state noted that while Ukraine is waiting for the delivery of promised air defense systems, primarily Patriot, from partners, Russia continues to strike our country. After all, the Russian dictator does not need any long-range permits for this. -Anyone who simply sees on the map where Russia strikes from, where it prepares forces and keeps reserves, where it locates military facilities and what logistics it uses - anyone who sees all this obviously understands what long-range Ukraine is for,- - the President emphasized. Volodymyr Zelensky also noted that the other day he discussed this in detail with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and British Foreign Minister David Lammy. According to the words of the Head of State, after this meeting, there can no longer be any open question about why Ukraine needs sufficient long-range. -I want to emphasize: enough. Not enough to simply say that there is a solution. Long-range enough to change the course of the war and force Russia to seek peace. And we very much hope for our partners, we hope for the result from our partners. At least we are working on it,- added Volodymyr Zelenskyi. As reported by ArmyInform, the EU will send interest from frozen Russian assets to strengthen Ukraine's defense.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/prezydent-ukrayiny-nam-potribna-dalekobijnist-dlya-zminy-perebigu-vijny/	2024-09-13T05:48:04-07:00
The third recruiting center of the Ukrainian army opened in Sumy Oblast in a week	About this informs on September 13, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.

This makes it possible to attract precisely motivated personnel to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is a key factor for strengthening the combat capability of our army,- said Volodymyr Artyukh, head of the Sumy OVA. The database of Ukrainian army recruiting centers has more than 10,000 vacancies in the Defense Forces. These are drivers, grenade launchers, medics, UAV operators, psychologists, lawyers, clerks and others.

Without food and water in the trenches: the drones put the occupiers on starvation rations	reported who and how exactly deprived the occupiers of the basic necessities for conducting hostilities, on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Vitaly Sarantsev. -Such simple problems have serious consequences for the enemy, because those units that are in advanced positions cannot carry out their tasks efficiently, cannot go on assaults, cannot carry out tasks related to the engineering equipment of their positions,- he said. The lack of an established stable supply of provisions, water and, in some cases, even ammunition has a negative impact on the combat capability of enemy units. Such a situation was created thanks to the skilful combat work of Ukrainian drones, which broke the logistical chains of support in the enemy's near rear. — The prerequisite for this is the effective actions of our FPV drone operators, who skillfully search for the enemy's movement routes and cut all the logistics chains as precisely and accurately as possible. They destroy everything that approaches the positions, no matter how the enemy tries to carry out these support tasks either on foot, using motorized vehicles, or using cars, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast, the occupiers suffer from Ukrainian drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/bez-harchiv-ta-vody-v-okopah-dronari-posadyly-okupantiv-na-golodnyj-pajok/	2024-09-13T05:23:56-07:00

Free pallia: no money was earned, only a suspicion of 10 years in prison	The Security Service of Ukraine informs about this. -This time, the occupiers remotely involved two Odesa residents, an immigrant from Luhansk region and a resident of Izmail district, before committing arson. Among them are three minors. All of them were looking for -easy money- in Telegram channels, where they got into the field of view of the special services of the Russian Federation, -said SBU employees. In order to carry out enemy tasks, the participants at various times found potential -targets- and then coordinated them with their Russian supervisors. After the arsons, the attackers recorded the fire on the cameras of their own phones and sent a -video report- to representatives of the Russian special services. According to such an algorithm, the perpetrators destroyed 6 official cars of Ukrainian defenders, but never received the promised money from the occupiers. Criminals were arrested -on hot pursuit- in various districts of Odesa. During the searches of the homes of the detainees, incendiary devices and mobile phones with evidence of subversive activities for the benefit of the Russian Federation were seized. Investigators of the Security Service informed the detainees (according to the crimes committed) of suspicion under the following articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: The perpetrators are in custody. They face 8 to 10 years in prison.

The cases of exploitation of car fuel tanks have become more frequent, that is, they have become overturned more. This information is being verified. But it fits into the general picture of the situation that arose due to the lack of ferry connections, which was the main logistical tool for ensuring the grouping both in Crimea itself and in the south of our country,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk.

The end of a saboteur's career: a man from Chernihiv who helped destroy his own city was detained	notified the Security Service of Ukraine.

The priority targets of the enemy shelling were the base points of the Ukrainian troops involved in the defense of the northern borders of Ukraine. According to available data, the occupiers planned to use Kh-59 air missiles to carry out fire damage. The Russian special service also tried to find out the locations of enterprises that fulfill a state defense order. To perform these tasks, the FSB remotely recruited a 44-year-old employee of a local factory. -The man came to the attention of the Russian special services because of his anti-Ukrainian comments in Telegram channels.

-Sarayami- according to the Donetsk scenario: what makes Russians submissively -canned in cans-	The battalion commander told about the peculiarities of storming -barracks- according to the Donetsk scenario on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- of shock air defense systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket chieftain Ivan Sirk, captain Yury Fedorenko. — The first armored vehicle that goes in their assault column is mostly an old modification tank, roughly like the T-72. It can be without a tower, without ammunition. It is used precisely as a carrier. From above, it is actually covered with a -barn-. Anyone who has ever seen a barn or an old house knows how it will look made of metal, said the drone commander. In front of this armored vehicle are trawls designed to remove mine barriers, both anti-personnel and anti-tank. — Between the body of the tank and between this -barn-, which is welded on top, there is an assault infantry. Behind the tank, 2-3 BMPs are moving, similarly covered with -sheds- on top. Between the body of the BMP and this very -barn- is the assault infantry, the soldier continued. It is difficult to understand why the Russians meekly accept certain death. — Frankly speaking, I do not know what the Russian occupiers are telling the military and how they are forcing them to climb into this structure that is being built, because it is certain death. Most of the conscious people who are involved in the military affairs understand this, including new recruits of the Russian Federation. But the system of coercion in them works perfectly and the occupier is more afraid of his own than going to the battlefield to certain death. Therefore, one way or another, they are -preserved- in this -can-, said Yuriy Fedorenko. Next, assault actions take place - Russian -barracks- rush in the direction of the positions of the units of the Defense Forces. — At high speed, the main task is to jump to our advanced positions. -Tanchyk makes a pass and BMPs fly behind him to rush the infantry and then move on to shock-assault actions with the aim of displacing us from advanced positions,- said the commander of -Achilles-. The military said that drones saw such sheds for the first time in Donetsk region. There, they were used most in the Avdiivka region, in the Bakhmut area and in other places. Losses among the personnel of the enemy during such assaults are colossal. — 90% of vehicles are currently destroyed by Defense Forces on the battlefield either immediately or after damage. Up to 60-70% of the assault infantry, which moves on such equipment, does not reach the line of advance, Yuriy Fedorenko said. The military said that during the past day, Achilles fighters managed to destroy 4 units of armored vehicles - one tank and 3 BMP. In general, even more enemy equipment was burned on the field, because the gunners and drones of other units also worked well on it. Since the beginning of September, the -Achillesians- have already destroyed 25 units of the occupiers' equipment. However, the droners are in no hurry to relax - the occupants still have enough -dances- and -beh- left. -This indicates that the enemy still has the opportunity, unfortunately, to carry out shock-assault actions and deploy its lightly armored and armored vehicles,- noted Yuriy Fedorenko. Earlier, ArmyInform showed how the long-range -helmeted- Achilles - hit exactly under the turret of a Russian tank and defeated -Grad - in Belgorod region, and the all-seeing -Achilles- saw and eliminated the occupiers and shot a full yagdtash of enemy equipment in Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/sarayamy-za-doneczkym-sczenariyem-shho-zmushuye-rosiyan-pokirno-konservuvatysya-v-blyashanky/	2024-09-13T01:51:18-07:00

The EU will direct interest from frozen Russian assets to strengthen Ukraine's defense	About this informs the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. -Ukraine thanks the EU for the decision to direct interest from frozen Russian assets to Ukraine's defense needs.

Scaling up the production of EW systems, training servicemen to use them effectively are the main tasks at the moment. -It is hard to imagine a battlefield without EW devices now,- noted the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Andriy Lebedenko. -In the realities of modern warfare, the number of hits by drones is on the same level as artillery.- The number of applications of UAVs is growing every month, as is the number of their modifications. Today, damage by drones reaches 60%. Therefore, the development of EW systems, their maximum efficiency and their supply to the troops in sufficient quantity is an issue that requires an urgent solution. Effective EW on the battlefield is, first of all, the preservation of the lives of Ukrainian soldiers, therefore the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine identified the development of EW systems as one of the key priorities. Currently, we have three ways of developing EW: improvement of existing weapons, introduction of EW equipment provided by foreign partners and introduction of qualitatively new EW equipment of our own production. Therefore, our goal today is to discuss all problems, hear from manufacturers, colleagues from the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, the Ministry of Strategic Industries of Ukraine and obtain effective algorithms for improving EW tools, - emphasized the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The head of the Department of Innovation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Vitaly Dobryansky, emphasized that the existing system of support for domestic manufacturers at the stages of development and codification of EW systems requires special attention. Currently, a system of testing the latest samples is organized and functioning. We are also forming experimental combat units to conduct such tests in combat conditions, the conclusions of which will greatly simplify the codification of products. According to Oleksandr Bornyakov, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine for IT Development, the number of samples of radio electronic warfare has now increased significantly. -We started with ten to fifteen developments, now we have about two hundred,- he emphasized. During the forum, manufacturers of electronic warfare systems had the opportunity not only to share their vision for the development of the industry, but also to present some of the latest developments. According to representatives of the manufacturing companies, all systems have been successfully tested and are currently working effectively at the front. As reported by ArmyInform, on the sidelines of the MSPO International Specialized Weapons Exhibition, which was recently held in Poland, -ugody-pro-spivpraczyu-v-sferi-ozbroyennya/->several measures aimed at strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities took place.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/forum-z-rozvytku-reb-ukrayinski-vyrobnyky-predstavyly-novitni-rozrobky-dlya-frontu/	2024-09-12T23:12:37-07:00

Enemy saboteurs in Sumy Oblast are detected by drones: what do the DRGs do?	told about this on the broadcast of the -Edyny Novy- marathon spokesman of the State Border Service of Ukraine Andrii Demchenko. — Although the activity has decreased, the enemy's subversive activities have not completely disappeared. Therefore, our soldiers continue to act actively and jointly together in order to expose the attempts of enemy sabotage and intelligence groups to enter with any purpose. For this, we use unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as other technical means of terrain control, he said. In general, the activity of Russian saboteurs in the border zone in the Sumy region has significantly decreased compared to previous periods before the start of the Kursk offensive operation. If earlier enemy saboteurs engaged in battle with Ukrainian defenders, tried to inflict fire damage or even capture positions, now they focused on attempts to detonate the area. -Saboteurs are trying to enter our territory, especially to take certain actions in order to mine the area, but not to engage in fire activity,- said Andriy Demchenko. He noted that the Russian DRGs are afraid of encountering active opposition from the units of the Defense Forces and that is why they have reduced their activity, avoid detection at all costs and have given up attempts to proactively enter the battle. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Defense Forces forced the enemy to practically abandon the use of DRG in Sumshchyna, therefore minuvanni-misczevosti/->Russian saboteurs on the northern border focused on mining the area. Instead, thanks to the Kursk operation, Ukrainian defenders are able to significantly strengthen border protection in Sumshchyna /a>.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/vorozhyh-dyversantiv-na-sumshhyni-vyyavlyayut-dronamy-chym-zajmayutsya-drg/	2024-09-12T22:54:55-07:00

propaganda -reflects- information about Kurshchyna: why is Bucha here?	The situation is especially cynicized by the fact that, in the case of the shops, the propagandists show footage of the soldiers of the Soviet Union engaged in their usual looting business - only not in Ukraine, but in their -native- Kursk region! At the same time, the representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Sakharova, calls on international structures -not to turn a blind eye to the terrorist acts of the Kyiv regime on the territory of the Russian Federation.- This tactic, typical of Russian propaganda, is called -mirroring.- Propagandists make the same accusations against Ukraine that we once made against Russia, in particular regarding the events in Buch. That is, they often do not even invent fakes, but simply copy news items from Ukrainian news. The average Russian who consumes this information willingly believes it, because he would have behaved the same way in a foreign country (which the Ukrainians were able to see many times) — he looted, shot, raped. Therefore, Sakharova's appeal to international structures is completely hopeless. After all, apart from unspoken accusations of crimes, the Russians cannot provide any evidence of illegal actions by the Armed Forces. It is Russia that systematically uses terrorist methods of warfare and violates international humanitarian law, while Ukraine protects its territory and citizens from the aggressor. Regarding the war crimes committed by the Russians in Ukraine, a significant evidence base has been collected, both Ukrainian and independent world media wrote about them and continue to write about them. Therefore, the Russians use -reflection- primarily to divert attention from their failure in Kurshchyna and the inevitable defeat in the war that they themselves started.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/rospropaganda-vidzerkalyuye-informacziyu-pro-kurshhynu-do-chogo-tut-bucha/	2024-09-12T20:22:16-07:00
Howitzer M101A1: the history of the gun — the record holder	This extraordinary howitzer certainly deserves a more detailed account. The correspondent of ArmiyaInform talked about it with Andriy Kharuk, a well-known weapons researcher, author of a personal profile art blog, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities of the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaydachny. The first part of the conversation was published by last week, and today we bring to your attention the second part of the conversation. — In addition to the modernization of the gun itself, as far as is known, the cartridges for it also underwent changes&#8230; — After the refusal in 1934 to use shrapnel in the ammunition of American 105-mm howitzers only two types of projectiles remained - high-explosive M1 with a mass of 14.97 kg and smoke. Already during the Second World War, an armor-piercing projectile, an aiming projectile (with colored smoke) and a cluster fragmentation projectile (used primarily in the Pacific theater of war) were adopted as weapons. The M1 projectile had two modifications - standard and -deep penetration- (with a reinforced case, but with a reduced charge mass). TNT or -composition B- - a mixture of TNT and RDX - was used for the equipment. The explosive mass for the standard projectile was 2.3 kg (for -composition B-) or 2.177 kg (for TNT); for a deep penetration projectile - 2.087 kg or 1.93 kg, respectively. The armor-piercing projectile weighed 13.25 kg and was equipped with a mixture of pentrite and TNT weighing 1.33 kg. The charge was profiled to form a cumulative jet. The initial speed of this projectile was 381 m/s. It could penetrate armor 102 mm thick at a distance of up to 1,800 m. Howitzer loading is semi-unitary (cases with charges were transported separately from shells, but were connected before loading). Seven variable shells were used for firing. — Mr. Professor, I ask you to clarify the marking system of this howitzer, because some informative sources create confusion in these markings. — In 1962, the M2A1 howitzer on the M2A1 carriage was given the designation M101 , and on the carriage M2A2 - M101A1. In both cases, barrels of two modifications could be used - M2A1 or M2A2, as well as anti-recoil devices of one of five modifications - from M2A1 to M2A5. Sights were improved and included: Elbow M16A1D telescopic sight for direct fire (3x magnification, 13° field of view); panoramic sight Panoramic M12A7S (4x magnification, field of view - 10°); quadrant M4A1. Ammunition, as before, consisted of semi-unitary shots, but their range was expanded and included the following types of shells: — This howitzer— no only an old-timer and a participant in many military campaigns, but also one of the record holders for the number of copies produced. - Mass production of howitzers at the Rock Island Arsenal continued until 1953, the total number of M2A1s produced was brought to 10,202 units. However, in the following years, the production of M101A1 howitzers was periodically renewed to fulfill export orders. The last such order (for 133 howitzers) was received in 1981 from Indonesia, the company fulfilled it by November 1983. —From the historical perspective and tactical and technical features, Andriy Ivanovych, let's focus on the direct service of this weapon. Which units of the US Army were they sent to? - In the late 1930s, the US Army began transitioning its infantry divisions to a new, -triangular- structure. The artillery of such a division was to consist of three divisions of 75-mm guns and one division of 105-mm howitzers (12 artillery systems in a division). Since there were no serial samples of 105-mm howitzers yet, the old 155-mm howitzers M1917 of the Schneider system were introduced in the division instead of these guns. Following the German Blitzkrieg in France, the US military decided to replace the 75 mm guns with 105 mm howitzers, leaving the division with a division of 155 mm howitzers - this was the organization of divisional artillery throughout World War II. — But, in addition to saturating each unit with specific guns, they needed to be managed successfully. How was this process organized? - An important innovation was the organization of a Fire Directio Center (FDC) in each division. It made it possible to focus the fire of the division on one target, and after it was hit, quickly transfer it to the next one. Central control equipment provided communication with batteries and forward artillery observers, as well as producing data for setting sights. In 1941, fire control centers also appeared at the division level. In 1937, the US Army had only 25 field artillery divisions. By December 1941 (the moment the United States entered the war), their number reached 142, and by 1945 exceeded 700. 264 of them had M2A1 howitzers: 161 divisions (147 as part of divisions and 14 separate) in the European Theater of War, 71 (respectively 62 and 9) in the Pacific and 32 in the US territory. In 1942, M2A1 howitzers appeared in the Marine Corps - one division of such guns was introduced into the divisional artillery regiments along with three divisions of 75-mm howitzers. By the beginning of the large amphibious operations on Saipan and Guam, the artillery regiments already had two divisions of 105-mm and 75-mm howitzers, and by the time of the landing on Iwo Jima in 1945, three and one, respectively. — As far as is known, during the Second World War this weaponry, along with others, was also prepared for export. How were these deliveries organized? - The main recipients of American aid under the Lend-Lease program - Great Britain and the USSR - did not show much interest in American artillery systems, making do with their own artillery systems. The USSR did not receive any such howitzers, the British were given only 16. The American howitzers were much more needed by China and Free France, which received 476 and 239 M2A1s, respectively. Another 223 units of these howitzers were transferred to a number of Latin American states that entered the war on the side of the Allies, but they were used in battle only by the Brazilians, who sent an infantry division to Italy that had three divisions of 105-mm howitzers. — And what was the fate of the use of these guns after the Second World War? — 105-mm howitzers were quite widely used during the Korean War, and on both sides of the front, both by the US and of the Republic of Korea, as well as parts of Chinese volunteers who fought on the side of the DPRK. The last campaign of the US Army in which the M101A1 howitzer was widely used was the Vietnam War. Their main task in this war was the direct support of infantry units, howitzers were relatively rare in divisions. Much more often, they were used in battery, underwater or even separate artillery installations. The use of howitzers of the 1st Division of the 7th Artillery Regiment as the armament of the LCM-6 landing craft became quite exotic. Later, AMMI pontoons mounted from standard sections were used as floating batteries. For two M101A1 howitzers, a pontoon measuring 27.45×8.66 m was used, on the edges of which ammunition storage was located, in the center - living quarters, and between it and the artillery bunkers - howitzer positions (all this was protected by armor sheets). Each battery had at its disposal three AMMI pontoons and five LCM-8 landing craft (three of them served as tugboats pushing pontoons, one as a fire control center, and another one carried additional ammunition). Since 1966, new 105-mm howitzers M102 began to arrive to replace the M101A1. The old systems were gradually transferred to the Allies until the end of 1969. South Vietnam received 730 M101A1 howitzers (only 60 of the new M102 systems were delivered). A year later, the South Vietnamese army had forty divisions of 105-mm howitzers (thirty in infantry divisions, seven separate and three airborne), as well as a hundred separate M101A1 platoons in fortified positions. Losses were also considerable, especially during the repulse of large-scale offensive operations. So, for the period from March 31 to April 10, 1972, 81 howitzers were lost. — Meanwhile, in the US Army itself, these guns were abandoned far from immediately. — In the US Army and Marine Corps, the M102 was never able to completely replace the old 105-millimeter guns. In 1983, the M101A1 took part in the last combat operation in the US Army — the invasion of Grenada. In 1985, the US Army had (mostly in the National Guard and Reserve) six M101 howitzers and 494 M101A1s. It wasn't until the 1990s that both the M101A1 and M102 were replaced by the new 105mm M119 howitzers. — During the so-called Cold War, the United States was an active supplier of its weapons to allies and partners. Surely, foreign armies were also interested in this proven weapon? — In the postwar years, American 105-mm howitzers entered the arms of the armies of several dozen countries — primarily NATO members (Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Turkey , Germany, France). Non-aligned Austria and Yugoslavia also received them, and after the collapse of the latter, newly independent states. In Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the M101A1 replaced the British-style 25-pounder. If in Australia and New Zealand the American howitzers have already been replaced by the licensed version of the English L118, then the Canadians in 1997 modernized their 105-mm howitzers (replacing the barrel with a longer, 33-caliber one) and under the C3 designation they keep a certain amount in spare parts. The basic version of the M101A1 was designated in Canada as C1 and was produced under license in the 1950s. In Latin America, the countries that did not operate American 105-mm howitzers are easier to think of: Costa Rica and Panama. In the rest of the states of the region (from Mexico in the north to Argentina in the south, as well as the islands of Haiti and the Dominican Republic), these howitzers are in service. Their number varies from country to country and ranges from a few units to several hundred (for example, Brazil has more than 250). In Africa, M101s are less common, but even in this region, you can name a good dozen countries that have received these systems. Ethiopia, Libya and Liberia received 105-mm howitzers as military aid from the United States, and Mozambique and some other states received them -inherited- from the colonialists. In the Middle East, M101 was used by both sides of the Israeli-Jordanian and Iranian-Iraqi conflicts, and was used in the armies of Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. American 105-millimeter guns are quite widespread in Indochina and the Far East (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Burma, the Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, Japan). In Japan and Taiwan, M101A1 howitzers were produced under license. In several countries, these howitzers have been modernized (for example, by turning into self-propelled guns, as in the Republic of Korea), but the modernization of the M101 is a topic for a separate story — Well, and a few words, Mr. Professor, about the present of these howitzers. — M101's career is gradually coming to an end. But even in the 21st century, this howitzer continues to serve to protect democracy. Ukraine received 18 such howitzers in September 2022. Their path to our Armed Forces was winding: the Americans at one time gave these howitzers to Denmark, and in 2002 they gave them to Lithuania, and twenty years later, the Lithuanians gave the M101A1 to Ukraine. The Ukrainian M101A1 made its combat debut in November 2022, and this howitzer was officially adopted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on August 28, 2023. 71 separate hunting brigades are known to use these systems. In one of its previous materials, ArmyInform told about the service of these guns in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and how they are evaluated by our garmaty.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/gaubyczya-m101a1-istoriya-garmaty-rekordsmenky/	2024-09-12T20:11:21-07:00
How many rockets are needed to bring down the Crimean bridge: an expert on air defense of the Russia...	Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmyInform about this. — Today, there is a question as to what the air defense of Crimea is in terms of cover by anti-aircraft missile systems. Indeed, at the moment it is much denser and better than the cover in Moscow, the military expert notes. According to him, almost all complexes are concentrated in Crimea, starting with a small radius of action, that is, for example, such as OSA, to the most modern S-300, S-400. And there is already confirmed information that their very rare S-500 complexes, of which there are 16 units in total, will be deployed there. This complex declares a target interception range of up to 600 kilometers at a speed of 3,000 meters per second - here we are talking about the target. Chernyk reminds that the speed of ATACMS missile is 1500 meters per second. — Why does the enemy act in this way? Because there is a problem with the Crimean Bridge. We are well aware that in order for the Crimean bridge to fall, it must be attacked by no less than 60-70 ballistic missiles. These are the same ATACMS. Or, let's say, now there is news that the development of our Ukrainian ballistic missiles of the Grom-2 type continues. In fact, there is nothing new here, but this work is ongoing, the expert adds. Chernyk says that there must be a large number of drones in this component: - And the total salvo for the bridge to really fall should be no less than 100-120 units of the appropriate equipment. the Russians are well aware that as soon as the bridge falls, Crimea will suffocate in terms of logistics. 90% of everything that is transported to Crimea is transported by rail. Petro Chernyk notes that it is becoming more and more difficult for the enemy to deliver (cargo. — Ed.) by barges. — Especially since we already have very good news that we even started sinking barges. Therefore, the enemy concentrated a huge amount of everything in the Crimea. At the same time, over the past six months, we have at least 5 cases of confirmation of the destruction of both the radar systems that provide the same S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems, as well as the destruction of the launchers themselves. And, so far, there is no confirmed information that the old ATACMS, which entered service in 1989, were successfully intercepted by the air defense system of the Russian Federation in Crimea, the expert emphasized. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/skilky-raket-potribno-shhob-upav-krymskyj-mist-ekspert-pro-protypovitryanu-oboronu-rf/	2024-09-12T20:00:52-07:00

Cruise missiles -minimaly-: an American start-up offered the Pentagon a new ammunition	The startup Ares Industries, named after the Greek god of war, was only founded in May 2024. However, on the portal of the California startup center Y Combinator the other day there was posted a message that the engineers of this company have already started flight tests of compact and inexpensive cruise missiles from this manufacturer, ArmiyaInform reports. The missiles are being developed primarily for use against ships and will, according to Ares, be -ten times smaller and ten times cheaper- than any currently known model. Anti-ship missiles now weigh more than a ton and cost several million dollars each. Ares plans to sell its rockets for $300,000 per unit. Ares Industries details its developments in a release. The entire summer was spent building several prototypes and testing them in the Mojave Desert. As a result of these tests, the first batch is already being prepared for the delivery of operational missiles to customers, which is planned to be carried out by mid-2025. According to Ares representatives, cruise missiles should be compatible with existing launch platforms and move at a high subsonic speed (the speed of sound is about 1,200 km/h). Developers want to focus on land and ship options, that is, those that are launched from vehicles or warships. In the future, airborne versions and variants with a longer flight range will also appear. Ares does not provide any information about the range of the first version, only stating that it is several hundred miles (that is, no less than 322 kilometers). This California-based startup's rendering shows anti-ship missiles similar to Lockheed Martin's AGM-158C LRASM. Long-range anti-ship missiles (LRASM) have stealth characteristics. Individual cruise missiles can communicate with each other and use artificial intelligence to bypass air defense measures. Their range is 370 kilometers. The updated version, which is planned to be introduced by the US Navy in 2026, is expected to have a range of 950 kilometers. However, AGM-158C LRASMs are quite expensive. The price per unit is about $3 million.The US Navy and Air Force together want to buy more than 1,000 AGM-158Cs by 2030. Ares Industries believes that its anti-ship missiles could hypothetically be used against China in the Pacific Ocean. However, recent conflicts in the Middle East have shown that American weapons are too expensive. Current US anti-ship missiles are designed to attack destroyers. However, it makes no sense to attack smaller frigates or even drone boats with millions of dollars worth of remotely controlled weapons. In a possible conflict in the Pacific, the United States would launch thousands of anti-ship missiles a week, depleting the stockpile in days. -We cannot produce enough anti-ship missiles to counter China,- the company said. Another benefit of Ares Industries' approach is the ability to perform so-called saturation attacks. During such group attacks, the enemy's defense systems are suppressed by a huge number of missiles and drones. However, the weapons with which these attacks are carried out must be correspondingly cheap. And size plays a role, too. Warships have limited space in their missile launchers. For example, if an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer's Mk-41 launcher has room for 96 LRASM cruise missiles, it can at least theoretically carry and launch 960 smaller Ares missiles instead. Then a single destroyer could hit the enemy fleet with nearly a thousand anti-ship missiles. The goal is not only to cause material damage to the enemy. In the second wave of attacks, larger rounds and cruise missiles may be launched. They have a better chance of achieving their goal, because the air defenses are already weakened by Shahed drones or need to be reloaded with ammunition and anti-aircraft missiles, and therefore are not yet ready to repulse an enemy attack. The Pentagon's profile program also shows that the US wants to increase the production of small and cheap weapons. As part of this initiative, thousands of small unmanned autonomous drones will be developed by 2025 and will use artificial intelligence. Defense companies, especially startups, are also joining this trend. Anduril Industries, a company created by Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey, recently announced that it will build a -hyperscale- manufacturing facility to create large-scale autonomous weapons systems such as drones or autonomous underwater vehicles. <iframe loading=-lazy- title=-What Do The Navy's Ship-Launched Missiles Actually Cost?- width=-640- height=-360- src=-https://www.youtube.com/embed/47BDvAuKRHc?start=271&amp;feature=oembed- frameborder=-0- allow=-accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write ; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share=-strict-origin-when-cross-origin- Comparative evaluation of the US Navy.

Counter-intelligence of the SBU exposed attempts by the Russian Federation to obtain data on the def...	About informs Security Service of Ukraine. The enemy agent turned out to be a local IT specialist who worked for a staff member of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces (better known as Gru). On the instructions of the occupier, the suspect set up an -observation post- in his own apartment to covertly monitor the locations of the Defense Forces. To do this, the informant purchased and installed tactical binoculars with a high magnification, a rangefinder grid and a compass in the apartment of a multi-story building. With the help of specialized optics, the person involved hoped to detect the positions of air defense and Ukrainian artillery, in particular HIMARS rocket artillery systems. The attacker also tracked the routes of military convoys and the location of Defense Forces fortifications. He transmitted the information he received to his Russian curator through an anonymous chat in the messenger.

-Your family will leave you, son-: Russia throws conscripts into battle in the Kharkiv Region	This was reported by the spokesman of the operative-tactical group -Kharkiv-, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. The next step may be the start of a large-scale mobilization campaign in the Russian Federation. — The significant losses suffered by the enemy in the Kharkiv direction, more than ten thousand people only in our operational zone in four months, forced Russia to look for additional resources to continue the war. Russian legislation does not prohibit enlisting conscript soldiers for combat operations after they have completed four months of service, so it is possible to predict their appearance in other areas as well, he noted. According to the spokesman, this may indicate a lack of military personnel in Russian units, as a result of which the military command is forced to use less experienced soldiers for combat missions. Voyskovyi added that Russian propaganda had already warmed up society to such a development, tested its reaction, which predictably turned out to be zero, so the next steps should be expected - the start of a large-scale mobilization campaign in Russia.

The head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs lied again: about what this time	This happened after participation in the Strategic Dialogue between the Russian Federation and the Cooperation Council of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation said: -We never wanted someone else's land. We wanted people who are part of the -Russian world- to be treated humanely. This absurd and false statement by Lavrov shows that the Russian government is generally detached from reality and lives in its own -bubble-. The whole world knows that the Russian Federation is an occupier and an invader. If Russia did not seek to seize someone else's land, then why did it change its own constitution to include six administrative-territorial units of Ukraine? Moreover, Russia cynically destroys precisely those regions where the Russian-speaking population mainly lived. According to the Office of the Prosecutor General, during the period of the large-scale invasion, as of September 10, almost 150,000 crimes of aggression and war crimes against the Russian Federation, more than 18,000 crimes against national security, and more than 2,000 crimes against children were registered. I wonder if, according to Lavrov's sick logic, after the liberation of part of the Kursk region, where the government of the Russian Federation refused to ensure the interests of its own citizens, Russia itself has the right to be territorially intact?	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/ochilnyk-mzs-rosiyi-znovu-zbrehav-pro-shho-czogo-razu/	2024-09-11T20:20:55-07:00
Leading cities and what will be new in the fall: how the recruiting campaign in Ukraine continues. I...	What are the most in-demand positions today? But in the end, do recruiting centers solve the problem of the lack of people in the army? ArmiyaInform asked about all this during a blitz interview with Oleksiy Bezhevets, the authorized representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on recruiting issues. — A few numbers: how many open recruiting centers do we have as of the beginning of September? What cities are in the plans? — The network is developing. We currently have 34 recruiting centers. Kraynaya was opened in Uman, before that there was Chernivtsi. There are, of course, plans to open new recruiting centers. As always, we do not announce the city: first we open, then we talk about it. But about 10 more such centers are in the process of preparation. Currently, we have literally a few regions left in Ukraine where centers are not yet present. And in all these regions, preparatory work is underway. Moreover, we are talking not only about regional centers, but also district ones, where the local authorities, in cooperation with us, have decided that it is advisable to do this. Therefore, by the end of October, at most in November, there will not be a single region of Ukraine without a Ukrainian army recruiting center. At the end of autumn, there will be at least 40 of them, as I can see from the dynamics at the moment. As for statistics, more than 16,000 people applied to recruiting centers as of the beginning of September. That is, all these people received counseling. Yes, there are a certain number of people who could not find vacancies for one reason or another: either quite specific requirements, or a specific profile of the corresponding candidate, which may not be suitable for military service, or some other specific characteristics. After all, the part determines whether the candidate is suitable for the vacant position and whether the part wants to see a person with the corresponding characteristics in him. Therefore, we are now simultaneously launching the process of reviewing the status of those candidates who have not been selected for vacancies, but who have taken the initiative and voluntarily decided to join the ranks of the Defense Forces. The goal: to work additionally with everyone who has expressed a desire, but has not yet been able to become a military serviceman. We also have an active communication campaign, which will now be intensified in various channels: outdoor advertising, additional online activities, etc. Information influence plays a role because coverage and communication with communities gives us an influx of new candidates interested in positions in the military. When these communication activities subside and new information waves roll in, people forget that there is such an opportunity and live in their information bubble. Our task is to enter this information bubble and tell people about the unique opportunity to choose a position and part on their own. And then help make a choice, don't miss the chance, because the mobilization processes are ongoing. —Which city shows the most effective result in the context of people's appeals to the recruiting center? — We have four such cities: Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia. By all indicators, these are the leaders, although there are also small cities, such as Shostka. This is a small town that has organized all these processes in a cool way, and they have great results. From the point of view of the efficiency of the centers even in small cities, this is already a definite plus, they perform their work, spending minimal resources and performing very important functions for the state. Yes, let even one recruiter work there. But if he recruits even 10 volunteers motivated to protect the Motherland of people, then this is already arch-class. And if there is already such an opportunity in a small community, and people have been helped, it is important. Because every person is a separate destiny. And we helped define and shape this destiny so that a person finds himself in the protection of the Motherland. —Which recruiting center and where was the most difficult to open from an organizational point of view? Is there resistance from local authorities in this process? And which region is the friendliest? We have wonderful people, and each region really has its own specifics (smiles. Ed.). Yes, there are nuances during the opening. Someone has different standards, approaches in work, business processes, communication culture, etc. Yes, in some places the processes were more complicated, in some - the processes went as quickly as possible. There are centers that we open literally within a week, and there are regions where preparation takes months. And it seems the same result, but the effort spent on this process is many times more. —What are your expectations-forecasts for the recruitment campaign of autumn 2024? — We continue to open centers, several per month. Maybe there will be an opening every week. Now we will see the dynamics in the degree of readiness. Up to 10 recruitment centers are planned to open in the next three months. We are also planning online activities at the same time: the process of creating a recruiting center in online mode is underway. This is a recruiting model where recruiters will proactively and exclusively online communicate with people and offer them certain vacancies in the Defense Forces. That is, we are talking about the proactive position of the center: we see a person who is looking for a job, his resume is posted on a website with vacancies. And we are the first to call and offer service in the Defense Forces and a position that is as close as possible to the position a person is looking for. Also, by the end of September, we plan to launch a hotline so that people can call, consult, voice complaints, etc. We hope to maintain the momentum in terms of volunteer requests in the fall, and it will only grow. We also want to provide physical support for candidates at all stages of registration to the ranks of the Defense Forces. We are currently discussing this with one of the recruiting centers of the Armed Forces centers. We are currently working out the details of how it should work and what it will look like. This is done so that the person is calm that there is a military man next to him, who will guide him -by the hand-, relatively speaking, through all the rooms, help with all the questions that have arisen: regarding VLK, processing documents, personal affairs, etc. And it will be a soldier -in the system- who communicates in the same language with other soldiers. We hope to launch such a service soon. Let's start with Kyiv and the region. In addition, we are preparing an approach to certain categories of people who, for example, are suitable for military service, but with certain restrictions. Such people now have the opportunity to join the service. And for such military personnel, we are developing a mechanism for creating a list of vacancies where, according to the law, they can serve, there are units that are ready to accept such people and ensure that these people actually return to military life. Such a separate initiative is also currently being developed. We will also go further in the future. Perhaps we will start with Kyiv: so that a person who decides to recruit can come to Kyiv, he will be provided with temporary housing and food while he solves organizational issues. And specialists will help her to complete documents at the TCC, and so that she can go to the training center to learn military affairs in a calm manner. In addition, the approval of changes in normative documents, Cabinet resolutions, which provide for the possibility of military units to directly register a recruit without the participation of the TCC, for the period of martial law, is currently ending. This is an exception in order to simplify the process of a person entering the army as much as possible. I hope that by the end of September these changes will be accepted and will come into force. —How many vacancies in the Defense Forces are we talking about as of the beginning of September? — According to our internal database, it is about 4,000 vacancies. Plus the online database on four online job search platforms — about 10,000 more. Yes, the mosaic of vacancies in the Defense Forces is huge. And a quality search gives a cool conversion: a person who applied and is eligible for military service can actually find a good job for himself. —Which professions/positions are currently the most in demand? — Every week there are spikes for certain positions. Yes, a large number of applications were, for example, for reconnaissance. There was a separate period when gunners were looking for positions. Always relevant - UAV operators. There is also a demand for staff positions, clerks, and the IT field. —Have there been cases when citizens turn to recruiting centers with the goal of signing a contract, rather than mobilizing? — Yes. Today, that ratio is roughly 40 to 60 or 60 to 40, and the figure fluctuates from month to month. —Do recruiting centers solve the problem of lack of people in the army? — Yes, there is a trend. The situation has improved significantly (in fact, since the end of spring) with the manning of military units. Yes, there are still not enough people, but the situation has improved. The role of recruiting centers in this is essential, because a large percentage of people who join the ranks of the Defense Forces every month are volunteers. These are thousands of people every month who used this new algorithm: took a letter of recommendation, found a part and went to serve there. And there are many such people. —How do young people react to recruiting centers? Your subjective observations. — If we take global statistics, then, unfortunately, we have the following indicators regarding the demographic situation: people who were born in the 90s or at the beginning of the 2000s are simply significantly less than those who who were born in the 70s, for example. But young people also turn to recruiting centers. We explain to them that they have the opportunity to conclude a contract for one year, they are not subject to mobilization, will have the opportunity to enter a higher military educational institution, receive the rank of officer, etc. It can be a ticket to life. Yes, young people are applying, and we perfectly understand that a lot needs to be done in this area, and a lot is already being done in this area. —Do women turn to recruiting centers— what is the trend? What positions are they looking for? Who are they in civilian life? - They apply, and there are a lot of them. In Sumy region, for example, a third of the candidates with whom work is being done on job selection are from women. One in three appeals is from a woman. And the potential is just huge. A woman in the army is not necessarily only a cook, a clerk, a lawyer or a journalist. In fact, there are no legal restrictions. A woman can also get professional training for almost any position in the army and perform her duties. A large number of units are very loyal and recruit women. Moreover, for different positions: snipers, UAV operators, medics. And Chernihiv region is also a regional leader in terms of the number of women applying to recruiting centers. —Portrait of a citizen of Ukraine who applies to a recruiting center,— what is he like? Each person is a separate universe. And to make the -average temperature in the room- would probably be wrong. I don't want to speculate (smiles. — Ed).

Two F-16s collided during a simulated battle, one pilot survived: from NATO history	The fatal incident occurred over the Greek island of Karpathos in the Aegean Sea in the context of the Aegean dispute, a conflict between two NATO member states over sovereignty and related rights in the Aegean Sea and the airspace above it. Reconstruction of a simulated dogfight between Greek and Turkish F-16s On 23 May 2006 around 12:40 local time, the Greek Air Force raised a pair of F-16 fighters to the interception of a pair of Turkish Air Force F-16s escorting an RF-4E Phantom reconnaissance aircraft over the Aegean Sea. The mission of the Turkish spy was most likely to photograph the S-300 air defense systems deployed on the island of Crete. Greek fighter pilots were ordered to intercept planes of the Turkish Air Force and to prevent them from approaching the coast of the island and taking aerial photographs of Greek objects. After the interception, Greek and Turkish fighter pilots resorted to a simulated aerial battle. The pilots of both countries strove to win by recording a conditional defeat of the enemy with the help of instruments. Maneuvering in dangerous proximity to each other, the Greek and Turkish fighter jets collided at an altitude of about 8,000 meters above sea level at a distance of 12 miles from the coast of the island of Karpathos. By <a target=-_blank- rel=-nofollow- href=-https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030232/http:/vasington.be.mfa.gov.tr/ShowAnnouncement.aspx?ID=115955 According to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a Greek fighter jet attacked a Turkish F-16 from behind and below, which led to a collision between the two planes. The impact caused an explosion that was devastating to both air machines. The collision was witnessed by the crew of Egyptian Airlines flight 797 from Cairo to Vienna, whose pilot informed the control center in Athens that during the flight at an altitude of about 10,000 meters above sea level, he saw a flash about 600 meters below his plane. The rescue missions of both countries immediately went to the scene of the plane crash, hoping that both pilots managed to eject. Greek Super Puma and Turkish Cougar search and rescue helicopters participated in the rescue mission. However, only one of the two pilots was able to eject successfully - Turkish Air Force Lieutenant Halil Ibrahim Ozdemir. He was lucky the second time when he was accidentally spotted by sailors in the merchant navy. At a distance of about 100 miles from the Turkish coast, it was picked up by the Panamanian merchant ship Gas Century of the Japanese company Yamamaru. Greek Air Force pilot Konstantinos Iliakis did not manage to save himself - as a result of the impact, the cockpit of his F-16 was destroyed, so he could not eject normally. The search for the Greek pilot turned out to be fruitless. The sailors of the frigate Λήμνος managed to find only the Greek pilot's helmet and a survival kit with Greek markings. According to Greek media reports, Konstantinos Iliakis was one of the most experienced F-16 pilots who was trained in the US and had many flight hours. The incident caused a major crisis and led to heightened tensions between official Athens and Ankara, with the Greek and Turkish sides traditionally blaming each other for the disaster. In the end, Greece and Turkey toned down accusatory rhetoric and defused the conflict, but failed to settle it. Despite the fact that both countries are part of the North Atlantic Alliance, their disputes in the Mediterranean continue. To date, the Turkish-Greek conflict is the only one in which F-16s have suffered officially confirmed air combat losses. In addition to the May 23, 2006 crash, there were other incidents over the Aegean Sea that resulted in the downing of these fighters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/dva-f-16-zitknulys-pid-chas-imitacziyi-boyu-vyzhyv-odyn-pilot-z-istoriyi-nato/	2024-09-11T20:00:11-07:00

Without training and motivation: in the Kharkiv region, Russia is fighting with poorly trained soldi...	Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, announced this on the air of the nationwide telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — This is a newly arrived personnel recruited by Russia — an existing mobilization resource has been raised. It is not yet known for sure who it is. These may be some ex-prisoners or representatives of foreign countries. In particular, there used to be people from Central Asia, Africa or the Middle East, he said. The spokesman noted that the Russian soldiers transferred to the Kharkiv direction have a low level of training and refuse to perform the assigned tasks. -Over the past few days or even weeks, we have already repeatedly noted cases of refusal of personnel - both in the direction of deep Lypka and in the Vovchansky direction - from carrying out combat and special tasks,- Vitaly Sarantsev recalled. The military officer said that cases of refusals have already been recorded and are becoming more and more frequent even in those brigades of the Russian army that arrived relatively recently in the Kharkiv direction. — A few weeks ago, the rotation of the 136th motorized rifle brigade, which took up positions near Vovchansk in the area of ​​the Tykh point itself, ended. They replaced the 82nd Airborne Assault Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, which suffered heavy losses and was withdrawn to recovery. This 136th brigade came in and stood still for several weeks. They tried to carry out intelligence activities, and equipped sabotage-reconnaissance groups, and tried to storm our positions head-on. Now they have also suffered losses, and as of yesterday - the day before yesterday, we have information that the servicemen of this brigade, which arrived in our direction not so long ago, are also refusing to perform combat and special tasks, he said. The spokesman explained that the special tasks include the establishment and provision of logistics and fortification equipment for positions. — This indicates that the enemy is more and more often in practically all directions using personnel who are not morally ready to perform any tasks. That is, they raise the mobilization resource, prepare it very hastily. Whether by deception, coercion, or in some other way, using promises of monetary rewards to be sent to war. But people understand that they were simply deceived and simply refuse to go into battle any further, said Vitaly Sarantsev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the north of Kharkiv region, the occupiers throw soldiers into battle less than a month after signing the contract and without any preparation, as a result enemy stormtroopers are sabotaging the orders of the command and in whole groups refuse to carry out the assigned tasks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/bez-pidgotovky-i-motyvacziyi-na-harkivshhyni-rosiya-voyuye-pogano-navchenymy-soldatamy/	2024-09-11T10:36:36-07:00

He ordered to capture -Kharkiv in 5 days-: -a hero of Russia- was informed about the suspicion	The Security Service of Ukraine informed about this. The suspect is Lieutenant General Konstantin Stepanishchev, deputy commander of the 6th Combined Arms Army of the Western Military District of the Russian Federation. The military designed and tried to implement an operation to capture Kharkiv by the end of February 2022. According to Stepanishchev's plan, the units of the ground troops subordinate to him were to surround the city and take it -in a ring- in 5 days.

Digitization of the provision of the Armed Forces: the DOT presented the innovative DOT-Chain system	-If earlier the term of delivery of products could be up to two months, after the introduction of DOT-Chain, this term should be reduced by approximately four times,- said Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. -The digitization of procurement processes in defense is a strategic step in increasing the efficiency of supplies of all necessary military equipment.- -DOT-Shain is another important step towards a military that values ​​people, time and efficient processes instead of filling out hundreds of papers. Thanks to this system, the procurement of products will become clearer and more transparent, and the possibility of expanding it to other products will significantly simplify the logistics processes in the Defense Forces,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Digital Development, Digital Transformations and Digitalization. The creation of DOT-Chain has become the largest digital project in DOT. A team of IT specialists of the State Rear Operator worked on the development. -We were faced with the task of changing the old system so that the non-lethal support of the Armed Forces was more effective. Currently, DOT-Chain functionality extends to food. The DOT IT team has digitized the entire procurement process, from submitting product applications to issuing invoices and documents. In the future, the system can be quickly scaled to cover other categories of goods,- said Alyona Zhuzha, IT adviser of the DOT. 1. Digitized paper documents to optimize the work of the military. This is an important step towards abandoning the -paper army-. Instead of 30 thousand paperwork that the military had to process every week is now just a few clicks into the system. This significantly reduces the amount of work of salespeople. 2. Simplified the process of paying for goods. It will be four times faster, because expense invoices are immediately uploaded to the system, and DOT, having signatures from the military unit and the supplier, can immediately pay for the shipment. 3.

From the contract to the front line — 20 days: whom the Russians throw into battle externally	The personnel of the occupiers involved in the hostilities characterized on the air of the telethon -Social News- by the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU Vitaly Sarantsev. — Among the Russian servicemen there are also former prisoners who were dragged into this war under coercion or deception. There are representatives of foreign countries. There are actually different sections of the population, he said. Russians also use propaganda and coercion to force residents of temporarily occupied territories to join the invading forces. The motivation of such soldiers is extremely low. — These people are not motivated, and in connection with this, we note the numerous refusals of personnel of the armed forces of the Russian Federation to perform tasks. This happens both on the Hlyboke-Lyptsi route and on other routes, in particular in the area of ​​the settlement of Tyche. The 136th separate motorized rifle brigade recently entered there. They started to perform tasks just a few weeks ago, but we are already seeing numerous refusals of personnel to perform both combat missions and special missions, the spokesman said. The occupiers refuse not only to storm the positions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, but also to perform tasks related to the adjustment and provision of logistics or the arrangement of fortifications. — This indicates that the Russians are gradually losing their offensive potential and they are forced to use anyone and any personnel in order to continue pushing into this war started by Russia, — explained Vitaly Sarantsev. At the same time, he noted that the enemy is actively replenishing not only tactical, but also operational and strategic reserves, paying the necessary attention to comprehensive training of servicemen. — Attention will be paid there to both combat training of personnel and, as they call it, military-political and ideological training. Therefore, we are not relaxing, we understand that, sooner or later, the enemy can supplement its current set of personnel with more trained military personnel, the military officer emphasized. Currently, the enemy does not feel the lack of personnel in the Kharkiv direction. — The forces and means that he currently maintains in our direction are sufficient for the enemy to continue to carry out active actions, to carry out offensive actions, to carry out assaults, to carry out sabotage and reconnaissance activities in non-attacked areas of the Russian-Ukrainian border with the aim of destabilizing the situation, with the purpose of carrying out intelligence tasks, Vitaliy Sarantsev reported. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast, enemy attack aircraft are sabotaging the orders of the command in whole groups and refusing to carry out their tasks, and also showed a video with captured fighters of the -Charter- brigade of the NGU by the Russian military, who said that signed a contract for military service on August 23 of this year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/vid-kontraktu-do-peredovoyi-20-dniv-kogo-rosiyany-kydayut-u-bij-eksternom/	2024-09-11T02:40:58-07:00

The cornerstone of this activity was the constant informing of Ukrainians about our plans for evacuation corridors, prompt notification of important changes in their work patterns, and stories about how everything works. We spoke frankly about existing problems and tried to keep people in feedback. This time reformatted the ministry into a professional humanitarian rapid response team.

This is part of the training of Ukrainian tank crews of the 33rd separate mechanized brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in between combat work in Donetsk region. Tankmen must be ready for any situation, for example, when the enemy blows up a bridge or crossing, but the hostilities must be continued. immersion Before overcoming an obstacle, the tank must be prepared, and this process is very responsible: the escape hatch, driver-mechanic hatch, triplexes, etc. are sealed. Such training is also part of the psychological preparation of servicemen for unexpected developments and unusual maneuvers. Tankists talk enthusiastically about German combat vehicles. -They are much more effective in their work than Soviet tanks. Maneuverable, easier to control and very fast,- says a tank operator with the call sign -Tourist-. These German tanks were handed over by Norway, which is part of the international tank coalition. All the crews in the brigade since the beginning of its formation have undergone training abroad and already have significant combat experience. The -Leopards- of the 33rd OMBr last year successfully participated in combat operations in the Zaporizhzhia direction, now they are hitting the enemy on East. Leopard 2A4 is capable of effective fire at a range of up to 5 kilometers.

Marriage in Action: how to get married online as a military man	The service can be used by all citizens of Ukraine, but this opportunity can be most useful for military personnel. Military vacations are quite difficult to predict, so it is difficult to think everything through in advance and organize an ordinary wedding. And the new service allows you to make friends even while on the front line. Basically, it's a marriage in a few clicks. Only internet is required&#8230; and, of course, the consent of the other half. ArmyInform tells how to marry a military man online. The new service even allows you to make an offer through Diya. The partner will receive a notification to which they must respond within 14 days. In particular, you need to go to -services- in Actions. Select -marriage online- and -Make a proposal- item. The system will offer to send this offer to a messenger convenient for your partner. However, such an offer is not binding. But it is not mandatory. If you made an offer in another way, you can apply for marriage registration right away in Diya. In Services, you need to find the -Marriage online- section and select the -marriage application- section. Someone alone must submit an application and indicate a partner in it. The latter must confirm the submission of such an application. When this happens, you will receive a notification. Read it and click -continue-. Next, you need to choose the date and time of the ceremony. Action will notify when the DRATSS confirms this date. Also, in Diya, you can decide what to do with your surname after the wedding: keep your own, take your partner's surname or make it double. Then you and your partner need to confirm the marriage registration application, sign with an electronic signature and pay the administration fee. On the day of the ceremony, Diya will send a reminder about the start of the video conference. On the wedding day, you just need to go to Diya and follow the link to join the online ceremony. An employee of the digital DRATSS will be waiting there. The ceremony lasts up to 30 minutes. The digital marriage registration certificate will be automatically activated within a day. You can also order a physical document by Ukrposhta delivery or pick it up at the branch. By the way, a wedding can be a reason for an additional 10 days of vacation. How to apply for family leave, read here . There are also certain requirements for registering a marriage in Diya. We will remind, previously Ukrainians had the opportunity to submit an online application for marriage registration. But the ceremony itself was still supposed to take place in DRACE. The only exception was military personnel. A simplified procedure was developed for them, which made it possible to get married remotely. That is, without the presence of the bride or groom. This procedure is valid even now, so a few words about it. What is needed? To submit an application to your immediate commander, in which to indicate information about yourself and your significant other - surname, first name and patronymic, date of birth, citizenship and chosen surname, if you wish to change it. Next, the commander must send an application to the DRATS to which the serviceman submitted the application. The fact of marriage registration is certified by an act, which is drawn up without the physical presence of one or both brides and grooms. However, they must be currently connected to the video procedure. The deed record of marriage is drawn up on the day of receipt of the application for the registration of a marriage or deed by the DRATSS department. This option also remains valid, but the new service in Diya greatly simplifies the whole procedure. As reported by ArmiyaInform, during the beta testing of the service the first , who married in this way, was a military serviceman.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/shlyub-u-diyi-yak-vijskovomu-odruzhytysya-onlajn/	2024-09-10T20:12:29-07:00
How the world helps Ukraine with the treatment and rehabilitation of wounded soldiers	Vadym Svyridenko, the adviser to the President of Ukraine on issues of rehabilitation of combatants, told about this during an interview with ArmiyaInform. — After the return of the fighters, we ask for their feedback: how do they like the prostheses, how was the rehabilitation, what did they learn there. And I am very glad that our rehabilitation and prosthetics are not behind in the world. And partner countries are already contacting us, interested in our experience. Because our military, like no one else in the world, faces such combat injuries. And we know what it is and how to deal with it. That is why specialists, for example, surgeons from Canada or America, are already coming to us. They, among other things, helped perform operations for facial injuries, says Vadym Svyridenko. We tell you more about how partner countries help our wounded defenders to recover their health and return to action. This country has an extensive network of cities and institutions where Ukrainian servicemen undergo treatment and rehabilitation. As of January 2024, 1,044 victims, including 735 military personnel, were evacuated to Germany. Also, 125 children with oncological diseases are being treated in the Federal Republic of Germany. In particular, the -Sharite- clinic accepts Ukrainians for treatment - military personnel with severe burns and mine-explosive injuries as a result of Russian military aggression are also treated here. In April 2024, another 13 Ukrainian defenders with amputations left Kyiv for Berlin. In a German military hospital, they are to be fitted with innovative prostheses. In general, German specialists expressed their readiness to provide prosthetics to 60 Ukrainian military personnel in Berlin. Our servicemen are also treated and rehabilitated in the city of Wiesbaden - here they have the opportunity to fully recover and receive the highest level of care. Poland has been helping with military rehabilitation since 2014. Ukrainian soldiers, in particular, are patients of the -Good Brother- rehabilitation and recreation center. In this institution, they can undergo a course of rehabilitation and recovery. Several hundred soldiers have already taken advantage of this opportunity. -Despite the fact that my right leg is completely iron, and the left one is missing about 75% of tendons and 50% of muscles, Polish rehabilitators taught me how to properly control my body. And not only did I return to a more or less normal life, but I even performed tasks in the area where the OOS was held,- Lt. Col. Ihor Chuprun, who underwent rehabilitation in Poland, recalled at one time. Already after the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the assistance of the Republic of Poland in matters of rehabilitation and treatment of military personnel only increased. In particular, Poland offered Ukraine to provide treatment and rehabilitation to 2,500 wounded Ukrainian servicemen. In addition, at the Military Medical Institute in Warsaw, Ukrainian specialists are trained in the field of rehabilitation of the wounded, as well as diagnosis and treatment of people who have suffered war injuries. Here, they improve their knowledge of accompanying patients during rehabilitation and modern methods of prosthetics. In Spain, there is a whole program of treatment and rehabilitation of Ukrainian servicemen and veterans who were injured in the war. In addition, this country also helps in the organization of recreation for Ukrainian children affected by the war. The country -stepped in- in aid from the first days of a full-scale invasion. In particular, wounded Ukrainian border guards (about 30 servicemen) who were wounded in 2022 in the first days of the enemy's invasion were treated in Spain. Our defenders also receive rehabilitation and treatment in the military hospital of the city of Zaragoza. This Orad y Gajías General Defense Hospital is one of two controlled by the Spanish Ministry of Defense. And he started receiving our fighters as early as 2022. The Netherlands also operates a rehabilitation program for Ukrainian military personnel. More than one group of servicemen used it. And in the Netherlands, Ukrainian military personnel undergoing rehabilitation and volunteers assemble drones for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Volunteers look for funding and order parts, while the military assembles the drones. Professional instructors help beginners. The finished device is thoroughly tested before being sent to Ukraine. From June 2022, the French Ministry of Defense will organize assistance to the Ukrainian wounded. One of the facilities that contributes to the treatment and rehabilitation of our soldiers in France is Percy Hospital. In March 2024, it was known that wounded army personnel were being taken to French civilian and military hospitals in the Paris region and Grand Est. As of spring 2024, there were more than two dozen groups of Ukrainian military personnel who arrived in France for treatment. Back in 2018, Bulgaria launched a two-year rehabilitation program for soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who were wounded, injured and maimed during hostilities in eastern Ukraine. In addition, Bulgaria had the status of a leading country within the NATO Trust Fund project in the field of medical rehabilitation in Ukraine. Our wounded defenders are receiving rehabilitation services at Kaleroya Military Medical Hospital in Hisar. Indications for physiotherapy in Kaleroya are injuries of the musculoskeletal system, injuries of the peripheral nervous system of the upper and lower extremities. And in 2020, the Project of Medical Rehabilitation of Ukrainian Veterans in Bulgaria was launched. Wounded Ukrainian military personnel (both those undergoing military service and those on reserve/retirement) and civilian personnel of the security and defense sector were sent for treatment. Expenses related to the procedures and accommodation of persons in the clinic were provided by the Bulgarian side, and international and local transportation, medical insurance and food for this period were provided by the NATO Trust Fund in Ukraine in the field of medical rehabilitation. The Baltic countries are friendly to Ukraine and our wounded defenders. For example, in April 2024, Lithuania started a special program for the rehabilitation of the Ukrainian military - about 15 million euros were allocated to Ukraine. These funds should be directed directly to the reconstruction of hospitals and the training of specialists. And the Latvian Support Fund for Ukraine, founded in 2014, collects donations for the treatment and rehabilitation of wounded Ukrainian servicemen, is an intermediary between the state, Latvian clinics and Ukrainian wounded who need help. Thus, as of the end of August 2024, more than 540 Ukrainian servicemen who were wounded in the war with the Russian Federation were treated in Latvia. At the beginning of June, the government allocated 184,000 euros for the rehabilitation of the soldiers of the Armed Forces. Estonia is not lagging behind - as of June 2024, it was known that more than 240 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine had already completed a rehabilitation course in Estonia. America supported Ukrainian wounded defenders even before the large-scale Russian invasion. For example, in 2019, the US government allocated about 5 million dollars and accepted 10 seriously wounded Ukrainian servicemen for treatment. For this purpose, the Americans have identified 10 hospitals that will receive Ukrainian servicemen for free treatment. It was then known that the average cost of treating one, as Americans calculated, is half a million dollars. And in December 2022, in New York, just in time for the Day of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the House of Heroes was opened for the rehabilitation and prosthetics of Ukrainian soldiers who lost their limbs during the war. The house is located in the Staten Island area, not far from the ocean. Oleksandr Rubtsov, head of the charity organization Kind Deeds, who owns a real estate company, implements the rehabilitation program for the wounded. According to him, he rented a house for this purpose and is accumulating donor funds for the further rehabilitation of Ukrainian soldiers. In addition, American specialists come to Ukraine and help in the treatment of our military. So, in 2023, American microsurgeons operated on wounded soldiers in Uzhhorod. According to Andrii Novak Transcarpathian Regional Clinical Hospital, this is the second visit of microsurgeons from the USA. During the visit, American doctors performed 7 operations on military personnel: it is about eliminating post-traumatic defects of bones and soft tissues of arms and legs. Canada is also helping our wounded defenders get stronger and healthier. Thus, in 2023, Ukraine and Canada signed an agreement on medical partnership in the field of mental health and military rehabilitation. According to this document, the Ukrainian Center for Mental Health and Rehabilitation -Lisova Polyana- has a sister company, the -Atlas- Institute of Veterans and Their Families. Both medical institutions specialize in the field of mental recovery and military rehabilitation. But this country helped our wounded even before the large-scale invasion. For example, in 2019, a project on the rehabilitation of patients with severe neurotraumas was implemented in the Rivne Region with the participation of Canadian specialists. And the Canadian instructors from the UNIFAIR training mission, who teach the Ukrainian military to provide first aid in case of wounds and injuries, have already become a familiar story for us.

NATO Assistant Secretary General for Operations Thomas Hoffus and the new head of the NATO Representation in Ukraine Patrick Turner visited the capital. The main topics of discussion were the need for progress on interoperability with NATO and the acceleration of promised aid from allies. The proposal discussed the use of Ukrainian suppliers and manufacturers to speed up the supply of property and support the economy of Ukraine. -We are glad to welcome you to Ukraine, which demonstrates your involvement and interest in our victory. But we have to raise the issue of the fulfillment of promises and the operational logistics of helping our military,- said Oleksandr Balanutsa, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for European Integration. He emphasized that what was promised for September should be in Ukraine in September. Sticking to schedules is important on the battlefield. The parties discussed the implementation of a number of joint projects with NATO - NATO's initiative to support Ukraine in security issues and NSATU training, the Joint Center for Analysis, Training and Education (JATEC) and the implementation of projects of the NATO agency for support and supply of NSPA. The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Stanislav Heyder, thanked for all the assistance provided by NATO to Ukraine.

As much as I fight, there is not a single fragment in me - the story of the soldier Fartovoy, who fo...	About the soldier was told on September 10 Armed forces. Such a call sign was given to him by a sergeant, also a marine, at the training center. The military man says that at that time there was no special reason for the call sign -Fartovy-. However, the nickname did become prophetic. The boy signed a contract with the army at the age of 22. It was January 2023. Fartovy shared a video from this -celebration-, when his brothers greeted him just in the positions. The guy was prompted to sign the contract by a video from TikTok. -I watched the video of the Third Assault. The boys are having a good time like this. I wanted too. This is their form, the ARKs&#8230; But, in fact, it turned out to be a completely different story in the army: -kalash- and -pixel- uniform, - smiles Fartovy. The soldier reinforced the status of a forward in battle: -As much as I fight, there is not a single fragment in me. A few contusions only, but that's it. I think I have this fart just because of the call sign. Near Urozhany, when a shell flew into the trenches, there was a boy near me, 200, and I just had a severe contusion. Then there was a direct hit into the trench. Well, there was a drop from a drone in Krynky. Two meters in front of me. Everyone around has 300, but I have nothing,- said Fartovy. For -Fartovy- month, he underwent basic military training at the training center. After that, he joined the ranks of the 505th OBMP. Already in the battalion, he studied for another three months and went through combat training: he practiced shooting at the range, learned the tactics of fighting from his more experienced comrades. After completing the training, as the commander of the grenade launcher unit, -Fartovoy- was sent to the Donetsk direction. Subsequently, he fought in the Zaporozhye direction and again returned to the Donetsk direction. And then there was the most difficult aspect of the front for -Fartovoy- among all the places he visited - Krynka. -The worst thing there is the forest. Because when you go and storm the landing, you have 12 enemies, well, at most, one or two of them can jump out somewhere in the field, and in Krynky, you go into the forest and they can run out from any side. Because of that, it was much harder there. Well, they had a lot of equipment there. Tanks, armored personnel carriers were rolling out on us&#8230; They had a lot of equipment there. But a lot of their equipment was stolen there by our FPV-schneiders,- recalls Fartovyi. Currently, -Fartovoy- performs the duties of chief sergeant of the fire support company. In order to enter the position fully, he still has sergeant courses ahead of him. At the same time, the soldier trains new arrivals to the battalion of fighters in the internal training center. ArmyInform told the story of a fighter who, despite the decision of the VLK, remained in the DSHV. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/skilky-voyuyu-zhodnogo-ulamka-v-meni-nemaye-istoriya-bijczi-fartovogo-yakyj-72-dni-byvsya-u-krynkah/	2024-09-10T09:37:37-07:00
The 12th Banderiv Readings will be held in Kyiv. ArmyInform is a media partner	This was reported by the organizer of the readings, sergeant of the fire support company of the 5th separate assault regiment, director of the USSD National Center Yuriy -Mamai- Syrotyuk. -During the conference, it is planned to revive the destroyed, erased and forbidden history of the long-standing resistance to Moscow imperialism of the peoples enslaved by Russia. Each people, nation, on whose land the Moscow occupier came, did some part of the more than a century of resistance to the Moscow empire. For centuries, Moscow destroyed the disobedient, encouraged traitors, and rewrote history. The time has come for every people in this prison of nations to find out -who they are, by whom, for what they are imprisoned- and to make their own decision - whether to die in Russian captivity, being a blind tool in the hands of the Kremlin, powerless on their land, deprived of language, history, identity, or to remember the glory of their ancestors and to fight for freedom,- noted Yuriy Syrotyuk. The Russian-Ukrainian war opened up a unique opportunity for peoples enslaved by Russia to throw off the yoke of Moscow colonialism and imperialism, and finally become the masters of their own destiny on their own land. The organizers of the 12th Banderiv readings invite researchers of Russian colonialism and the struggle against it, as well as active representatives of national liberation formations of peoples enslaved by Russia, to participate in the conference. The second panel will be dedicated to the actual prospects of the national liberation struggle. Based on the results of the readings, an electronic version of the participants' speeches will be prepared. As part of the XII Banderiv readings, it is traditionally planned to hold a Youth Essay Competition on the specified topic. In addition, on the eve of the event, the book -Involuntary Accession: The History of the Liberation Struggle of Peoples Enslaved by Russia- will be published in Ukrainian, English and an electronic version in the language of the occupiers. The media partner of -Banderivskyi readings- is the -ArmiyaInform- information agency. The Bander Readings project was founded in 2014 at the height of the Revolution of Dignity as an intellectual discussion of Bander's ideas and the creation of a vision of the Ukrainian state. It traditionally takes place in the first days of February at the time of the creation of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in 1929 as a movement that set the goal of establishing an independent Ukrainian cathedral state, its preservation and development. Past 11th Bander readings -The Liquidation of the Russian Empire- were held on February 10, 2024. It was possible to hold the conference in a new format and to publish the book -Liquidation of the Russian Empire- in English and Ukrainian, which has already been printed in three editions and has become a notable phenomenon among research on this topic. More details about the terms of participation and the possibility to support the project are available on the organizers' page.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/u-kyyevi-vidbudutsya-xii-banderivski-chytannya-armiyainform-mediapartner/	2024-09-10T09:17:49-07:00

He held the defense of a semi-surrounded position for nine days - the story of a paratrooper and a f...	The soldier's story was made public on September 10 by the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -I commanded a combat position that was semi-surrounded for nine days. Every day we repulsed several assaults of enemy infantry, which climbed on us as if possessed. To say that it was difficult then is an understatement,- recalls Serhiy. During that situation, several of his subordinates were wounded, and he himself received a concussion. However, despite this, and artillery and mortar shelling, which practically did not subside, and drops from enemy drones, the paratroopers did not leave their position, waiting for help. The brave soldier says that one of those days he was very surprised by a Russian who tried to storm the paratroopers in a slightly strange way. -A man in a black Adidas tracksuit, wearing sneakers and armed with a machine gun ran towards us. There was no helmet, no bulletproof vest, no first-aid kit, no other military equipment on him,- Serhiy is surprised. The Ukrainian paratroopers then decided that in this way, the Russian was trying to make it easier for himself to advance to their positions. But the soldiers did not have time to think for a long time, why he decided that it would help him. Therefore, they destroyed this -experimental athlete- with accurate fire. As well as other enemy fighters who climbed into their positions. Serhii notes that participation in active combat operations, when the situation on the battlefield changes very rapidly, has taught him to often make important decisions independently and act without waiting for the commander's order. -Once, during the shelling, I saw that an artillery shell hit the house where our soldiers were staying. There was no time to delay, so my partner and I, without waiting for the shelling to end, ran to help our people,- Serhii recalls. It turned out that the soldiers risked in vain: after freeing the entrance to the basement of the destroyed house, filled with broken brick fragments, the paratroopers rescued four brothers who were blocked in the underground room. -Who knows how the situation would have turned out for the boys if we had waited for the next team,- the fighter ponders. Serhiy went through so much in the war that one gets the impression that he has been serving for a long time, but this is not the case. The man joined the army in February 2024. Until then, he worked as a construction worker. He says that in his 43 years of life, he has never been in the army, but having joined the ranks of the paratroopers, having passed the appropriate training and having been in battles, he feels confident. To those who are still hesitating, he says not to be afraid. -Prepare physically and mentally. Everything else will be taught to you - no one will send you to the front line without training,- concludes Serhiy. His wife and three children are waiting for the paratrooper at home with Peremoha.

Commanded a missile attack on Okhmatdyt: the suspicion was reported to the Russian general	About this informs September 10 SBU. He turned out to be Lieutenant General Serhii Kobylash, who at that time held the position of long-range aviation commander of the Air Force of the Russian Aerospace Forces. Subsequently, after the strike on Okhmatdyt, he was promoted and appointed commander of the Russian Air Force. This was announced by Deputy Head of the SBU Serhii Naumyuk during a working meeting with Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan and Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin. -During the period of the investigation, the SBU, together with the Prosecutor General's Office, carried out tremendous work. We interrogated 112 victims and 50 eyewitnesses, conducted explosive, forensic and other examinations, analyzed videos from surveillance cameras,- Serhiy Naumyuk said. As the investigation established, by order of Kobylash, on July 8, 2024 at 9 a.m. 15 minutes a Russian Tu-95MS missile-carrying bomber launched an Kh-101 missile at a children's hospital in Kyiv. According to the Deputy Head of the Security Service of Ukraine, the 22nd Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Division of the Long-range Aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces carried out the shelling of Okhmatdyt. -It was established that the enemy plane took off from an airfield near the Russian city of Olenegorsk, and the missile was launched over the Saratov region of the Russian Federation at a distance of almost 600 km from the border of Ukraine,- the report said. From the territory of Russia, the Kh-101 entered the airspace of our country in the region of Chernihiv Oblast and began to maneuver, constantly changing its flight path through the territories of four regions. This indicates that the missile was programmed to maximally -bypass- Ukrainian air defense and further hit the medical facility. At approximately 10:45, a Russian X-101 hit the department of intensive and efferent therapy of acute and chronic intoxications of the Okhmatdyt hospital. At the scene of the incident, law enforcement officers found the remains of an enemy missile with markings indicating that it was manufactured on the basis of the Russian Raduga design center in the second quarter of 2024. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed Kobylash about suspicion in absentia under Part 2 of Art. 28, part 2 of Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (violation of the laws and customs of war, combined with intentional murder, committed by a group of persons according to a prior conspiracy). -Kobylash is currently suspected of committing other war crimes in Ukraine. In particular, attacks on civilian energy infrastructure were carried out under his leadership in 2022-2023. In March 2024, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Kobylash precisely for these war crimes,- emphasized Serhiy Naumyuk.

Fierce battles continue at the front: 147 combat clashes per day	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The invaders carried out two missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine, using two missiles, 71 airstrikes (dropped 91 anti-aircraft missiles), and also used 593 kamikaze drones. At the same time, the enemy fired 3,751 shots at the positions of our troops and settlements. On the Kharkiv direction, the occupiers attacked once in the Vovchansk region. Kharkiv came under bombardment, and in Bilokrynychno, terrorists struck with anti-aircraft guns from Ka-52 helicopters. Nine times the enemy stormed the positions of the Ukrainian military in the Kupyansk direction, in the districts of Petropavlivka, Synkivka, Stelmakhivka, Lozova and Hlushkivka. Two clashes are ongoing. In the Lyman direction the Russian invaders tried to advance 13 times in the districts of Cherneshchyna, Makiivka, Novosadovo, Nevsky, Dibrova, Hryhorivka, Yampolivka, and Torsky. Defenders of Ukraine repelled nine enemy attacks. Fighting continues near Nevsky and Novosadovo. The enemy made 11 attacks in the Northern direction. He concentrated his efforts in Verkhnokamyanskyi, Spirnyi and Zvanivka districts. Near the latter, half a dozen infantry fighting vehicles were deployed to support the infantry. Suffered losses. Fighting in the direction continues. In the Kramatorsk direction the occupiers carried out two assaults in the Bila Hora area. The situation is under the control of units of the Defense Forces. In the Toretsk direction, the aggressors attacked six times for aviation support near Toretsk and Nelipivka. They received a tough rebuff. In the Pokrovsky direction there is a high intensity of hostilities. The number of skirmishes has increased to 33. The invaders continue to attack our positions near Vozdvizhenka, Zeleny Pol, Novotroitskyi, Grodivka, Novogrodivka, Selidovo, and Mykhailivka. All attacks have been stopped by our defenders for the time being. Today, the enemy made the main efforts in the Novogrodivka area, where almost 40 percent of all skirmishes took place. The previous losses of the aggressor amounted to 336 occupiers killed and wounded. An electronic warfare device, three artillery systems, three cars and six motorcycles were also destroyed, five artillery systems and five cars were damaged. In the Kurakhiv direction there are 46 combat clashes of varying intensity. The occupiers most actively tried to advance in the areas of Krasnohorivka, Kostyantynivka and Georgiivka settlements, where about 75 percent of all battles took place. In addition, the enemy attacked in the direction of Halytsynivka, Ukranian, and Zhelany Pershy. In the Vremivsk direction the aggressor stormed the front edge of our defense nine times in the Vugledar, Zolotoi Niva, and Shakhtarsky areas. Ukrainian soldiers stopped seven enemy assaults, two more battles continue near Vugledar, where the occupiers also used assault aircraft - they hit with NARs. In the Orikhov direction, the enemy carried out a total of three attacks - two were repulsed near Malaya Tokmachka and one continued in the area of ​​Mali Shcherbaki. In the Dnieper direction nine enemy attempts to take the positions of our soldiers failed. The defense forces hold back the onslaught of the Russian occupiers. Separately, the department recognized the soldiers of the 25th separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who bravely hold their positions, skillfully repulse enemy attacks, inflicting significant losses on the invaders. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers significantly -livoberezhzhi-dnipra/->intensified offensive operations in the Pryndiprovsky direction with the aim of knocking out units of the Defense Forces from the bridgeheads on the Left Bank of the Dnipro, which Ukrainian defenders hold after leaving the village of Krynki.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/na-fronti-tryvayut-zhorstki-boyi-147-bojovyh-zitknen-za-dobu/	2024-09-09T21:08:29-07:00
15 km per day through enemy territory and the myth of strong intelligence of the Russian Federation:...	Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmyInform about this: -The Kursk operation is actually very, very successful. I would call it (an operation. — Ed.) global order. And it is necessary to understand why it happened. The first point: this is really an attempt to divert the enemy's forces and means from the main Donetsk direction. Only at first glance, this issue is unrealized. But in reality it is not so. Why? Because the combat army reserves are between 10 and 15 percent. So, if the enemy has 600,000 personnel along the battle line, then the mandatory reserve: 60,000-70,000 is still engaged. This is a very important moment. Next, this is a completely and definitively dispelled myth that one cannot enter the territory of the enemy, because, they say, it is a nuclear country, and the apocalypse will definitely happen. However, the apocalypse did not happen. And the most important goal, and it is, in fact, very promising: sooner or later it will reach the negotiation process. We are well aware that there will be no direct conversation between Ukraine and Russia. But according to the grain agreement, when we, Ukrainians, signed certain agreements with the Turks and the UN, and then Russia signed certain agreements with the Turks and the UN, then such a scenario could happen. And at this point we have to have a very, very strong position-. If for the enemy, Donetsk region and Luhansk region are of principle, then Kherson region and Zaporizhia region are not so principled. And according to the principle of such exchange — i.e., we return Kursk Oblast to them, and they return Zaporizhia and Kherson Oblast to us — such a scenario is quite possible. From the point of view of the organization's tactics and strategy, the operation is brilliant. Why is it shiny? Because it is breakthrough. In the first days of the operation, our forces moved at a speed of up to 10 km per day, and in some locations up to 15. I must remind you that the enemy covered almost the entire dry the weather passes several kilometers in the direction of Pokrovsk. Therefore, our speed is incredible. And most importantly: there is a myth that Russia has very strong intelligence. If the Russians could not calculate and see such an operation, then their intelligence is very, very bad. Any war, and especially the current one, has only three main laws. This is the concentration of the enemy's forces and means, the coordinated work of the military branches, and the third law, it was fully implemented here and very qualitatively, this is the hidden management of the troops. Being able to assemble several shock combat brigades, move them efficiently, provide them with equipment and break through the border — this is really a sign of the great quality of our operational art.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/15-km-na-dobu-vorozhoyu-terytoriyeyu-ta-mif-pro-sylnu-rozvidku-rf-ekspert-pro-blyskuchu-operacziyu-syl-oborony-na-kurshhyni/	2024-09-09T20:30:37-07:00
Combat took 14 tankers and two marines out of the encirclement: the story of lieutenant colonel Grud...	&#8230;On February 23, 2022, a battalion of a separate tank brigade named after Kostyantyn Pestushka was raised due to an alarm, and Oleg took it to a designated concentration area. - To be honest, there was nothing to indicate that a large-scale invasion would begin. The relevant order was received, we went out according to the training plans. But on the morning of February 24, around 4 a.m., the connection was dead. Reports began from posts that explosions were heard and bright flashes were seen at the base camp. In addition, we used the Viraj-tablet air defense system. The operator called me to see what was happening, and there were about 30 planes on the radar. We understood that a serious war had begun, the officer recalls. Around 10 o'clock Oleg Grudzevych's tank battalion reached the border in the Volnovakha district. There, the tankers found the first hours of a large-scale invasion. It was very hot near Volnovakha - the Russians broke through the defense of one of the infantry battalions. — Our unit suffered its first losses there — the tank crew was killed. We went away with hard fights - pearls scattered like mad. According to intelligence data, there were convoys of 70 units, and 50, 30, 20. I remember how successfully one crew - an officer's crew - worked. The thing is that Major Serhii Brovkin, the deputy commander, was there for the gunner, and Captain Pavlo Grelya for the tank commander. So they destroyed two BMP-3 with one shot. The armor-piercing projectile pierced both cars of the Rashists, and it was so successful that they exploded one after another, inflating like bubbles. And the column did not even stop, the Rashists simply did not understand what had happened, says Oleg Grudzevych. He remembered the first days of the large-scale invasion as continuous battles, maneuvers, retreats, counterattacks, and at the same time the realization that the Rashists could be beaten. And he still cannot forget how the local population helped the Ukrainian soldiers. When our tanks simply ran out of fuel on February 27, volunteers from one of the settlements, which is currently temporarily captured, came to help. Farmers shared the fuel, pouring 200 liters into each tank. As Oleg recalls, he managed to gather his units, and on February 28, the tankers entered Mariupol on the territory of the Azovmash plant, where, together with the marines, they began fighting for the city. Oleg tells about those battles calmly, as if it were about ordinary work: - The schedule of the orcs was like a working day. It's dawn - they're on the move, small arms are working. It begins to pout - shooting battles stop, artillery and aviation begin to work. On the 13th, a mechvod (mechanic-driver. — Ed.) died. We tried to protect the team link, but still they had to take risks, there was simply no other strength. Already on the 2nd or 3rd day of the fighting, we moved to the basement. Battalions were still stationed around the city perimeter, tanks were moving out, there were constant skirmishes, Russian artillery and aviation were already in full swing. They calculated the location of headquarters on -Azovstal- and -Azovmash-, and aviation worked on them. Mines and -Hradi- were already flying to the plant. The Azov people came to us and said: -We don't understand their mathematics: 50 people attack every day from one direction. 20-30 turn around, they will lose a lot of equipment and tanks. The next morning it's 50 again.- The fighting continued at this pace until the end of March. On March 15, the tankers ran out of drinking water and food. Oleg thinks, then continues: - We started drinking water from the fire-fighting ponds that were at the factory. Water and green, but there was no way out. There was also no supply of ammunition and food, later we began to count literally every projectile for tanks, sukhpai. The ring was getting tighter every day, we were moving away little by little. Orcs were literally pelting us with cannon fodder. We had no news or communication, but we stood on the perimeter of the plant, holding Azovmash - 800 meters, in the roundabout. I had 2 combat-ready tanks left, mine and one more, and 2 or 3 vehicles were from the 36th brigade. They went to work in pairs. Scatter on all sides of the pearl. All the anti-aircraft gunners and tankers I had were already working as infantrymen, going on 8-hour shifts. I remember how on April 5, an enemy tank broke into the territory of -Azovmash-, but it was knocked out. Every evening, as soon as it got dark, the Russians came out and began to -pour- everywhere with a double frenzy. We understood that we would not last another week. Oleg recalls that the first attempt to break through the encirclement was on April 10. They tried to break through the territory of the Ilyich plant, but, unfortunately, the attempt was unsuccessful. The next day, another breakout attempt, this time successful. Two tanks that remained from Oleg's battalion with the remains of shells: one had about 20 shells in the conveyor, the other tank had 15. The unit left the factory. — Our plan was as follows: to the road, if there is an opportunity, we break through on equipment. When the tanks stop, then we blow up the equipment, and then we move on foot, in groups of 10-15 people. The connection was reset and checked. On April 11, around midnight, they started moving. Next to my tank was a -motolyga- (light armored multi-purpose transporter. - Ed.), people were sitting on it, including the wounded. I tell the officer that I will divert fire on myself. And I will not leave them alone. I give tasks to the commander, the mechanic. We were lucky that it was raining that night and there were no drones. I say to the commander of another unit that was with us: -While we are shooting for 30-40 minutes, stay a kilometer away from me. You see the transfer of fire - move behind us to the distance that we have advanced. And this is how we move - from border to border.- &#8230;The breakthrough was frantic - tankers opened fire, burned Russian equipment, the infantry also did their job. Then the tanks ran out of fuel and stopped. There were no shells either. Tankers took out night lights, radios, sights and destroyed everything they could. They took with them small arms, ammunition, grenades, remnants of sukhpay, water. They moved behind the rear of the Rashists. Today, few people can imagine what it is like to move in the enemy's environment. Expect a shot, a rupture, a mine detonation, a random meeting with the occupiers or local traitors at any moment. Oleg speaks sparingly about the exit. — Before the breakthrough, thanks to Starlink, I downloaded an offline map and took a normal one. We knew roughly where our units would be and how far we had to go. It was 138 kilometers straight, and all 175 to bypass the Rashisti. They planned the movement as follows: we walk at night, warm up at the same time, and hide somewhere during the day. The only thing that bothered me a lot was the cold. Although, perhaps, it saved us in the end, because the enemy also did not want to peek somewhere in such abominable weather. On the first day, the main thing was to get as far away from the abandoned equipment as possible. Population centers were bypassed. But we went to one, Znamenivka, not far from Anatolia - there was a bridge over the river near the reservoir. We came across a Russian DRG near the bridge. We -put down- one occupant, ran across that concrete bridge and lay down in a rather large landing. From 8 in the morning to 9 in the evening, they stayed in that landing. The opponent was afraid to comb her. For 4 hours, they drove next to each other, released only a few queues in our direction. Then we got somewhere - they probably thought that we had gone along the creek. We were very tired, because we had been out for the 3rd day. So, after resting a little in that landing, they filled up with water and moved along the river. There they ran into another group of Rashists. There was a short fight, one of them was definitely -killed-, but a bullet or two hit our fighter in the backpack. The soldier is running, the backpack is on fire, I shout to him: -Drop that backpack!-, and he: -Go away, there are grenades!- — -All the more, throw him to hell!-. He tore off that backpack and threw it away. We then broke away and went for several days without fire contact. Somewhere on the 6th or 7th day, they finished off the remaining sukhpai, began to look for sorrel, rummaged through garbage cans - they thought they would find something. On one of the days we almost got caught. We leave the next landing - and here our soldier noticed a tent 20 meters away, and some antennas there. They passed 300-400 meters. In the morning I already say: -Let's not go anywhere, because our legs hurt, our stomachs hurt, it's raining.- There are still about 40 kilometers to the front. Next is a quarry with sand, they thought to wait in it, and there were 20 Urals with Zetkas. We hear - somewhere behind, the generator started up, 400 meters away. I think they have come. It saved that the weather was bad, it was raining. So they lay near the quarry. Orcs were loaded with sand, no one else was seen until evening. Then they went very carefully - I sent a patrol of 2-3 people ahead. At 500 meters, if clear, they turned back, and we continued. Walked all the time with their phones turned off - I warned them to charge the power banks before leaving, and everyone turned off their phones except for me. I say - if I see someone's phone, I will shoot my knees! Of course, I wouldn't have done that, but no one was using the phones, because the Russians track cellular communications clearly. About 15 kilometers before the collision line, I see one -Life- strip appeared on my phone, but I couldn't make a call. On the 9th day, 2 -sticks- appeared on the phone. He called the brigadier general, he didn't recognize us at first, then he was happy. I got together with the unit commander who was ahead of us, and for the last 12 hours he helped us go. I remember how he tells us that there is a small area that will have to be run. And our legs are no longer carrying us, and our stomachs hurt, I was vomiting blood. The guys took my machine gun and backpack from me, they say: -We will deliver them, your task is to prove us.- And so they came&#8230; They cried because they almost didn't believe that we would make it. They have experienced so much&#8230; They came, fell down, we were given a cigarette and water to drink. He called his commander back, the next day our brigade came to pick us up. There were 16 people with me. Two of them are from the 36th Brigade. For this breakthrough from Mariupol and exit, in fact, he received the -Golden Star-. I do what I can, no more and no less. At the moment, we are temporarily on recovery, soon they will give a new command, because the Rashists must be beaten in order to return home as soon as possible. In addition to the -Golden Star- of the Hero of Ukraine, which was personally awarded to Oleh Grudzevych by the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi during a visit to the unit, for the battles near Volnovakha and Mariupol, the officer was also awarded two orders of Bohdan Khmelnytsky III and II degrees.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/kombat-vyviv-z-otochennya-14-tankistiv-i-dvoh-morpihiv-istoriya-pidpolkovnyka-grudzevycha/	2024-09-09T20:19:14-07:00
-Dirty bomb-, biolaboratories and what are the Chechens doing here: what is the Kremlin mouthpiece c...	During the meeting of the Ninth Eastern Economic Forum on September 5, he again changed the goal of the war against Ukraine and stated that the main task of -his- remains the capture of the Donetsk region. He also called it a -sacred duty- of Russian soldiers to retake part of Russia's Kursk region, which is currently controlled by the Ukrainian military. Putin declared: -The invasion of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation into the border regions of the Russian Federation failed.- And this is despite the fact that the Armed Forces continue to perform all the assigned tasks in Kurshchyna. The Russian dictator also hinted that Russia did not refuse negotiations with Ukraine, but on the basis of -documents- agreed in Istanbul in 2022. It will be recalled that at that time the Russians demanded the actual capitulation of Ukraine. In the annexes to the Istanbul Agreements, Russia prescribed a number of restrictions for Ukraine, while no restrictions were foreseen for the Russians. This was said by the former US Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland. -The Istanbul agreements prohibited Ukraine from having some weapons systems, so, in essence, Ukraine would be weakened from a military point of view, while there were no similar restrictions on the part of Russia: Russia was not required to withdraw, it was not necessary to have a buffer zone on the border, Russia was not it was forbidden to keep any weapons on the border. -Ukraine felt that this could be a trap, so after consulting with its allies, it withdrew from the negotiations,- said Victoria Nuland. Putin could get a castrated demilitarized country for nothing. He obviously liked this, so now Putin only creates the appearance of readiness for negotiations, and all he wanted and wants is the surrender of Ukraine. For this purpose, the Russian dictator is manipulating the ephemeral -Istanbul Agreements- in the Russian interpretation. Ukraine needs a just peace, according to the norms of international law, according to the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which the head of the Kremlin constantly avoids. In addition, during his speech at the forum, Putin continued to say that the current authorities of Ukraine are not interested in ending hostilities because they do not want to hold presidential elections. He was supported by the dictator's spokesman, Dmytro Peskov, who declared: -Zelenskyi's regime is de jure illegitimate, although in fact it continues its activities.- We will remind that, according to the Constitution of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi remains the legitimate head of state and will exercise his powers until the moment of taking office as the new President, whom Ukrainians will elect in the elections. Zakharova, the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, was also noted for another batch of disinformation published on the air. She stated: -Ukrainian criminals guilty of serious international crimes against their own and Russian citizens, as well as their accomplices, will be brought to court and they will suffer the deserved punishment.- As is known, during the war, Ukraine strictly adheres to all international conventions and rules of warfare, unlike Russia, which constantly violates them. Zakharova also emphasized once again that the alleged main customer and instigator of the aggression of the -Kyiv regime- is the -collective West-. The statements of the Russian propagandist are populist in nature and do not have any legal basis. In addition, they cannot withstand any criticism and have no limits to cynicism. It was Russia that attacked a sovereign state, kills Ukrainians every day and destroys entire cities. There is only one aggressor, whose name is Russia. But this does not prevent the terrorist country from constantly accusing Ukraine of preparing terrorist attacks. So, last week, the RIA Novosti channel published an interview with an alleged Ukrainian prisoner of war, who said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine were preparing ammunition with the banned chlorpicrin in a laboratory near Kramatorsk. Also, Russian propagandist Veselovskyi said: -Ukraine has already made a dirty nuclear bomb long ago and would be ready to use it, but it does not use it,- and a collaborator from the Russian Federation, Ganchev, said that the threat of attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants will remain. Let us remind you that it is Ukraine that strictly adheres to the requirements of the international nuclear security regime, unlike the aggressor country, which constantly uses nuclear blackmail for manipulation and intimidation. In addition, Ukraine, as a signatory to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons, strictly adheres to its obligations. Therefore, all the statements of propagandists are fakes, in which only Russians believe. And with plots on its own television, the propaganda of the aggressor country tries to justify the aggression of the Russian Federation and to cultivate hatred of Ukrainians among its citizens. For example, on the anniversary of the terrorist attacks in Buinaksk, Volgodonsk, and Moscow (September 4-16, 1999), the story of propagandist Dmytro Kiselyov is being circulated in the Russian Federation, in which Ukrainians are equated with -Chechen terrorists.- According to Kiselyov, now Ukrainians resisting the Russian invasion are -doing the same thing- as the terrorists who blew up residential buildings in Russian cities. Propaganda directly threatens - the defenders of Ukraine will either be destroyed or a Russian prison, -where life is worse than death.- In fact, using the pretext of -fighting terrorism- to justify wars is a classic Kremlin tactic. According to many independent investigators, the FSB was involved in the terrorist attacks in 1999, in which more than 300 people died and which became the reason for the Second Chechen War. It is the terrorist country Russia that constantly uses terrorist methods and commits crimes against the civilian population in both Chechnya and Ukraine. To write the review, materials from the Center for Combating Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine were used.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/brudna-bomba-biolaboratoriyi-j-do-chogo-tut-chechenczi-pro-shho-znov-volaye-rupor-kremlya/	2024-09-09T20:10:59-07:00
Because it is the most long-range: the US Navy puts into service the AIM-174B air-to-air missile	The fact that the Indo-Pacific region has been chosen as the prime territory for the deployment of these weapons, in the opinion of Reuters agency analyst, can significantly change the balance of forces in the air, in particular in armed confrontation with China, ArmiyaInform reports. The missile was developed by a well-known American manufacturer in the field of aerospace engineering - Raytheon - based on the SM-6 system , making it currently the longest-range missile ever used by the US, and was officially commissioned in July. It should be noted that the Pentagon did not officially present the new charge. Therefore, defense sector researchers are only making assumptions about the capabilities of the new missile based solely on its external image. Photos of F/A-18E/F Super Hornet aircraft with a new type of armament have appeared online. The new missile program and its implementation may mark a scientific and technical revolution in the fight against air targets&#8230; and even more. Yes, by data by The War Zone, the AIM-174B is a new air-to-air missile. Its appearance marks a significant increase in the capabilities of the US Navy in the fight against air targets, although the use of new weapons may extend beyond the air sphere. As confirmed by Naval News, the missile, also known as SM-6 ALC (Air-Launched Configuration), has been officially adopted by the US Navy. Weapons photographed by air adjusters during RIMPAC 2024 maneuvers while which has not been officially announced. The sudden appearance of a new missile without a pre-presented development program in the press remains largely a mystery. This reflects well the ability of the United States to conduct secret programs and the ability of Americans to avoid leaking information to the press when necessary. There are many indications that the F/A-18s will receive weapons that could radically change the balance of power in the Pacific. As can be seen from the photos published on social networks, the missile is suspended on the underwing pylon of the BRU-32B/A type of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. A few years ago, visually similar weapons were spotted under another aircraft of this type. However, that rocket was painted orange, which could mean that it was just an experimental product, a mass-sized mock-up, or maybe just a flying target. All three F/A-18E/F VFA CVW-2s are attached to the aeroplane of the Carl Vinson aircraft carrier and apparently received the AIM-174B air defense system. In recent weeks, the new missiles have been spotted in a gray color with a white fairing, which is typical of production air-to-air missiles adopted by the US Air Force and Navy. The airframe of the rocket can also be seen in great detail in the pictures. On its case there is a spoken marking DATM-174B. The abbreviation means that the missile is special, test, the common designation of the combat missile is AIM-174B. The RIMPAC exercise also saw F/A-18E/F fighters with underwing pylon-mounted missiles bearing the NAIM-174B index, with the N prefix indicating modifications for special tests where no return to the original configuration is planned. The model number in the missile designation -174- and the geometric and aerodynamic exterior of the missile airframe reveal the mystery of the weapon's origin. RIM-174B is the ship-to-air missile designation, also known in the US Navy as the SM-6 (Standard Missile-6) Block IA. In the US Navy, it is used to combat aerodynamic and ballistic targets, and also has limited capabilities to attack surface targets. The AIM-174 is a variant of the SM-6 adapted for use on combat aircraft. A missile modified for air carriers can use the altitude and speed of its carrier as launch conditions. For this reason, it lacks the Mk 72 solid propellant booster used in the original RIM-174B, which is launched from the Mk 41 shipboard Vertical Launch System (VLS). The AIM-174B missile without the Mk 72 booster weighs 1,890 pounds ± 14 lbs (857 kg ± 6 kg). The missile's terminal velocity can reach Mach 3.5 (1,050 m/s) when intercepting aerial, aerodynamic, and ballistic targets at altitudes up to 110,000 feet (34,000 meters) or Mach 2.5 (825 m/s ) when hitting land and surface targets at a range of 200 nautical miles (370 km). The missile has an active AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air homing system for end-of-flight targeting, but, unlike the AMRAAM, is not equipped with an inertial system as the primary missile control system in the initial and mid-range of the flight path, but programmable GPS navigation system, which is more accurate and allows you to do without a radio altimeter when attacking surface and ground targets in flight at low and ultra-low altitudes. It seems that as a result of this modification, the weapon does not lose its aerodynamic parameters, in particular, regarding the launch range. In this aspect, an air-launched missile may even win against a prototype ship-based missile. Given that estimates of the launch range of the -traditional- ship-based RIM-174B range from 240 to 460 km, this means that the AIM-174B could prove to be the longest-range air-to-air missile in its class, surpassing the Russian P-37 (AA 13 Axehead in the NATO nomenclature), the Chinese PL-15 (CH-AA-10 Abaddon) or the European Meteor. AIM-174B — new missile -air — air- of the US Navy for long-range F-18 Super Hornets.

Heavy fighting in tracts and islands: the intensity of enemy assaults on the Left Bank of the Dniepe...	Captain Dmytro, the spokesman of the operational group of troops -Tavria- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- Lykhova - In three days - Friday, Saturday and Sunday - 30 combat clashes took place there. The opponent had no success. Today, since the beginning of the day, there have already been 7 combat clashes there, while they are not taking place in one place, but are scattered on different islands, tracts, on different areas, which are stretched over a considerable length of the Dnipro coast, he said. This is an atypical situation, because previously most of the enemy's ground offensive operations were carried out in Zaporizhzhia, namely on the Robotynsky ledge in the Orihiv direction. Now the situation has changed. — Over the course of yesterday, 13 enemy assaults were repelled in our entire operational zone, of which three took place in the Orichiv direction, none in the Gulyajpil region, and 10 attacks were repelled at once in the Dnieper direction. This is such an atypical activity, the spokesman noted. The military believes that the Russians want to oust units of the Defense Forces from their positions on the bridgeheads on the Left Bank of the Dnieper. — They want, so to speak, to do it in such a leap. There are no other explanations. But in principle, their activation is the greatest in the last couple of months after the end of the active defense of Krynok, when our units — marines and other units of the Armed Forces — moved to other designated positions on the Left Bank of the Dnieper, he said. Dmytro Lykhovii suggested that the intensification of offensive actions by the Russians on the left bank of the Dnieper is related to their concern about a possible Ukrainian offensive in this direction. — There was information that the Russians were waiting for our offensive there. There were active actions, in particular, by the special forces of the Main Directorate of Intelligence with amphibious landings on the Kinburn spit, on the Tendriv spit. So the Russians keep their contingent there also for defense reasons. But now we are dealing with an increase in the number of assaults on their part, the spokesman said. In general, the Russians did not relax their attention to the SSU-held bridgeheads on the Left Bank of the Dnieper, even when they transferred their units from other directions in the South in view of the Kursk offensive operation of the Defense Forces. — It can be said that after the start of the Kursk offensive operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, when the enemy in a certain way transferred his units to threatened areas, in particular to Kurshchyna, he took most of these units from the Zaporizhzhia region. Whereas in Kherson Oblast, the number that was there actually remained. There, the Russians did not weaken the group. On the contrary, they conduct rotations at the front edge of their units, transfer -storm- detachments there in particular to maintain the intensity of assault actions, in order to be able to attack in the future, said Dmytro Lykhova. On the other hand, in other directions in the South, the number of assaults by the occupiers decreased. — If earlier most of the combat clashes took place in Zaporozhye, in the Orichiv direction, specifically on the Robotynsky ledge, now there are very few of them there. For example, yesterday there were three of them, none before that, today two have already happened since the beginning of the day. At the same time, the enemy is actively using unguided air missiles. In the Gulyajpil direction, there have been three weeks without significant changes, that is, there are no ground assaults, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform showed that our soldiers destroyed a warehouse of enemy watercraft in the South.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/09/v-urochyshhah-i-na-ostrovah-vazhki-boyi-zrosla-intensyvnist-shturmiv-voroga-na-livoberezhzhi-dnipra/	2024-09-09T10:28:16-07:00

But when they get into the Russian military system and face reality, everything falls into place,- the Ukrainian military said. -Это что вообще такое? You go according to the contract, you sign the contract, and you go and spend your money. Those are contracts that you get, you earn,- complains a serviceman of the aggressor state of the Russian Federation. Instead, in captivity, he was fed and given the necessary clothes. However, only he was so lucky - all the other henchmen of the Russian died. -Russians, you live in a country that kills you more than any other. Your Russian -tsar- killed more Russians than any Ukrainian. We will continue to destroy anyone who chooses to play the -great conqueror-.

The Ministry of Defense is updating the food supply of the Armed Forces: the pilot project will be l...	About this reported in the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The main task of the new approach is to ensure better quality of products supplied to the Armed Forces and to increase the efficiency of the supply process itself. It was introduced to potential suppliers, manufacturers and distributors. -From February 2025, two models will operate in parallel: the one under which DOT works now, and the new pilot model. This approach is used to ensure the stability of the system and the continuity of the supply process. Transformations in the food model for the military should increase the efficiency of supply and, at the same time, ensure compliance with high standards of product quality,- said Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. The pilot will operate throughout the year and will cover such regions as the city of Kyiv and the Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Cherkasy, and Kirovohrad regions. The main changes concern the financial model of interaction with the supplier, the product model and the quality control process. The supplier will receive compensation for the cost of goods and a fee for services (warehousing and transportation) subject to the SLA. The marginal cost of the catalog will be determined and fixed. For most types of products (75%) through open procurement platforms, the DOT will choose manufacturers who will be contracted by suppliers. For the remaining categories, suppliers will independently identify subcontractors. DOT, in turn, can block them for quality inconsistency and for violating integrity norms. All products will pass through the distribution center and only then be sent to military units. This is an additional stage of quality control, to which DOT specialists will be involved. DOT will apply a -black list- to suppliers and manufacturers - a new tool to prevent participation in the process of providing food for the Armed Forces in future periods of those entities that have already violated contractual obligations . -The idea of ​​the pilot model is to change the philosophy of interaction with suppliers and manufacturers due to the change in their incentives and the openness of the terms of cooperation. We see this approach as the basis of partnership. At the same time, our main goal is to ensure an increase in both the quality of products received by the Armed Forces and the efficiency of the supply process itself. So that, while observing the transparent rules of the game, all participants in the process are interested in ensuring a continuous and high-quality supply of the Armed Forces,- said Halyna Litosh, program director for the food sector of the DOT. Earlier, ArmyInform informed that The Kingdom of Sweden announced the 17th package of military aid to Ukraine in the amount of SEK 4.6 billion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/09/minoborony-onovlyuye-harchove-zabezpechennya-zsu-pilotnyj-proyekt-zapustyat-nastupnogo-roku/	2024-09-09T07:52:03-07:00
