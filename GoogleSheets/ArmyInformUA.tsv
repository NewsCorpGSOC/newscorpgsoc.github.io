Suicide on the battlefield: Russians shoot through -akhmat-	How is this related to the frequent suicides of Russian soldiers on the battlefield in the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon broadcast explained the commander of the battalion of shock air defense systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket captain Ivan Sirk, captain Yury Fedorenko. The military said that the professionally trained -Akhmatians- do not fight on the front line. Instead, the appearance of -akhmat- units in a certain direction indicates a low level of motivation and discipline among regular Russian occupation troops. - Where -Ahmat- appears - there are problems in the troops, which they have to solve at the expense of a system of coercion, humiliation and destruction of servicemen of the Russian occupation forces, actually carrying out punishment directly on the battlefield, he said. As a result of such a system, it is easier for Russian soldiers to shoot themselves than to retreat without completing the task, because in the near rear they will be abused, tortured or even executed by the -Akhmatians-. — That is why you can often see a video published on social networks, when the occupier, having received an insignificant injury, for example, to the lower limbs, commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. It is easier for him to die on the battlefield than to return without completing the task to the rear. This result is ensured by the -Ahmat- unit, Yuriy Fedorenko explained. He noted that the Russian soldiers had only two options left - either to die on the battlefield or to be executed by the -Akhmatians-. - How long will the Russians tolerate that this very unit can do whatever they want with them, like with dolls - it's their choice, to die in Ukraine or at the hands of the -Akhmatians-, - concluded the drone commander. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv region, the Russians attack with -barracks- according to the Donetsk scenario, but the Defense Forces destroy 90% of the enemy's armored vehicles and 60-70% of the infantry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/samogubstvo-na-poli-boyu-rosiyany-strilyayutsya-cherez-ahmat/	2024-09-14T02:50:42-07:00

-Fin- and his Norwegian Leopard: battles in Zaporizhzhia, tricks of the Russians in the East and the...	During the war, -Fin- worked in the banking sector for the third year, before the large-scale invasion of Russia. After the mobilization, he took part in the Kharkiv operation, fought in Zaporozhye during the counteroffensive last year, and now he is in Donetsk region, together with his comrades, destroying the enemy on Leopard 2A4 tanks. -Fin- was among the first tankers who started working on German tanks that arrived in Ukraine last year from Western partners. ArmyInform tells its story on the occasion of Tank Troops Day. — I encountered a large-scale invasion at home in the Buchansky district of the Kyiv region. Heard how they started bombing Gostomel airport. The first explosion occurred at approximately 5:30 am. -Then I ran out into the street, and within a few minutes I learned from the news that the war had begun,- the serviceman recalls. -Fin- studied banking and graduated from the military department as a tank platoon commander. After studying, he worked in a bank, and already in October 2022 he was mobilized and assigned to the tank platoon commander, then still in the 4th tank brigade: - At first, they worked with T-64 and T-72 tanks. These were our main tanks, working in the Kharkiv direction. Later, -Fin- was offered to go to study on foreign equipment, while at first they were not even informed that it would be Leopard tanks. - Later we were already informed that we were going to study on foreign equipment, namely on Leopard 2A4 tanks. The training took place in Poland for about 40 days. -Fin- assures that this term is enough to master new tanks, because all servicemen already had significant combat experience. — Many who passed through Bakhmut took part in the Kharkiv operation. Tanks almost all go the same way. And it was very easy for us, as we just started studying, adds -Fin-. In Poland, he was trained on a Polish tank, and when he returned to Ukraine, he got one of the Leopards that Norway gave him. Currently, a whole tank coalition of countries is working, which transfers tanks of various modifications to Ukraine. — Tanks from different countries are slightly different in equipment, have different machine guns. There is also a difference in the devices, -night lights-, some of which have rear view cameras. But in general, the differences are not such that they cannot be understood or require additional training, explains -Fin-. His unit has been working at Leopards for a year and a half. -Fin- received one of the first such tanks that arrived in Ukraine. — I had my first combat use on this tank during a counteroffensive in the Zaporizhzhia region in 2023, the settlement of Mala Tokmachka. They went on the attack, started working. The enemy fired heavily at us, using FPV drones a lot. In the end, we completed the task and retreated to more advantageous positions to save the lives of the crew, save the equipment, the tank remained intact, - recalls -Fin-. After such an attack, many traces of artillery shells remained on the equipment. Tankers say that the Russians, on the one hand, are afraid of the Leopards, but on the other hand, they also hunt them, consider Western equipment a priority target. — There were cases of drone strikes, the commander of a tank with the call sign -Chechen- was killed in mine. He was hit by a -lancet- directly in the commander's hatch, he died on the spot. The crew survived, but the commander died, says -Fin-. Currently, the tanks of the 33rd brigade are performing combat tasks in the eastern direction and are holding back the advance of the Russian invaders. — the Russians are constantly trying to trick us. But we are not the first day in the war, so we know their tricks. -Leopards- are used precisely in tank battles, we engage in direct fire so that the target is 2.5-3 kilometers away, - notes -Fin-, and about Russian -analogovnet- tanks, such as the T-90M -Proryv-, says the following: — Tanks are all destroyed, all are burning. The key is knowing where to shoot. Crews are officially paid for each destroyed unit of enemy equipment. It's also an added motivation to destroy them more. — One of the crews destroyed two BMPs at once. They left and worked very quickly. -Leopard- has an excellent sight, sees far, plus speed. They just saw two BMPs in an open area and immediately stopped them with two shots. After that, they immediately rolled back -into a hole- so that neither artillery nor drones could catch up. We work at speed: there is a task, there is a goal, we worked quickly and hid, explains -Fin-. He adds that the Soviet tanks, which are also in the armed brigade, mainly work from closed positions, that is, as artillery and cover. — Nowadays, we often conduct training, because we do not know what will await us in the future. We may have to ford or ford a river. Bridges are often blown up, and we have to be ready for that, says the tank company commander. Currently, the 33rd brigade is also actively recruiting, in addition, experienced commanders can already train new arrivals themselves. — There is still a lack of highly qualified personnel, namely tank commanders. We have guys who were anti-tank fighters who joined us. We ourselves trained them on the training grounds, and now they skillfully perform combat tasks. That is, they were anti-tankers, but they became tankers. Tankers who work on foreign equipment constantly exchange experience in the operation of tanks and their use in combat operations. — My colleague studied in Britain on Challenger tanks, and we constantly exchange information about what we or they are better at, what are our weaknesses. We support the contact. -Fin- emphasizes that an important quality for a tanker is the ability to work in a crew. — The crew is one unit, they must work together. There has to be trust between them in order to move out and complete the task. And you also need perseverance to study, to learn the technique. Constantly working and training. There are no longer any height requirements. -I have a platoon leader who is 192 cm tall and he's quite comfortable,- adds -Fin- with a smile.

Distinguishes drones from birds: what is known about the radars that the Netherlands will transfer t...	As reported ArmyInform, the corresponding contract was arranged by the Ministry of Defense of the Kingdom with Robin Radar Systems in The Hague. Robin Radar Systems radars are designed to detect small drones, distinguishing them from other objects such as birds. A unique feature of certain radar samples from the Dutch manufacturer is their ability to work while driving on a vehicle, which ensures increased operational capabilities. The mobile nature of these radars makes them difficult for adversaries to detect and neutralize, providing continuous detection of air threats. These radars will play a crucial role in countering Russian drone attacks, providing a significant defense capability for Ukraine. The MAX, ELVIRA and IRIS radars offered by Robin Radar Systems provide advanced drone detection and tracking solutions suitable for a variety of environments. With its 360-degree 3D coverage, the MAX radar can detect and track thousands of moving objects simultaneously, providing real-time updates and accurate data through rapid rotation. Designed for airports and wind farms, it is particularly suitable for environments where flight safety is critical. ELVIRA, a 2D radar specifically designed for drone detection, uses advanced technologies such as micro-Doppler classification to effectively distinguish UAVs from other objects while offering easy integration with command and control systems. Robin Radar Iris® is a short-range X-band 3D radar designed for drone detection and identification. It is a frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar with two independent radio frequency systems, two pairs of antennas diametrically opposed to transmit and receive. IRIS is a lightweight 3D radar that deploys in less than 15 minutes and can detect drones at speeds of up to 100 km/h, making it ideal for rapid deployment in the field. The weight of these radars is 29 kg, they deploy in 15 minutes and provide a circular view, the instrument range of which is up to 5 km. The systems can detect UAVs weighing 3 kg from a distance of 4 km and 1.4 kg from 2 km. -This three-coordinate radar operates in the X-Band range, that is, at a wavelength of 3.75-2.5 cm and at a frequency of 8-12 GHz. The beam width is 6 degrees and the scan speed is 1 second, the analysts said. -As for the ability to work while driving, speeds up to 100 km/h and angles up to 10 degrees are allowed.- Also exists project integration of Robin Radar's IRIS with OpenWorks Engineering's Vision Flex CUAS optical autonomous surveillance system, which increases the effectiveness of target detection and recognition. Experts from IKK Defense Express believe that these small-sized installations will be an ideal addition to the work of small fire groups , which are engaged in identifying targets. They can also come in handy for cover from threats during marches, experts emphasize. In the context of the war in Ukraine, where drones are increasingly being used for reconnaissance and attacks, these radars will help provide valuable capabilities to counter the aerial threat. Their ability to quickly detect, track and classify drones will allow Ukrainian forces to better anticipate and neutralize drone attacks, strengthening their defenses against airstrikes.

Throw a shadow on NATO to hide its hybrid attacks: how and why Russia lies about UAVs	The purpose of this narrative is obvious — to show the Russians as if they are fighting against the entire -Western world- and to accuse Ukraine's partners of escalation. Information is being actively circulated in the Russian information space that the territory of NATO countries is allegedly being used by the Armed Forces to launch UAVs. For example, during the drone attack on the Murmansk region on September 11, Russian information launderers spread the news that one of the Ukrainian UAVs had arrived from the territory of Norway, a NATO member. The Kremlin has long sought to involve NATO in a war in order to lose not only Ukraine, but the entire -collective west-. According to the Kremlin dictator, such a reason for the unsuccessful completion of -svo- should have satisfied the domestic Russian audience. That is why Russian drones and missiles have repeatedly invaded the airspace of at least five NATO member states and two other European states. Moldova, which is particularly suffering from the consequences of Russian attacks, has repeatedly recorded cases of missile and drone debris falling on its territory, and Romania even activates the air alarm signal during Russian air attacks and has built shelters in border areas. On September 7, the Russian-Iranian -shahed- fell for the first time in Latvia, as a result of which the country announced the strengthening of air defense on its eastern borders. It is no secret for Ukraine that Russia has been waging a hybrid war against the entire civilized world for a long time. This is manifested in cyber attacks, systematic violation of airspace by fighter jets, particularly over the Baltic Sea, aggressive propaganda through the media and the church, funding of pro-Russian organizations and individual politicians. And the West's accusations of escalation, which periodically come from the Russians, are just an attempt to shift responsibility for their actions onto someone else.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/kynuty-tin-na-nato-shhob-pryhovaty-svoyi-gibrydni-ataky-yak-i-chomu-rosiya-breshe-pro-bpla/	2024-09-13T20:13:32-07:00
Utility discount in a few clicks: how to issue a discount remotely	ArmyInform tells who can use this service and what needs to be done. Previously, beneficiaries had to submit several applications. The first is about registering a war veteran, and the second is actually about assigning a benefit for housing and communal services. Currently, one application is submitted. And it's simplified. The point is that a significant amount of data is now collected automatically through electronic information exchange between public registries. By the way, family members of a veteran can apply for benefits. This can be done both by those who have already retired from the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, and by those who are still serving. For the latter, such an option can come in handy, because it is not so easy to personally visit various government institutions during service. Vacations are not big enough to waste time on. The result of the application review can be tracked in the section -My applications- - -application status-. Currently, the benefit for the payment of housing and communal services is provided in cash. By default, the Pension Fund can open an account in Oschadbank and inform the beneficiary about it. And the beneficiary must sign the bank account agreement. If you want the money to be transferred to an account in another bank, you need to apply to the territorial body of the Pension Fund. For registration, you need to provide your account, where the money will be deposited. It usually takes some time for registration and billing. But later the money comes. In general, the benefit involves the following process - you pay the full amount for housing and communal services, which are indicated in the payments. But you receive funds on the card in the form of compensation. It should be remembered that if you do not pay for the utility bill, the benefits may stop. We would like to remind you that the discount on the payment of housing and communal services is not the only benefit provided to the participants of hostilities. More about social guarantees read here. If you have not yet registered the status of a combatant, but there are grounds for its registration, we also wrote about the options how UBD can be issued now.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/znyzhka-na-komunalku-v-dekilka-klikiv-yak-oformyty-pilgu-dystanczijno/	2024-09-13T20:00:45-07:00
In Poland, the NATO-Ukraine JATEC Center - Ministry of Defense officially started its work	About this reported on September 13 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The decision to create JATEC was approved at the NATO summit in Washington in July this year. The center is located in the Polish city of Bydgoszcz. -The joint center with NATO will help Ukraine not only to implement procedures, approaches and standards, but also to share its own experience. Interoperability is one of our main goals and we are taking concrete steps for it. We have submitted our proposals for the implementation of the projects and are waiting for substantive decisions,- Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Stanislav Hayder commented on the event. Assistant Secretary General of the Alliance Thomas Goffus, Commander of the NATO Strategic Command for Transformations General Philippe Lavin, First Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces, Major General Karol Dymanovsky, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for European Integration Oleksandr Balanutsa took part in the negotiations in Poland. The parties legally established the creation of the Center and outlined its main tasks, structure, roles and functions of the management team. The work of JATEC is aimed at achieving interoperability of the security and defense institutions of Ukraine with the relevant institutions of the Alliance, improving the quality of education, increasing the analytical component and training personnel. The parties agreed that the establishment of the Center should be formally completed in October-November of this year. -The opening of a joint center with NATO is a real step towards the integration of Ukraine into the structure of the Alliance. Membership in NATO is not a political slogan, but the implementation of specific projects. We are gradually moving towards becoming a full-fledged part of the bloc, and the opening of JATEC brings us closer to this,- Oleksandr Balanutsa said during the event. Another topic of negotiations is ensuring the work of the Center, namely the need to provide resources from NATO for the implementation of measures and the development of an information and communication network. Representatives of Ukraine and NATO also agreed on the need to launch projects within the framework of JATEC as soon as possible. In particular, the Ukrainian side handed over a list of 70 projects for joint work and suggested which of them should become priorities. As reported by ArmyInform, the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Stanislav Hayder during a meeting in Kyiv informed experts of the European Union about the course and results of reforms in the field of defense.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/u-polshhi-oficzijno-rozpochav-robotu-czentr-nato-ukrayina-jatec-minoborony/	2024-09-13T12:11:01-07:00

Exposure, suspicion, special investigation: law enforcement officers in the Kupyan region worked har...	The law enforcement officers exposed a 49-year-old woman who worked as a clerk in the occupation administration. During the capture of the village of Dvorichna in the Kupyan District, a local resident voluntarily supported the Russian invaders. She assumed the position of -executive chief specialist of the paperwork sector of the Dvurechan territorial administration of the Temporary Civil Administration of the Kupyan district of the Kharkiv region.- The woman organized the documents and their further verification, formed cases and handed them over to the leadership of the occupation administration. Also, an official of the occupation administration was engaged in the formation of applications from local residents for further payment of -material aid- in Russian rubles. After the liberation of the district from the Russian invaders, the accomplice of the occupiers tried to avoid legal responsibility, but she was exposed. Also, the prosecutor's office in absentia notified about suspicion due to the fact of collaborative activity to a 37-year-old man who helped invaders to -legally take- Ukrainian enterprises into the property of the Russian Federation. During the occupation of the city of Kupyansk, he voluntarily agreed to cooperate with the Russian invaders, and in July 2022 he deliberately assumed the position of -executive chief specialist of the Department of Economic Development of the Military-Gradient Administration of the Kupyan District of the Kharkiv Region.- The man, on the instructions of the occupation leadership, carried out an inventory of communal and state enterprises, and also drew up -reports- based on its results. On the basis of these -documents-, the occupiers have already illegally transferred captured Ukrainian enterprises to the property of the aggressor state. Before the de-occupation of Kharkiv Oblast by the Defense Forces of Ukraine, the collaborator fled to the Russian Federation together with the Russian military. Law enforcement officers raised the issue of declaring him wanted. Also, the prosecutors completed a special investigation and sent to the court an indictment against the Kupyan city council member for the fact of collaborative activity. During the occupation of the city by the armed forces of the Russian Federation, she voluntarily cooperated with the Russian occupiers. In July 2022, the invaders appointed a woman to the position of -and. at. chief physician of the communal enterprise -Kupyanskoe territorial medical association- of the Ministry of Health of the Kharkiv Oblast Regional State Administration. Before the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine, the woman worked as a cardiologist, so she had relevant work experience and skills that she used when working for the invaders. The newly minted -leader- coordinated the work of subordinate employees, followed the instructions of the occupation leadership and even managed to appear in a Russian propaganda video. In the video, the -chief doctor- talked about receiving the so-called -human aid with medicines- from the Russian Federation, thus creating a positive image of the aggressor country. The woman performed her duties until the moment of deoccupation. She is currently hiding from Ukrainian law enforcement officers. The accused has been declared wanted, she will be tried in absentia. A woman faces up to ten years of imprisonment with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for a period of up to fifteen years and confiscation of property. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that this week, according to the materials The court of the State Bureau of Investigation sentenced 5 defectors, indictments were sent to the court against 3 collaborators, 4 more persons were notified of suspicion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/vykryttya-pidozra-speczrozsliduvannya-potrijno-vidpraczyuvaly-pravoohoronczi-na-kupyanshhyni/	2024-09-13T11:43:34-07:00

Putin's subject spied on the Armed Forces in Kharkiv: -shtirlitsa- will be tried	This was reported by the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office. In addition to official work in a banking institution, the man additionally spied for the benefit of the Russian Federation. Recruited by the Russian intelligence services, he established contact with a person who, in his opinion, had access to the state secret service in order to collect classified information. These data were necessary for the enemy to launch strikes on documentation storage sites with the aim of destroying them and, as a result, opposing the recovery of critical infrastructure that had already suffered from shelling by the aggressor state. In addition, the man collected information about the deployment locations of personnel and military equipment of Ukrainian defenders on the territory of Kharkiv. While moving around the city, the accused recorded, including with the help of a video recorder, the location of the armed forces. He transmitted the collected intelligence information to his curator via Telegram. The data obtained from the spy is necessary for the enemy to plan massive attacks. Thanks to the concerted and coordinated actions of the law enforcement officers, the spy was exposed and arrested in July 2024. During the search of his place of residence, mobile phones, flash drives, computer equipment, a video recorder, etc., as well as a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation and an improvised explosive device were seized. The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office approved and referred to the court an indictment on the facts of espionage, dissemination of information about the movement, movement, location of the Armed Forces, committed under martial law, with the purpose of providing such information to the state, which is carrying out armed aggression against Ukraine, as well as on the fact of acquisition, carrying and keeping an explosive device without a statutory permit. The man will be held without bail. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that banker-spy was detained in Kharkiv.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/piddanecz-putina-shpyguvav-za-zsu-u-harkovi-shtirlicza-sudytymut/	2024-09-13T11:12:15-07:00

GUR: Every operation to capture the enemy is a rescue of brothers who are in Russian captivity	Andrii Yusov, a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, shared the details on September 13 on the air of -Social News-. Today is the 56th exchange during the period of the full-scale invasion. 49 of our defenders have returned. Among them are the National Guard, the National Guard, the Armed Forces, the border guards, who were illegally convicted by the Russian invaders. We meet today at our homes. They are now provided with the first necessary medical assistance, psychological assistance, and initial examination. Next, of course, is a long rehabilitation process,- Andriy Yusov said. The representative of the GUR commented on the return from captivity of the defenders of Azovstal. -For Ukraine, the return of every defender from all divisions is an important task and everyone must return. But Russian propaganda pays special attention to individual units, individual episodes of the shameful Russian genocidal war against Ukrainians. However, no matter how difficult it is, we return ours. And the defenders of Azovstal were returned last exchange. Then they were conscripts. And this exchange we also have good news for the Mariupol garrison. And it will continue,- stated the representative of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. According to Andrii Yusov, the large-scale replenishment of the exchange fund during the Kursk operation also played a huge role in the exchange. Although each operation to capture the enemy is a separate difficult job and additional risks for our defenders, they save the lives of their brothers who are in Russian captivity. How ArmyInform reported earlier that 49 soldiers and civilians, including the Hero of Ukraine, returned home from Russian captivity. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/gur-kozhna-operacziya-po-zahoplennyu-voroga-u-polon-poryatunok-pobratymiv-yaki-v-rosijskij-nevoli/	2024-09-13T08:29:22-07:00

The President of Ukraine answered whether the operation in Kurshchyna was a mistake	He told about this during his participation in the 20th annual meeting of the Yalta European Strategy. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also noted that thanks to the Kursk operation, it was possible to stop the enemy in the Kharkiv direction and slow down the advance of the Russians in the Donetsk region. After the operation in Kurshchyna, the backlog of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for shells near Pokrovsk decreased from 1:12 to 1:2.5. -In Kurshchyna, the Russians began their rapid offensive. About 60-70 thousand people want to apply. We know about 40,000 are already there,- the President noted. The President noted that it is a pleasant fact that not only Ukraine is talking about the deoccupation of its territories, but also Russia. In addition, Volodymyr Zelenskyi answered the question whether the Kursk operation was a mistake. The head of state recalled the Russian offensive in the Kharkiv direction, which is also a very important center of the eastern part of Ukraine. -You saw that they broke through our defenses, wanted to capture Kharkiv, in addition to their official messages regarding the construction of some buffer zones along our entire border, and they would not have finished with the East,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The President noted that we later received intelligence from our partners. -In the north of our state, starting from Sumshchyna, from the east to the north of our state, plans were being prepared to create appropriate buffer zones, and with one or another military success, they wanted to capture the centers of these regions. This is what the Kursk operation gave,- the head of state summarized. In the opinion of Volodymyr Zelenskyi, the operation gave the results that everyone was counting on. -The enemy has been stopped in Kharkiv Oblast, its advance on Donetsk Oblast has slowed down, although it is very difficult there, and there is still a long way to positive things there. However, they withdrew their forces from Kharkiv Oblast, Zaporozhye and other groups that were preparing in the north for the occupation of our territories. The enemy began to move all this to the Kursk direction. This is what happened,- added the President.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/prezydent-ukrayiny-vidpoviv-chy-bula-operacziya-na-kurshhyni-pomylkoyu/	2024-09-13T07:09:04-07:00

Enemy armored assaults have become more frequent in Kharkiv Oblast: how to counter them	How this can be countered told on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon, the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU Vitaly Sarantsev. — Last day, the enemy tried to storm the units of the Defense Forces in Vovchansk and used two BMPs for support. Both machines were detected already during the approach to our positions and were hit by fire from FPV drones. One of the cars was destroyed, the other was damaged, he said. Despite heavy losses of the occupiers, they do not stop trying to storm in the future, which indicates the importance of the Kharkiv direction for the Russian military and political leadership. In order to continue the offensive, the invaders are trying to change tactics and approaches to carrying out combat missions. On the other hand, the Russians are not sending any significant reinforcements to Kharkiv region and are forced to storm with available forces. — The enemy conducts constant rotations, accumulates forces that carry out assaults in the city itself. He rotates these units internally and is constantly trying to strengthen them. As for any global accumulation, it is currently not observed either in the direction of Vovchansk or near other settlements, in particular Hlyboky, Lyptsi or other locations on the Russian-Ukrainian border, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that ->in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian drones put the occupiers on starvation rations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/vorozhi-broneshturmy-pochastishaly-na-harkivshhyni-yak-vdayetsya-protydiyaty/	2024-09-13T06:26:23-07:00

As a border guard - Schumacher - overtook enemy drones on bends	About Andrii with the call sign -Malyuk- said on September 13 on the website of the State Border Service. The first rotation of -Malyuk- — to the combat zone in the Kharkiv region. There he had to drive various armored and non-armored vehicles, deliver and pick up personnel from positions, transport the wounded, deliver ammunition and necessary property to the soldiers, etc. -With a night vision device, he drove at a speed of 120-130 km per hour at night. When the enemy FPV drones started to fly, it was even necessary to drive at a higher speed so that they did not catch up,- -Malyuk- recalls. Adrenaline, says the border guard, was over the top. However, they went to any challenge. And if at full speed in the dark they flew into ravines from enemy anti-tank vehicles and shells, then they simply pulled out the car, repaired it and drove on. Previously ArmyInform told about 43-year-old Serhiy, a soldier of the 78th separate airborne assault regiment and his experience of brutal battles in the Toretsk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/yak-prykordonnyk-shumaher-na-virazhah-obganyav-vorozhi-drony/	2024-09-13T05:57:48-07:00
President of Ukraine: We need long-range capability to change the course of the war	He emphasized this during a speech within the XX meeting of the Yalta European Strategy. The head of state noted that while Ukraine is waiting for the delivery of promised air defense systems, primarily Patriot, from partners, Russia continues to strike our country. After all, the Russian dictator does not need any long-range permits for this. -Anyone who simply sees on the map where Russia strikes from, where it prepares forces and keeps reserves, where it locates military facilities and what logistics it uses - anyone who sees all this obviously understands what long-range Ukraine is for,- - the President emphasized. Volodymyr Zelensky also noted that the other day he discussed this in detail with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and British Foreign Minister David Lammy. According to the words of the Head of State, after this meeting, there can no longer be any open question about why Ukraine needs sufficient long-range. -I want to emphasize: enough. Not enough to simply say that there is a solution. Long-range enough to change the course of the war and force Russia to seek peace. And we very much hope for our partners, we hope for the result from our partners. At least we are working on it,- added Volodymyr Zelenskyi. As reported by ArmyInform, the EU will send interest from frozen Russian assets to strengthen Ukraine's defense.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/prezydent-ukrayiny-nam-potribna-dalekobijnist-dlya-zminy-perebigu-vijny/	2024-09-13T05:48:04-07:00
The third recruiting center of the Ukrainian army opened in Sumy Oblast in a week	About this informs on September 13, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.

This makes it possible to attract precisely motivated personnel to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is a key factor for strengthening the combat capability of our army,- said Volodymyr Artyukh, head of the Sumy OVA. The database of Ukrainian army recruiting centers has more than 10,000 vacancies in the Defense Forces.

Without food and water in the trenches: the drones put the occupiers on starvation rations	reported who and how exactly deprived the occupiers of the basic necessities for conducting hostilities, on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Vitaly Sarantsev. -Such simple problems have serious consequences for the enemy, because those units that are in advanced positions cannot carry out their tasks efficiently, cannot go on assaults, cannot carry out tasks related to the engineering equipment of their positions,- he said. The lack of an established stable supply of provisions, water and, in some cases, even ammunition has a negative impact on the combat capability of enemy units. Such a situation was created thanks to the skilful combat work of Ukrainian drones, which broke the logistical chains of support in the enemy's near rear. — The prerequisite for this is the effective actions of our FPV drone operators, who skillfully search for the enemy's movement routes and cut all the logistics chains as precisely and accurately as possible. They destroy everything that approaches the positions, no matter how the enemy tries to carry out these support tasks either on foot, using motorized vehicles, or using cars, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast, the occupiers suffer from Ukrainian drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/bez-harchiv-ta-vody-v-okopah-dronari-posadyly-okupantiv-na-golodnyj-pajok/	2024-09-13T05:23:56-07:00

Free pallia: no money was earned, only a suspicion of 10 years in prison	The Security Service of Ukraine informs about this. -This time, the occupiers remotely involved two Odesa residents, an immigrant from Luhansk region and a resident of Izmail district, before committing arson. Among them are three minors. All of them were looking for -easy money- in Telegram channels, where they got into the field of view of the special services of the Russian Federation, -said SBU employees. In order to carry out enemy tasks, the participants at various times found potential -targets- and then coordinated them with their Russian supervisors. After the arsons, the attackers recorded the fire on the cameras of their own phones and sent a -video report- to representatives of the Russian special services. According to such an algorithm, the perpetrators destroyed 6 official cars of Ukrainian defenders, but never received the promised money from the occupiers. Criminals were arrested -on hot pursuit- in various districts of Odesa. During the searches of the homes of the detainees, incendiary devices and mobile phones with evidence of subversive activities for the benefit of the Russian Federation were seized. Investigators of the Security Service informed the detainees (according to the crimes committed) of suspicion under the following articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: The perpetrators are in custody. They face 8 to 10 years in prison.

The cases of exploitation of car fuel tanks have become more frequent, that is, they have become overturned more. This information is being verified.

According to available data, the occupiers planned to use Kh-59 air missiles to carry out fire damage. The Russian special service also tried to find out the locations of enterprises that fulfill a state defense order. To perform these tasks, the FSB remotely recruited a 44-year-old employee of a local factory. -The man came to the attention of the Russian special services because of his anti-Ukrainian comments in Telegram channels.

-Sarayami- according to the Donetsk scenario: what makes Russians submissively -canned in cans-	The battalion commander told about the peculiarities of storming -barracks- according to the Donetsk scenario on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- of shock air defense systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket chieftain Ivan Sirk, captain Yury Fedorenko. — The first armored vehicle that goes in their assault column is mostly an old modification tank, roughly like the T-72. It can be without a tower, without ammunition. It is used precisely as a carrier. From above, it is actually covered with a -barn-. Anyone who has ever seen a barn or an old house knows how it will look made of metal, said the drone commander. In front of this armored vehicle are trawls designed to remove mine barriers, both anti-personnel and anti-tank. — Between the body of the tank and between this -barn-, which is welded on top, there is an assault infantry. Behind the tank, 2-3 BMPs are moving, similarly covered with -sheds- on top. Between the body of the BMP and this very -barn- is the assault infantry, the soldier continued. It is difficult to understand why the Russians meekly accept certain death. — Frankly speaking, I do not know what the Russian occupiers are telling the military and how they are forcing them to climb into this structure that is being built, because it is certain death. Most of the conscious people who are involved in the military affairs understand this, including new recruits of the Russian Federation. But the system of coercion in them works perfectly and the occupier is more afraid of his own than going to the battlefield to certain death. Therefore, one way or another, they are -preserved- in this -can-, said Yuriy Fedorenko. Next, assault actions take place - Russian -barracks- rush in the direction of the positions of the units of the Defense Forces. — At high speed, the main task is to jump to our advanced positions. -Tanchyk makes a pass and BMPs fly behind him to rush the infantry and then move on to shock-assault actions with the aim of displacing us from advanced positions,- said the commander of -Achilles-. The military said that drones saw such sheds for the first time in Donetsk region. There, they were used most in the Avdiivka region, in the Bakhmut area and in other places. Losses among the personnel of the enemy during such assaults are colossal. — 90% of vehicles are currently destroyed by Defense Forces on the battlefield either immediately or after damage. Up to 60-70% of the assault infantry, which moves on such equipment, does not reach the line of advance, Yuriy Fedorenko said. The military said that during the past day, Achilles fighters managed to destroy 4 units of armored vehicles - one tank and 3 BMP. In general, even more enemy equipment was burned on the field, because the gunners and drones of other units also worked well on it. Since the beginning of September, the -Achillesians- have already destroyed 25 units of the occupiers' equipment. However, the droners are in no hurry to relax - the occupants still have enough -dances- and -beh- left. -This indicates that the enemy still has the opportunity, unfortunately, to carry out shock-assault actions and deploy its lightly armored and armored vehicles,- noted Yuriy Fedorenko. Earlier, ArmyInform showed how the long-range -helmeted- Achilles - hit exactly under the turret of a Russian tank and defeated -Grad - in Belgorod region, and the all-seeing -Achilles- saw and eliminated the occupiers and shot a full yagdtash of enemy equipment in Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/sarayamy-za-doneczkym-sczenariyem-shho-zmushuye-rosiyan-pokirno-konservuvatysya-v-blyashanky/	2024-09-13T01:51:18-07:00

Forum for the development of EW: Ukrainian manufacturers presented the latest developments for the f...	The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine informs about this. Representatives of the Armed Forces, the Ministry of Defense, relevant ministries and companies producing EW systems took part in the event, which was launched in accordance with the decision of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -The direction of radio-electronic warfare is one of the priority tasks for the military today,- Lieutenant General Anatoliy Barhylevych, chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said in his speech via closed video conference. He added that we must do everything necessary to develop EW technologies as soon as possible, taking into account the range of use of its means by the enemy. According to the forum participants, it is important to speed up the development of samples, standardize and simplify the codification procedure. Scaling up the production of EW systems, training servicemen to use them effectively are the main tasks at the moment. -It is hard to imagine a battlefield without EW devices now,- noted the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Andriy Lebedenko. -In the realities of modern warfare, the number of hits by drones is on the same level as artillery.- The number of applications of UAVs is growing every month, as is the number of their modifications. Today, damage by drones reaches 60%. Therefore, the development of EW systems, their maximum efficiency and their supply to the troops in sufficient quantity is an issue that requires an urgent solution. Effective EW on the battlefield is, first of all, the preservation of the lives of Ukrainian soldiers, therefore the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine identified the development of EW systems as one of the key priorities. Currently, we have three ways of developing EW: improvement of existing weapons, introduction of EW equipment provided by foreign partners and introduction of qualitatively new EW equipment of our own production. Therefore, our goal today is to discuss all problems, hear from manufacturers, colleagues from the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, the Ministry of Strategic Industries of Ukraine and obtain effective algorithms for improving EW tools, - emphasized the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The head of the Department of Innovation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Vitaly Dobryansky, emphasized that the existing system of support for domestic manufacturers at the stages of development and codification of EW systems requires special attention. Currently, a system of testing the latest samples is organized and functioning. We are also forming experimental combat units to conduct such tests in combat conditions, the conclusions of which will greatly simplify the codification of products. According to Oleksandr Bornyakov, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine for IT Development, the number of samples of radio electronic warfare has now increased significantly. -We started with ten to fifteen developments, now we have about two hundred,- he emphasized. During the forum, manufacturers of electronic warfare systems had the opportunity not only to share their vision for the development of the industry, but also to present some of the latest developments. According to representatives of the manufacturing companies, all systems have been successfully tested and are currently working effectively at the front. As reported by ArmyInform, on the sidelines of the MSPO International Specialized Weapons Exhibition, which was recently held in Poland, -ugody-pro-spivpraczyu-v-sferi-ozbroyennya/->several measures aimed at strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities took place.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/forum-z-rozvytku-reb-ukrayinski-vyrobnyky-predstavyly-novitni-rozrobky-dlya-frontu/	2024-09-12T23:12:37-07:00

Enemy saboteurs in Sumy Oblast are detected by drones: what do the DRGs do?	told about this on the broadcast of the -Edyny Novy- marathon spokesman of the State Border Service of Ukraine Andrii Demchenko. — Although the activity has decreased, the enemy's subversive activities have not completely disappeared. Therefore, our soldiers continue to act actively and jointly together in order to expose the attempts of enemy sabotage and intelligence groups to enter with any purpose. For this, we use unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as other technical means of terrain control, he said. In general, the activity of Russian saboteurs in the border zone in the Sumy region has significantly decreased compared to previous periods before the start of the Kursk offensive operation. If earlier enemy saboteurs engaged in battle with Ukrainian defenders, tried to inflict fire damage or even capture positions, now they focused on attempts to detonate the area. -Saboteurs are trying to enter our territory, especially to take certain actions in order to mine the area, but not to engage in fire activity,- said Andriy Demchenko. He noted that the Russian DRGs are afraid of encountering active opposition from the units of the Defense Forces and that is why they have reduced their activity, avoid detection at all costs and have given up attempts to proactively enter the battle. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Defense Forces forced the enemy to practically abandon the use of DRG in Sumshchyna, therefore minuvanni-misczevosti/->Russian saboteurs on the northern border focused on mining the area. Instead, thanks to the Kursk operation, Ukrainian defenders are able to significantly strengthen border protection in Sumshchyna /a>.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/vorozhyh-dyversantiv-na-sumshhyni-vyyavlyayut-dronamy-chym-zajmayutsya-drg/	2024-09-12T22:54:55-07:00

propaganda -reflects- information about Kurshchyna: why is Bucha here?	The situation is especially cynicized by the fact that, in the case of the shops, the propagandists show footage of the soldiers of the Soviet Union engaged in their usual looting business - only not in Ukraine, but in their -native- Kursk region! At the same time, the representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Sakharova, calls on international structures -not to turn a blind eye to the terrorist acts of the Kyiv regime on the territory of the Russian Federation.- This tactic, typical of Russian propaganda, is called -mirroring.- Propagandists make the same accusations against Ukraine that we once made against Russia, in particular regarding the events in Buch. That is, they often do not even invent fakes, but simply copy news items from Ukrainian news. The average Russian who consumes this information willingly believes it, because he would have behaved the same way in a foreign country (which the Ukrainians were able to see many times) — he looted, shot, raped. Therefore, Sakharova's appeal to international structures is completely hopeless. After all, apart from unspoken accusations of crimes, the Russians cannot provide any evidence of illegal actions by the Armed Forces. It is Russia that systematically uses terrorist methods of warfare and violates international humanitarian law, while Ukraine protects its territory and citizens from the aggressor. Regarding the war crimes committed by the Russians in Ukraine, a significant evidence base has been collected, both Ukrainian and independent world media wrote about them and continue to write about them. Therefore, the Russians use -reflection- primarily to divert attention from their failure in Kurshchyna and the inevitable defeat in the war that they themselves started.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/rospropaganda-vidzerkalyuye-informacziyu-pro-kurshhynu-do-chogo-tut-bucha/	2024-09-12T20:22:16-07:00
Howitzer M101A1: the history of the gun — the record holder	This extraordinary howitzer certainly deserves a more detailed account. The correspondent of ArmiyaInform talked about it with Andriy Kharuk, a well-known weapons researcher, author of a personal profile art blog, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities of the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaydachny. The first part of the conversation was published by last week, and today we bring to your attention the second part of the conversation. — In addition to the modernization of the gun itself, as far as is known, the cartridges for it also underwent changes&#8230; — After the refusal in 1934 to use shrapnel in the ammunition of American 105-mm howitzers only two types of projectiles remained - high-explosive M1 with a mass of 14.97 kg and smoke. Already during the Second World War, an armor-piercing projectile, an aiming projectile (with colored smoke) and a cluster fragmentation projectile (used primarily in the Pacific theater of war) were adopted as weapons. The M1 projectile had two modifications - standard and -deep penetration- (with a reinforced case, but with a reduced charge mass). TNT or -composition B- - a mixture of TNT and RDX - was used for the equipment. The explosive mass for the standard projectile was 2.3 kg (for -composition B-) or 2.177 kg (for TNT); for a deep penetration projectile - 2.087 kg or 1.93 kg, respectively. The armor-piercing projectile weighed 13.25 kg and was equipped with a mixture of pentrite and TNT weighing 1.33 kg. The charge was profiled to form a cumulative jet. The initial speed of this projectile was 381 m/s. It could penetrate armor 102 mm thick at a distance of up to 1,800 m. Howitzer loading is semi-unitary (cases with charges were transported separately from shells, but were connected before loading). Seven variable shells were used for firing. — Mr. Professor, I ask you to clarify the marking system of this howitzer, because some informative sources create confusion in these markings. — In 1962, the M2A1 howitzer on the M2A1 carriage was given the designation M101 , and on the carriage M2A2 - M101A1. In both cases, barrels of two modifications could be used - M2A1 or M2A2, as well as anti-recoil devices of one of five modifications - from M2A1 to M2A5. Sights were improved and included: Elbow M16A1D telescopic sight for direct fire (3x magnification, 13° field of view); panoramic sight Panoramic M12A7S (4x magnification, field of view - 10°); quadrant M4A1. Ammunition, as before, consisted of semi-unitary shots, but their range was expanded and included the following types of shells: — This howitzer— no only an old-timer and a participant in many military campaigns, but also one of the record holders for the number of copies produced. - Mass production of howitzers at the Rock Island Arsenal continued until 1953, the total number of M2A1s produced was brought to 10,202 units. However, in the following years, the production of M101A1 howitzers was periodically renewed to fulfill export orders. The last such order (for 133 howitzers) was received in 1981 from Indonesia, the company fulfilled it by November 1983. —From the historical perspective and tactical and technical features, Andriy Ivanovych, let's focus on the direct service of this weapon. Which units of the US Army were they sent to? - In the late 1930s, the US Army began transitioning its infantry divisions to a new, -triangular- structure. The artillery of such a division was to consist of three divisions of 75-mm guns and one division of 105-mm howitzers (12 artillery systems in a division). Since there were no serial samples of 105-mm howitzers yet, the old 155-mm howitzers M1917 of the Schneider system were introduced in the division instead of these guns. Following the German Blitzkrieg in France, the US military decided to replace the 75 mm guns with 105 mm howitzers, leaving the division with a division of 155 mm howitzers - this was the organization of divisional artillery throughout World War II. — But, in addition to saturating each unit with specific guns, they needed to be managed successfully. How was this process organized? - An important innovation was the organization of a Fire Directio Center (FDC) in each division. It made it possible to focus the fire of the division on one target, and after it was hit, quickly transfer it to the next one. Central control equipment provided communication with batteries and forward artillery observers, as well as producing data for setting sights. In 1941, fire control centers also appeared at the division level. In 1937, the US Army had only 25 field artillery divisions. By December 1941 (the moment the United States entered the war), their number reached 142, and by 1945 exceeded 700. 264 of them had M2A1 howitzers: 161 divisions (147 as part of divisions and 14 separate) in the European Theater of War, 71 (respectively 62 and 9) in the Pacific and 32 in the US territory. In 1942, M2A1 howitzers appeared in the Marine Corps - one division of such guns was introduced into the divisional artillery regiments along with three divisions of 75-mm howitzers. By the beginning of the large amphibious operations on Saipan and Guam, the artillery regiments already had two divisions of 105-mm and 75-mm howitzers, and by the time of the landing on Iwo Jima in 1945, three and one, respectively. — As far as is known, during the Second World War this weaponry, along with others, was also prepared for export. How were these deliveries organized? - The main recipients of American aid under the Lend-Lease program - Great Britain and the USSR - did not show much interest in American artillery systems, making do with their own artillery systems. The USSR did not receive any such howitzers, the British were given only 16. The American howitzers were much more needed by China and Free France, which received 476 and 239 M2A1s, respectively. Another 223 units of these howitzers were transferred to a number of Latin American states that entered the war on the side of the Allies, but they were used in battle only by the Brazilians, who sent an infantry division to Italy that had three divisions of 105-mm howitzers. — And what was the fate of the use of these guns after the Second World War? — 105-mm howitzers were quite widely used during the Korean War, and on both sides of the front, both by the US and of the Republic of Korea, as well as parts of Chinese volunteers who fought on the side of the DPRK. The last campaign of the US Army in which the M101A1 howitzer was widely used was the Vietnam War. Their main task in this war was the direct support of infantry units, howitzers were relatively rare in divisions. Much more often, they were used in battery, underwater or even separate artillery installations. The use of howitzers of the 1st Division of the 7th Artillery Regiment as the armament of the LCM-6 landing craft became quite exotic. Later, AMMI pontoons mounted from standard sections were used as floating batteries. For two M101A1 howitzers, a pontoon measuring 27.45×8.66 m was used, on the edges of which ammunition storage was located, in the center - living quarters, and between it and the artillery bunkers - howitzer positions (all this was protected by armor sheets). Each battery had at its disposal three AMMI pontoons and five LCM-8 landing craft (three of them served as tugboats pushing pontoons, one as a fire control center, and another one carried additional ammunition). Since 1966, new 105-mm howitzers M102 began to arrive to replace the M101A1. The old systems were gradually transferred to the Allies until the end of 1969. South Vietnam received 730 M101A1 howitzers (only 60 of the new M102 systems were delivered). A year later, the South Vietnamese army had forty divisions of 105-mm howitzers (thirty in infantry divisions, seven separate and three airborne), as well as a hundred separate M101A1 platoons in fortified positions. Losses were also considerable, especially during the repulse of large-scale offensive operations. So, for the period from March 31 to April 10, 1972, 81 howitzers were lost. — Meanwhile, in the US Army itself, these guns were abandoned far from immediately. — In the US Army and Marine Corps, the M102 was never able to completely replace the old 105-millimeter guns. In 1983, the M101A1 took part in the last combat operation in the US Army — the invasion of Grenada. In 1985, the US Army had (mostly in the National Guard and Reserve) six M101 howitzers and 494 M101A1s. It wasn't until the 1990s that both the M101A1 and M102 were replaced by the new 105mm M119 howitzers. — During the so-called Cold War, the United States was an active supplier of its weapons to allies and partners. Surely, foreign armies were also interested in this proven weapon? — In the postwar years, American 105-mm howitzers entered the arms of the armies of several dozen countries — primarily NATO members (Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Turkey , Germany, France). Non-aligned Austria and Yugoslavia also received them, and after the collapse of the latter, newly independent states. In Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the M101A1 replaced the British-style 25-pounder. If in Australia and New Zealand the American howitzers have already been replaced by the licensed version of the English L118, then the Canadians in 1997 modernized their 105-mm howitzers (replacing the barrel with a longer, 33-caliber one) and under the C3 designation they keep a certain amount in spare parts. The basic version of the M101A1 was designated in Canada as C1 and was produced under license in the 1950s. In Latin America, the countries that did not operate American 105-mm howitzers are easier to think of: Costa Rica and Panama. In the rest of the states of the region (from Mexico in the north to Argentina in the south, as well as the islands of Haiti and the Dominican Republic), these howitzers are in service. Their number varies from country to country and ranges from a few units to several hundred (for example, Brazil has more than 250). In Africa, M101s are less common, but even in this region, you can name a good dozen countries that have received these systems. Ethiopia, Libya and Liberia received 105-mm howitzers as military aid from the United States, and Mozambique and some other states received them -inherited- from the colonialists. In the Middle East, M101 was used by both sides of the Israeli-Jordanian and Iranian-Iraqi conflicts, and was used in the armies of Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. American 105-millimeter guns are quite widespread in Indochina and the Far East (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Burma, the Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, Japan). In Japan and Taiwan, M101A1 howitzers were produced under license. In several countries, these howitzers have been modernized (for example, by turning into self-propelled guns, as in the Republic of Korea), but the modernization of the M101 is a topic for a separate story — Well, and a few words, Mr. Professor, about the present of these howitzers. — M101's career is gradually coming to an end. But even in the 21st century, this howitzer continues to serve to protect democracy. Ukraine received 18 such howitzers in September 2022. Their path to our Armed Forces was winding: the Americans at one time gave these howitzers to Denmark, and in 2002 they gave them to Lithuania, and twenty years later, the Lithuanians gave the M101A1 to Ukraine. The Ukrainian M101A1 made its combat debut in November 2022, and this howitzer was officially adopted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on August 28, 2023. 71 separate hunting brigades are known to use these systems. In one of its previous materials, ArmyInform told about the service of these guns in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and how they are evaluated by our garmaty.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/gaubyczya-m101a1-istoriya-garmaty-rekordsmenky/	2024-09-12T20:11:21-07:00
How many rockets are needed to bring down the Crimean bridge: an expert on air defense of the Russia...	Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmyInform about this. — Today, there is a question as to what the air defense of Crimea is in terms of cover by anti-aircraft missile systems. Indeed, at the moment it is much denser and better than the cover in Moscow, the military expert notes. According to him, almost all complexes are concentrated in Crimea, starting with a small radius of action, that is, for example, such as OSA, to the most modern S-300, S-400. And there is already confirmed information that their very rare S-500 complexes, of which there are 16 units in total, will be deployed there. This complex declares a target interception range of up to 600 kilometers at a speed of 3,000 meters per second - here we are talking about the target. Chernyk reminds that the speed of ATACMS missile is 1500 meters per second. — Why does the enemy act in this way? Because there is a problem with the Crimean Bridge. We are well aware that in order for the Crimean bridge to fall, it must be attacked by no less than 60-70 ballistic missiles. These are the same ATACMS. Or, let's say, now there is news that the development of our Ukrainian ballistic missiles of the Grom-2 type continues. In fact, there is nothing new here, but this work is ongoing, the expert adds. Chernyk says that there must be a large number of drones in this component: - And the total salvo for the bridge to really fall should be no less than 100-120 units of the appropriate equipment. the Russians are well aware that as soon as the bridge falls, Crimea will suffocate in terms of logistics. 90% of everything that is transported to Crimea is transported by rail. Petro Chernyk notes that it is becoming more and more difficult for the enemy to deliver (cargo. — Ed.) by barges. — Especially since we already have very good news that we even started sinking barges. Therefore, the enemy concentrated a huge amount of everything in the Crimea. At the same time, over the past six months, we have at least 5 cases of confirmation of the destruction of both the radar systems that provide the same S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems, as well as the destruction of the launchers themselves. And, so far, there is no confirmed information that the old ATACMS, which entered service in 1989, were successfully intercepted by the air defense system of the Russian Federation in Crimea, the expert emphasized. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/skilky-raket-potribno-shhob-upav-krymskyj-mist-ekspert-pro-protypovitryanu-oboronu-rf/	2024-09-12T20:00:52-07:00

Later, the application will be scaled to all Defense Forces. -A month ago, together with hundreds of guests, including from other countries, I watched with admiration for the first time how two servicemen created and approved the first electronic report in the history of Ukraine in two minutes. Today, two hundred thousand military personnel can use Army+ capabilities. More to come. Updates and new functionality, taking into account feedback and comments from military personnel. Army+ becomes an instrument of changes in the army, so that further these changes will be painfully felt by the enemy,- said Deputy Minister of Defense for Digitalization Kateryna Chernogorenko. Today, Army+ allows service members to generate a unique service member number called Army ID, create, submit and reconcile electronic reports and take surveys. The second survey on the use of combat systems in the military is currently underway. Servicemen can pass it until September 20. -A month has passed since Army+ has been working in the army. Its capabilities have already been evaluated by two hundred thousand military personnel. The application is implemented by more than 600 military units. I am grateful to all military personnel - from soldiers and commanders on the front line to clerks in headquarters - for organizing work with electronic reports and using modern tools that make us stronger and more effective than the enemy,- emphasized the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Colonel Andriy Lebedenko.

Cruise missiles -minimaly-: an American start-up offered the Pentagon a new ammunition	The startup Ares Industries, named after the Greek god of war, was only founded in May 2024. However, on the portal of the California startup center Y Combinator the other day there was posted a message that the engineers of this company have already started flight tests of compact and inexpensive cruise missiles from this manufacturer, ArmiyaInform reports. The missiles are being developed primarily for use against ships and will, according to Ares, be -ten times smaller and ten times cheaper- than any currently known model. Anti-ship missiles now weigh more than a ton and cost several million dollars each. Ares plans to sell its rockets for $300,000 per unit. Ares Industries details its developments in a release. The entire summer was spent building several prototypes and testing them in the Mojave Desert. As a result of these tests, the first batch is already being prepared for the delivery of operational missiles to customers, which is planned to be carried out by mid-2025. According to Ares representatives, cruise missiles should be compatible with existing launch platforms and move at a high subsonic speed (the speed of sound is about 1,200 km/h). Developers want to focus on land and ship options, that is, those that are launched from vehicles or warships. In the future, airborne versions and variants with a longer flight range will also appear. Ares does not provide any information about the range of the first version, only stating that it is several hundred miles (that is, no less than 322 kilometers). This California-based startup's rendering shows anti-ship missiles similar to Lockheed Martin's AGM-158C LRASM. Long-range anti-ship missiles (LRASM) have stealth characteristics. Individual cruise missiles can communicate with each other and use artificial intelligence to bypass air defense measures. Their range is 370 kilometers. The updated version, which is planned to be introduced by the US Navy in 2026, is expected to have a range of 950 kilometers. However, AGM-158C LRASMs are quite expensive. The price per unit is about $3 million.The US Navy and Air Force together want to buy more than 1,000 AGM-158Cs by 2030. Ares Industries believes that its anti-ship missiles could hypothetically be used against China in the Pacific Ocean. However, recent conflicts in the Middle East have shown that American weapons are too expensive. Current US anti-ship missiles are designed to attack destroyers. However, it makes no sense to attack smaller frigates or even drone boats with millions of dollars worth of remotely controlled weapons. In a possible conflict in the Pacific, the United States would launch thousands of anti-ship missiles a week, depleting the stockpile in days. -We cannot produce enough anti-ship missiles to counter China,- the company said. Another benefit of Ares Industries' approach is the ability to perform so-called saturation attacks. During such group attacks, the enemy's defense systems are suppressed by a huge number of missiles and drones. However, the weapons with which these attacks are carried out must be correspondingly cheap. And size plays a role, too. Warships have limited space in their missile launchers. For example, if an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer's Mk-41 launcher has room for 96 LRASM cruise missiles, it can at least theoretically carry and launch 960 smaller Ares missiles instead. Then a single destroyer could hit the enemy fleet with nearly a thousand anti-ship missiles. The goal is not only to cause material damage to the enemy. In the second wave of attacks, larger rounds and cruise missiles may be launched. They have a better chance of achieving their goal, because the air defenses are already weakened by Shahed drones or need to be reloaded with ammunition and anti-aircraft missiles, and therefore are not yet ready to repulse an enemy attack. The Pentagon's profile program also shows that the US wants to increase the production of small and cheap weapons. As part of this initiative, thousands of small unmanned autonomous drones will be developed by 2025 and will use artificial intelligence.

The enemy agent turned out to be a local IT specialist who worked for a staff member of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces (better known as Gru). On the instructions of the occupier, the suspect set up an -observation post- in his own apartment to covertly monitor the locations of the Defense Forces. To do this, the informant purchased and installed tactical binoculars with a high magnification, a rangefinder grid and a compass in the apartment of a multi-story building. With the help of specialized optics, the person involved hoped to detect the positions of air defense and Ukrainian artillery, in particular HIMARS rocket artillery systems. The attacker also tracked the routes of military convoys and the location of Defense Forces fortifications. He transmitted the information he received to his Russian curator through an anonymous chat in the messenger. According to the informant's coordinates, the occupiers planned to carry out a new series of missile and drone strikes on the front-line territory of the region. The security service exposed the enemy henchman early and detained him in his own apartment. Prior to that, comprehensive measures were taken to secure the locations of Ukrainian troops. During searches of the detainee's premises, optics and a mobile phone, which he used in his criminal activities, were seized. -Investigators of the Security Service informed him of the suspicion under Part 2 of Art. 114-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (unauthorized dissemination of information about the movement, movement or location of the Armed Forces with the possibility of their identification in the locality with the purpose of providing such information to the state that is carrying out armed aggression against Ukraine),- the message says.

To implement this task, the Ministry of Defense actively cooperates with international partners, in particular with the NATO Combat Trauma Committee (CoTCCC). The DOZ is studying the best practices of NATO member countries, initiating requests to the defense attaché at Ukrainian embassies regarding the quality standards of hemostatic tourniquets. On the basis of the received data, the department analyzed its own capabilities for the development of technical and functional requirements for mechanical products to stop bleeding. In addition, the Ministry of Defense has applied to the NATO Science &amp; Technology Organization to receive a grant to create a laboratory for testing and testing of tourniquets and first aid equipment. -Providing our army with modern, standardized medical equipment is at the top of our priorities. Our task is to make pre-medical care on the battlefield as effective as possible by adapting and implementing advanced international standards,- said Oksana Sukhorukova, head of the Health Department of the IOU. According to her, the development of requirements for turnstiles and their certification according to NATO standards is key to their strategy. -It's not just a procedure, it's about our commitment to providing every soldier with real-time, life-saving tools on the frontline,- she noted. Another important step was the adoption of order No. 436 dated June 29, 2024 -On approval of the Volumes of pre-medical care provided during hostilities and training of Security Forces and Defense Forces on a tactical basis.- According to it, the skill of using a tourniquet is mandatory at all levels of training in home care.

-Your family will leave you, son-: Russia throws conscripts into battle in the Kharkiv Region	This was reported by the spokesman of the operative-tactical group -Kharkiv-, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. The next step may be the start of a large-scale mobilization campaign in the Russian Federation. — The significant losses suffered by the enemy in the Kharkiv direction, more than ten thousand people only in our operational zone in four months, forced Russia to look for additional resources to continue the war. Russian legislation does not prohibit enlisting conscript soldiers for combat operations after they have completed four months of service, so it is possible to predict their appearance in other areas as well, he noted. According to the spokesman, this may indicate a lack of military personnel in Russian units, as a result of which the military command is forced to use less experienced soldiers for combat missions. Voyskovyi added that Russian propaganda had already warmed up society to such a development, tested its reaction, which predictably turned out to be zero, so the next steps should be expected - the start of a large-scale mobilization campaign in Russia. ArmyInform previously reported that in the Kharkiv region, Russia is fighting with poorly trained soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/rodyna-tyebya-brosit-synok-rosiya-kydaye-v-bij-strokovykiv-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-09-12T03:12:18-07:00

The head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs lied again: about what this time	This happened after participation in the Strategic Dialogue between the Russian Federation and the Cooperation Council of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation said: -We never wanted someone else's land. We wanted people who are part of the -Russian world- to be treated humanely. This absurd and false statement by Lavrov shows that the Russian government is generally detached from reality and lives in its own -bubble-. The whole world knows that the Russian Federation is an occupier and an invader. If Russia did not seek to seize someone else's land, then why did it change its own constitution to include six administrative-territorial units of Ukraine? Moreover, Russia cynically destroys precisely those regions where the Russian-speaking population mainly lived. According to the Office of the Prosecutor General, during the period of the large-scale invasion, as of September 10, almost 150,000 crimes of aggression and war crimes against the Russian Federation, more than 18,000 crimes against national security, and more than 2,000 crimes against children were registered. I wonder if, according to Lavrov's sick logic, after the liberation of part of the Kursk region, where the government of the Russian Federation refused to ensure the interests of its own citizens, Russia itself has the right to be territorially intact?	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/ochilnyk-mzs-rosiyi-znovu-zbrehav-pro-shho-czogo-razu/	2024-09-11T20:20:55-07:00
Leading cities and what will be new in the fall: how the recruiting campaign in Ukraine continues. I...	What are the most in-demand positions today? But in the end, do recruiting centers solve the problem of the lack of people in the army? ArmiyaInform asked about all this during a blitz interview with Oleksiy Bezhevets, the authorized representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on recruiting issues. — A few numbers: how many open recruiting centers do we have as of the beginning of September? What cities are in the plans? — The network is developing. We currently have 34 recruiting centers. Kraynaya was opened in Uman, before that there was Chernivtsi. There are, of course, plans to open new recruiting centers. As always, we do not announce the city: first we open, then we talk about it. But about 10 more such centers are in the process of preparation. Currently, we have literally a few regions left in Ukraine where centers are not yet present. And in all these regions, preparatory work is underway. Moreover, we are talking not only about regional centers, but also district ones, where the local authorities, in cooperation with us, have decided that it is advisable to do this. Therefore, by the end of October, at most in November, there will not be a single region of Ukraine without a Ukrainian army recruiting center. At the end of autumn, there will be at least 40 of them, as I can see from the dynamics at the moment. As for statistics, more than 16,000 people applied to recruiting centers as of the beginning of September. That is, all these people received counseling. Yes, there are a certain number of people who could not find vacancies for one reason or another: either quite specific requirements, or a specific profile of the corresponding candidate, which may not be suitable for military service, or some other specific characteristics. After all, the part determines whether the candidate is suitable for the vacant position and whether the part wants to see a person with the corresponding characteristics in him. Therefore, we are now simultaneously launching the process of reviewing the status of those candidates who have not been selected for vacancies, but who have taken the initiative and voluntarily decided to join the ranks of the Defense Forces. The goal: to work additionally with everyone who has expressed a desire, but has not yet been able to become a military serviceman. We also have an active communication campaign, which will now be intensified in various channels: outdoor advertising, additional online activities, etc. Information influence plays a role because coverage and communication with communities gives us an influx of new candidates interested in positions in the military. When these communication activities subside and new information waves roll in, people forget that there is such an opportunity and live in their information bubble. Our task is to enter this information bubble and tell people about the unique opportunity to choose a position and part on their own. And then help make a choice, don't miss the chance, because the mobilization processes are ongoing. —Which city shows the most effective result in the context of people's appeals to the recruiting center? — We have four such cities: Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia. By all indicators, these are the leaders, although there are also small cities, such as Shostka. This is a small town that has organized all these processes in a cool way, and they have great results. From the point of view of the efficiency of the centers even in small cities, this is already a definite plus, they perform their work, spending minimal resources and performing very important functions for the state. Yes, let even one recruiter work there. But if he recruits even 10 volunteers motivated to protect the Motherland of people, then this is already arch-class. And if there is already such an opportunity in a small community, and people have been helped, it is important. Because every person is a separate destiny. And we helped define and shape this destiny so that a person finds himself in the protection of the Motherland. —Which recruiting center and where was the most difficult to open from an organizational point of view? Is there resistance from local authorities in this process? And which region is the friendliest? We have wonderful people, and each region really has its own specifics (smiles. Ed.). Yes, there are nuances during the opening. Someone has different standards, approaches in work, business processes, communication culture, etc. Yes, in some places the processes were more complicated, in some - the processes went as quickly as possible. There are centers that we open literally within a week, and there are regions where preparation takes months. And it seems the same result, but the effort spent on this process is many times more. —What are your expectations-forecasts for the recruitment campaign of autumn 2024? — We continue to open centers, several per month. Maybe there will be an opening every week. Now we will see the dynamics in the degree of readiness. Up to 10 recruitment centers are planned to open in the next three months. We are also planning online activities at the same time: the process of creating a recruiting center in online mode is underway. This is a recruiting model where recruiters will proactively and exclusively online communicate with people and offer them certain vacancies in the Defense Forces. That is, we are talking about the proactive position of the center: we see a person who is looking for a job, his resume is posted on a website with vacancies. And we are the first to call and offer service in the Defense Forces and a position that is as close as possible to the position a person is looking for. Also, by the end of September, we plan to launch a hotline so that people can call, consult, voice complaints, etc. We hope to maintain the momentum in terms of volunteer requests in the fall, and it will only grow. We also want to provide physical support for candidates at all stages of registration to the ranks of the Defense Forces. We are currently discussing this with one of the recruiting centers of the Armed Forces centers. We are currently working out the details of how it should work and what it will look like. This is done so that the person is calm that there is a military man next to him, who will guide him -by the hand-, relatively speaking, through all the rooms, help with all the questions that have arisen: regarding VLK, processing documents, personal affairs, etc. And it will be a soldier -in the system- who communicates in the same language with other soldiers. We hope to launch such a service soon. Let's start with Kyiv and the region. In addition, we are preparing an approach to certain categories of people who, for example, are suitable for military service, but with certain restrictions. Such people now have the opportunity to join the service. And for such military personnel, we are developing a mechanism for creating a list of vacancies where, according to the law, they can serve, there are units that are ready to accept such people and ensure that these people actually return to military life. Such a separate initiative is also currently being developed. We will also go further in the future. Perhaps we will start with Kyiv: so that a person who decides to recruit can come to Kyiv, he will be provided with temporary housing and food while he solves organizational issues. And specialists will help her to complete documents at the TCC, and so that she can go to the training center to learn military affairs in a calm manner. In addition, the approval of changes in normative documents, Cabinet resolutions, which provide for the possibility of military units to directly register a recruit without the participation of the TCC, for the period of martial law, is currently ending. This is an exception in order to simplify the process of a person entering the army as much as possible. I hope that by the end of September these changes will be accepted and will come into force. —How many vacancies in the Defense Forces are we talking about as of the beginning of September? — According to our internal database, it is about 4,000 vacancies. Plus the online database on four online job search platforms — about 10,000 more. Yes, the mosaic of vacancies in the Defense Forces is huge. And a quality search gives a cool conversion: a person who applied and is eligible for military service can actually find a good job for himself. —Which professions/positions are currently the most in demand? — Every week there are spikes for certain positions. Yes, a large number of applications were, for example, for reconnaissance. There was a separate period when gunners were looking for positions. Always relevant - UAV operators. There is also a demand for staff positions, clerks, and the IT field. —Have there been cases when citizens turn to recruiting centers with the goal of signing a contract, rather than mobilizing? — Yes. Today, that ratio is roughly 40 to 60 or 60 to 40, and the figure fluctuates from month to month. —Do recruiting centers solve the problem of lack of people in the army? — Yes, there is a trend. The situation has improved significantly (in fact, since the end of spring) with the manning of military units. Yes, there are still not enough people, but the situation has improved. The role of recruiting centers in this is essential, because a large percentage of people who join the ranks of the Defense Forces every month are volunteers. These are thousands of people every month who used this new algorithm: took a letter of recommendation, found a part and went to serve there. And there are many such people. —How do young people react to recruiting centers? Your subjective observations. — If we take global statistics, then, unfortunately, we have the following indicators regarding the demographic situation: people who were born in the 90s or at the beginning of the 2000s are simply significantly less than those who who were born in the 70s, for example. But young people also turn to recruiting centers. We explain to them that they have the opportunity to conclude a contract for one year, they are not subject to mobilization, will have the opportunity to enter a higher military educational institution, receive the rank of officer, etc. It can be a ticket to life. Yes, young people are applying, and we perfectly understand that a lot needs to be done in this area, and a lot is already being done in this area. —Do women turn to recruiting centers— what is the trend? What positions are they looking for? Who are they in civilian life? - They apply, and there are a lot of them. In Sumy region, for example, a third of the candidates with whom work is being done on job selection are from women. One in three appeals is from a woman. And the potential is just huge. A woman in the army is not necessarily only a cook, a clerk, a lawyer or a journalist. In fact, there are no legal restrictions. A woman can also get professional training for almost any position in the army and perform her duties. A large number of units are very loyal and recruit women. Moreover, for different positions: snipers, UAV operators, medics. And Chernihiv region is also a regional leader in terms of the number of women applying to recruiting centers. —Portrait of a citizen of Ukraine who applies to a recruiting center,— what is he like? Each person is a separate universe. And to make the -average temperature in the room- would probably be wrong. I don't want to speculate (smiles. — Ed).

Two F-16s collided during a simulated battle, one pilot survived: from NATO history	The fatal incident occurred over the Greek island of Karpathos in the Aegean Sea in the context of the Aegean dispute, a conflict between two NATO member states over sovereignty and related rights in the Aegean Sea and the airspace above it. Reconstruction of a simulated dogfight between Greek and Turkish F-16s On 23 May 2006 around 12:40 local time, the Greek Air Force raised a pair of F-16 fighters to the interception of a pair of Turkish Air Force F-16s escorting an RF-4E Phantom reconnaissance aircraft over the Aegean Sea. The mission of the Turkish spy was most likely to photograph the S-300 air defense systems deployed on the island of Crete. Greek fighter pilots were ordered to intercept planes of the Turkish Air Force and to prevent them from approaching the coast of the island and taking aerial photographs of Greek objects. After the interception, Greek and Turkish fighter pilots resorted to a simulated aerial battle. The pilots of both countries strove to win by recording a conditional defeat of the enemy with the help of instruments. Maneuvering in dangerous proximity to each other, the Greek and Turkish fighter jets collided at an altitude of about 8,000 meters above sea level at a distance of 12 miles from the coast of the island of Karpathos. By <a target=-_blank- rel=-nofollow- href=-https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030232/http:/vasington.be.mfa.gov.tr/ShowAnnouncement.aspx?ID=115955 According to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a Greek fighter jet attacked a Turkish F-16 from behind and below, which led to a collision between the two planes. The impact caused an explosion that was devastating to both air machines. The collision was witnessed by the crew of Egyptian Airlines flight 797 from Cairo to Vienna, whose pilot informed the control center in Athens that during the flight at an altitude of about 10,000 meters above sea level, he saw a flash about 600 meters below his plane. The rescue missions of both countries immediately went to the scene of the plane crash, hoping that both pilots managed to eject. Greek Super Puma and Turkish Cougar search and rescue helicopters participated in the rescue mission. However, only one of the two pilots was able to eject successfully - Turkish Air Force Lieutenant Halil Ibrahim Ozdemir. He was lucky the second time when he was accidentally spotted by sailors in the merchant navy. At a distance of about 100 miles from the Turkish coast, it was picked up by the Panamanian merchant ship Gas Century of the Japanese company Yamamaru. Greek Air Force pilot Konstantinos Iliakis did not manage to save himself - as a result of the impact, the cockpit of his F-16 was destroyed, so he could not eject normally. The search for the Greek pilot turned out to be fruitless. The sailors of the frigate Λήμνος managed to find only the Greek pilot's helmet and a survival kit with Greek markings. According to Greek media reports, Konstantinos Iliakis was one of the most experienced F-16 pilots who was trained in the US and had many flight hours. The incident caused a major crisis and led to heightened tensions between official Athens and Ankara, with the Greek and Turkish sides traditionally blaming each other for the disaster. In the end, Greece and Turkey toned down accusatory rhetoric and defused the conflict, but failed to settle it. Despite the fact that both countries are part of the North Atlantic Alliance, their disputes in the Mediterranean continue. To date, the Turkish-Greek conflict is the only one in which F-16s have suffered officially confirmed air combat losses. In addition to the May 23, 2006 crash, there were other incidents over the Aegean Sea that resulted in the downing of these fighters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/dva-f-16-zitknulys-pid-chas-imitacziyi-boyu-vyzhyv-odyn-pilot-z-istoriyi-nato/	2024-09-11T20:00:11-07:00

Rustem Umyerov: Our goal is to return every piece of Ukrainian land, including Crimea	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported this. -For me, this is not just a business meeting or an opportunity to communicate with international partners. This is my personal struggle. Crimea is my home, and every day I, like millions of Ukrainians, feel the pain of the Russian occupation for my state and for our people on the peninsula,- said Rustem Umyerov.

Without training and motivation: in the Kharkiv region, Russia is fighting with poorly trained soldi...	Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, announced this on the air of the nationwide telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — This is a newly arrived personnel recruited by Russia — an existing mobilization resource has been raised. It is not yet known for sure who it is. These may be some ex-prisoners or representatives of foreign countries. In particular, there used to be people from Central Asia, Africa or the Middle East, he said. The spokesman noted that the Russian soldiers transferred to the Kharkiv direction have a low level of training and refuse to perform the assigned tasks. -Over the past few days or even weeks, we have already repeatedly noted cases of refusal of personnel - both in the direction of deep Lypka and in the Vovchansky direction - from carrying out combat and special tasks,- Vitaly Sarantsev recalled. The military officer said that cases of refusals have already been recorded and are becoming more and more frequent even in those brigades of the Russian army that arrived relatively recently in the Kharkiv direction. — A few weeks ago, the rotation of the 136th motorized rifle brigade, which took up positions near Vovchansk in the area of ​​the Tykh point itself, ended. They replaced the 82nd Airborne Assault Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, which suffered heavy losses and was withdrawn to recovery. This 136th brigade came in and stood still for several weeks. They tried to carry out intelligence activities, and equipped sabotage-reconnaissance groups, and tried to storm our positions head-on. Now they have also suffered losses, and as of yesterday - the day before yesterday, we have information that the servicemen of this brigade, which arrived in our direction not so long ago, are also refusing to perform combat and special tasks, he said. The spokesman explained that the special tasks include the establishment and provision of logistics and fortification equipment for positions. — This indicates that the enemy is more and more often in practically all directions using personnel who are not morally ready to perform any tasks. That is, they raise the mobilization resource, prepare it very hastily. Whether by deception, coercion, or in some other way, using promises of monetary rewards to be sent to war. But people understand that they were simply deceived and simply refuse to go into battle any further, said Vitaly Sarantsev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the north of Kharkiv region, the occupiers throw soldiers into battle less than a month after signing the contract and without any preparation, as a result enemy stormtroopers are sabotaging the orders of the command and in whole groups refuse to carry out the assigned tasks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/bez-pidgotovky-i-motyvacziyi-na-harkivshhyni-rosiya-voyuye-pogano-navchenymy-soldatamy/	2024-09-11T10:36:36-07:00

He ordered to capture -Kharkiv in 5 days-: -a hero of Russia- was informed about the suspicion	The Security Service of Ukraine informed about this. The suspect is Lieutenant General Konstantin Stepanishchev, deputy commander of the 6th Combined Arms Army of the Western Military District of the Russian Federation. The military designed and tried to implement an operation to capture Kharkiv by the end of February 2022. According to Stepanishchev's plan, the units of the ground troops subordinate to him were to surround the city and take it -in a ring- in 5 days. For this, assault groups of Russian troops were to cover Russian fighters, and Iskander ballistic missiles were to attack the civilian infrastructure of the regional center. In addition, during the fighting, a special-purpose group of military intelligence of the Russian Federation (known as GRU) tried to infiltrate Kharkiv to capture the local administration building and raise the Russian flag there. In the event of the capture of the city, Stepanishchev planned to order subordinate units to take control of all administrative and strategic objects of the city and to initiate a full range of isolation and filtration measures against Kharkiv residents. In Office of the Prosecutor General and The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office also noted that during the invasion units under Stepanishchev gradually occupied settlements from the state border to the suburbs in order to have advantageous firing positions for shelling the regional center The law enforcement officers also established that in 2014 he took part in hostilities against Ukrainian troops in the Luhansk region. Then he commanded the 4th separate motorized rifle brigade of the armed forces of the Russian Federation. Later, he was promoted to the rank of general, given a new position, a -Hero of Russia- star, and also an order to prepare for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Earlier, ArmiyaInform reported that law enforcement officers completed the investigation into the Russian serviceman who tortured a resident of Kyiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/nakazuvav-zahopyty-harkiv-za-5-dniv-geroyu-rosiyi-povidomyly-pro-pidozru/	2024-09-11T09:03:06-07:00

Digitization of the provision of the Armed Forces: the DOT presented the innovative DOT-Chain system	-If earlier the term of delivery of products could be up to two months, after the introduction of DOT-Chain, this term should be reduced by approximately four times,- said Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. -The digitization of procurement processes in defense is a strategic step in increasing the efficiency of supplies of all necessary military equipment.- -DOT-Shain is another important step towards a military that values ​​people, time and efficient processes instead of filling out hundreds of papers. Thanks to this system, the procurement of products will become clearer and more transparent, and the possibility of expanding it to other products will significantly simplify the logistics processes in the Defense Forces,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Digital Development, Digital Transformations and Digitalization. The creation of DOT-Chain has become the largest digital project in DOT. A team of IT specialists of the State Rear Operator worked on the development. -We were faced with the task of changing the old system so that the non-lethal support of the Armed Forces was more effective. Currently, DOT-Chain functionality extends to food. The DOT IT team has digitized the entire procurement process, from submitting product applications to issuing invoices and documents. In the future, the system can be quickly scaled to cover other categories of goods,- said Alyona Zhuzha, IT adviser of the DOT. 1. Digitized paper documents to optimize the work of the military. This is an important step towards abandoning the -paper army-. Instead of 30 thousand paperwork that the military had to process every week is now just a few clicks into the system. This significantly reduces the amount of work of salespeople. 2. Simplified the process of paying for goods. It will be four times faster, because expense invoices are immediately uploaded to the system, and DOT, having signatures from the military unit and the supplier, can immediately pay for the shipment. 3. Optimized data exchange. Information from the system is used, in particular, by the Ministry of Defense. This allows the military to adjust its needs according to the data aggregated by DOT-Chain: the number of requests, supply information, and the amounts accepted or not accepted by military units. 4. Adjusted the interaction between the parties involved in the process of providing the Armed Forces. In the DOT-Chain system, all procurement and supply documents are visible for each request. In fact, DOT becomes a third party that takes care of both procurement and suppliers and can quickly respond to changing requests from military units. State rear operator (DOT) is a procurement agency under the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, which provides the rear needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: food, property, fuel and lubricants. As reported by ArmiyaInform, a new model of food supply for the Armed Forces presented by the Procurement Agency of the Ministry of Defense -State Rear Operator-. As a pilot project, it will be operational in several regions of Ukraine as early as 2025.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/czyfrovizacziya-zabezpechennya-zbrojnyh-syl-dot-prezentuvav-innovaczijnu-systemu-dot-chain/	2024-09-11T03:38:08-07:00

From the contract to the front line — 20 days: whom the Russians throw into battle externally	The personnel of the occupiers involved in the hostilities characterized on the air of the telethon -Social News- by the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU Vitaly Sarantsev. — Among the Russian servicemen there are also former prisoners who were dragged into this war under coercion or deception. There are representatives of foreign countries. There are actually different sections of the population, he said. Russians also use propaganda and coercion to force residents of temporarily occupied territories to join the invading forces. The motivation of such soldiers is extremely low. — These people are not motivated, and in connection with this, we note the numerous refusals of personnel of the armed forces of the Russian Federation to perform tasks. This happens both on the Hlyboke-Lyptsi route and on other routes, in particular in the area of ​​the settlement of Tyche. The 136th separate motorized rifle brigade recently entered there. They started to perform tasks just a few weeks ago, but we are already seeing numerous refusals of personnel to perform both combat missions and special missions, the spokesman said. The occupiers refuse not only to storm the positions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, but also to perform tasks related to the adjustment and provision of logistics or the arrangement of fortifications. — This indicates that the Russians are gradually losing their offensive potential and they are forced to use anyone and any personnel in order to continue pushing into this war started by Russia, — explained Vitaly Sarantsev. At the same time, he noted that the enemy is actively replenishing not only tactical, but also operational and strategic reserves, paying the necessary attention to comprehensive training of servicemen. — Attention will be paid there to both combat training of personnel and, as they call it, military-political and ideological training. Therefore, we are not relaxing, we understand that, sooner or later, the enemy can supplement its current set of personnel with more trained military personnel, the military officer emphasized. Currently, the enemy does not feel the lack of personnel in the Kharkiv direction. — The forces and means that he currently maintains in our direction are sufficient for the enemy to continue to carry out active actions, to carry out offensive actions, to carry out assaults, to carry out sabotage and reconnaissance activities in non-attacked areas of the Russian-Ukrainian border with the aim of destabilizing the situation, with the purpose of carrying out intelligence tasks, Vitaliy Sarantsev reported. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast, enemy attack aircraft are sabotaging the orders of the command in whole groups and refusing to carry out their tasks, and also showed a video with captured fighters of the -Charter- brigade of the NGU by the Russian military, who said that signed a contract for military service on August 23 of this year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/vid-kontraktu-do-peredovoyi-20-dniv-kogo-rosiyany-kydayut-u-bij-eksternom/	2024-09-11T02:40:58-07:00

The cornerstone of this activity was the constant informing of Ukrainians about our plans for evacuation corridors, prompt notification of important changes in their work patterns, and stories about how everything works. We spoke frankly about existing problems and tried to keep people in feedback. This time reformatted the ministry into a professional humanitarian rapid response team.

Such training is also part of the psychological preparation of servicemen for unexpected developments and unusual maneuvers. Tankists talk enthusiastically about German combat vehicles. -They are much more effective in their work than Soviet tanks. Maneuverable, easier to control and very fast,- says a tank operator with the call sign -Tourist-. These German tanks were handed over by Norway, which is part of the international tank coalition. All the crews in the brigade since the beginning of its formation have undergone training abroad and already have significant combat experience.

Marriage in Action: how to get married online as a military man	The service can be used by all citizens of Ukraine, but this opportunity can be most useful for military personnel. Military vacations are quite difficult to predict, so it is difficult to think everything through in advance and organize an ordinary wedding. And the new service allows you to make friends even while on the front line. Basically, it's a marriage in a few clicks. Only internet is required&#8230; and, of course, the consent of the other half. ArmyInform tells how to marry a military man online. The new service even allows you to make an offer through Diya. The partner will receive a notification to which they must respond within 14 days. In particular, you need to go to -services- in Actions. Select -marriage online- and -Make a proposal- item. The system will offer to send this offer to a messenger convenient for your partner. However, such an offer is not binding. But it is not mandatory. If you made an offer in another way, you can apply for marriage registration right away in Diya. In Services, you need to find the -Marriage online- section and select the -marriage application- section. Someone alone must submit an application and indicate a partner in it. The latter must confirm the submission of such an application. When this happens, you will receive a notification. Read it and click -continue-. Next, you need to choose the date and time of the ceremony. Action will notify when the DRATSS confirms this date. Also, in Diya, you can decide what to do with your surname after the wedding: keep your own, take your partner's surname or make it double. Then you and your partner need to confirm the marriage registration application, sign with an electronic signature and pay the administration fee. On the day of the ceremony, Diya will send a reminder about the start of the video conference. On the wedding day, you just need to go to Diya and follow the link to join the online ceremony. An employee of the digital DRATSS will be waiting there. The ceremony lasts up to 30 minutes. The digital marriage registration certificate will be automatically activated within a day. You can also order a physical document by Ukrposhta delivery or pick it up at the branch. By the way, a wedding can be a reason for an additional 10 days of vacation. How to apply for family leave, read here . There are also certain requirements for registering a marriage in Diya. We will remind, previously Ukrainians had the opportunity to submit an online application for marriage registration. But the ceremony itself was still supposed to take place in DRACE. The only exception was military personnel. A simplified procedure was developed for them, which made it possible to get married remotely. That is, without the presence of the bride or groom. This procedure is valid even now, so a few words about it. What is needed? To submit an application to your immediate commander, in which to indicate information about yourself and your significant other - surname, first name and patronymic, date of birth, citizenship and chosen surname, if you wish to change it. Next, the commander must send an application to the DRATS to which the serviceman submitted the application. The fact of marriage registration is certified by an act, which is drawn up without the physical presence of one or both brides and grooms. However, they must be currently connected to the video procedure. The deed record of marriage is drawn up on the day of receipt of the application for the registration of a marriage or deed by the DRATSS department. This option also remains valid, but the new service in Diya greatly simplifies the whole procedure. As reported by ArmiyaInform, during the beta testing of the service the first , who married in this way, was a military serviceman.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/shlyub-u-diyi-yak-vijskovomu-odruzhytysya-onlajn/	2024-09-10T20:12:29-07:00
How the world helps Ukraine with the treatment and rehabilitation of wounded soldiers	Vadym Svyridenko, the adviser to the President of Ukraine on issues of rehabilitation of combatants, told about this during an interview with ArmiyaInform. — After the return of the fighters, we ask for their feedback: how do they like the prostheses, how was the rehabilitation, what did they learn there. And I am very glad that our rehabilitation and prosthetics are not behind in the world. And partner countries are already contacting us, interested in our experience. Because our military, like no one else in the world, faces such combat injuries. And we know what it is and how to deal with it. That is why specialists, for example, surgeons from Canada or America, are already coming to us. They, among other things, helped perform operations for facial injuries, says Vadym Svyridenko. We tell you more about how partner countries help our wounded defenders to recover their health and return to action. This country has an extensive network of cities and institutions where Ukrainian servicemen undergo treatment and rehabilitation. As of January 2024, 1,044 victims, including 735 military personnel, were evacuated to Germany. Also, 125 children with oncological diseases are being treated in the Federal Republic of Germany. In particular, the -Sharite- clinic accepts Ukrainians for treatment - military personnel with severe burns and mine-explosive injuries as a result of Russian military aggression are also treated here. In April 2024, another 13 Ukrainian defenders with amputations left Kyiv for Berlin. In a German military hospital, they are to be fitted with innovative prostheses. In general, German specialists expressed their readiness to provide prosthetics to 60 Ukrainian military personnel in Berlin. Our servicemen are also treated and rehabilitated in the city of Wiesbaden - here they have the opportunity to fully recover and receive the highest level of care. Poland has been helping with military rehabilitation since 2014. Ukrainian soldiers, in particular, are patients of the -Good Brother- rehabilitation and recreation center. In this institution, they can undergo a course of rehabilitation and recovery. Several hundred soldiers have already taken advantage of this opportunity. -Despite the fact that my right leg is completely iron, and the left one is missing about 75% of tendons and 50% of muscles, Polish rehabilitators taught me how to properly control my body. And not only did I return to a more or less normal life, but I even performed tasks in the area where the OOS was held,- Lt. Col. Ihor Chuprun, who underwent rehabilitation in Poland, recalled at one time. Already after the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the assistance of the Republic of Poland in matters of rehabilitation and treatment of military personnel only increased. In particular, Poland offered Ukraine to provide treatment and rehabilitation to 2,500 wounded Ukrainian servicemen. In addition, at the Military Medical Institute in Warsaw, Ukrainian specialists are trained in the field of rehabilitation of the wounded, as well as diagnosis and treatment of people who have suffered war injuries. Here, they improve their knowledge of accompanying patients during rehabilitation and modern methods of prosthetics. In Spain, there is a whole program of treatment and rehabilitation of Ukrainian servicemen and veterans who were injured in the war. In addition, this country also helps in the organization of recreation for Ukrainian children affected by the war. The country -stepped in- in aid from the first days of a full-scale invasion. In particular, wounded Ukrainian border guards (about 30 servicemen) who were wounded in 2022 in the first days of the enemy's invasion were treated in Spain. Our defenders also receive rehabilitation and treatment in the military hospital of the city of Zaragoza. This Orad y Gajías General Defense Hospital is one of two controlled by the Spanish Ministry of Defense. And he started receiving our fighters as early as 2022. The Netherlands also operates a rehabilitation program for Ukrainian military personnel. More than one group of servicemen used it. And in the Netherlands, Ukrainian military personnel undergoing rehabilitation and volunteers assemble drones for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Volunteers look for funding and order parts, while the military assembles the drones. Professional instructors help beginners. The finished device is thoroughly tested before being sent to Ukraine. From June 2022, the French Ministry of Defense will organize assistance to the Ukrainian wounded. One of the facilities that contributes to the treatment and rehabilitation of our soldiers in France is Percy Hospital. In March 2024, it was known that wounded army personnel were being taken to French civilian and military hospitals in the Paris region and Grand Est. As of spring 2024, there were more than two dozen groups of Ukrainian military personnel who arrived in France for treatment. Back in 2018, Bulgaria launched a two-year rehabilitation program for soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who were wounded, injured and maimed during hostilities in eastern Ukraine. In addition, Bulgaria had the status of a leading country within the NATO Trust Fund project in the field of medical rehabilitation in Ukraine. Our wounded defenders are receiving rehabilitation services at Kaleroya Military Medical Hospital in Hisar. Indications for physiotherapy in Kaleroya are injuries of the musculoskeletal system, injuries of the peripheral nervous system of the upper and lower extremities. And in 2020, the Project of Medical Rehabilitation of Ukrainian Veterans in Bulgaria was launched. Wounded Ukrainian military personnel (both those undergoing military service and those on reserve/retirement) and civilian personnel of the security and defense sector were sent for treatment. Expenses related to the procedures and accommodation of persons in the clinic were provided by the Bulgarian side, and international and local transportation, medical insurance and food for this period were provided by the NATO Trust Fund in Ukraine in the field of medical rehabilitation. The Baltic countries are friendly to Ukraine and our wounded defenders. For example, in April 2024, Lithuania started a special program for the rehabilitation of the Ukrainian military - about 15 million euros were allocated to Ukraine. These funds should be directed directly to the reconstruction of hospitals and the training of specialists. And the Latvian Support Fund for Ukraine, founded in 2014, collects donations for the treatment and rehabilitation of wounded Ukrainian servicemen, is an intermediary between the state, Latvian clinics and Ukrainian wounded who need help. Thus, as of the end of August 2024, more than 540 Ukrainian servicemen who were wounded in the war with the Russian Federation were treated in Latvia. At the beginning of June, the government allocated 184,000 euros for the rehabilitation of the soldiers of the Armed Forces. Estonia is not lagging behind - as of June 2024, it was known that more than 240 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine had already completed a rehabilitation course in Estonia. America supported Ukrainian wounded defenders even before the large-scale Russian invasion. For example, in 2019, the US government allocated about 5 million dollars and accepted 10 seriously wounded Ukrainian servicemen for treatment. For this purpose, the Americans have identified 10 hospitals that will receive Ukrainian servicemen for free treatment. It was then known that the average cost of treating one, as Americans calculated, is half a million dollars. And in December 2022, in New York, just in time for the Day of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the House of Heroes was opened for the rehabilitation and prosthetics of Ukrainian soldiers who lost their limbs during the war. The house is located in the Staten Island area, not far from the ocean. Oleksandr Rubtsov, head of the charity organization Kind Deeds, who owns a real estate company, implements the rehabilitation program for the wounded. According to him, he rented a house for this purpose and is accumulating donor funds for the further rehabilitation of Ukrainian soldiers. In addition, American specialists come to Ukraine and help in the treatment of our military. So, in 2023, American microsurgeons operated on wounded soldiers in Uzhhorod. According to Andrii Novak Transcarpathian Regional Clinical Hospital, this is the second visit of microsurgeons from the USA. During the visit, American doctors performed 7 operations on military personnel: it is about eliminating post-traumatic defects of bones and soft tissues of arms and legs. Canada is also helping our wounded defenders get stronger and healthier. Thus, in 2023, Ukraine and Canada signed an agreement on medical partnership in the field of mental health and military rehabilitation. According to this document, the Ukrainian Center for Mental Health and Rehabilitation -Lisova Polyana- has a sister company, the -Atlas- Institute of Veterans and Their Families. Both medical institutions specialize in the field of mental recovery and military rehabilitation. But this country helped our wounded even before the large-scale invasion. For example, in 2019, a project on the rehabilitation of patients with severe neurotraumas was implemented in the Rivne Region with the participation of Canadian specialists. And the Canadian instructors from the UNIFAIR training mission, who teach the Ukrainian military to provide first aid in case of wounds and injuries, have already become a familiar story for us.

It is noted that the detainees were residents of Vinnytsia and Ivano-Frankivsk regions. A 60-year-old resident of Nizhnya Apsha in Transcarpathia drove them to the river in his vehicle.

The IOU and NATO delegations discussed speeding up the promised aid to Ukraine from the allies	About this informs September 10 Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. NATO Assistant Secretary General for Operations Thomas Hoffus and the new head of the NATO Representation in Ukraine Patrick Turner visited the capital. The main topics of discussion were the need for progress on interoperability with NATO and the acceleration of promised aid from allies. The proposal discussed the use of Ukrainian suppliers and manufacturers to speed up the supply of property and support the economy of Ukraine. -We are glad to welcome you to Ukraine, which demonstrates your involvement and interest in our victory. But we have to raise the issue of the fulfillment of promises and the operational logistics of helping our military,- said Oleksandr Balanutsa, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for European Integration. He emphasized that what was promised for September should be in Ukraine in September. Sticking to schedules is important on the battlefield. The parties discussed the implementation of a number of joint projects with NATO - NATO's initiative to support Ukraine in security issues and NSATU training, the Joint Center for Analysis, Training and Education (JATEC) and the implementation of projects of the NATO agency for support and supply of NSPA. The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Stanislav Heyder, thanked for all the assistance provided by NATO to Ukraine. He also called for speeding up the implementation of projects within NSPA. -Unfortunately, the speed of implementation of NSPA projects, if we are not talking about fuel and turnstiles, remains at an extremely low level,- said Stanislav Heyder. NATO Assistant Secretary General for Operations, Thomas Hoffus, also introduced the new head of the NATO Representation in Ukraine, Patrick Turner, and once again assured of unwavering support for Ukraine. -We want close cooperation to increase the level of compatibility, progress and Ukraine's entry into NATO. Ready to act more actively from our side in matters of assistance from allies and consultations where necessary,- assured Patrick Turner. The NATO delegation was briefed on the operational situation on the battlefield, needs and intelligence data on the enemy, to which Ukraine should respond asymmetrically.

As much as I fight, there is not a single fragment in me - the story of the soldier Fartovoy, who fo...	About the soldier was told on September 10 Armed forces. Such a call sign was given to him by a sergeant, also a marine, at the training center. The military man says that at that time there was no special reason for the call sign -Fartovy-. However, the nickname did become prophetic. The boy signed a contract with the army at the age of 22. It was January 2023. Fartovy shared a video from this -celebration-, when his brothers greeted him just in the positions. The guy was prompted to sign the contract by a video from TikTok. -I watched the video of the Third Assault. The boys are having a good time like this. I wanted too. This is their form, the ARKs&#8230; But, in fact, it turned out to be a completely different story in the army: -kalash- and -pixel- uniform, - smiles Fartovy. The soldier reinforced the status of a forward in battle: -As much as I fight, there is not a single fragment in me. A few contusions only, but that's it. I think I have this fart just because of the call sign. Near Urozhany, when a shell flew into the trenches, there was a boy near me, 200, and I just had a severe contusion. Then there was a direct hit into the trench. Well, there was a drop from a drone in Krynky. Two meters in front of me. Everyone around has 300, but I have nothing,- said Fartovy. For -Fartovy- month, he underwent basic military training at the training center. After that, he joined the ranks of the 505th OBMP. Already in the battalion, he studied for another three months and went through combat training: he practiced shooting at the range, learned the tactics of fighting from his more experienced comrades. After completing the training, as the commander of the grenade launcher unit, -Fartovoy- was sent to the Donetsk direction. Subsequently, he fought in the Zaporozhye direction and again returned to the Donetsk direction. And then there was the most difficult aspect of the front for -Fartovoy- among all the places he visited - Krynka. -The worst thing there is the forest. Because when you go and storm the landing, you have 12 enemies, well, at most, one or two of them can jump out somewhere in the field, and in Krynky, you go into the forest and they can run out from any side. Because of that, it was much harder there. Well, they had a lot of equipment there. Tanks, armored personnel carriers were rolling out on us&#8230; They had a lot of equipment there. But a lot of their equipment was stolen there by our FPV-schneiders,- recalls Fartovyi. Currently, -Fartovoy- performs the duties of chief sergeant of the fire support company. In order to enter the position fully, he still has sergeant courses ahead of him. At the same time, the soldier trains new arrivals to the battalion of fighters in the internal training center. ArmyInform told the story of a fighter who, despite the decision of the VLK, remained in the DSHV. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/skilky-voyuyu-zhodnogo-ulamka-v-meni-nemaye-istoriya-bijczi-fartovogo-yakyj-72-dni-byvsya-u-krynkah/	2024-09-10T09:37:37-07:00
The 12th Banderiv Readings will be held in Kyiv. ArmyInform is a media partner	This was reported by the organizer of the readings, sergeant of the fire support company of the 5th separate assault regiment, director of the USSD National Center Yuriy -Mamai- Syrotyuk. -During the conference, it is planned to revive the destroyed, erased and forbidden history of the long-standing resistance to Moscow imperialism of the peoples enslaved by Russia. Each people, nation, on whose land the Moscow occupier came, did some part of the more than a century of resistance to the Moscow empire. For centuries, Moscow destroyed the disobedient, encouraged traitors, and rewrote history. The time has come for every people in this prison of nations to find out -who they are, by whom, for what they are imprisoned- and to make their own decision - whether to die in Russian captivity, being a blind tool in the hands of the Kremlin, powerless on their land, deprived of language, history, identity, or to remember the glory of their ancestors and to fight for freedom,- noted Yuriy Syrotyuk. The Russian-Ukrainian war opened up a unique opportunity for peoples enslaved by Russia to throw off the yoke of Moscow colonialism and imperialism, and finally become the masters of their own destiny on their own land. The organizers of the 12th Banderiv readings invite researchers of Russian colonialism and the struggle against it, as well as active representatives of national liberation formations of peoples enslaved by Russia, to participate in the conference. The second panel will be dedicated to the actual prospects of the national liberation struggle. Based on the results of the readings, an electronic version of the participants' speeches will be prepared. As part of the XII Banderiv readings, it is traditionally planned to hold a Youth Essay Competition on the specified topic. In addition, on the eve of the event, the book -Involuntary Accession: The History of the Liberation Struggle of Peoples Enslaved by Russia- will be published in Ukrainian, English and an electronic version in the language of the occupiers. The media partner of -Banderivskyi readings- is the -ArmiyaInform- information agency. The Bander Readings project was founded in 2014 at the height of the Revolution of Dignity as an intellectual discussion of Bander's ideas and the creation of a vision of the Ukrainian state. It traditionally takes place in the first days of February at the time of the creation of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in 1929 as a movement that set the goal of establishing an independent Ukrainian cathedral state, its preservation and development. Past 11th Bander readings -The Liquidation of the Russian Empire- were held on February 10, 2024. It was possible to hold the conference in a new format and to publish the book -Liquidation of the Russian Empire- in English and Ukrainian, which has already been printed in three editions and has become a notable phenomenon among research on this topic. More details about the terms of participation and the possibility to support the project are available on the organizers' page.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/u-kyyevi-vidbudutsya-xii-banderivski-chytannya-armiyainform-mediapartner/	2024-09-10T09:17:49-07:00

He held the defense of a semi-surrounded position for nine days - the story of a paratrooper and a f...	The soldier's story was made public on September 10 by the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -I commanded a combat position that was semi-surrounded for nine days. Every day we repulsed several assaults of enemy infantry, which climbed on us as if possessed. To say that it was difficult then is an understatement,- recalls Serhiy. During that situation, several of his subordinates were wounded, and he himself received a concussion. However, despite this, and artillery and mortar shelling, which practically did not subside, and drops from enemy drones, the paratroopers did not leave their position, waiting for help. The brave soldier says that one of those days he was very surprised by a Russian who tried to storm the paratroopers in a slightly strange way. -A man in a black Adidas tracksuit, wearing sneakers and armed with a machine gun ran towards us. There was no helmet, no bulletproof vest, no first-aid kit, no other military equipment on him,- Serhiy is surprised. The Ukrainian paratroopers then decided that in this way, the Russian was trying to make it easier for himself to advance to their positions. But the soldiers did not have time to think for a long time, why he decided that it would help him. Therefore, they destroyed this -experimental athlete- with accurate fire. As well as other enemy fighters who climbed into their positions. Serhii notes that participation in active combat operations, when the situation on the battlefield changes very rapidly, has taught him to often make important decisions independently and act without waiting for the commander's order. -Once, during the shelling, I saw that an artillery shell hit the house where our soldiers were staying. There was no time to delay, so my partner and I, without waiting for the shelling to end, ran to help our people,- Serhii recalls. It turned out that the soldiers risked in vain: after freeing the entrance to the basement of the destroyed house, filled with broken brick fragments, the paratroopers rescued four brothers who were blocked in the underground room. -Who knows how the situation would have turned out for the boys if we had waited for the next team,- the fighter ponders. Serhiy went through so much in the war that one gets the impression that he has been serving for a long time, but this is not the case. The man joined the army in February 2024. Until then, he worked as a construction worker. He says that in his 43 years of life, he has never been in the army, but having joined the ranks of the paratroopers, having passed the appropriate training and having been in battles, he feels confident. To those who are still hesitating, he says not to be afraid. -Prepare physically and mentally. Everything else will be taught to you - no one will send you to the front line without training,- concludes Serhiy. His wife and three children are waiting for the paratrooper at home with Peremoha.

Commanded a missile attack on Okhmatdyt: the suspicion was reported to the Russian general	About this informs September 10 SBU. He turned out to be Lieutenant General Serhii Kobylash, who at that time held the position of long-range aviation commander of the Air Force of the Russian Aerospace Forces. Subsequently, after the strike on Okhmatdyt, he was promoted and appointed commander of the Russian Air Force. This was announced by Deputy Head of the SBU Serhii Naumyuk during a working meeting with Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan and Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin. -During the period of the investigation, the SBU, together with the Prosecutor General's Office, carried out tremendous work. We interrogated 112 victims and 50 eyewitnesses, conducted explosive, forensic and other examinations, analyzed videos from surveillance cameras,- Serhiy Naumyuk said.

According to the Deputy Head of the Security Service of Ukraine, the 22nd Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Division of the Long-range Aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces carried out the shelling of Okhmatdyt. -It was established that the enemy plane took off from an airfield near the Russian city of Olenegorsk, and the missile was launched over the Saratov region of the Russian Federation at a distance of almost 600 km from the border of Ukraine,- the report said. From the territory of Russia, the Kh-101 entered the airspace of our country in the region of Chernihiv Oblast and began to maneuver, constantly changing its flight path through the territories of four regions.

At the scene of the incident, law enforcement officers found the remains of an enemy missile with markings indicating that it was manufactured on the basis of the Russian Raduga design center in the second quarter of 2024. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed Kobylash about suspicion in absentia under Part 2 of Art. 28, part 2 of Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (violation of the laws and customs of war, combined with intentional murder, committed by a group of persons according to a prior conspiracy). -Kobylash is currently suspected of committing other war crimes in Ukraine. In particular, attacks on civilian energy infrastructure were carried out under his leadership in 2022-2023. In March 2024, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Kobylash precisely for these war crimes,- emphasized Serhiy Naumyuk.

The enemy continues to violate international norms by hiding its ships in the Black Sea	The Navy of Ukraine informs about this. There are no enemy ships in the Sea of ​​Azov. In the Mediterranean Sea, 1 enemy ship, which is a carrier of Kalibr cruise missiles with a total salvo of up to 4 missiles. During the day in the interests of the Russian Federation, passage through the Kerch Strait was carried out: The Russian Federation continues to violate the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of ​​1974 (SOLAS) by turning off automatic identification systems (AIS). As reported by ArmyInform, Dmytro Pletenchuk commented why Russia stopped using naval platforms during attacks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/vorog-prodovzhuye-porushuvaty-mizhnarodni-normy-hovayuchy-svoyi-korabli-u-chornomu-mori/	2024-09-09T21:26:33-07:00
The occupiers hit the populated areas of the Zaporizhzhia region 314 times	This was reported by Ivan Fedorov, the head of Zaporizhzhya OVA. Russian troops carried out 15 airstrikes on Stepnohirsk, Kamyansk, Lobkovo, Orikhov, Novoandriivka, Novodanilivka, and Biloghiru.

Fierce battles continue at the front: 147 combat clashes per day	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The invaders carried out two missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine, using two missiles, 71 airstrikes (dropped 91 anti-aircraft missiles), and also used 593 kamikaze drones. At the same time, the enemy fired 3,751 shots at the positions of our troops and settlements. On the Kharkiv direction, the occupiers attacked once in the Vovchansk region. Kharkiv came under bombardment, and in Bilokrynychno, terrorists struck with anti-aircraft guns from Ka-52 helicopters. Nine times the enemy stormed the positions of the Ukrainian military in the Kupyansk direction, in the districts of Petropavlivka, Synkivka, Stelmakhivka, Lozova and Hlushkivka. Two clashes are ongoing. In the Lyman direction the Russian invaders tried to advance 13 times in the districts of Cherneshchyna, Makiivka, Novosadovo, Nevsky, Dibrova, Hryhorivka, Yampolivka, and Torsky. Defenders of Ukraine repelled nine enemy attacks. Fighting continues near Nevsky and Novosadovo. The enemy made 11 attacks in the Northern direction. He concentrated his efforts in Verkhnokamyanskyi, Spirnyi and Zvanivka districts. Near the latter, half a dozen infantry fighting vehicles were deployed to support the infantry. Suffered losses. Fighting in the direction continues. In the Kramatorsk direction the occupiers carried out two assaults in the Bila Hora area. The situation is under the control of units of the Defense Forces. In the Toretsk direction, the aggressors attacked six times for aviation support near Toretsk and Nelipivka. They received a tough rebuff. In the Pokrovsky direction there is a high intensity of hostilities. The number of skirmishes has increased to 33. The invaders continue to attack our positions near Vozdvizhenka, Zeleny Pol, Novotroitskyi, Grodivka, Novogrodivka, Selidovo, and Mykhailivka. All attacks have been stopped by our defenders for the time being. Today, the enemy made the main efforts in the Novogrodivka area, where almost 40 percent of all skirmishes took place. The previous losses of the aggressor amounted to 336 occupiers killed and wounded. An electronic warfare device, three artillery systems, three cars and six motorcycles were also destroyed, five artillery systems and five cars were damaged. In the Kurakhiv direction there are 46 combat clashes of varying intensity. The occupiers most actively tried to advance in the areas of Krasnohorivka, Kostyantynivka and Georgiivka settlements, where about 75 percent of all battles took place. In addition, the enemy attacked in the direction of Halytsynivka, Ukranian, and Zhelany Pershy. In the Vremivsk direction the aggressor stormed the front edge of our defense nine times in the Vugledar, Zolotoi Niva, and Shakhtarsky areas. Ukrainian soldiers stopped seven enemy assaults, two more battles continue near Vugledar, where the occupiers also used assault aircraft - they hit with NARs. In the Orikhov direction, the enemy carried out a total of three attacks - two were repulsed near Malaya Tokmachka and one continued in the area of ​​Mali Shcherbaki. In the Dnieper direction nine enemy attempts to take the positions of our soldiers failed. The defense forces hold back the onslaught of the Russian occupiers. Separately, the department recognized the soldiers of the 25th separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who bravely hold their positions, skillfully repulse enemy attacks, inflicting significant losses on the invaders. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers significantly -livoberezhzhi-dnipra/->intensified offensive operations in the Pryndiprovsky direction with the aim of knocking out units of the Defense Forces from the bridgeheads on the Left Bank of the Dnipro, which Ukrainian defenders hold after leaving the village of Krynki.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/na-fronti-tryvayut-zhorstki-boyi-147-bojovyh-zitknen-za-dobu/	2024-09-09T21:08:29-07:00
15 km per day through enemy territory and the myth of strong intelligence of the Russian Federation:...	Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmyInform about this: -The Kursk operation is actually very, very successful. I would call it (an operation. — Ed.) global order. And it is necessary to understand why it happened. The first point: this is really an attempt to divert the enemy's forces and means from the main Donetsk direction. Only at first glance, this issue is unrealized. But in reality it is not so. Why? Because the combat army reserves are between 10 and 15 percent. So, if the enemy has 600,000 personnel along the battle line, then the mandatory reserve: 60,000-70,000 is still engaged. This is a very important moment. Next, this is a completely and definitively dispelled myth that one cannot enter the territory of the enemy, because, they say, it is a nuclear country, and the apocalypse will definitely happen. However, the apocalypse did not happen. And the most important goal, and it is, in fact, very promising: sooner or later it will reach the negotiation process. We are well aware that there will be no direct conversation between Ukraine and Russia. But according to the grain agreement, when we, Ukrainians, signed certain agreements with the Turks and the UN, and then Russia signed certain agreements with the Turks and the UN, then such a scenario could happen. And at this point we have to have a very, very strong position-. If for the enemy, Donetsk region and Luhansk region are of principle, then Kherson region and Zaporizhia region are not so principled. And according to the principle of such exchange — i.e., we return Kursk Oblast to them, and they return Zaporizhia and Kherson Oblast to us — such a scenario is quite possible. From the point of view of the organization's tactics and strategy, the operation is brilliant. Why is it shiny? Because it is breakthrough. In the first days of the operation, our forces moved at a speed of up to 10 km per day, and in some locations up to 15. I must remind you that the enemy covered almost the entire dry the weather passes several kilometers in the direction of Pokrovsk. Therefore, our speed is incredible. And most importantly: there is a myth that Russia has very strong intelligence. If the Russians could not calculate and see such an operation, then their intelligence is very, very bad. Any war, and especially the current one, has only three main laws. This is the concentration of the enemy's forces and means, the coordinated work of the military branches, and the third law, it was fully implemented here and very qualitatively, this is the hidden management of the troops. Being able to assemble several shock combat brigades, move them efficiently, provide them with equipment and break through the border — this is really a sign of the great quality of our operational art.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/15-km-na-dobu-vorozhoyu-terytoriyeyu-ta-mif-pro-sylnu-rozvidku-rf-ekspert-pro-blyskuchu-operacziyu-syl-oborony-na-kurshhyni/	2024-09-09T20:30:37-07:00
Combat took 14 tankers and two marines out of the encirclement: the story of lieutenant colonel Grud...	&#8230;On February 23, 2022, a battalion of a separate tank brigade named after Kostyantyn Pestushka was raised due to an alarm, and Oleg took it to a designated concentration area. - To be honest, there was nothing to indicate that a large-scale invasion would begin. The relevant order was received, we went out according to the training plans. But on the morning of February 24, around 4 a.m., the connection was dead. Reports began from posts that explosions were heard and bright flashes were seen at the base camp. In addition, we used the Viraj-tablet air defense system. The operator called me to see what was happening, and there were about 30 planes on the radar. We understood that a serious war had begun, the officer recalls. Around 10 o'clock Oleg Grudzevych's tank battalion reached the border in the Volnovakha district. There, the tankers found the first hours of a large-scale invasion. It was very hot near Volnovakha - the Russians broke through the defense of one of the infantry battalions. — Our unit suffered its first losses there — the tank crew was killed. We went away with hard fights - pearls scattered like mad. According to intelligence data, there were convoys of 70 units, and 50, 30, 20. I remember how successfully one crew - an officer's crew - worked. The thing is that Major Serhii Brovkin, the deputy commander, was there for the gunner, and Captain Pavlo Grelya for the tank commander. So they destroyed two BMP-3 with one shot. The armor-piercing projectile pierced both cars of the Rashists, and it was so successful that they exploded one after another, inflating like bubbles. And the column did not even stop, the Rashists simply did not understand what had happened, says Oleg Grudzevych. He remembered the first days of the large-scale invasion as continuous battles, maneuvers, retreats, counterattacks, and at the same time the realization that the Rashists could be beaten. And he still cannot forget how the local population helped the Ukrainian soldiers. When our tanks simply ran out of fuel on February 27, volunteers from one of the settlements, which is currently temporarily captured, came to help. Farmers shared the fuel, pouring 200 liters into each tank. As Oleg recalls, he managed to gather his units, and on February 28, the tankers entered Mariupol on the territory of the Azovmash plant, where, together with the marines, they began fighting for the city. Oleg tells about those battles calmly, as if it were about ordinary work: - The schedule of the orcs was like a working day. It's dawn - they're on the move, small arms are working. It begins to pout - shooting battles stop, artillery and aviation begin to work. On the 13th, a mechvod (mechanic-driver. — Ed.) died. We tried to protect the team link, but still they had to take risks, there was simply no other strength. Already on the 2nd or 3rd day of the fighting, we moved to the basement. Battalions were still stationed around the city perimeter, tanks were moving out, there were constant skirmishes, Russian artillery and aviation were already in full swing. They calculated the location of headquarters on -Azovstal- and -Azovmash-, and aviation worked on them. Mines and -Hradi- were already flying to the plant. The Azov people came to us and said: -We don't understand their mathematics: 50 people attack every day from one direction. 20-30 turn around, they will lose a lot of equipment and tanks. The next morning it's 50 again.- The fighting continued at this pace until the end of March. On March 15, the tankers ran out of drinking water and food. Oleg thinks, then continues: - We started drinking water from the fire-fighting ponds that were at the factory. Water and green, but there was no way out. There was also no supply of ammunition and food, later we began to count literally every projectile for tanks, sukhpai. The ring was getting tighter every day, we were moving away little by little. Orcs were literally pelting us with cannon fodder. We had no news or communication, but we stood on the perimeter of the plant, holding Azovmash - 800 meters, in the roundabout. I had 2 combat-ready tanks left, mine and one more, and 2 or 3 vehicles were from the 36th brigade. They went to work in pairs. Scatter on all sides of the pearl. All the anti-aircraft gunners and tankers I had were already working as infantrymen, going on 8-hour shifts. I remember how on April 5, an enemy tank broke into the territory of -Azovmash-, but it was knocked out. Every evening, as soon as it got dark, the Russians came out and began to -pour- everywhere with a double frenzy. We understood that we would not last another week. Oleg recalls that the first attempt to break through the encirclement was on April 10. They tried to break through the territory of the Ilyich plant, but, unfortunately, the attempt was unsuccessful. The next day, another breakout attempt, this time successful. Two tanks that remained from Oleg's battalion with the remains of shells: one had about 20 shells in the conveyor, the other tank had 15. The unit left the factory. — Our plan was as follows: to the road, if there is an opportunity, we break through on equipment. When the tanks stop, then we blow up the equipment, and then we move on foot, in groups of 10-15 people. The connection was reset and checked. On April 11, around midnight, they started moving. Next to my tank was a -motolyga- (light armored multi-purpose transporter. - Ed.), people were sitting on it, including the wounded. I tell the officer that I will divert fire on myself. And I will not leave them alone. I give tasks to the commander, the mechanic. We were lucky that it was raining that night and there were no drones. I say to the commander of another unit that was with us: -While we are shooting for 30-40 minutes, stay a kilometer away from me. You see the transfer of fire - move behind us to the distance that we have advanced. And this is how we move - from border to border.- &#8230;The breakthrough was frantic - tankers opened fire, burned Russian equipment, the infantry also did their job. Then the tanks ran out of fuel and stopped. There were no shells either. Tankers took out night lights, radios, sights and destroyed everything they could. They took with them small arms, ammunition, grenades, remnants of sukhpay, water. They moved behind the rear of the Rashists. Today, few people can imagine what it is like to move in the enemy's environment. Expect a shot, a rupture, a mine detonation, a random meeting with the occupiers or local traitors at any moment. Oleg speaks sparingly about the exit. — Before the breakthrough, thanks to Starlink, I downloaded an offline map and took a normal one. We knew roughly where our units would be and how far we had to go. It was 138 kilometers straight, and all 175 to bypass the Rashisti. They planned the movement as follows: we walk at night, warm up at the same time, and hide somewhere during the day. The only thing that bothered me a lot was the cold. Although, perhaps, it saved us in the end, because the enemy also did not want to peek somewhere in such abominable weather. On the first day, the main thing was to get as far away from the abandoned equipment as possible. Population centers were bypassed. But we went to one, Znamenivka, not far from Anatolia - there was a bridge over the river near the reservoir. We came across a Russian DRG near the bridge. We -put down- one occupant, ran across that concrete bridge and lay down in a rather large landing. From 8 in the morning to 9 in the evening, they stayed in that landing. The opponent was afraid to comb her. For 4 hours, they drove next to each other, released only a few queues in our direction. Then we got somewhere - they probably thought that we had gone along the creek. We were very tired, because we had been out for the 3rd day. So, after resting a little in that landing, they filled up with water and moved along the river. There they ran into another group of Rashists. There was a short fight, one of them was definitely -killed-, but a bullet or two hit our fighter in the backpack. The soldier is running, the backpack is on fire, I shout to him: -Drop that backpack!-, and he: -Go away, there are grenades!- — -All the more, throw him to hell!-. He tore off that backpack and threw it away. We then broke away and went for several days without fire contact. Somewhere on the 6th or 7th day, they finished off the remaining sukhpai, began to look for sorrel, rummaged through garbage cans - they thought they would find something. On one of the days we almost got caught. We leave the next landing - and here our soldier noticed a tent 20 meters away, and some antennas there. They passed 300-400 meters. In the morning I already say: -Let's not go anywhere, because our legs hurt, our stomachs hurt, it's raining.- There are still about 40 kilometers to the front. Next is a quarry with sand, they thought to wait in it, and there were 20 Urals with Zetkas. We hear - somewhere behind, the generator started up, 400 meters away. I think they have come. It saved that the weather was bad, it was raining. So they lay near the quarry. Orcs were loaded with sand, no one else was seen until evening. Then they went very carefully - I sent a patrol of 2-3 people ahead. At 500 meters, if clear, they turned back, and we continued. Walked all the time with their phones turned off - I warned them to charge the power banks before leaving, and everyone turned off their phones except for me. I say - if I see someone's phone, I will shoot my knees! Of course, I wouldn't have done that, but no one was using the phones, because the Russians track cellular communications clearly. About 15 kilometers before the collision line, I see one -Life- strip appeared on my phone, but I couldn't make a call. On the 9th day, 2 -sticks- appeared on the phone. He called the brigadier general, he didn't recognize us at first, then he was happy. I got together with the unit commander who was ahead of us, and for the last 12 hours he helped us go. I remember how he tells us that there is a small area that will have to be run. And our legs are no longer carrying us, and our stomachs hurt, I was vomiting blood. The guys took my machine gun and backpack from me, they say: -We will deliver them, your task is to prove us.- And so they came&#8230; They cried because they almost didn't believe that we would make it. They have experienced so much&#8230; They came, fell down, we were given a cigarette and water to drink. He called his commander back, the next day our brigade came to pick us up. There were 16 people with me. Two of them are from the 36th Brigade. For this breakthrough from Mariupol and exit, in fact, he received the -Golden Star-. I do what I can, no more and no less. At the moment, we are temporarily on recovery, soon they will give a new command, because the Rashists must be beaten in order to return home as soon as possible. In addition to the -Golden Star- of the Hero of Ukraine, which was personally awarded to Oleh Grudzevych by the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi during a visit to the unit, for the battles near Volnovakha and Mariupol, the officer was also awarded two orders of Bohdan Khmelnytsky III and II degrees.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/kombat-vyviv-z-otochennya-14-tankistiv-i-dvoh-morpihiv-istoriya-pidpolkovnyka-grudzevycha/	2024-09-09T20:19:14-07:00
-Dirty bomb-, biolaboratories and what are the Chechens doing here: what is the Kremlin mouthpiece c...	During the meeting of the Ninth Eastern Economic Forum on September 5, he again changed the goal of the war against Ukraine and stated that the main task of -his- remains the capture of the Donetsk region. He also called it a -sacred duty- of Russian soldiers to retake part of Russia's Kursk region, which is currently controlled by the Ukrainian military. Putin declared: -The invasion of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation into the border regions of the Russian Federation failed.- And this is despite the fact that the Armed Forces continue to perform all the assigned tasks in Kurshchyna. The Russian dictator also hinted that Russia did not refuse negotiations with Ukraine, but on the basis of -documents- agreed in Istanbul in 2022. It will be recalled that at that time the Russians demanded the actual capitulation of Ukraine. In the annexes to the Istanbul Agreements, Russia prescribed a number of restrictions for Ukraine, while no restrictions were foreseen for the Russians. This was said by the former US Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland. -The Istanbul agreements prohibited Ukraine from having some weapons systems, so, in essence, Ukraine would be weakened from a military point of view, while there were no similar restrictions on the part of Russia: Russia was not required to withdraw, it was not necessary to have a buffer zone on the border, Russia was not it was forbidden to keep any weapons on the border. -Ukraine felt that this could be a trap, so after consulting with its allies, it withdrew from the negotiations,- said Victoria Nuland. Putin could get a castrated demilitarized country for nothing. He obviously liked this, so now Putin only creates the appearance of readiness for negotiations, and all he wanted and wants is the surrender of Ukraine. For this purpose, the Russian dictator is manipulating the ephemeral -Istanbul Agreements- in the Russian interpretation. Ukraine needs a just peace, according to the norms of international law, according to the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which the head of the Kremlin constantly avoids. In addition, during his speech at the forum, Putin continued to say that the current authorities of Ukraine are not interested in ending hostilities because they do not want to hold presidential elections. He was supported by the dictator's spokesman, Dmytro Peskov, who declared: -Zelenskyi's regime is de jure illegitimate, although in fact it continues its activities.- We will remind that, according to the Constitution of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi remains the legitimate head of state and will exercise his powers until the moment of taking office as the new President, whom Ukrainians will elect in the elections. Zakharova, the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, was also noted for another batch of disinformation published on the air. She stated: -Ukrainian criminals guilty of serious international crimes against their own and Russian citizens, as well as their accomplices, will be brought to court and they will suffer the deserved punishment.- As is known, during the war, Ukraine strictly adheres to all international conventions and rules of warfare, unlike Russia, which constantly violates them. Zakharova also emphasized once again that the alleged main customer and instigator of the aggression of the -Kyiv regime- is the -collective West-. The statements of the Russian propagandist are populist in nature and do not have any legal basis. In addition, they cannot withstand any criticism and have no limits to cynicism. It was Russia that attacked a sovereign state, kills Ukrainians every day and destroys entire cities. There is only one aggressor, whose name is Russia. But this does not prevent the terrorist country from constantly accusing Ukraine of preparing terrorist attacks. So, last week, the RIA Novosti channel published an interview with an alleged Ukrainian prisoner of war, who said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine were preparing ammunition with the banned chlorpicrin in a laboratory near Kramatorsk. Also, Russian propagandist Veselovskyi said: -Ukraine has already made a dirty nuclear bomb long ago and would be ready to use it, but it does not use it,- and a collaborator from the Russian Federation, Ganchev, said that the threat of attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants will remain. Let us remind you that it is Ukraine that strictly adheres to the requirements of the international nuclear security regime, unlike the aggressor country, which constantly uses nuclear blackmail for manipulation and intimidation. In addition, Ukraine, as a signatory to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons, strictly adheres to its obligations. Therefore, all the statements of propagandists are fakes, in which only Russians believe. And with plots on its own television, the propaganda of the aggressor country tries to justify the aggression of the Russian Federation and to cultivate hatred of Ukrainians among its citizens. For example, on the anniversary of the terrorist attacks in Buinaksk, Volgodonsk, and Moscow (September 4-16, 1999), the story of propagandist Dmytro Kiselyov is being circulated in the Russian Federation, in which Ukrainians are equated with -Chechen terrorists.- According to Kiselyov, now Ukrainians resisting the Russian invasion are -doing the same thing- as the terrorists who blew up residential buildings in Russian cities. Propaganda directly threatens - the defenders of Ukraine will either be destroyed or a Russian prison, -where life is worse than death.- In fact, using the pretext of -fighting terrorism- to justify wars is a classic Kremlin tactic. According to many independent investigators, the FSB was involved in the terrorist attacks in 1999, in which more than 300 people died and which became the reason for the Second Chechen War. It is the terrorist country Russia that constantly uses terrorist methods and commits crimes against the civilian population in both Chechnya and Ukraine. To write the review, materials from the Center for Combating Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine were used.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/brudna-bomba-biolaboratoriyi-j-do-chogo-tut-chechenczi-pro-shho-znov-volaye-rupor-kremlya/	2024-09-09T20:10:59-07:00
Because it is the most long-range: the US Navy puts into service the AIM-174B air-to-air missile	The fact that the Indo-Pacific region has been chosen as the prime territory for the deployment of these weapons, in the opinion of Reuters agency analyst, can significantly change the balance of forces in the air, in particular in armed confrontation with China, ArmiyaInform reports. The missile was developed by a well-known American manufacturer in the field of aerospace engineering - Raytheon - based on the SM-6 system , making it currently the longest-range missile ever used by the US, and was officially commissioned in July. It should be noted that the Pentagon did not officially present the new charge. Therefore, defense sector researchers are only making assumptions about the capabilities of the new missile based solely on its external image. Photos of F/A-18E/F Super Hornet aircraft with a new type of armament have appeared online. The new missile program and its implementation may mark a scientific and technical revolution in the fight against air targets&#8230; and even more. Yes, by data by The War Zone, the AIM-174B is a new air-to-air missile. Its appearance marks a significant increase in the capabilities of the US Navy in the fight against air targets, although the use of new weapons may extend beyond the air sphere. As confirmed by Naval News, the missile, also known as SM-6 ALC (Air-Launched Configuration), has been officially adopted by the US Navy. Weapons photographed by air adjusters during RIMPAC 2024 maneuvers while which has not been officially announced. The sudden appearance of a new missile without a pre-presented development program in the press remains largely a mystery. This reflects well the ability of the United States to conduct secret programs and the ability of Americans to avoid leaking information to the press when necessary. There are many indications that the F/A-18s will receive weapons that could radically change the balance of power in the Pacific. As can be seen from the photos published on social networks, the missile is suspended on the underwing pylon of the BRU-32B/A type of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. A few years ago, visually similar weapons were spotted under another aircraft of this type. However, that rocket was painted orange, which could mean that it was just an experimental product, a mass-sized mock-up, or maybe just a flying target. All three F/A-18E/F VFA CVW-2s are attached to the aeroplane of the Carl Vinson aircraft carrier and apparently received the AIM-174B air defense system. In recent weeks, the new missiles have been spotted in a gray color with a white fairing, which is typical of production air-to-air missiles adopted by the US Air Force and Navy. The airframe of the rocket can also be seen in great detail in the pictures. On its case there is a spoken marking DATM-174B. The abbreviation means that the missile is special, test, the common designation of the combat missile is AIM-174B. The RIMPAC exercise also saw F/A-18E/F fighters with underwing pylon-mounted missiles bearing the NAIM-174B index, with the N prefix indicating modifications for special tests where no return to the original configuration is planned. The model number in the missile designation -174- and the geometric and aerodynamic exterior of the missile airframe reveal the mystery of the weapon's origin. RIM-174B is the ship-to-air missile designation, also known in the US Navy as the SM-6 (Standard Missile-6) Block IA. In the US Navy, it is used to combat aerodynamic and ballistic targets, and also has limited capabilities to attack surface targets. The AIM-174 is a variant of the SM-6 adapted for use on combat aircraft. A missile modified for air carriers can use the altitude and speed of its carrier as launch conditions. For this reason, it lacks the Mk 72 solid propellant booster used in the original RIM-174B, which is launched from the Mk 41 shipboard Vertical Launch System (VLS). The AIM-174B missile without the Mk 72 booster weighs 1,890 pounds ± 14 lbs (857 kg ± 6 kg). The missile's terminal velocity can reach Mach 3.5 (1,050 m/s) when intercepting aerial, aerodynamic, and ballistic targets at altitudes up to 110,000 feet (34,000 meters) or Mach 2.5 (825 m/s ) when hitting land and surface targets at a range of 200 nautical miles (370 km). The missile has an active AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air homing system for end-of-flight targeting, but, unlike the AMRAAM, is not equipped with an inertial system as the primary missile control system in the initial and mid-range of the flight path, but programmable GPS navigation system, which is more accurate and allows you to do without a radio altimeter when attacking surface and ground targets in flight at low and ultra-low altitudes. It seems that as a result of this modification, the weapon does not lose its aerodynamic parameters, in particular, regarding the launch range. In this aspect, an air-launched missile may even win against a prototype ship-based missile. Given that estimates of the launch range of the -traditional- ship-based RIM-174B range from 240 to 460 km, this means that the AIM-174B could prove to be the longest-range air-to-air missile in its class, surpassing the Russian P-37 (AA 13 Axehead in the NATO nomenclature), the Chinese PL-15 (CH-AA-10 Abaddon) or the European Meteor. AIM-174B — new missile -air — air- of the US Navy for long-range F-18 Super Hornets.

Heavy fighting in tracts and islands: the intensity of enemy assaults on the Left Bank of the Dniepe...	Captain Dmytro, the spokesman of the operational group of troops -Tavria- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- Lykhova - In three days - Friday, Saturday and Sunday - 30 combat clashes took place there. The opponent had no success. Today, since the beginning of the day, there have already been 7 combat clashes there, while they are not taking place in one place, but are scattered on different islands, tracts, on different areas, which are stretched over a considerable length of the Dnipro coast, he said. This is an atypical situation, because previously most of the enemy's ground offensive operations were carried out in Zaporizhzhia, namely on the Robotynsky ledge in the Orihiv direction. Now the situation has changed. — Over the course of yesterday, 13 enemy assaults were repelled in our entire operational zone, of which three took place in the Orichiv direction, none in the Gulyajpil region, and 10 attacks were repelled at once in the Dnieper direction. This is such an atypical activity, the spokesman noted. The military believes that the Russians want to oust units of the Defense Forces from their positions on the bridgeheads on the Left Bank of the Dnieper. — They want, so to speak, to do it in such a leap. There are no other explanations. But in principle, their activation is the greatest in the last couple of months after the end of the active defense of Krynok, when our units — marines and other units of the Armed Forces — moved to other designated positions on the Left Bank of the Dnieper, he said. Dmytro Lykhovii suggested that the intensification of offensive actions by the Russians on the left bank of the Dnieper is related to their concern about a possible Ukrainian offensive in this direction. — There was information that the Russians were waiting for our offensive there. There were active actions, in particular, by the special forces of the Main Directorate of Intelligence with amphibious landings on the Kinburn spit, on the Tendriv spit. So the Russians keep their contingent there also for defense reasons. But now we are dealing with an increase in the number of assaults on their part, the spokesman said. In general, the Russians did not relax their attention to the SSU-held bridgeheads on the Left Bank of the Dnieper, even when they transferred their units from other directions in the South in view of the Kursk offensive operation of the Defense Forces. — It can be said that after the start of the Kursk offensive operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, when the enemy in a certain way transferred his units to threatened areas, in particular to Kurshchyna, he took most of these units from the Zaporizhzhia region. Whereas in Kherson Oblast, the number that was there actually remained. There, the Russians did not weaken the group. On the contrary, they conduct rotations at the front edge of their units, transfer -storm- detachments there in particular to maintain the intensity of assault actions, in order to be able to attack in the future, said Dmytro Lykhova. On the other hand, in other directions in the South, the number of assaults by the occupiers decreased. — If earlier most of the combat clashes took place in Zaporozhye, in the Orichiv direction, specifically on the Robotynsky ledge, now there are very few of them there. For example, yesterday there were three of them, none before that, today two have already happened since the beginning of the day. At the same time, the enemy is actively using unguided air missiles. In the Gulyajpil direction, there have been three weeks without significant changes, that is, there are no ground assaults, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform showed that our soldiers destroyed a warehouse of enemy watercraft in the South.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/09/v-urochyshhah-i-na-ostrovah-vazhki-boyi-zrosla-intensyvnist-shturmiv-voroga-na-livoberezhzhi-dnipra/	2024-09-09T10:28:16-07:00

They talked with a captured Kazakh who went to kill people for money. We often meet people who think they can sit in the back, make money, and everything will be fine. But when they get into the Russian military system and face reality, everything falls into place,- the Ukrainian military said. -Это что вообще такое? You go according to the contract, you sign the contract, and you go and spend your money. Those are contracts that you get, you earn,- complains a serviceman of the aggressor state of the Russian Federation. Instead, in captivity, he was fed and given the necessary clothes. However, only he was so lucky - all the other henchmen of the Russian died. -Russians, you live in a country that kills you more than any other. Your Russian -tsar- killed more Russians than any Ukrainian. We will continue to destroy anyone who chooses to play the -great conqueror-. We have something to fight for - for our home, our families, our future,- Ukrainian soldiers emphasized.

The Ministry of Defense is updating the food supply of the Armed Forces: the pilot project will be l...	About this reported in the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The main task of the new approach is to ensure better quality of products supplied to the Armed Forces and to increase the efficiency of the supply process itself. It was introduced to potential suppliers, manufacturers and distributors. -From February 2025, two models will operate in parallel: the one under which DOT works now, and the new pilot model. This approach is used to ensure the stability of the system and the continuity of the supply process. Transformations in the food model for the military should increase the efficiency of supply and, at the same time, ensure compliance with high standards of product quality,- said Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. The pilot will operate throughout the year and will cover such regions as the city of Kyiv and the Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Cherkasy, and Kirovohrad regions. The main changes concern the financial model of interaction with the supplier, the product model and the quality control process. The supplier will receive compensation for the cost of goods and a fee for services (warehousing and transportation) subject to the SLA. The marginal cost of the catalog will be determined and fixed. For most types of products (75%) through open procurement platforms, the DOT will choose manufacturers who will be contracted by suppliers. For the remaining categories, suppliers will independently identify subcontractors. DOT, in turn, can block them for quality inconsistency and for violating integrity norms. All products will pass through the distribution center and only then be sent to military units. This is an additional stage of quality control, to which DOT specialists will be involved. DOT will apply a -black list- to suppliers and manufacturers - a new tool to prevent participation in the process of providing food for the Armed Forces in future periods of those entities that have already violated contractual obligations . -The idea of ​​the pilot model is to change the philosophy of interaction with suppliers and manufacturers due to the change in their incentives and the openness of the terms of cooperation. We see this approach as the basis of partnership. At the same time, our main goal is to ensure an increase in both the quality of products received by the Armed Forces and the efficiency of the supply process itself. So that, while observing the transparent rules of the game, all participants in the process are interested in ensuring a continuous and high-quality supply of the Armed Forces,- said Halyna Litosh, program director for the food sector of the DOT. Earlier, ArmyInform informed that The Kingdom of Sweden announced the 17th package of military aid to Ukraine in the amount of SEK 4.6 billion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/09/minoborony-onovlyuye-harchove-zabezpechennya-zsu-pilotnyj-proyekt-zapustyat-nastupnogo-roku/	2024-09-09T07:52:03-07:00

A scheme for a schemer: the arrested fraudster from the TCC was not allowed to leave behind bars	notified the Security Service of Ukraine In August of this year, with the assistance of the leadership of the Ministry of Defense and the Ground Forces Command, he was detained on suspicion of organizing schemes for evaders. According to the case materials, the official, together with two accomplices, offered conscripts to avoid conscription on the basis of fictitious conclusions of the VLK about -poor health.- More than 1.2 million US dollars were found during the searches in the premises and cars of the participants. Almost half of this amount was found in specially arranged hiding places under the floor and behind the wall paneling in the residence of an official of the Buchansky TCC. After the suspect was arrested, the court decided to release him on bail of UAH 1 million. However, immediately after making the appropriate amount of bail, the investigators of the Security Service informed the official about a new suspicion, which did not allow him to go free. This time, according to the SBU military counterintelligence materials, the perpetrator's criminal actions were qualified under Art. 368-5 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (illegal enrichment). Currently, a preventive measure has been chosen for him in the form of detention with the right to deposit bail in the amount of UAH 18 million. The investigation is ongoing.
