NATO Secretary General: It is necessary to strengthen support for Ukraine and change the trajectory ...	He stated this during his speech at the -Ukrainian Breakfast- in Davos, organized on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. -If Ukraine loses, it will mean that within NATO we will no longer talk about spending 3% of GDP on defense. Then it will be about the need to spend trillions of dollars to contain Russia. This will be a much higher price than what is currently spent on modernization and increasing defense production,- Mark Rutte said. He added that by the time the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi decides that it is necessary to start negotiations with the Russian Federation, Ukraine should be in the strongest position. -The main issue is for it to be a permanent peace, so that there is no repetition of the situation as with the Minsk agreements, when we thought we had a permanent peace, but in fact Putin continued the seizure of Ukraine in 2022,- Mark Rutte said. The NATO Secretary General emphasized that for sustainable peace it is necessary to ensure that Putin never again occupies a single square meter of Ukrainian territory. -We must strengthen support for Ukraine. We have to change the trajectory of the war. The front line is currently moving in the wrong direction. The focus should be on Ukraine being in the strongest position, especially at the beginning of the negotiations. And when they will be completed, so that the achieved peace will be permanent. Ukraine's full membership in NATO would be the easiest way to ensure peace in the future. But whatever the outcome of the negotiations, Putin should have no say or influence over who joins or doesn't join NATO,- he concluded. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi said that Europe should preserve unity, increase defense spending, ensure energy independence and be able to guarantee security. The President emphasized that Ukraine has created models of defense cooperation that can make the whole of Europe stronger. It is about the joint production of artillery and drones, including unique ones that have no analogues in the world.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/gensek-nato-neobhidno-posylyuvaty-pidtrymku-ukrayiny-ta-zminyty-trayektoriyu-vijny/	2025-01-22T23:19:21-08:00

A fantastic target for FPV drones, 5 km to the front line and an old GAZ-66: a cog expert that can d...	&#8220;Ukrainians show simply phenomenal success in the part of exterminating Russian vehicles. Compared to January of last year, these indicators have tripled, and even quadrupled. If in January 2024, Russians experienced losses in the automotive industry of about 10-30 units per day, now these indicators reach 100-120. A simple and logical question arises, why did this happen? In fact, this question should be considered in the mandatory reference to their armored vehicles, both tanks and armored fighting vehicles. Because that's the only way it really looks. What is the point of the question? During this war, we destroyed almost 10,000 tanks. Is it a lot? It's unbelievable, fantastic! Nothing like this has happened since the Second World War. I would like to remind you that at the beginning of the war, the Russian Federation's official tank fleet was 3,400 units. So, at this minute, we have destroyed almost two and a half state parks. And armored fighting vehicles of all types, starting from the old BTR-60PB, including the most massive BTR-80, and ending with BMP-1, BMP-2 and a small number of BMP-3 machines - that's almost 20,000. And their full-time fleet was 14,000. One important detail should be considered here. Russia can no longer produce full-fledged, high-quality armored vehicles. First of all, this applies to tanks. If the Soviet Union at the time of its collapse had six large armored tank factories, at the moment the Russian Federation has only one: Uralvagonzavod. And it can produce only one tank - T-90. They say that, they say, we put up to 1,500 tanks in service per month. But there is a nuance. This is not a new technique, it is a restored technique from conservation. Yes, the warehouse is still quite large. At the beginning of the war, it was estimated at up to 20,000 units of various types and types of armored vehicles. And it is no secret that the Russians have begun very serious and scrupulous work on returning their own equipment from Third World countries. Because since the mid-60s of the last century, the Soviet Union exported a huge amount of various equipment to a large number of countries. And because of this, the Russians still have a certain margin of safety. However, again, the same T-90s can produce a maximum of 25 tanks per month. This is the top bar. It's just two mouthpieces. We will remind that a full-time tank company is 10-11 units, no more. This is what their potential looks like. This also applies to their modern armored vehicles. So, in view of this, the Russians are forced to compensate for transporting their personnel by car to the front line. As for the cars themselves: what are the main workhorses and what is their margin of safety? The most popular military vehicles are the KAMAZ 4310, the Ural 4320, and probably their most successful medium-class truck, the GAZ 66, which has already been discontinued. It was discontinued in 1999, and for the entire time it has been produced since the 60s, produced almost a million units. These main corporations — KAMAZ and Ural — can collectively produce, as they themselves declare, up to 55,000 units of a wide variety of equipment of all modifications per year. But there is a nuance. Let's not forget that the Russian industry is a resource industry, and it is also an agricultural industry. Russians are still among the top five producers of agricultural products, primarily legumes, oil, and the like. The economy also needs a huge amount of auto equipment. And in view of the fact that the main two corporations (KAMAZ and Ural - ed.) have come under international sanctions, there are very big problems with the components. Even the Soviet Union could not fully provide all production cycles on its own, especially in the bearing part. Therefore, the Russians will not be able to produce such a large amount of automotive equipment that would be able to cover all the necessary moments for transporting personnel. And not only that. And, let's say, the delivery of standard ammunition to the artillery. And there is one more nuance. Automotive is just a fantastic target for our FPV drones. And in terms of the quality of the use of FPV drones for such purposes, we are now showing perhaps the best indicators not only in terms of our war, but in general, in a global sense. So why are car scrapping rates so high? Because Russia has serious problems with the production of tanks, serious problems with the production of the entire line of armored personnel carriers. And this problem will only increase: about the bearing, I reminded. Not to mention, say, aiming systems. At one time, even before the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the best configuration of the T-72B3 was provided exclusively by French thermal imaging systems. Sanctions are increasing and will continue to increase. This problem will grow and, not surprisingly, it is in automotive technology that a phenomenal thing can happen, when a small cog can destroy the whole car. the Russians are not giving up on the strategic task of seizing the eastern bridgehead. A soldier cannot run 5 km to the front line on the attack line. Let's say, at least one and a half kilometers, it has to be transported by automobile. And if the indicators continue to grow, it may happen that the Russians will be forced to redistribute this automotive equipment from the national economy. And in view of the colossal sanctions pressure on this economy, the moment may come when entire industries may stop due to the fact that there will not be enough trucks, say, to deliver the required amount of coal to a thermal power plant. Such is the phenomenal state of affairs in the field of destruction of automotive equipment. We hope that our soldiers will soon raise this figure to 120-130, or even up to 200 units per day (destruction of enemy vehicles - ed.). We wish them success in this.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/fantastychna-czil-dlya-fpv-droniv-5-km-do-peredovoyi-ta-starenkyj-gaz-66-ekspert-pro-gvyntyk-yakyj-mozhe-zrujnuvaty-usyu-impersku-mashynu/	2025-01-22T21:02:31-08:00
With a gun and a prayer - on foot and at night: how the rotation of infantrymen at -zero-	ArmyInform tells how the rotation of fighters takes place on the front line in the 2nd International Defense Legion of Ukraine. Before moving forward in the direction of forward positions, fighters arrive from rest at a common assembly point. It is here that they can get the most up-to-date information about the advance, listen to orders and advice from commanders, check weapons and -equipment-, set up -radioks-. — In connection with the dynamics and active assault actions of the enemy, every rotation now happens in manual mode. Previously, we had planned rotations, which were prescribed in the morning or the day before and were carried out clearly according to the script. Currently, due to the active assault actions of the enemy, everything needs to be adjusted and plans are changing dynamically. That's why rotation is difficult, - says the company commander Oleksandr. Advancing further can be fast, but sometimes you also have to wait until it is safe to continue moving further towards the positions. Depending on the situation, the wait can last from several tens of minutes to several hours. During their stay at the assembly point, the fighters have the opportunity to rest or have a snack. Located several kilometers from the drop-off point, the shelter where they stay is quite safe, well camouflaged and comfortable. It is possible to get comfortable here to lie down or drink hot tea. — Here we are waiting for the team to leave. One of the rotation algorithms provides for the movement of the group leaving the positions to the disembarkation point in such a way that the new group arrives there at the same time as them. Therefore, we are now waiting for the command to load into the car and drive towards the front line, - explains the second commander of the company, Yuriy. If everyone is replaced, there is no need to wait for the exit of the previous group, because it will start exiting only when the new shift enters the position. At this time, the transport returns to the assembly point and will go to the loading point in such a way as to immediately pick up those who leave and rush to the rear without any waiting. — We try to change the position completely, but due to a number of circumstances, not always it works. Therefore, we find out who is more tired and try to pick them up. We have to hold those who can still stand in their positions for another day or two. But we usually try to change people in the positions completely, - assures Oleksandr. - During the rotation, you can experience even greater losses than during the rotation of the positions. Because it is much more difficult and dangerous to bring people to -zero- than to be there. Therefore, we constantly change the landing points so that they cannot be detected by the enemy, and we -crush- enemy drones with EW. Brigade EWs work very well, - says Oleksandr. In addition to suppressing enemy UAVs with EWs, fighters also have additional active protection from drones - there are hunting rifles in each of the groups and at each of the positions. With their help, a trained fighter can shoot down a detected drone at a safe distance. —A hunting rifle was purchased for each position, which destroys enemy drones with gunpowder. This is quite an effective tool. A fighter who knows how to use her stands out for her. He practices how to load it correctly, how to shoot at a drone. That is, his additional task is the destruction of drones, - says Yuriy. - The average distance of a pedestrian crossing is one and a half or two kilometers, but it can be 3 or even 4. If there is a danger of fire damage to the unloading point, then it is transferred deeper to the rear. Because of this, soldiers have to go to positions further and longer, and with a very significant load, - says Oleksandr. In addition to weapons, body armor and other ammunition, soldiers additionally carry up to 30 kilograms of cargo. First of all, these are ammunition, water, food, means of communication, a backpack or trench EW, additional batteries and many other necessary trinkets. The task of the commander is to check that the fighter does not forget the necessary things and does not collect extra. - When the fighters go back, they take only personal belongings, weapons and protective equipment. Heavy weapons - machine guns or RPGs, as well as sleeping bags and similar things remain in place, because all this is additional weight, - explains Yuriy. The rotation now takes place exclusively at night, because the nearest rear is closely watched by numerous enemy drones. However, even darkness is not a sufficient guarantee of security — the Russians have enough UAVs with thermal imaging capabilities. If the shelling begins, because the rotation is -drawn- by the enemy, then it is either paused, or the group is camouflaged. The average rotation time is 2‒3 hours. This is enough to withdraw and start a group, or vice versa - first start and then withdraw. But if we don't go according to plan, it can drag on for the whole night, says Oleksandr. While he is talking, the fighters inspect their equipment. Someone has already managed to doze off, others are happy to listen to the story about the Ukrainian Antarctic station -Akademik Vernadskyi- and the research vessel -Noosphere-. Quiet and focused, they are happy to distract themselves with an interesting story before a dangerous task. Everyone who is currently in the forefront is not doing it for the first time. According to the established tradition of the 2nd International Legion, the unit's sleeve insignia should feature a stylized antique helmet and spear and the motto in Latin -Viribus unitis- - -With united effort-. This chevron is a combat chevron and should be earned. The arm badge is issued to soldiers who have completed their first combat mission, so those who wear it are no longer newcomers to the Legion and have passed the baptism of fire on the front lines. task. Company commander Yuriy congratulates the soldiers and personally fastens a chevron on each shoulder. This is the combat green and black version of the arm badge, the soldiers will receive the ceremonial red, gray and black version after returning. A blessing from the military chaplain and a joint prayer are mandatory before going to the position. This is part of the tradition and a tribute to the brothers, for whom faith is the strongest support that strengthens the spirit in a difficult hour. The military chaplain of the 2nd International Legion, Father Makarii, conducts a short service. While taking the soldiers of the unit from different countries of the world on vacation, he not only instructs and strengthens them in the Christian faith, but also tells them about Ukraine and Ukrainians, introduces them more deeply to the culture and history of our people. — My dear friends, my dear brothers in Christ, you are here together for a very clear mission. Don't think this is an easy mission. You have a special calling from God because we cannot do anything without God's will. If you are here, it is because God called you to come here - he addresses the soldiers and asks God to protect them from Russian bullets, shells and bombs. The machines will soon arrive and the rotation will follow the usual planned algorithm - an expensive disembarkation at the point and a few kilometers of walking to the positions with a heavy load and under the constant danger of detection by the enemy. The group that the fighters are supposed to replace has already advanced to meet and will soon arrive at the place, which is only 10-15 minutes away from here.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/z-rushnyczeyu-ta-molytvoyu-pishky-ta-ponochi-yak-vidbuvayetsya-rotacziya-pihotyncziv-na-nuli/	2025-01-22T20:48:40-08:00

Imitating the Ukrainians: American marines are actively using TRV heavy drones	In October of this year, Combat Logistics Battalion 8 (CLB-8), part of the 2nd Logistics Group of the US Marine Corps, demonstrated the capabilities of the British-made Tactical Resupply Vehicle 150 (TRV-150) cargo drone during maneuvers Bold Quest 24. Actually, drones from Malloy Aeronautics are well known in the Defense Forces of Ukraine. About the fact that the leadership of the United Kingdom transferred to our state flying products from this company, ArmyInform reported last September. Characterizing their UAV TRV-150, its developers stated: -Thanks to the ability to reliably lift 68 kg in any weather, you can trust the T150 to get your loads anywhere!-. And talking about the course of multinational military exercises Bold Quest 24, reviewers of the defense portal Army Recognition noted that under frequent field school at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, aimed at to improve interoperability between air, ground, sea, space and cyber units, the TRV-150 drone operationally delivered 38.5 kilograms of medical supplies, including donated blood. In April 2023, the US Navy signed an $8.4 million contract with the British company Malloy Aeronautics and its American reseller Service Engineering for 21 units of these unmanned aircraft systems. This decision was made after the TRV-150 took first place in the PMA-263 Tactical Resupply UAS Challenge in 2019. On 27 October 2023, the Marine Corps announced an initial operational capability (IOC) for the TRV-150C at Marine Corps Base Hawaii, equipping and training the Third Maritime Logistics Battalion (LLB-3) to operate the system. The US Marine Corps plans to deploy the Tactical Unmanned Aerial Supply System (TRUAS) to all logistics battalions by 2028, with each unit expected to receive between three and six drones. The development of the TRV-150 stems from Malloy Aeronautics' previous work on hovercraft concepts in 2012, which evolved into more practical unmanned cargo delivery systems. The TRV-150, an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) cargo drone, can transport up to 68 kilograms of cargo over a distance of 70 kilometers at a cruising speed of 108 kilometers per hour. It has a flight time of 36 minutes and uses waypoint navigation for autonomous mission planning. The TRV-150 features eight electric motors that drive the propellers, removable batteries for quick replacement, and modular components, including foldable propeller booms and a fixed chassis for compact storage and easy transport. The device is designed to be deployed by one person and is capable of operating in a variety of weather conditions, including rain, wind, desert and arctic environments. The drone is capable of delivering cargo both by landing and dropping it from the air. The demonstration of the TRV-150 at Bold Quest 24 underscores a broader trend in military logistics where armed forces are increasingly relying on autonomous drones to solve problems in battlefield supply operations. These unmanned systems can transport critical items such as ammunition, food and medical supplies, reducing reliance on manned convoys in high-risk areas. The US Army is implementing similar initiatives, developing autonomous air supply systems for infantry brigade combat teams. Advances in battery technology are expected to increase the payload, range and speed of these systems, as well as potential plans for in-flight wireless charging. Drones like the TRV-150 are especially valuable in medical resupply missions, where sensitive materials like blood must be transported in difficult environments. The US Army's Project Crimson uses the FVR-90 drone, which has the ability to take off and land vertically, to deliver whole blood to combat medics. During the Convergence project, 22 drones transported simulated blood packages in the Mojave Desert, demonstrating their effectiveness in scenarios involving mass casualty of service members. These initiatives are aimed at improving the logistics of medical supply in contested airspace and rough terrain, potentially increasing the survival rate of the wounded.

Russian air defense repelled an attack on Smolensk: this had never happened before	It seems that every day the Russian mass media is becoming more and more like scenarios from thrillers, in which the main character always manages to stop the disaster at the last moment. And here's a new story for you: the Ukrainian attack on Smolensk region, which was repulsed by Russian anti-aircraft defense so quickly that even in fantasy films, they don't have time to show all the tension. But there are a few things you should pay attention to before accepting this as the truth. First, let's look at the concept itself: the presence of active attacks by Ukrainian forces on the territory of Russia indicates that the front has long ceased to be limited only to Ukrainian lands. However, for Kremlin propagandists, it looks as if the protected city of Smolensk is one of the last bastions worth defending to the last breath. And now, they are presenting it as a battle that took place with the invincible Russian air defense. But isn't it strange that at this time official sources have not confirmed any evidence of this miraculous reflection? Secondly, the Russian sources themselves limit themselves to statements that the anti-aircraft missile system successfully destroyed all targets. But there are no videos or photos anywhere to confirm this -heroic- moment. Doesn't that seem a little suspicious? After all, as we know, if anything happens in Russia, even similar to the lightning flight of a rocket, the video is already in all social networks. And now about the fictional -reflection- itself. Doesn't it seem strange to you that even in the most difficult conditions of the war in Smolensk, no one noticed that parts of Ukrainian drones or missiles disappeared from the air defense system, which could confirm this statement? Maybe because no attacks actually happened? The Kremlin is well aware that if they want to support the morale of their army and population, it is necessary to create stories about an indomitable power that seemingly continuously protects the country from all troubles. However, reality does not always correspond to such stories. Especially when it comes to actual results: the situation at the front is actually quite different. If we put everything together, we can only laugh at how the Kremlin is trying to create a new victory with the help of fantasy. And if the anti-aircraft defense really destroyed many targets, then most likely, these -targets- existed only in the fiction of Moscow propagandists. Isn't that right? This is another vivid example of how manipulation and fake news are becoming a tool for waging war, not on the front, but in the information space. But who believes all this? But only those for whom it is important to remain in the dark, without access to the truth.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/rosijska-ppo-vidbyla-ataku-na-smolensk-takogo-shhe-ne-bulo/	2025-01-22T20:16:01-08:00

When Every Signal Matters: The Story of Military Signalman Anastasia	The story of the servicemen was made public on the page of the command of the Armed Forces Communications and Cyber ​​Security Forces of Ukraine. Anastasia began her service in the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2020, when she deliberately signed a contract with the Air Force. Her decision is connected with her family heritage: her father was also a signalman, and it was his stories that became the first step in her future profession. -At first it was difficult, because I learned almost everything -from scratch-. There was anxiety and fear of making a mistake at a crucial moment. But if you strive for knowledge and improvement, everything is possible,- Anastasia shares. Before the full-scale invasion, she already felt confident in her profession. A Russian attack caught her on a combat mission on February 24, 2022. Then Anastasia provided communication in the unit under enemy fire. Now the woman says that it is combat work that helps her overcome anxiety. -When checking the connection or setting up the satellite, I concentrate as much as possible. In this moment, you think more about victory,- Anastasia smiles. The choice of profession also affected her personal life. It was in the army that she met her beloved husband, also a serviceman of the Armed Forces. -In war, we are all the same, men and women. We are performing an equally important mission - defending Ukraine. I believe that Victory will be with us!- — a confident communicator.

Half a million dollars and 100 -clients-: a mobilization evasion scheme was exposed in Kharkiv	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. Under the procedural guidance of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office, four persons were notified of the suspicion of obstructing the lawful activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations in a special period, committed by a group of persons based on a prior conspiracy, and of assisting in the illegal transportation of persons across the state border of Ukraine by removing obstacles (Part 2 of Article 28, Part 1 of Article 114-1, Part 2 of Article 332 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). According to the investigation, a 54-year-old man from Kharkiv, who was previously convicted and was serving a sentence for intentional murder, developed a device to -help- men evade mobilization. He involved his acquaintances in the -plan-: a lawyer and two retired women. The lawyer was looking for men of draft age who wanted to avoid mobilization and planned to go abroad. The women, through their own connections in the medical facilities of the region, arranged for clients to receive fictitious disabilities. The organizer of the arrangement coordinated the actions of accomplices and distributed the -income-. It is known that for the -service- the attackers announced an amount ranging from 5,000 to 8,000. US dollars. According to preliminary data, about 100 men of draft age managed to take advantage of the illegal scheme.

- Fart or experience? - how a Ukrainian mortar destroyed an enemy tank with one shot	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Bohdan has experience working with different types of mortars and can compare their effectiveness. In 2014, he worked with the Soviet 2B11 mortar, later he used the Ukrainian Hammers and the American M120 mortars, which he considers the most convenient due to their design features. Bohdan mentions two cases that are particularly memorable due to the effectiveness of mortar weapons. The first occurred in the Kherson region, where he managed to destroy an enemy MTLB carrying ammunition for the Russian infantry. And the second in Zaporizhzhia, when one of the mines hit the hatch of a Russian T-72 tank that was moving to support the infantry. Although this shot was accidental, it turned out to be fatal for enemy equipment. In addition, Bohdan notes that the mortar has repeatedly confirmed its effectiveness in destroying enemy fortifications and equipment. -Our calculation worked on the enemy infantry, but it so happened that at the moment of one of the shots, a Russian tank approached with open hatches (the ventilation of the tower in the T-72 is bad, so tankmen during intensive firing often open the hatches in order not to be poisoned by powder gases ). And our mine hit directly into the open hatch of the moving tank. It happened by accident, we were just lucky, but the fact remains that we destroyed the tank with one shot from a mortar,- says Bohdan. However, not all stories turn out the way you want them to. Bohdan recalls the case when, a few months ago, his unit came under fire from Russian artillery and aircraft. An enemy drone detected their positions, and 152 mm artillery began to work on them, covering them with 17 shells. One of the shells hit the shelter where four fighters were hiding. Bohdan was wounded, but after treatment he returned to the army. Despite the difficult tests, Bohdan firmly believes in the victory of Ukraine. -We must be prepared that the war may last longer than we hope. On the other hand, there is no other choice - we will definitely win,- he concludes. As ArmiyaInform reported, sailor Vasyl with the call sign -Robbiynyk- served in the 38th separate brigade of marines, where he heroically defended Ukraine in the Pokrovsky direction. In close combat he neutralized the enemy, took a prisoner and became an example of courage for his brothers. Vasyl is currently undergoing rehabilitation after a serious injury, but dreams of returning to the service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/22/fart-chy-dosvid-yak-ukrayinskyj-minometnyk-vidpravyv-v-utyl-vorozhyj-tank-odnym-postrilom/	2025-01-22T09:11:10-08:00

Occupiers on rubber boats swim across Oskil, but they are met by our drones	Major Viktor Tregubov, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, stated this on January 22 on the air of -Suspilne Novosti-. To the presenter's question, thanks to which the Russian military manages to advance towards the village of Dvorichna, he answered that this is due to the infiltration of the occupiers through the Oskil River. -They are constantly seeping there through Oskil. Usually at night, usually on small watercraft. Every day we register the destruction of a certain number of Russian watercraft, but these are rubber boat-class watercraft,- Viktor Tregubov said. For example, according to him, six occupants can get into a rubber boat to swim across Oskil at night or during fog and hide in a forest strip. The spokesman of the -Khortytsia- OSUV noted that Ukrainian drones hunt them both when the Russians try to cross the river and in the forest strips. -When they have already accumulated a certain number of people there, they try to carry out assault actions. Our people catch and destroy them in the forests. That's why the map always looks like it's constantly flickering. They are sometimes in Dvorichnaya, sometimes not in Dvorichnaya. They have a favorite crossing point there,- he explained. Viktor Tregubov said that the main problem for the Russians is that the Oskil River has not frozen over. -If the river had frozen over, they could have more or less fixed the logistics there. And the river is not frozen, you can't throw a pontoon across it, because there is fire control of Ukrainian troops there, which will simply destroy it instantly, and that's why they have to go in small groups like that,- he said.

-When we fight, we get our own-: Volodymyr Zelenskyi reminded Ukrainians about the lessons of histor...	The head of state published his video message on this occasion in his social networks. -Good morning, Ukraine, Ukrainians! Our state is strong, independent, because it is united and united. We always remember this, especially on this day, January 22, the Day of the Unity of Ukraine. I am recording this address in Sophia Square, a historical place, a place of strength, a place of wisdom, given to us by the events that happened here more than 100 years ago. And the subsequent episodes of our history prove that when we fight, we certainly gain ours, but when we quarrel, then we lose ours. And it was here, on this square, that the Act of Separation was proclaimed,- the greeting reads. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyi, when -discord- and -ambition- come to the fore, statehood can be lost, as it has already happened before in our history. -One's own freedom has been lost for many years, for decades. And these are several generations who lived under foreign flags, traditions, who were told how to live, how to speak, how to think, who to love, who to hate. This is what is not one's own statehood, what is the loss of independence. And every year, on this day, we always remembered these lessons of unity, we made living chains, we said how important it is to protect unity, to be side by side,- the President emphasized. At the same time, he noted that after the start of the full-scale Russian invasion, Ukrainians once again had to prove their unity. -And we came together. All Ukrainians united, not declaratively, not on paper, not by some command, but by an inner call. Millions of us together and together were able to resist, save Ukraine together, repulsed the occupier, restrained this great influx together. The power of Ukrainians is hidden in this word, it is about us, about what we are capable of when we choose not some personal ambitions, but choose Ukraine, choose its interests. When we choose not a sword, but a sword, to defend our own, to defend with all our might,- emphasized Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He also added that Sobornist is necessary for Ukrainians to ultimately win their right to live in peace. -Today I want to congratulate everyone on this day, on the Day of the Unity of Ukraine. I want to be strong, believe in myself, believe in Ukraine, know for sure that Ukrainian unity is not only about the two banks of the Dnieper, it is about our whole world, it is Ukraine today. Wherever we are, all of us who were born in different cities, towns, villages, all our soldiers, our children, doctors, volunteers, teachers, energy workers, everyone who today, wherever he is, will say, I am Ukrainian , I am Ukrainian,- the President wished.

Today is Sobornosti Day: what Ukrainians celebrate on this day	Since the end of the 17th century, our lands have been divided between different empires, so their confederation (i.e. unification into a single state entity) has become the pinnacle of social life aspirations for Ukrainians. The Ukrainian national movement presented a political program unification during the -Spring of Nations- - a series of revolutions of 1848-1849 that swept across Europe. The main Russian Rada (the first Ukrainian political organization that appeared in Lviv at the time) in the manifesto of May 10, 1848 declared its desire for the unity of the Ukrainian lands. Among the preserved materials of the Main Russian Council is an anonymous article in which it is noted: -From the Tisza behind the Carpathians, on both sides of the Dniester and Dnieper to the banks of the Don, there are settlements of one Slavic people, the number of which reaches 15 million. Therefore, the purpose of such a great nation cannot be to occupy a secondary position in Europe, to be subordinated to another-. After 1865, in a song to the words of Pavlo Chubynskyi from Dnieper and music by Mykhailo Verbytskyi from Galicia (it was this song that became the basis of the national anthem of Ukraine ) the following words appeared: -Let's stand up, brothers, in a bloody battle from the Xiang to the Don, We will not let anyone rule in our native land.- The Tarasiv Brotherhood, a secret student organization created in Poltava in 1891, proclaimed in its program: -Independent, sovereign Ukraine: cathedral and indivisible, from the Syan to the Kuban, from the Carpathians to the Caucasus.- The slogan -One, unified, indivisible, free, independent Ukraine from the Carpathians to the Caucasus- was also used by Mykola Mikhnovsky in the brochure -Independent Ukraine- (1900). The First World War, national revolutionary movements and the collapse of empires brought the realization of the dream of cathedral unity. The Ukrainian Central Rada was established in Kyiv in 1917, and on January 22, 1918, it proclaimed the independence of the Ukrainian People's Republic from Russia. And in Galicia, on the ruins of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the West Ukrainian People's Republic emerged on November 1, 1918, after the November Revolution. Its leaders initiated negotiations on the unification of Transnistrian Ukraine with Transnistrian Ukraine. On December 1, 1918, at the -Fastiv- railway station, representatives of the ZUNR and the UNR signed the -Pre-Accession Treaty- (that is, preliminary or preliminary). The agreement stated the unwavering intention of ZUNR -to merge into one large state with the Ukrainian People's Republic in the shortest possible time.- For its part, the Ukrainian National People's Republic announced its agreement -to accept the entire territory and population of the Western Ukrainian People's Republic as an integral part of the state integrity of the Ukrainian People's Republic.- The contract was signed by: Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Simon Petliura, Fedir Shvets, Panas Andrievskyi from the Ukrainian National People's Republic of Ukraine, Longyn Tsegelskyi and Dmytro Levytskyi from the National People's Republic of Ukraine. The pre-accession treaty was ratified on January 3, 1919, at the first meeting of the Ukrainian National Council, the governing body of the Ukrainian People's Republic. On January 18, a joint meeting of the Directorate and the Council of People's Ministers of the Ukrainian People's Republic was held with the participation of a delegation from Galicia, Bukovyna, and Transcarpathia. It was about the promulgation of the Act of Unification of the UNR and the ZUNR and the celebration on this occasion. The Council of Ministers instructed the Minister of National Education Ivan Ohienko to write the script of the events and personally lead all the ceremonies. It was he who proposed to organize a national holiday on the anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Ukrainian People's Republic. On January 22, 1919, on Sofia Square in Kyiv, on the first anniversary of the independence of the Ukrainian People's Republic, in a festive atmosphere the proclamation of the -Universal Directory of the Ukrainian People's Republic- (which we symbolically called the Act of Zluka). Buildings in the central part of the city were decorated with national flags, the entrance to Sofia Maidan was decorated with a triumphal arch with the coats of arms of the UNR and ZUNR. Tens of thousands of capital residents and numerous guests flocked to the central streets to the music. The choir led by Kyryll Stetsenko, accompanied by the orchestra, sang -Ukraine is not dead yet-. And the historic moment came - the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the ZUNR Longyn Tsegelskyi announced the letter, the resolution of the UNRada, and handed it over to the head of the Directorate Volodymyr Vinnychenko. In response, a member of the Directory Fedir Shvets read Universal: -&lt;&#8230;&gt; From now on, the West Ukrainian People's Republic (Galichyna, Bukovyna, and Hungarian Rus) and Trans-Dnieper Great Ukraine, separated from each other for centuries, will merge into one. The age-old dreams that the best sons of Ukraine lived and died for came true. From now on there is a single independent Ukrainian People's Republic &lt;&#8230;&gt;-. The holiday ended with a solemn prayer and a parade. The columns of Sich riflemen and Colonel Yevhen Konovalts were greeted with special enthusiasm. The next day, January 23, 1919, in the premises of the Kyiv Opera House (modern National Opera of Ukraine), the Labor Congress of Ukraine discussed the mentioned documents and approved them. By thus ratifying the Universal Directory of the UNR, the Congress gave it a legitimate legal character. The President of the UN Rada, Yevhen Petrushevich, was soon elected to the Directory. ZUNR, after merging with UNR, changed its name to Western Oblast of the Ukrainian People's Republic (ZO UNR). Unfortunately, due to the ongoing war with the Russians, the unification of UNR and ZUNR into one state was not completed . However, the Act of Zluka became a symbol and legend for subsequent generations of fighters for a free Ukraine. Yulian Bachynskyi's old slogan -from Syan to the Caucasus- was included in the words of the March of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN anthem), written in 1929 by Oleksa Babii. On August 24, 2018, a version of the song adapted to modern Ukrainian conditions became the March of the Ukrainian Army: -Our glory leads us into battle. For us, the law is the highest order! The cathedral Ukrainian is a state - one for the ages, from the Syan to the Caucasus!-. The memory of one's own state in 1917-1921 became one of the cornerstones of the formation of the modern national identity of Ukrainians, inspired the continuation of the liberation struggle . In 1990, on the occasion of the 71st anniversary of the proclamation of the separation of the UNR and ZUNR, the Ukrainian patriotic the public formed a living chain of unity from Ivano-Frankivsk to Kyiv. An example of that -Ukrainian wave- was the -Baltic Way- action by residents of the Baltic countries. How many participants came to the commemoration of the events of the Ukrainian Revolution is not known for sure: various sources say from 500 thousand to three million people who joined hands and created a continuous chain from Kyiv through Lviv to Ivano-Frankivsk. The action became a harbinger of the future fall of the USSR and the emergence of Ukraine's independence. The idea of ​​territorial integrity of the country is combined with ideas of spiritual cohesion. In the conditions of the modern Russian-Ukrainian war, sobrality acquires greater symbolism and poignancy, because now, more than ever, Ukrainians need to unite for the sake of the future. A united nation that sees its own future will certainly restore the unity of the territory. This will happen after the de-occupation of Crimea, as well as our territories in Donetsk and Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson, Mykolaiv and Kharkiv regions.

A robot to replace a sniper: American gunsmiths offered a technological rotation on the battlefield ...	As state in a post on the official website of the manufacturer, representatives of the American weapons company SWORD Defense Systems, their development ensures safe and reliable deployment of the weapon system, giving the operator the ability to load and safely use the weapon at a distance, according to ArmyInform. These features also allow the operator to troubleshoot and safely unload the platform for recovery. 6.5 Creedmoor cartridges allow accurate fire up to 1200 m. SPUR can also use the 7.62×51 NATO cartridge if suitable ammunition is available. Thanks to its powerful SPUR sensors can work in various conditions, both day and night. The development was called -Special Purpose Unmanned Rifle- (SPUR) and was made in the form of a detachable module. At one time, the SPUR self-propelled gun made its debut on the exhibition floor of the main annual convention of the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) in Washington, DC. The rifle was cooperated with the development of the Ghost Robotics company, the Vision-60 robot dog. Such four-legged robotic devices are actively being introduced to the defense market by companies from various countries and are equipped with a variety of weapons. In particular, our editorial office earlier spyni/-> told about the Thermonator robot dog, on which a compact ARC flamethrower with an electric drive is mounted. Speaking of weapon details, the SPUR is based on a semi-automatic rifle that uses a proven short-stroke piston design. The model is available in two calibers, which makes it versatile for tasks that require high accuracy at medium and long distances. For flexibility, the rifle is equipped with the following key components: Optics and sensors: — High definition day sight. — Thermal imaging module for night operations. These systems allow effective use of the rifle at any time of the day and in difficult weather conditions. Actuators are perhaps the most important part of the SPUR, turning it into an autonomous combat unit. Executive mechanisms provide: Remote charging of weapons. — Installation and removal of the fuse. - Shooting process. — Discharge and eliminate major delays. A standard magazine has a capacity of 10 rounds. This may seem like a limitation, but this choice is driven by point-use missions, not mass fire. Management is carried out remotely over a secure communication channel. The automatic ballistic system ensures accurate calculation of the trajectory of the shot, minimizing the human factor. SPUR is not just a rifle, but a system that can be integrated into different carriers. At the NDIA Future Force Capabilities Expo arms show, the rifle was demonstrated on a robot dog, which caused quite a stir. Platforms such as quadpods are highly mobile and can be used in urban environments, difficult terrain or even indoors. This demonstration highlighted SPUR's conceptual flexibility: it can be installed not only on ground robots, but also on unmanned aerial vehicles or stationary systems. Robotic systems with weapons, such as SPUR, can be used in various scenarios: - Defense of strategic assets: installed on a stationary platform, the rifle is able to monitor the area around the clock and automatically respond to threats. — Targeted military operations: SPUR use on drones or ground operations minimizes risks to the lives of operators. — Suppression of sabotage groups: thanks to the autonomous system of ballistic calculations and the capabilities of thermal imaging, SPUR becomes an effective tool for detecting and eliminating the enemy. The SPUR includes a thermal imaging camera with 30x magnification, which means that in the middle of the night, a remote operator can easily detect living and breathing targets. The Vision-60 and SPUR tandem is designed to allow soldiers to approach the target at close range without exposing themselves to danger. A new US Army robot dog with a sniper rifle.

-He screamed with joy-: the story of -Multa- from the 23rd OMBR, who burned a Russian on a quad bike	The senior soldier of the 23rd separate mechanized brigade Volodymyr with the call sign -Mult- is the master of the unmanned aerial systems battalion of the unmanned systems battalion. Until 2015, he worked as a dispatcher of -Poltavaoblenergo- in the Kobelyak branch. This was his home field for the last 17 years. In 2015-2018, served in the ranks of the 27th reactive artillery brigade (senior mechanic-driver on BMP-1 and BMP-2 and Uragan BM). Then he served in the Military Commissariat for another 6 months, and then went abroad. He worked as an electrician in the Czech Republic, Poland and Germany. He states that he earned less than he could earn in a similar position in Kyiv. -In the capital - 50 thousand hryvnias, and in Europe, the work of an electrician is paid at the level of 35-40 thousand hryvnias,- says the military man. However, with the large-scale invasion, -Mult- returned to Ukraine with his wife - she then left for Europe again with her two daughters, and our interlocutor began, as it often happened, to -storm- the Military Commissariat - the same, native one where he once served. -I went to them for two weeks and asked to be accepted into the army. It was a pike(laughs - ed.). Somehow they call and ask if I am ready to leave at 6 in the morning. I agreed, packed my bag, took a pack of cigarettes. We were brought to Cherkassy in the 93rd Brigade. Then there were two busloads of people, about a hundred people, and only 13 of us were taken. I was among them. In my military ticket it was written that I was a senior mechanic-driver. I was asked if I would go to the APC. I replied that I could go even to BRDM. To which I was answered: -Well, then you will be a grenade launcher,- -Mult- recalls his story. A month of training followed, and the trooper became a proficient user of both the Needle and the Stinger. In 2022, he recalls, just in time for Easter, the brigade went on combat missions in the Raisin direction, in Barvinkovo. Then our units managed to pass and clear 30 kilometers of territory. -Once, my partner and I dug a 2-person dugout for ourselves - but we never spent the night there. An urgent telegram came for the rotation, and three days later we were in Bahmut.- They held the defense and fought for the city for 2 months. In the battles for this city, -Mult- was wounded - -Uragan- served in the positions of the Armed Forces. -The shells fell 2 meters from us. My brother was burned, I was thrown 7 meters.- After that, he served in the Kharkiv Military Commissariat for 5 months. From October 31, 2024, -Mult- is in the ranks of the 23rd separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in the battalion of unmanned systems. -Back in 2022, in the 93rd Brigade, I bought myself a drone. Two pieces. I am self-taught in general, I love technology. I used to solder phones (laughs - ed.). That's how I became the master of the BPAK shock unit,- the army man shares. On November 24, 2024, there was a particularly tasty exercise against the enemy. This combat episode is described in the -Khortytsia- OSUV as follows: during the performance of combat missions to detect and identify enemy ground and air targets, UAV strikes by dropping weapons from the UAV on enemy targets, senior soldier Volodymyr Kononenko discovered two enemy BBMs, ATV and 47 enemy manpower. -Thanks to his skillful and decisive actions, nine servicemen of the USSR were killed, 28 were wounded, an ATV and an anti-aircraft vehicle were damaged,- the command emphasizes. -Mult- describes this episode succinctly, but emotionally: -I was flying, and I see a quadric.- I took it and threw it at him. And this was my first shot like this! I was screaming with joy!-, the serviceman does not hide his emotions. When we ask whether, with all his baggage of experience, he still had to go through a course of basic general military training, the army man laughs heartily, nods in the affirmative, and asks us to guess in which year. It turns out that in 2024. But notes that it was interesting. -As a MANPADSman, I have never conducted assaults. And during the BZVP, we practiced the skills of assault and trenches, and buildings.- Success on the battlefield, in the words of -Multa-, now depends largely on technology. -The more drones, the better,- he succinctly emphasizes. &#8230; On Thursday, December 12, 2024, there was a big Russian offensive in the direction of Kurakhovo. -And on Friday, the 13th, my circle -smashed-. Tore off the fingers on the right hand.- So far, the military has already carried out five operations. Treatment is ongoing. When asked the traditional question about how he would advise civilians to overcome their fear and join the Defense Forces, Mult says: -Just get over that fear. During my time in the army, I must have been up there 10 times already. I want to get a tattoo: the number -10- with wings, with the face of a ragdoll doll.- Photo is from the personal archive of a serviceman	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/22/azh-vereshhav-vid-radoshhiv-istoriya-multa-iz-23-ombr-yakyj-spalyv-rosiyan-na-kvadroczykli/	2025-01-21T20:31:17-08:00
Fake about -energy catastrophe in the EU-: how many lies in one gas pipe	The first wave of disinformation began back in 2022, when the EU announced a reduction in dependence on Russian energy carriers. the Kremlin launched the thesis: -Europe will not survive the winter without our gas.- Then, when the winter passed, and Europeans still did not freeze in their apartments, the dark people changed: now the emphasis was on the -long-term damage- to the economy. It was a classic approach: first to intimidate, then to push to the conclusion that -without Russia, there is nowhere.- Only the script did not work. In reality, the Russian economy is suffering from sanctions, and the Europeans are just wondering how long they endured energy blackmail. Europe is confidently walking the path of energy independence, building its strategy on real achievements and not on propaganda myths. Meanwhile, Russia is still trying to sell the world the fiction that -everything is lost- without it. Perhaps the Kremlin should apply to Hollywood - screenwriters are valued there. True, only the talentless are not hired - so the chances are small. The lie that Europe cannot survive without Russian energy carriers is an attempt to save face in a situation where Russia has lost on all fronts. The EU is alive and developing, but the Kremlin has to sit on the -gas needle-, no longer having anyone to supply its raw materials to.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/22/fejk-pro-energetychnu-katastrofu-v-yes-skilky-brehni-v-odnij-gazovij-trubi/	2025-01-21T20:07:01-08:00

The first call sign she got was -Leila-, but it didn't stick. Her real nickname was -Batman,- and it was this name that stuck with her after an incident with a hat she made from a buff that resembled Batman's ears. -It's not just a call sign, it's a part of me. I train our boys and girls, because I know that life depends on physical training. Each of us must be ready for everything, even for the most difficult conditions,- says -Batman-. She emphasizes the importance of physical training, because it helps not only to withstand physical exertion, but also to strengthen the will. Thanks to her perseverance, not only physical strength, but also moral endurance develops under her guidance. -My job is not just to train, but to motivate. Each soldier must be prepared not to become a burden to his unit. I always make it clear that fitness is not just about us, it's about our brothers and sisters,- she says. Natalya is now training recruits, preparing them for real battles. -These are people from different professions, with different experiences, but with one thing in common: they have motivation. And this is the most important thing. The war shows what every person is capable of in extreme conditions. They learn not to give up and to go to the end,- she concludes. As reported by ArmyInform, -Zaets- is the commander of a platoon of attack UAVs from the 22nd OMBr of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which turns the latest technologies into weapons against the enemy. Thanks to his knowledge and skill, he not only effectively manages operations, but also proves that even two drones can destroy an enemy tank.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/21/instruktorka-betmen-zhinka-yaka-gartuye-sylu-i-duh-novobrancziv/	2025-01-21T11:52:04-08:00

According to him, the occupation the authorities initially announced the start of repair work on January 20, but the work was postponed to January 23. The water supply is promised to be restored only on January 28, which means that people will be without drinking water for at least 10 days. In many settlements in the occupied Luhansk region, the problem of access to water has become chronic. Local -authorities- have repeatedly demonstrated their inability to quickly respond to emergency situations, which only worsens the humanitarian crisis in the region. Artem Lysogor emphasized that such long delays in restoring water supply are the result of inefficient management and the occupiers' careless attitude to the basic needs of the population. The lack of drinking water against the backdrop of winter is becoming a serious problem for residents. People are forced to look for alternative sources of water supply or wait for the occupation authorities to fulfill their promises, which may be delayed indefinitely. Accidents at infrastructural facilities and the lack of a timely response from the occupation administration have become characteristic of the temporarily occupied territories. People left in these conditions face a lack not only of water, but also of other basic services, which makes their lives even more difficult.

How the border guards of the -Forpost- brigade use Mavic drones: the experience of -French-, -Nexus-...	The State Border Service of Ukraine informed about the peculiarities of drone operators' work. A drone operator with the callsign -French- notes that positioning is one of the key aspects of a successful operation. According to him, movement to locations is complicated by difficult conditions - broken roads and swamp. Fighters are forced to stay in their positions for at least four days. -We have prepared a dugout for ourselves, because basements and houses are a good target for the enemy. And the dugout and the correct location allow you to stay hidden and perform the task effectively,- he says. The operator of the UAV -Nexus- explained that the main losses of drones occur not only due to combat operations, but also due to technical failures. -The drone can crash due to firmware problems or failure of the gimbal, the camera's stabilizing system. Often this becomes critical, as the operator loses the ability to see the route,- he notes. The technician with the call sign -Fin- is responsible for the repair of all types of reconnaissance and attack drones. According to him, the most common malfunctions are body damage, gimbal failure and loss of drone beams. -Engine failure is less common, but it also needs attention. The success of combat missions depends on the quality of repairs,- he explains. According to French, UAV operators play an important role in protecting infantry. They accompany military units, monitor possible threats and even mine approaches to positions. -We are doing everything possible to keep the infantrymen safe. We understand how difficult the positions are, so we try to make their work easier,- the operator emphasizes. The experience of the fighters of the -Forpost- brigade confirms that effective aerial reconnaissance is the coordinated work of operators, technicians and the entire unit. As reported by ArmyInform, Oleg Gerva with the call sign -Gera-, commander of the mortar battery of the 67th separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, ten years ago heroically held the defense Donetsk Airport (DAP).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/21/yak-prykordonnyky-brygady-forpost-vykorystovuyut-drony-mavic-dosvid-franczuza-neksusa-i-fina/	2025-01-21T09:08:37-08:00
30,000 kits of poor quality: the Kyiv company was exposed in a supply scam	This is reported by the SBU. In Kyiv, the Security Service exposed two founders of a private company that supplied wholesale batches of low-quality military uniforms to National Guard units. It is documented that between March and October 2023, those involved shipped 30,000 units of clothing for Ukrainian defenders with a total cost of UAH 28.7 million. The examination initiated by the Security Service showed that the military uniform purchased with state funds was sewn using hardware that did not meet the technical conditions. In particular, the materials used have a lower class of wear resistance, so a serviceman will not be able to reliably fix protective ammunition and weapons with ammunition on such clothing. Accordingly, this may pose a real threat to the life and health of Ukrainian soldiers on the front line. According to the case materials, the defendants deliberately -saved- on quality materials in order to buy cheaper components and thus make more profit. During the searches, commercial documentation and a hard drive with evidence of embezzlement were found in the residences of the participants. So far, the SBU investigators have informed both founders of the enterprise about the suspicion for h. 2 Art. 28, ch. 5th century 191 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (possession of property by abuse of official position, committed on a particularly large scale by prior conspiracy by a group of persons under martial law). Offenders face up to 12 years in prison with confiscation of property. An investigation is underway to bring all those responsible to justice. Comprehensive measures were carried out under the procedural guidance of the Specialized Prosecutor's Office in the sphere of defense of the Central region.

The President of Ukraine called on Europe to increase defense spending and jointly create air defens...	About this he said during a speech to the participants of the World Economic Forum in Davos. The head of state noted that despite the fact that Russia's overall economic potential is much smaller than Europe's, the Russian Federation produces several times more ammunition and military equipment than all of Europe combined. In addition, Russia is increasing cooperation with Iran and North Korea. That is why it is important to maintain unity in Europe. -We need a common European policy in the field of security and defense, and all European countries should be ready to spend on security as much as is really necessary, and not as much as they have become accustomed to through years of neglect. If defense requires 5% of GDP, then it should be 5%,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President emphasized that Ukraine has created models of defense cooperation that can make the whole of Europe stronger. It is about the joint production of artillery and drones, including unique ones that have no analogues in the world. In addition, the head of state called to jointly create air defense systems that can deal with all types of cruise and ballistic missiles. -Europe needs its own Iron Dome capable of resisting any threats. We cannot rely on the goodwill of a few capitals when it comes to Europe's security,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He also emphasized that no European country should depend on one energy supplier, especially Russia, and the policy of US President Donald Trump can help in this matter. Separately, the head of state noted that Europe must be able to guarantee peace and security for itself and for others. -Europe deserves to be strong. And for this, Europe needs the EU and NATO. Is it possible without Ukraine and without a fair end to Russia's war against Ukraine? I'm sure not. Only real security guarantees for us will be real security guarantees for everyone in Europe. And we must ensure that America also considers us necessary,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy concluded.

According to them, the prisoner fell into their hands after another assault on Ukrainian positions, when the enemy realized that it would not be possible to break through and began to retreat. -Then they were chased away by mortars, skirmishes. Towards the end of the assaults, one of the drones said that a body was moving. They said to check who it is. We got together and ran out. We were corrected by drones where to go to see it. When they approached, they saw a green scarf-pipe on top of their heads, they thought it was ours. They asked if he needed help, he did not answer. When they came closer, they saw narrow eyes. They saw that the armor is not ours&#8230; Gestures showed what he had to do. He had a grenade and a knife on his armor. They told him to throw it all away,- shared one of the Ukrainian soldiers. The fighters also recall that when they searched the prisoner, in one of his summaries, they unexpectedly discovered a sausage that the soldier from the DPRK had taken with him on the assault for some reason. -We showed him the direction to follow us.

Can Polish tanks withstand ATGM strikes: ArmiyaInform report from Donetsk region	About the capabilities of PT-91 tanks in battle, the destruction of racist targets at short distances, and why the enemy wants to cut the Pokrovsk-Kostiantynivka highway so much further in the ArmyInform material. Getting to the -hiding places- of our tanks is another quest. We leave in the morning, overcome broken asphalt and field roads, behind more or less -living- settlements. The closer to the front line, the more broken villages where almost no one lives. The extreme part of the path is on a wet and viscous field, the swamp hits the car with -shards-. Ahead is a plantation, where Polish PT-91 Twardy tanks are hidden. Cars in caponiers, well camouflaged, nearby we can see a field warehouse with ammunition. From the outside, it is almost impossible to understand what is here. Even in winter, among bare trees. Neither enemy UAVs nor other enemy intelligence can detect tanks. -You can't get here on foot, although, of course, you can,- says the pickup truck driver who accompanied us with a smile, -somehow the guys took more than two hours to get through this wet field, and then we spent half a day washing them from the swamp.- Let's meet, tank platoon commander Andriy. He is from Kharkiv Oblast. In 2004, he graduated from the military department of the Kharkiv Institute of Tank Troops. After the large-scale invasion, he was mobilized into the ZSU. He underwent retraining at the National Academy of Ground Forces in Lviv. -In Lviv, a group of tank officers was formed for training at a training center in Poland. There they learned to work on PT-91 tanks. We mastered the technique together with the crews. After 1.5 months of training in 2023, together with these tanks, they went to Ukraine to perform combat missions. First, the Zaporizhzhia direction, now here in the Pokrovska district we are -piling up- on the occupiers,- says Andriy. -In short, the PT-91 Twardy tank is a third-generation Polish main battle tank modeled after the Soviet T-72 tank. In fact, these two tanks do not differ in any way. A combat vehicle weighing approximately 45 tons. The RT-91 tank uses active armor developed by Polish ERAWA: these are 400 protective blocks with a coating that reduce the visibility of the combat vehicle in the infrared and radar ranges. There are additionally welded protective blocks that should protect against projectile fragments of various calibers. Also, additional armor is installed to preserve the lives of tank crews from the hits of anti-tank missile systems. Considering the aerial threat posed by enemy UAVs, an anti-cumulative -brazier structure- is attached on top. Regarding weapons. The caliber of the gun is 125 mm, the Kalashnikov tank machine gun is 7.62 mm. Plus there is a 12.7 mm anti-aircraft machine gun, but it is practically not used on the battlefield. After all, the machine gun itself was developed in the 60s of the last century to be used against helicopters. The rotorcraft in those days did not fly fast, they were clumsy, so the tank commander could safely climb onto the armor and strike at them. Now, in times of mass use by the enemy of small UAVs at high altitudes, this capability of the tank is not used at all. If we talk about FPV drones, then only the -barbecue- will help effectively. The tank is equipped with a smoke grenade launcher, in addition, there is a night vision device. The chassis works stably. The maximum that we managed, it seems, the mechanic squeezed 60 km/h out of the tank on a dirt road. The car can maneuver over difficult terrain and overcome water obstacles. Overcomes fords and swampy areas up to 1 meter. Of course, you need to choose roads wisely, because you can drive into a swamp and sit -on your stomach-. It is not easy to pull a multi-ton car out of there. Lately, work has been very dynamic in the Pokrovsky area. Depending on the combat tasks, we work both with direct fire and from closed firing positions. The targets are diverse: accumulation of manpower, enemy equipment, shelters, some kind of dugouts. Most often, we use direct strikes here. At the same time, the firing distance was different: a kilometer, 500 m, 300 m, even up to 200 meters to the enemy. As it usually happens. For example, the command was given to the car crew to -dismantle enemy shelters where small assault groups have gathered- or perhaps a situation where the enemy is trying to break through the defenses of our units with infantry. The target can be located in a settlement or in a forest plantation -in the gray zone-. A tank equipped with EW goes on a mission, it is accompanied by an air reconnaissance unit, the commander at the control point -monitors- the video of the battle through the UAV. The tank crew must have full situational awareness on the battlefield. Conventionally speaking, the tank reaches the forest plantation, the -fire- command goes and that's it - the target is destroyed. If a direct hit, a second strike is no longer necessary. Of course, a Polish tank can fire up to 6 shots per minute. Just the other day, during one day of combat work, only one tank crew engaged the enemy 3 times with -direct fire-. Then the tankers shot the enemy at a distance of up to 200 meters. Is there anything left of the shelter and the raschits themselves? Judging by radio intercepts, no, only frantic Russian screams and continuous -mother- could be heard. So you understand, our work is -high-adrenaline-. The tank crew completed the task, rolled back, then headed to the -sink-. From closed firing positions, the tank works already at considerable distances. It is 8, 9 or even 10 km. In Donetsk region, it is more necessary to destroy the Rashists with -direct fire-. This is due to the high intensity of combat operations and the use of enemy assault groups in the area of ​​responsibility of our unit. We destroy the enemy with filigree precision. There has never been a case where a detected target was not hit. There is no significant difference whether these are small infantry groups advancing in the -gray zone- or a single unit of enemy equipment. There are coordinates, targeting and boom! Somehow, from closed firing positions, it was possible to destroy a Russian tank and BMP, which were moving in a column of enemy heavy equipment. It was about 8 km to the enemy. The boys and I didn't know anything about it. The combatant reported, said: -Well done, you got it!-. In general, during the two years of the war, so much enemy equipment was -placed- that you can't remember everything. At first, they exterminated the Rashists in Zaporozhye in the Rabotine district, now near Pokrovsk. In combat conditions, it is very important to maintain the survivability of the crew. People's lives matter, machinery is replaceable. The enemy is also hunting our tankers. Once one of our Twardys was hit by an anti-tank guided missile. The car stopped and caught fire, but the boys got out. Of course, the car stayed there because it couldn't move on its own. The crew left that place on foot. Good thing enemy FPV drones weren't working then. It happened that enemy shells burst very close, shrapnel hit the car. Then the boys were simply concussed, but they completed the task. The task of the Russian occupying forces is to take control of the main routes in Donetsk region, through which our troops are supplied -at zero-. Therefore, the enemy is trying to cut off the main logistics route Pokrovsk-Kostyantynivka for the Defense Forces. The enemy attacks in this direction continuously. The tactics of the Rashists are unchanged - they advance in small assault groups, infiltrate a certain area in the -gray zone- and try to advance to our positions. In some places, mechanized equipment is also used to lift the slats. But at the stages of their movement, our aerial scouts -fix- the movement and the coordinates are transmitted to the fire attack.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/21/chy-vytrymuyut-polski-tanky-udary-ptrk-reportazh-armiyainform-z-donechchyny/	2025-01-20T20:44:55-08:00
On the finish line: the US has decided on a site for the assembly of aircraft that will replace the ...	According to site The Defense Post, FLRAA is an ongoing program designed to replace aging helicopters UH- 60 Black Hawk and AH-64 Apache for modernized convertible aircraft, ArmyInform notes. Located near the company's Air Defense Center in Beech Field, this facility will conduct all manufacturing work for the initiative and will be supported by Bell's manufacturing network in Texas. Additional fuselage development will be conducted at the firm's Advanced Composite Center in Fort Worth, and final assembly of the aircraft will be conducted in Amarillo. Operations at the Wichita hub are expected to begin -in the next few months,- the company said. . -As Bell prepares for the next phase of FLRAA engineering and manufacturing, we are committed to investing in advanced manufacturing to deliver exceptional performance at an affordable price for our customers.- - said Bell CEO and President Lisa Atherton. -Textron has a rich history with the state of Kansas as well as the city of Wichita, and we are proud to deepen that relationship with this new venture.- Bell Textron awarded the main development contract FLRAA systems for the US Army in December 2022, with the company's V-280 Valor selected as the program airframe. Platform components will be sourced from various partners: Safran for the aircraft's high-voltage generator, Eaton for hydraulics, GE Aerospace for avionics, and Astronics for power and distribution systems. At the same time, CAE will supply flight simulators for the appropriate training of crews under this program. In August, the U.S. Army authorized Bell Textron to proceed with the development of the V-280 prototype. The first production aircraft is due to arrive by 2030. So, how do its creators see the successor to the famous American helicopters UH-60 Black Hawk and AH-64 Apache? The Bell V-280 Valor is a multipurpose convertible designed for the transportation of people and cargo, as well as for special operations. According to the customer's technical task, it should have a load capacity at the level of modern army helicopters, but surpass them in terms of flight characteristics. The V-280 has a streamlined fuselage with a cross-section close to rectangular. The bow part is reserved for the pilots' cabin, and in the center is the cargo-passenger cabin. A high-mounted wing is attached to the fuselage, at the ends of which there are two motorized nacelles. The tail feathers are V-shaped. The total length of the convertible is 15.4 m, the wingspan is about 25 m. The two propellers are 10.7 m in diameter. The dry weight of the machine reaches 8.2 tons, and the maximum take-off weight is 14 tons. The V-280 is capable of carrying up to 4.5 tons of cargo both inside the cabin and on external suspension. The cabin is designed for 10-11 passengers. The Valor test sample was equipped with two General Electric T64-419 turboshaft engines. Serial equipment will be equipped with a pair of Rolls-Royce AE 1107F engines with a capacity of more than 6,000 hp. k.s. everyone This decision was made to increase the overall characteristics, as well as for partial unification with the V-22 Osprey convertibles. The V-280 screw motor group has an original design. The motor nacelle and the engine are fixed on the wing, and the nose part of the nacelle with the propeller sleeve can move in the vertical plane for different flight modes. The engine and propeller are connected through an original Bell-Textron gearbox that provides power transmission in all hub positions. The onboard radio-electronic equipment of the V-280 meets Pentagon standards and includes all necessary command and control instruments, as well as navigation and communication systems. BREO allows you to control the convertible in all modes and solve transport tasks. The Valor's maximum design speed exceeds 550 km/h. Cruiser - 520 km/h. The practical height limit is declared at the level of 1800 m code. The combat radius of the flight is 1-1.4 thousand. km, and the driving range is 3900 km. The main advantage of the V-280 is its high flight characteristics. According to such parameters, it surpasses any helicopter of the US Army Aviation. In comparison, the maximum speed of the UH-60 is only 295 km/h, and the maximum range is 2.2 thousand. km With the appearance of the V-280 Valor, US Army aviation will receive new capabilities. Aviation units, as before, will be able to transport people and cargo both in the rear and in combat zones. However, the speed of transportation will increase significantly. Convertibles will be able to transport the same cargo faster than helicopters or make more flights in the same time, increasing the volume of transportation. However, Valor is not the only project in the design -portfolio- of Bell Textron Inc. As reported ArmyInform, this American aircraft corporation in February this year presented its plans for the development of a high-speed the next-generation Sprint X-plane convertible. Convertoplan Bell V-280.

A British colony, you say? The enemy is once again trying to sell lies with Soviet dust	Well, it's worth figuring out who is the colony here, and who is chasing after his -methodics- again. Let's start with the main thing: such a -contract- does not exist. In June 2023, Ukraine and Great Britain signed a Memorandum of Partnership, which provides for cooperation in the defense, economic and political spheres. And this is a standard international practice that in no way makes one country a colony of another. But, of course, Russian propagandists decided to put on their rose-colored imperial glasses and see what is not there. Probably, for them the very word -partnership- sounds like something suspicious - because they are used to a hierarchy where someone always has to be the master. The history of Russia is a history of chronic fear of the freedom of others. They built an empire for centuries, where the whip and fear were the main tools of power. Therefore, it is difficult for them to understand how countries can be equal partners and not master and slave. In addition, Britain has long become a -horror- for Russian propaganda. There are -insidious Anglo-Saxons-, and -a prime minister who makes decisions in a sauna with Zelensky-, and even mentions that Britain supposedly -rules the whole world-. Probably, it is even more difficult for them to come to terms with the fact that Ukraine builds partnerships that bring real benefits, and not -gas deals- or -grain blockades-. If Russia is so fond of handing out labels, it should take a look at itself. Didn't Russia colonize nations for centuries? Didn't Moscow force Ukrainians, Belarusians, Georgians, Kazakhs and other nations to dance to its tune? And now, when Ukraine is finally breaking out of this toxic addiction, they are trying to portray us again as a disenfranchised colony. But unlike their imperial reality, our treaties with partners are based on mutual benefit and respect. Trying to convince the world that Ukraine has become a British colony looks like an anecdote from a series of -Putin fairy tales.- Because if Ukraine is a colony, then Russia, it turns out, is a -great democratic state.- But even that already sounds ridiculous. It's amazing how, in a world where there are so many facts, Russia still tries to sell cheap fakes. But you know, let them fantasize further. Meanwhile, we will build a future with those who know what freedom and partnership are, not colonialism and lies.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/21/brytanska-koloniya-kazhete-vorog-vkotre-namagayetsya-prodaty-brehnyu-z-radyanskym-pylom/	2025-01-20T20:09:14-08:00
- There were ten or more departures per day - military man Vadim saved about 100 wounded	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -I was working when the enemy surrounded Chernihiv. There were ten or more departures per day. Then the chairman did not think about how many people you brought,- Vadim noted. All these wounded servicemen were evacuated while the enemy was ravaging Chernihiv Oblast. He recalls one particular story that will forever remain in his memory. -In Chernihiv, the enemy fired at civilian infrastructure. One of the injured is a civilian man whose leg was torn off above the knee. Someone from the civilian or military applied a Soviet -Esmarch- tourniquet to him, and the man was taken to a military hospital&#8230; in the trunk of a civilian car,- Vadim recalls. When they opened the trunk, they saw that it was covered in blood. -They thought that the person was not alive. But I checked the pulse on the carotid artery - it was there,- the man said. He quickly took out a tourniquet from the first aid kit and put it on the wounded man. When he twisted the noose, the man screamed in pain. It was a sign that he was still fighting for his life. In the end, he was saved. As reported by ArmiyaInform, junior sergeant Bohdan with the call sign -White-, a pilot of the battalion of strike unmanned aircraft systems of the 38th Marine Corps Brigade, became a true symbol of accurate and merciless revenge on the occupiers. During his service, he sent about 250 Russian soldiers to hell. .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/vyyizdiv-bulo-i-desyat-i-bilshe-za-den-vijskovyj-vadym-vryatuvav-blyzko-100-poranenyh/	2025-01-20T11:51:28-08:00
A terminally ill father and a tearful story: a man from Kyiv was detained at the border with false d...	About this informs State Border Service of Ukraine. The men claimed they were on their way to visit relatives, and the son, who is a conscript, produced documents purporting to prove that his father was terminally ill and required constant care. However, the border guards discovered that the documents showed signs of forgery. They did not correspond to the official model and contained errors. Because of this, the Kyivan was refused to leave the border, and in his actions they see signs of a criminal offense under Art. 358 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine — -Forgery of documents or their use.- The State Border Service reminds of the futility of attempts to use forged documents when crossing the border. Thanks to modern inspection equipment and qualified personnel, border guards ensure reliable control and protection of the state border.

Every attack is someone's life,- Lyuty says. According to him, the -Shershni Dovbush- unit works on one of the most difficult areas of the front, where Russian troops constantly carry out assaults and offensive actions. -In the Pokrovsky direction, they are coming in droves, constantly, but we can see them clearly and destroy them,- the commander notes. -Lyuty- emphasizes that his unit works non-stop: -Guys come from the road, immediately get to work, dig positions, arrange them and from the first day begin to perform tasks.

Oleg -Hera-: 10 years of war — from the defense of the Donetsk airport to the battles in Kurshchyna	The story of the fighter was published on January 20 on the brigade's page. -Ruins, smoke, constant sounds of explosions - Russian artillery, mortars, tanks were working on us. Sometimes it came to close combat. The enemy tried to destroy everything that was still intact. But we didn't give up,- Oleg recalls, talking about those difficult days. In 2014, after mobilization, Oleg returned from earning money abroad, where he worked as a welder at large infrastructure facilities. When the war began, he could not stay away and went to the Military Commissariat, where after a short training he was assigned to the 95th Airmobile Brigade, and later to the 90th Separate Airmobile Battalion. From the first days of his stay at the Donetsk airport, Oleg saw it destroyed and covered with smoke, as if from a picture of the apocalypse. Defense of the airport area became more and more difficult: lack of ammunition, food, water and constant cold. -The hardest thing was when we lost our brothers. It is the greatest pain when you realize that they no longer have a chance to survive,- shares the memories of -Hera-. Oleg's main task was to provide defense from the control tower, where the enemy repeatedly tried to break through. This point was key to controlling the airport. Then he not only led the defense, but also gave numerous commands, adjusting the fire of the mortar battery and destroying the enemy. Oleg does not forget his brothers who showed incredible courage during the defense of the airport. He mentions Ihor Branovytsky, who was captured while trying to help his seriously wounded comrades, and who was tortured for it. -He became a Hero of Ukraine posthumously,- says Oleg. Other heroes from DAP, such as Anatoly -Spartanets- Sviryd and Ruslan -Baghdad- Borovyk, had a great influence on Oleg. The -Spartan- was known for his courage and motivation for his brothers, and Ruslan, having released a photo book about the defense of DAP, became a symbol of struggle and resilience. -We have not surrendered the airport. Every meter of this territory cost the enemy dozens of their lives. We have shown that even in the most difficult conditions it is possible to remain invincible,- Oleg is confident. In the ten years that have passed since those events, Oleg has not stopped at what he has achieved. Despite the injury, disability and long years of rehabilitation after several operations, he returned to service. Today, he is the commander of a mortar battery unit and continues to destroy the enemy in the Kursk direction. -I want to say to those who are struggling right now: don't give up. We, the guys from DAP, held the defense when it seemed that we had no strength left. But we persevered. Your fortitude is your most powerful weapon,- adds the unit commander, talking about the continuous struggle for Ukraine. As reported by ArmiyaInform, Denys Gubernator, a former football player, after being wounded in the Donbass, decided to go into self-defense in order to return home and rest. After a year of rehabilitation and struggle with his own emotions, he realized that he could not leave his brothers at the front. Later he joined the -Charters- where his father serves.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/oleg-gera-10-rokiv-vijny-vid-zahystu-doneczkogo-aeroportu-do-boyiv-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-20T10:37:15-08:00

NATO's Supreme Commander for Transformation, Admiral Pierre Wandier, emphasized that one of the main areas of research is the combination of modern technologies in the Ukrainian war with brutal trench warfare and artillery shelling. -Ukrainian soldiers fight in the trenches and use artillery as it was customary more than a century ago, but they also use drones, artificial intelligence and space communication. As a result, Ukrainian artillery has become more effective and more lethal,- he said. According to him, studying the Ukrainian experience will allow NATO to quickly respond to modern threats and remain a strategically reliable organization. We will remind you that the decision on -ta-nato/->launch JATEC was approved based on the results of the meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council at the level of defense ministers February 15, 2024.

The Ministry of Defense has updated the system for checking the quality of property for the Armed Fo...	About the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported. To control the quality of material property received by servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Ministry of Defense uses an updated procedure for receiving it. According to the new algorithm, things that do not meet the requirements as a result of the inspection are returned to suppliers with reasoned remarks. Those, in their turn, should take into account the recommendations and return the material property already of appropriate quality. From December 2023, the Central Department of Quality Control began to change the system of acceptance of tangible property. When the new algorithm was just launched, between February and March 2024, 30-35% of products were returned to suppliers due to non-compliance. However, over the course of the year, thanks to the updated rules, the situation improved - and now this figure does not exceed 10%. -Providing the Armed Forces of Ukraine with quality property is not only a matter of standards, but also of trust in the state. The new approach to quality control creates transparent conditions that encourage suppliers to meet the highest standards. This is another step towards increasing the efficiency and fairness of the defense procurement system,- said Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. In December 2023, the procedure for checking property samples in testing laboratories was resumed. This made it possible to carry out a study of all indicators of raw materials and tangible property materials supplied under concluded contracts for the needs of the Armed Forces, and to identify the possible use of low-quality materials by suppliers for the manufacture of goods. In addition, the Ministry of Defense entered into an agreement with the British State watch fund, which finances the work of an independent laboratory to conduct a re-audit in case of suspicion of biased test results. Also, the Central Department of Quality Control has changed the place of acceptance of the property - it is delivered to the supply base and checked directly at the warehouses to avoid possible substitution. Previously, the supplier could deliver tangible property directly to the units after inspection at the factory. -The main task of the Central Quality Control Department was to create such conditions that would centrally prevent the participation of companies supplying low-quality property in tenders. This is possible only thanks to the creation of an evidence base,- said the head of the department Ihor Leshchenko. For the objectivity of the conclusions, the inspection is now not carried out individually, but by a collegial decision and is recorded on video. In case of violations, the video serves as an evidence base for both the manufacturer and law enforcement agencies. In addition, the introduction of a new algorithm for accepting tangible property is designed to prevent the pressure of interested parties on the bodies of the Ministry of Defense. The process is established by regulations and orders of the Ministry of Defense. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of will coordinate with the NATO Science and Technology Organization (NATO Science and Technology Organization — STO) research in the military field.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/minoborony-onovylo-systemu-perevirky-yakosti-rechovogo-majna-dlya-zbrojnyh-syl-ukrayiny/	2025-01-20T06:24:20-08:00

Even last year, the Russian occupation administration appointed the first so-called chieftains, who headed the first Cossack cells in the TOT.

How reported ArmyInform, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, stated that it is forbidden to transfer highly qualified personnel of the Air Force Forces specializing in aircraft maintenance, in the infantry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/sotni-tysyach-soldativ-golovnokomanduvach-zsu-nazvav-vtraty-armiyi-rf-mynulogo-roku/	2025-01-19T23:55:21-08:00
Defense forces received more than 30 new models of small arms and grenade launchers in 2024	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informs about this. The list of codified samples includes pistols, machine guns, assault and sniper rifles produced by arms concerns of Germany, the Czech Republic, Belgium, the USA, etc. Among the samples of small arms approved for use are products of Ukrainian gunsmiths, in particular, a universal shotgun that can be used both against enemy infantry and against drones. -The level of the army's capabilities is assessed primarily by its arsenal of weapons. It is important not only the number of tanks, artillery systems, MLRS, but also what the infantry are armed with. New tools of war in the hands of our soldiers means more opportunities on the battlefield. Modern small arms and grenade launchers from the world's leading arms manufacturers and domestic gunsmiths allow our soldiers to shoot more accurately and hit the enemy at greater distances. Better characteristics of weapons, greater reliability are the factors on which both the results of combat missions and the lives of our soldiers depend,- said the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Ivan Havryliuk. Ukrainian servicemen who use small arms of Western production in combat conditions note its high efficiency. These weapon samples are distinguished by better accuracy and firing range. Soldiers also highly appreciate the ergonomics and ease of use of Western-made assault rifles and machine guns. In addition, Western-made assault rifles use 5.56 x 45 mm NATO cartridges, which have a higher bullet energy than the Soviet 5.45 x 39 mm small arms ammunition. And therefore, Western weapons have an advantage in killing action. Compared to Soviet or Russian models, the products of European or American gunsmiths are also distinguished by a much higher culture of factory execution. All grenade launchers codified during 2024 have NATO calibers of 40 and 84 mm. Among them are products of European and American arms concerns. Among the Ukrainian models approved for operation are a hand-held grenade launcher and a 40-mm underbarrel grenade launcher. As reported by ArmyInform, during 9 months of 2024, the Defense Department codified and roczi-povidomlennya-vid-minoborony/->allowed 175 samples for use in the Defense Forces vehicles, including 76 domestically produced.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/syly-oborony-otrymaly-ponad-30-novyh-zrazkiv-strileczkoyi-zbroyi-ta-granatometiv-u-2024-roczi/	2025-01-19T23:43:32-08:00

Under the pretext of the need to report on the expenditure of charitable funds, criminals ask to record a video message with thanks and to provide their identity documents.

The National Police urges citizens to be alert and attentive and in no case send money, personal data and documents to unverified persons in order not to become victims of fraudsters.

-Collect the frame-: as an actor and soldier, Maksym Devizorov helps veterans return to life	The guest of ArmiyaInform was the well-known Ukrainian actor Maksym Devizorov, who spoke about what motivated him to join the Defense Forces, how his acting experience helped during his service, and why it is important in the realities of war to continue to enrich Ukrainian cultural heritage. —What prompted you to join the ranks of the Armed Forces? — I was prompted by the call of my heart. I had no idea what I could do for the country at such a moment. We watched for several days what was going on. Then I could no longer marinate in it&#8230; From the first days I went to the TCC, I was told several times that they only take those who had combat experience. Then, with my friends and my girlfriend, we left for Lviv to send the girls abroad. Already there I registered, and when they asked who was ready to go to war, I immediately agreed. He immediately got into the 103rd separate territorial defense brigade named after Andrii Sheptytskyi. From the moment the battalions were formed, when all the recruits were still in civilian clothes, no one knew what they could do or what they could be useful for. However, we started training quite quickly and left for Donetsk within a month. My first position was a grenade launcher driver, it was even somewhat funny, because I have a license, but I was not a very confident driver at that time, I lacked experience. I studied here and there until I got a secondment at TRO-media, I was in the autorotat. - What moments on the firing line are most etched in your memory? -The brightest moment was on the first night in Pokrovsk. Then for the first time I saw this glow that did not stop. Of course, the moments when I lost my brothers are the ones that will be with me for the rest of my life. The first time we lost our brother in Donetsk region, then in the Kupyan direction three more of ours were missing. —How did your acting experience help you during your service? —My acting experience helped me record my appeal to volunteers. When it was necessary to ask them for help or to thank them, they immediately called me. In addition, he somehow -made a noise- in the technical education classes. We were then told to imagine that we were injured and had to put a tourniquet on, so I paid for my entire salary. Screamed, writhed in pain, saw how the boys even began to -catch the pale man- a little. These are such moments of humor, because there is no way without it. —Tell us about your service at TRO-media? What projects are you working on? —When I got there, we were preparing for the big festival -War in the Lens-. There were a lot of different projects. We shoot videos for a mobilization campaign, for recruiting, in addition to this, analytical programs. Currently, my main line of work is -Veterans Theater-. My brothers and I started such an initiative, where soldiers and veterans can come, learn to write plays, share their experiences in the circle of those who understand them. I personally consider this project very valuable, because it is not only therapeutic, but also cool texts come out of our military. These plays win various dramaturgy competitions, and are taken by directors to be staged in academic theaters. For example, Alina Sarnatska's play, A Combat Medic, will be played in the Zankovetska Theater next season. Volodymyr Tuka's play is already being staged in Kherson. We want to scale our project so that in every city there is a cell and those who feel the need to work through their pain through creativity. — You recently returned to the stage of the Theater on the Left Bank in the play -You can't go, you can't stay.- What feelings arose after such a long pause? - I breathed a sigh of relief, because for a long time I had been -mourning- myself that I could not return yet. Only then. when the war ends After all, I understood that at any moment the commander's combat order could come and I would have to go. However, as long as there is an opportunity to be in Kyiv, my colleagues asked me to somehow play together. I could no longer refuse, I somehow silenced these doubts and fears and left. It was very cool when my colleagues from the theater greeted me so warmly and showed such humane attitude. That's when we wanted to combine the -Veterans Theater- and the Theater on the Left Bank. I have become such a link through which this can be realized. Now we have launched the -Livy ++- project, that is, on the stage of -Livy- we will play performances of both the -Veterans' Theater- and other projects related to veterans, their rehabilitation, where they will be both actors and playwrights. —How do you manage to combine shooting in films and service? —When the situation became more or less clear to me, I agreed during the vacation to shoot the TV series -Cure from the Past-. There, I play a military man who has been injured and has lost his memory. Now this project has already been released. If sometimes it can be realized in short episodes, then this is a great joy for me, because I continue my service. We have prepared the New Year's movie -Train on December 31-, there I also play a soldier, I have a small appearance on the screen, but my brothers say that they are waiting and plan to go see this movie on vacation. - Do you plan to return to acting on a permanent basis after the war? -After the end of the war, we will tell the story of this war both on stage and on the screen. If we can adapt our -Veterans Theater- project to the needs of society and the market, I would very much like to continue doing it. Personally, it happened to me here that I was able to write and stage a play. Now I am organizing screenings of the play -Military Mom-, this is what drives me and helped me return to the idea that there is still a chance for a normal life. There were times when my friends said that this project was a turning point for them too, so for me it is real honey for the soul. And it will be cool if after the war it will also be possible to do this. - What is the main goal of the -Veterans Theater-? -The main goal of the -Veterans Theater- -is to build a dialogue between the veteran and the civilian. There is a lot of unspoken pain when many are stopped by the thought that no one needs it. For example, it's easier for me to live my experiences inside, I don't need to talk to someone, but to reflect on it alone. Therefore, the goal of this project is to help, so to speak, to -put together a frame- for our military and veterans in a circle of like-minded people who also went through all the horrors of war. Any possible manifestation of creative realization is the right path to yourself, first of all, to your healing. Someone may have done it before and now need a resource to resume this activity, and someone just needs to try it to understand if this activity is suitable for a person. And we are looking for different ways how this can be implemented. It would seem like the -Veterans Theater-, but we also organized an elective course in clay modeling. Personally, I have never done this, but when I got a small plate, a little strange, but still mine, I brought it home, put it there, and my heart loved to look at this beauty. - In your opinion, is it important to develop Ukrainian theater and cinema during the war? -It is extremely important to develop our art even during the war. We have been consuming pro-Russian content for a very long time in an incredible amount and this -warm bath- that everything will be fine has played an evil joke on us. Since the survival of our nation is now at stake, culture is an integral element of preserving our identity and statehood. Because of this, it is necessary to find an opportunity for the Ukrainian word and thought to be heard everywhere, including abroad, because otherwise everything will be tragic. - How did the war affect your relationships with family and friends? -Someone -dropped out-, on the contrary, relationships strengthened in the family. I have two brothers who also serve, we see each other very rarely, but there is already that unbreakable bond that is supported by our beliefs, that is, it gives us even more bricks in a strong family foundation. With friends, it is easier for me to communicate with those with whom I have a common experience. For almost 3 years, large-scale companies have lost touch with many, but this is life and we constantly have new companies, new partnerships.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/zibraty-ramu-yak-aktor-ta-voyin-maksym-devizorov-dopomagaye-veteranam-povernutysya-do-zhyttya/	2025-01-19T21:15:55-08:00

Advanced -stabik- with a cat in Donetsk region: why -the package of the wounded- is most needed near...	The stabilization point of the 2nd International Defense Legion of Ukraine was shown to ArmiyaInform by the head of the medical service of the 2nd International Defense Legion of Ukraine, senior lieutenant Mykhailo with the call sign -Engels- and paramedic Oleksiy with the call sign -Donatello-. He owes his nickname -Engels- to one of the senior officers, to whom Michael's beard reminded him of the famous German philosopher. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the soldier has gone from a soldier and a platoon combat medic to the head of the medical service of the 2nd International Defense Legion of Ukraine. On February 25, 2022, Mykhailo was mobilized as a soldier, but soon became a platoon combat medic. When it became known about his medical education, he graduated from the National Medical University named after O. AT. -Engels- from Bogomolets in Kyiv, a specialist in radiology, was appointed to the position of doctor of a medical center and promoted to the rank of officer. In the 2nd International Legion, the officer has been serving as the head of the medical service for a year and a half. The service had to be created from scratch, because when Mykhailo headed it, it had two drivers, two paramedics and no doctor. Therefore, the personnel issue had to be solved simultaneously with the establishment of material support. — Two paramedics, two drivers and zero doctors. And now we already have five doctors - a completely closed staff. To organize a medical service, first of all, people are needed. If there are people and people have the initiative, then everything will follow,- he says. Oleksiy -Donatello- adds that a lot depends on the head of the medical service, who is able to organize the work of the team and establish the necessary financial support almost -from scratch-. — I would say that an initiative nachmed is needed. At the moment when there was no Misha, there was almost nothing in the medical service either. The main thing the Legion could do then was try to engage with friendly organisms to help with the evacuation. There was one car, there were not enough crews, - stresses Oleksiy. He owes his nickname to the absence of several fingers on his hand, which makes his hand look like the limb of a ninja turtle from the famous series of comics and cartoons. With such a long-standing injury, Alexei could not serve, but he could not stand aside when his knowledge and skills were needed to save the lives of soldiers on the front lines. — It was still in my childhood, I already came to the war with an incomplete number of fingers. You may remember that my wife, who loves me very much, came up with the call sign. Who else would not have thought of it or dared, but she called it that, - jokes the doctor. Initially, the battalion medical service of the 2nd International Legion had to use the help and support of those military organizations to which the unit was attached, because their level of equipment and provision was much better. - Since we are a separate battalion, it is our -damned fate- to be assigned to someone forever. If we are attached to someone, it means we can use some resources of their organization, including medical services, Mykhailo explains. However, at present, thanks to the initiative of the commander and the staff of the battalion's medical service, the situation has changed, and already those military organizations to which the Legion is attached and interacts, have begun to use the established work of stabilization point 2 of the International Legion. - At the moment, the brigade to which we are assigned and all units have everything tied to this -stabic-. That is, now the brigade to which we are seconded works purely through us. And if you look at the map, then probably there is no such -stable- so close to the front anywhere else, - notes the head of the medical service. You can really get to -zero- from here in 10-15 minutes. However, such a quick evacuation of the wounded is possible only under ideal conditions, when the enemy shelling subsides and the activity of Russian drones in the air decreases. Then the injured person can be very quickly brought to the point, stabilize his condition and send him further to the hospital. - By the standards of how it could be and how it was - this is super close. In other subdivisions, it happens that it is necessary to drive an hour one way to the stabilization point. And this is taking into account that the front is not a straight line, and you still have to drive parallel along it to get to the positions, explains -Donatello-. Rapid delivery of the wounded simply from the positions to the stabilization point is one of the main advantages of the medical service of the 2nd International Legion. Medics emphasize that they managed to establish an evacuation mechanism at the grassroots level in such a way that everything can be done independently without the need to involve the resources of units. - We have specially equipped cars that can go there and pick up the wounded. We emphasize that we want to reduce the evacuation time. We are taking a risk, because now a lot of wounded cannot be evacuated from the positions when it is really necessary. The problem of overstretched tourniquets, tourniquet syndromes, and infected wounds has become acute. The advanced -stable point- allows you to avoid this, Mykhailo emphasizes. Shifting at the stabilization point is organized in three shifts, each of which works for three days. For the next three days, the members of the shift rest, after which they work in the battalion medical service for another three days. After that, back to the headquarters. — At the moment, we have three shifts of four people each: two doctors, a paramedic and a driver. If we have a wounded person, the driver and the paramedic go and pick him up from the position and bring him here. Next, two doctors stabilize the patient, and at this time the car is being prepared for further evacuation, says the head of the medical service. Previously, the shift was two-day shifts, but too frequent shifts could attract the attention of the enemy, so it was abandoned. There is a permanent -farm- on the -stabik- - a big black cat Boris, who does not go anywhere and helps take care of the premises and supports the wounded morally. Because sometimes, doctors joke, warming up, sipping on a -stick- of hot soup and petting a cat is no less important for patients than getting the necessary medical care. After all, the lightly wounded, who arrived from the positions, often did not have the opportunity to eat properly and warm up there. The medical service has several vehicles at its disposal - a bus, SUVs and even an American M113 armored personnel carrier, which, however, is currently under repair. All of them are necessary both for the evacuation of the wounded from the positions and for their subsequent delivery to the hospital. — What is good about wheeled machinery? The fact that it is easily repaired, has a better resource, is fast. But it is less passable. What is good -goose-? She's slower, but she's passable and has defense. However, at the same time, it attracts a lot of attention. Therefore, if we can drive quietly on an unarmored wheeled vehicle and without making a noise pick up the wounded person, this is the best option and we do it, -Engels- explains. — If we know that they are already waiting for us there in any case — it is necessary to do anything to pick up the wounded, and it is better to do it by riding a tracked vehicle, then we choose a tracked vehicle, -Donatello- adds. Soldiers can be sent from the headquarters to the hospital both in the transport of the medical service of the 2nd International Legion and in the vehicles of allies who are unable to evacuate the wounded from the front line, but can easily pick them up from the -stabik-. - Two doctors for one wounded person is quite enough. One works as an anesthesiologist, the other as a surgeon. -We are trying to provide help and stabilize the wounded as quickly as possible,- says -Engels-. Doctors can be joined at this time by a paramedic or a paramedic, who assist when working with a patient. Thus, three specialists can work with one wounded person at the same time. The main task at the headquarters is to stabilize the condition of the wounded so that he can get to the hospital normally. This journey can last from 30‒50 minutes to 1.5‒2 hours, and during this time nothing critical for the injured person's health should happen in the vehicle. — We do everything to ensure that the patient remains stable within an hour. This is our task. He gets to the hospital, and the full range of care is already provided there, which can be expanded, - explains the head of the medical service. In order to provide quality assistance, a stabilization point near the frontline must be properly equipped and provided with everything necessary. Several premises, of which at least one should be warm and electrified, access to water and electricity supply - if not from a fixed network, then at least from EcoFlow or a generator. — There should be a table on which to lay the wounded. There should be a basic set of consumables that are used. These are basic surgical items, basic anesthesia equipment, a ventilator, a laryngoscope, an oxygen concentrator, explains the head of the medical service Mykhailo. — This is a MARCH protocol at maximum speed. If with the MARCH protocol for a soldier, all this is put in one first-aid kit, then here it takes up a whole room. There is everything needed to stop the bleeding, everything to secure an airway, both non-surgical and surgical. Next, everything to restore blood circulation, including blood heaters, blood itself, solutions, Oleksiy tells and shows the equipment and consumables. Medics emphasize that deeper in the rear, literally an hour's drive from here, it is possible to set up a stab post with much greater capabilities, but the critical point is the time during which the wounded will be brought there. So it's much better to have a less equipped -stab- 15 minutes from the positions than a perfect one - an hour and a half. The most common are blast injuries and shrapnel injuries of the limbs, concussions and closed brain injuries are also common. Bullet wounds are much less common, but there is a lot of combat stress. — A year ago, most of our wounded were due to mortar attacks or RPGs, there were less frequent drops and AGS, now almost all injuries are the result of drops and FPV drone attacks. At the same time, the main fighters are injured when entering the position, because once they have reached the position, they are relatively safe there, but the way to enter the position is very difficult, says Oleksiy. Since the evacuation from the positions is carried out when there is power for it, not one but several wounded may arrive at the headquarters at the same time. Sometimes there can be even more than 10 - one or two severe, a few more moderate and most lightly wounded, with contusions or battle stress. — We sort them all, take them one by one and provide assistance. Up to ten at the same time are single cases. On average, 3-4 injured people arrive, one of them may be seriously injured - we provide him with assistance first. In parallel, we also work with others, depending on how dangerous their injuries are, says Mykhailo. A warehouse with consumables and other necessary things is organized in one of the premises of the stabilization point. Among the purely medical -consumers-, neatly folded civilian clothes - underpants, T-shirts, sweaters, sweatpants - attract attention. Nearby on the floor are several pairs of rubber slippers. — These are all clothes for the wounded. Almost all of them arrive in torn, wet, dirty clothes, covered in blood. To get to the wounds, we have to remove these clothes from them, cut them off. And our task is to prevent hypothermia, to warm patients - we need to dress them in something so that they are warm, dry and comfortable. Because if he puts all his wet clothes on himself again, he will never get warm, explains -Donatello-. Civilian clothing for the wounded is provided by volunteers to the medical service of the 2nd International Legion. They also hand over sets of adaptive clothing, which can be easily put on the injured person with the help of special Velcro fasteners. — I have already seen that there was a state initiative with the creation of the -Package of the Wounded-. I wonder who will be provided with them. Because if they will be provided directly in hospitals that are 30-40 kilometers from the front line, then, in my opinion, this is not super cool. It is necessary to provide the most advanced -stabiks-, where for the first time a person's clothes are cut off and something must be put on him immediately. This package, like all medical care, should be as close as possible to the front lines, Oleksiy emphasizes. — When a fighter enters the hospital, we immediately start to keep in touch with him. Since we have many foreigners in the Legion who are not familiar with the Ukrainian medical system, we have developed a guide for them in four languages ​​on what and how to do it, says the head of the medical service. A sign in four languages ​​- in Ukrainian, English, Spanish and Portuguese - should help an injured foreigner not to get confused and lost. By constantly maintaining contact with the medical service, he is guaranteed to receive all necessary medical care and statutory compensation for injuries. - As soon as the wounded leaves us for the hospital, we call the representative of his company - the foreman or chief sergeant. They pack his backpack with his things - documents, phone, clothes - and take them to him so that he has all the necessary things and can travel with them, says the medic. The most important thing, he emphasizes, is for the wounded to have a phone with him and to be in contact with the unit. Then it will be possible to prepare and send him all the necessary documentation, as well as visit the fighter during treatment and rehabilitation. — Representatives of the medical service and representatives of the Legion regularly visit the wounded. It is very important to have contact with them, because in hospitals in Ukraine, usually few people speak English, and even more so, almost no one speaks Spanish or Portuguese. We try to take care of our fighters at all stages, Mykhailo emphasizes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/peredovyj-stabik-z-kotom-na-donechchyni-chomu-pakunok-poranenogo-najpotribnishyj-poblyzu-nulya/	2025-01-19T20:39:53-08:00
Modernization will increase lethality: the high-tech destroyer of the US Navy will be equipped with ...	As informs the portal of the US Naval Institute, the work carried out will allow -Zumwalt- to remain one of the most technologically advanced and deadly ships in the US Navy, ArmyInform reports. Work, which began last August and is expected to run through 2025, is underway at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi. As reported by the press service of the US Navy, the ship will be equipped with Conventional Prompt Strike hypersonic systems. This retrofit involves replacing the original Advanced Gun System (AGS) with four large-caliber missile launchers, each carrying three hypersonic missiles, for a total salvo of 12 missiles. Experts at the defense site at Army Recognition said that Ingalls Shipbuilding's Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) division played a significant role in the modernization of destroyers of the Zumwalt type. On August 29, 2023, a $154.8 million contract was awarded for the modernization of the USS Zumwalt (DDG 1000), including the integration of a conventional rapid strike weapon system (CPS). This project follows previous contracts, including $10.5 million in January 2023 for planned modernization of USS Zumwalt and USS Michael Monsoor (DDG 1001). HII was also involved in equipping Zumwalt-class destroyers with advanced Mk 57 vertical launch systems under a $74 million contract awarded in April 2024. Leveraging nearly $1 billion in infrastructure investments, HII continues to improve the combat capabilities and technological sophistication of these U.S. Navy stealth warships. The Conventional Operational Strike (CPS) program, originally called Rapid Global Strike, is designed to give the United States the ability to launch high-precision conventional strikes around the world within one hour. CPS uses technologies such as hypersonic gliders and surface, air and underwater missile platforms. Potential delivery systems include missiles similar to intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), hypersonic cruise missiles and kinetic weapons launched from orbit. A key objective is to consider rapid response and capability scenarios other than nuclear strikes. Test milestones include the flight of the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon in 2011, the Common Hypersonic Glide Body tested in 2020, and integration plans for Zumwalt destroyers in 2024. Design measures are aimed at distinguishing CPS from nuclear systems to reduce the risk of misinterpretation by adversaries. Numerous defense enterprises are participating in the CPS modernization program. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor responsible for final assembly of the rocket, which takes place in Cortland, Alabama, integrating components manufactured by Northrop Grumman and Dynetics. Northrop Grumman is building the rocket boosters and the payload module, while Dynetics is building the hypersonic glider. Program funding and oversight is managed by the DDG-1000 Program Office. However, the cost of these systems is causing some concern in the US. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the production and maintenance of 300 hypersonic missiles over 20 years could cost nearly $18 billion, an average of $60 million per missile. Critics say the costs could exceed the value of many potential targets. Proponents object, insisting that hypersonic weapons extend operational range and accuracy beyond the reach of conventional systems, providing an advantage in contested environments. USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) is a guided-missile destroyer and the flagship of her class, named after Admiral Elmo Zumwalt. She has a displacement of 14,564 tons, is 600 feet long and is powered by an integrated power system that generates 78 MW, giving her a speed of 33.5 knots. Initially, such vessels were equipped with two 155 mm advanced gun systems designed for long-range land-based projectiles, but the abolition of the use of land-based ammunition removed the guns from the armament arsenal, leading to a transition from land attacks to surface warfare. The vessel has 80 Mk 57 Peripheral Vertical Launch System cells for various missiles, a radar cross-section designed to reduce detection, and an automation-oriented design for a smaller crew. Entered into service in 2016, the Zumwalt has undergone a variety of modifications, including the planned replacement of Advanced Gun Systems with hypersonic missile launch systems during a modernization period beginning in 2023. Zumwalt-type destroyers were conceived in the United States under the DD-21 program, launched in the 1990s, as a 21st-century solution to naval fire support previously performed by battleships. The program aimed to develop multi-role warships with a focus on land attack, surface warfare, and reduced radar detection, consistent with mandates from the US Congress to increase naval firepower. Due to rising costs and changing military priorities, the program was transformed into the DD(X) initiative, and the number of ships planned for construction was reduced from 32 to 3. At an estimated total program cost of $22.5 billion, the Zumwalt class of destroyers represents the transition to smaller, more technologically integrated fleets, as well as an attempt to balance technological innovation with fiscal and operational problems and a global race for hypersonic supremacy. In fact, hypersonic capabilities are now considered necessary by the United States to maintain strategic parity with rivals such as Russia and China, which have made significant advances in this area. China tested its DF-ZF hypersonic glider between 2014 and 2016, which is reported to be in service by 2019, along with other hypersonic weapons such as the DF-27 and YJ-21. Russia is developing similar technologies, including the Avangard hypersonic weapon system, which went into mass production in 2018, and the Oreshnik, recently used against Ukraine. In turn, it is reported that, according to the planned schedule, the first full-scale deployment of the Zumwalt should take place in the last months of 2026 or at the beginning of 2027. This major event will take place under the control of the US 7th Fleet and the US Indo-Pacific Command, confirming their leadership in this strategic step.

Day of commemoration of defenders of Donetsk airport: the second birthday of combatant Alex	The Day of Honoring the Defenders of Donetsk Airport in the system of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is celebrated annually on January 20. The defense of Donetsk airport is thousands of stories of bravery and exploits, front-line brotherhood and mutual aid. ArmiyaInform offers its readers today the memoirs of Doctor of Historical Sciences, senior lieutenant of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yevhen Lunyak. He defended DAP as part of the 1st tank brigade. The commander of his brigade at that time was the legendary tank driver -Adam- - Yevhen Mezhevikin, Hero of Ukraine. Today, Yevhen Lunyak, who continues to defend Ukraine, has prepared for publication the book -Front stories from Donbas-, which will soon be published in one of the capital's publishing houses. This is a collection of real stories collected by the author during the tragic and at the same time heroic vicissitudes of the modern Russian-Ukrainian war since 2014. until today. Evgeny Lunyak is a direct participant in most of the described events. The book will also include these stories&#8230; On November 30, 2014, in the midst of heavy fighting for the Donetsk airport, the 5th company of the legendary -cyborg- tankers of the 1st Separate Guards Tank Brigade (as it was called at the time) was tasked with going to the airport to fire at separatist positions in the old terminal and provide support to our DAP defenders. The departure was planned by the forces of four tanks (1st and 93rd brigades) under the command of Kombat Adam, Kombat Alex, Sturman and Company Commander Vano. At that time, the 5th tank company of 40 people had already lost 4 soldiers killed (Volodymyr Kundenko, Stanislav Krivonos, Yuriy Kostyuchenko, Volodymyr Titarchuk), 1 missing (Yevgen Savenko), more than 10 people were wounded, contused and injured. . 3 tanks were lost in DAP, 5 more combat vehicles were seriously damaged. Alex and Vano's crews were almost all officers. The tankers were hunted. The road to the DAP was now strewn with mines and closely monitored by the separatists. Unfortunately for our tankers, snow dusted the ground - and now anti-tank mines were completely invisible. Adam's tank went first, followed by Alex's tank, then Navigator, and last was Vano. As it turned out, Adam's tank drove through a dangerous area on the approach to the DAP. Alex was less fortunate. His tank hit a mine at the edge of the left track. According to the recollections of Vano, whose tank was riding behind, the left part of the 40-ton front combat vehicle was thrown into the air more than a meter, after which the tank fell, losing the ability to move, the front part was completely damaged. The commander of the tank Alex and his crew survived, you can say that they were born in a shirt, but all three received injuries. It was decided to continue the operation with Adam's crew, joined by Sturman, and evacuate Alex's damaged tank and crew, which Sturman and then Vano successfully did with their men. Since then, Alex and his friends (San Sanich and Tolyan) have remembered the date of this departure, when they were lucky to survive. They said that this day was their second birthday. The circling of the Terminator at the airport in our locations around Donetsk was talked about a lot and retold as a military anecdote or an anecdote, without knowing for sure the actors and the circumstances of the event. It was one of the night trips to the airport from Pisyk. I was told about this episode of the fighting for the airport by its participants, including the Terminator himself. Adam, Rotny and Terminator tanks participated in that visit. The tank of the latter, which according to the front line tradition bore its own name -Barsik-, was supposed to remain at the beginning of the runway to provide cover for a large convoy that was supposed to deliver food, weapons and medicine to the defenders of the old and new terminals. It seems that the plan was quite simple and straightforward. However, for some reason, -Barsik- began to operate according to a different program, which led to a great commotion in the separatist locations, not least because of the unpredictability and incomprehensibility of this tank's actions. Of course, as soon as the convoy began to approach the airport, the fighters of -Novorossiya- prepared for a fire attack on the objects that were on the runway. Their fire increased and became more accurate, but this time could not seriously damage our armored vehicles. As the three tanks successfully completed their task of escorting the column and turned around to return to base, Terminator's terrified voice came over the walkie-talkie: -Guys, I'm lost! I can't see anything!- -Barsyk- began to maneuver here and there along the runway. He sometimes approached the positions of the separatists, then moved away from them. Of course, they opened fire with all available weapons, but, fortunately, they could not cause serious damage to either the tank or the crew. -Guys, where am I?- - the Terminator's confused voice continued to shout over the walkie-talkie. It seemed to him that his tank was being pushed from all sides, and he did not know at all where he should go to leave the airport. It became obvious that -Barsik- had lost its way and could become the prey of the enemy, and its crew would face a sad fate. Adam, whose tank had already left the airport, commanded: -Barsik-, look, now we will give a line of tracers from a machine gun. Go to the tracers!- However, as the Terminator himself recalled, he saw these bullets from different sides, because the separatists also fired them. So I didn't know where to go. The Terminator kept asking for directions. His tank drove chaotically down the runway. Rotny ordered his mechanic Slavik to turn on the headlight on the tank. At the same time, he himself opened the hatch to look around. It was very risky, and how to find a lost tank with a frightened crew otherwise, he simply had no idea. However, the Terminator never saw the light of the headlights flashing from Rotny's tank. Adam gave him another clue. These were the lights of Donetsk at night. He used to say: -Look where the city is lit up and drive in the opposite direction.- However, the Terminator said that he could not see the lights of this metropolis either. Apparently, he was already in despair. But then Rotny, whose tank was just leaving the runway, had a life-saving idea. He asked the Terminator over the walkie-talkie if he could see the moon in the sky. The Terminator opened the hatch and saw the moon, which he happily informed Rotno. -Let the moon look in your eyes! Go straight!- — a new order came from Rotny. At that moment, the Terminator said that a tank had just passed him. It became clear to Rotny that his tank had passed Barsyk, which was at the beginning of the runway, and therefore quite far from enemy positions. Rotny ordered Slavik to turn back, drive up to -Barsik- and turn on the headlights. Now the Terminator saw Company's tank and confidently followed it to the base. Such circling around the airport caused the anger of Slavik, who was ready to give the Terminator a hard time, who, due to his own indolence, put his comrades in danger. However, first of all, Rotny said that in battle everyone can get lost and no one is immune to it. Secondly, the driver-mechanic of -Barsyk- Seryoh assured that he himself -got through-, although he had already been to the airport many times, but this time he was confused and could not find his way around. In the end, the Terminator and his adventures began to be ridiculed, which caused him a great mental battle. Terminator even moved to live in the locations of fighters of another brigade and did not come to the table of his company, experiencing such a failure, which, thanks to fate, ended happily. It was in this state that I found the Terminator a few days later in the Sands, he was glad of my arrival and the fact that I always treated him with respect and often called him by his first name and patronymic. Later, by order of Rotny, the Terminator moved to Tonenko. I think it was absolutely the right decision, and no one made fun of him here, and he was able to show himself well in household affairs, especially those related to cooking. *** Today, bloody battles on a scale that Europe has not seen since the Second World War continue in Donetsk region. In 2015, DAP became the symbol of the defense of Donetsk region against the Russian invaders, and now legends are being born in other cities of Donetsk region, where Ukrainian defenders are showing examples of resilience and courage to the whole world.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/den-vshanuvannya-zahysnykiv-doneczkogo-aeroportu-drugyj-den-narodzhennya-kombata-aleksa/	2025-01-19T20:17:56-08:00
Lies to order: propaganda invented a GUR sniper who shoots pensioners near Pokrovsk	In pro-Russian telegram channels and mass media, a video began to be widely distributed, where a supposedly Ukrainian sniper from the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine shoots civilians - elderly people who were walking on the road near Pokrovsk. The -news- emphasizes that this is a -special intimidation tactic- by the Armed Forces. To enhance the effect, the video was accompanied by -expert- comments from people with zero combat experience, but with the high rank of couch analysts. And, of course, all this is served under the sauce: -Look what they're doing!- 1. There is no evidence of the authenticity of the video. The video was shot as if it were another computer game. The angles are strange, the shot is blurry, and the moment of the shot is cut. For some reason, the camera -accidentally- ends up exactly where it needs to be. This is the typical handwriting of Russian propagandists, who still think that blurred shots add drama. 2. No geolocation. There are no location links on the video. No characteristic landmarks, no signs, no names of settlements. It seems that -Pokrovsk- appeared in this story by chance, or because the map of Donetsk region in the Kremlin ends with two or three familiar cities. 3. The GUR does not engage in such operations. The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is an elite unit that carries out strategic tasks, not contrived actions of intimidation against civilians. Such -plots- can look believable only in Russian TV series, where logic has long been buried. 4. The people in the video do not look like civilians. The appearance of the -victims- raises many questions. The clothes are unnaturally new, the posture is confident, and the movements are too coordinated for elderly people who are supposedly going to a war zone. Perhaps these are the same -actors- who portrayed Ukrainian refugees from infiltration camps? 5. Stage shooting. The shots do not have any signs of actual shooting. There is no reload sound or realistic recoil. But there is a suspicious smoke and the learned movements of the -sniper-, who looks more like an actor with military props. 1. Denigrate GUR. Ukrainian special forces have already become a symbol of efficiency and strength. Therefore, the enemy is trying to label them as -killers of civilians-. Although the Russians themselves are shelling peaceful cities and villages of Ukraine every day. 2. To justify their crimes. By creating such fakes, the Kremlin is trying to divert attention from the real crimes of the Russian army. Like, -and you look at what the Ukrainians are doing.- It's a classic trick to blame the victim for his own sins. 3. To sow panic among civilians. Russian propaganda is counting on the fact that such videos will cause fear and hatred among the residents of the frontline areas. They need to divide Ukrainians, to fuel distrust of the army. But with this quality of -cinema- it is unlikely to work. The fake about the -GUR sniper- near Pokrovsk is another attempt by Russian propaganda to denigrate Ukraine. But even in this they lacked imagination and skill. But another primitive film was released for the domestic consumer, who still believes that Ukrainians are fighting to -intimidate the Russians-. And we are just fighting for our land. And while the Russians are mounting their productions, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are really working. And, believe me, it is far from pensioners.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/brehnya-na-zamovlennya-rospropaganda-vygadala-snajpera-gur-shho-rozstrilyuye-pensioneriv-pid-pokrovskom/	2025-01-19T20:08:42-08:00
In Kurshchyna, the enemy group was on its way to reinforce the Russians, but it was eliminated by th...	They published a video of combat work on January 19 on their channel. It is noted that the enemy is trying with all its might to displace Ukrainian fighters in Kurshchyna. Russian troops change their tactics often — from small enemy groups to convoys of equipment. -They were headed for the replenishment -to the vans- - but the FPV 47 -Magura- brigade sent them straight to hell. Destroyed APCs, tanks, BMPs, ATVs, KamAZs, holes and dugouts where the Russians were hiding - this is the result of the work of three FPV crews in three days in Kurshchyna,- defenders of Ukraine commented. As reported ArmyInform, aerial reconnaissance of the 3rd mechanized battalion of the 47th brigade noticed in time and destroyed a group of Russian soldiers who were preparing for an assault .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/na-kurshhyni-vorozha-grupa-pryamuvala-dlya-pidkriplennya-rosiyan-ale-yiyi-likviduvaly-bijczi-magury/	2025-01-19T10:57:50-08:00
The President of Ukraine and the First Lady honored wounded Ukrainian soldiers with state awards	About this January 19 informs Office of the President. In particular, this medical facility currently provides assistance to military personnel who fought in the Pokrovsk Region and in the Kharkiv region, as well as participated in the Kursk operation. Volodymyr Zelenskyi thanked the soldiers for the defense of Ukraine and awarded them with the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky III degree, the orders -For Courage- III degree, as well as the medals -For Military Service to Ukraine- and -Defender of the Fatherland-. -We want to thank you for protecting our state and our people. For service in various areas. All directions are important, and you were on the most difficult. You are our heroes, we are very grateful to all of you,- the President emphasized. Also, he and the First Lady together with the Minister of Veterans Affairs Natalia Kalmykova met with representatives of the Medical Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and military psychologists. The participants of the meeting noted positive changes in the field of mental health in the military sector. In particular, the specialty of psychologist has appeared, combat stress control groups have started working, psychological rehabilitation departments and offices in military medical clinical centers and hospitals have been developed, clinical psychologist positions have been introduced. Olena Zelenska noted that, according to a survey by the Ukrainian Veterans' Fund of the Ministry of Veterans, psycho-emotional instability among military personnel is considered a very likely challenge after returning from service by more than half of future veterans and veterans — 52.6%. -We need to work on making the aid comprehensive. For example, so that it covers both wounded servicemen and their family members in hospitals, as well as medical personnel who work in a constant stressful environment,- she noted. In addition, the President and his wife got acquainted with the project of creating barrier-free routes in the cities of Ukraine -Movement without barriers-, which is being implemented by the Ministry of Community and Territorial Development as part of Olena Zelenska's initiative. During this year, barrier-free routes with convenient entrances and approaches, transport, stops, sidewalks, public places will gradually appear in 12 cities and towns: in Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipro, Zhytomyr, Kropyvnytskyi, Lviv, Rivne, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Slavutychi, Ternopil, Buchi and Opishny. -Of course, the state and communities here cannot do without the cooperation of all objects on these routes — and this includes, in particular, businesses that are or will be included in our -Business Without Barriers- community: retail chains, banks, other institutions are already changing towards users and, we hope, will help smaller businesses do the same,- the First Lady concluded. As reported by ArmyInform, to implement the decision of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the troops complex group of the General headquarters headed by the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Oleg Apostol.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/prezydent-ukrayiny-j-persha-ledi-vidznachyly-poranenyh-ukrayinskyh-voyiniv-derzhavnymy-nagorodamy/	2025-01-19T10:36:05-08:00
Home-made explosives and grenades: gunmen were detained in three regions	The Security Service of Ukraine informs about this. Odesa Region: A man was detained who tried to sell improvised explosive devices, F-1 and RGD combat grenades, as well as almost 1 kg of TNT. Chernihiv Region: Three criminals were looking for customers to sell automatic weapons and explosives.

The spokesman of the Navy said whether Ukraine is threatened by Russian missile carriers that are in...	About it in broadcast of the national telethon -Edyni Novyni- on Sunday, 19 January, Navy spokesman Dmytro Pletenchuk said. -All the same, they will take out something for the protection of the base point. And, of course, we are monitoring this situation. We see everything that is happening,- Dmytro Pletenchuk said. To a journalist's request to explain what the connection is between the fact that Russia is taking missile carriers to the Black Sea and the fact that the launches will actually take place, the spokesman for the Navy answered as follows: -Here you always have to look up, because they are usually used during mass strikes together with other weapons systems: strategic aviation, OTRK, sea carriers of cruise missiles. And it is also necessary to look at the number: if we see more than one unit in the sea, and we know that an attack from the air is being prepared, for example, then, accordingly, we can count on the fact that, most likely, ships will also be used,- he says Dmytro Pletenchuk. The presenter also drew attention to the fact that the daily reports also include Russian missile carriers that are in the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore, the spokesman of the Navy explained why these ships are recorded and whether there were launches from the Mediterranean Sea: -The danger must be considered as always present. And this water area is the closest to us, and the Azov-Black Sea region and the Mediterranean Sea are interconnected. Of course, no launches were made. It should not be forgotten that the airspace of NATO member countries is in the path of tracking these missiles. Regardless of how they decide to use these missiles, this space is the sovereign territory of these states and it can be considered an attack on these states. Therefore, as a rule, they do not dare to resort to such actions, but it is also necessary to take this into account, because it is a danger,'' Dmytro Pletenchuk emphasized. As ArmyInform wrote, ships of the Russians are not allowed to their only foreign naval base in Tartus, which is in Syria, and they are forced to drift in the Mediterranean Sea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/rechnyk-vms-rozpoviv-chy-zagrozhuyut-ukrayini-rosijski-raketonosiyi-yaki-perebuvayut-v-seredzemnomu-mori/	2025-01-19T09:05:14-08:00

He told this in an interview with Andrii Tsaplienko. -First of all, there is my order, which prohibits the transfer of highly qualified personnel who have undergone training and who specialize in aircraft maintenance.

According to him, at the same time, Ukraine needs personnel at the front. He emphasized that it is necessary to increase the number of people in mechanized brigades. -Unfortunately, mobilization possibilities do not cover this need. Therefore, we are taking measures to reduce our logistics component, supply component, maintenance component within reasonable limits. Staffs know this task. They did the math,- he noted.

Major Viktor Tregubov, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, stated this on January 19 on the air of -Suspilne Novosti-. -Even in the Toretsk direction, we observed how people were driven to the fortifications with mines in their hands so that they would throw them with their hands at the positions of the Ukrainians, but in the case of Pokrovsk, we see that they are no longer going head-to-head,- he said. According to the spokesman of the -Khortytsia- OSUV, due to a lack of personnel, the Russians are trying to enter the city from the western side. -They understand that now they no longer have the resources that would allow them to fill everything with meat, flood Pokrovsk with waves of meat, as they once flooded Mariupol. We have come to the moment when the Russians for the first time, maybe since the war, did not have enough meat to just throw people around, to make a mat of people, on which the next ones walk,- he explained. According to Viktor Tregubov, this means that the occupiers have certain problems with their own resource, which seemed inexhaustible to them. Now the troops of the Russian Federation are beginning to fight more thoughtfully and economically from the point of view of personnel. We will remind, on average, 50-60 clashes per day take place in the Pokrovsky direction. The enemy trying to bypass Pokrovsk from the western side to capture the city.

Pictures with their own history: the exhibition project - Airport opened in Kyiv. 242-	These are 24 works by the artist, volunteer, military serviceman Oleg Drobotskyi with the nickname -Artist-. He died in the spring of 2023 during the fighting in the Bakhmut district. Oleg Drobotsky created his paintings based on the photos of the famous journalist and photographer, author of the book -Airport- Serhiy Loik. And these pictures already have their own story. Three of them survived the occupation in Kherson: there they were hidden by Ukrainian patriots, and after the liberation of the city, they were transferred to the author's homeland. Oleh Drobotsky's parents, Mr. Igor and Mrs. Olga, were present at the opening of the exhibition on the eve of the Day of Remembrance of DAP defenders. According to his father, the idea to create a series of paintings based on the motifs of Serhiy Loiko's photographs originated in the -Artist- nine years ago. Since then, the exhibition has been in 10 regions of Ukraine - when its author was still alive. Mr. Igor also recalled that his son was killed when the Russians launched massive artillery fire at the position of the 67th Brigade. -Do you know what the soldiers of this brigade were like?... They were simply deranged. Strong They may have been inspired by the feat of the cyborgs and defeated the enemy with their motivation alone. The cyborgs had a crazy motivation, which was later imitated by the defenders of Azovstal, Bakhmut and other cities, who steadfastly held the defense,- says Mr. Igor. Also at the opening were representatives of law enforcement and law enforcement agencies, in particular, Minister of Veterans Affairs Nataliya Kalmykova. -When we talk about military and patriotic education, all the words sound quite formal. But it is precisely in such places, when we come and have the opportunity to touch the work of those who protected, defended, created - this is the living realization of military-patriotic education. In 2014-2015, DAP became a symbol of indomitability. Many of those who were then 12-13 years old are now defending the country in the ranks of the Armed Forces. And I am sure that it was the feat of cyborgs that became an example for each of these young men, a seed that later grew into powerful patriotism. Patriotism cannot be legislated or somehow created - it can only be woven through art, personal example. And today, unfortunately, every family has an example of a defender nearby,- Nataliya Kalmykova said during her welcoming speech. And the deputy head of the Department of Humanitarian Support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Oleksiy Serhiyenko, drew attention to the tenacity of the Ukrainian struggle for independence: -Every day, our soldiers demonstrate heroism and courage. The most important thing that unites our soldiers for centuries is that we never tire of defending our land, our Ukraine. And not once during all the historical battles have we encroached on other lands. And the whole world and the aggressor understand this. But our strength is enough. Our soldiers prove this every day. Today, as we stand in this hall honoring the heroism of cyborgs, our warriors are fighting under the whistling of bullets, shells, in danger, dying. And it is our sacred duty to remember everyone. And we will take revenge for each of our dead, for the grief of each family,- Oleksiy Sergienko said. A small impromptu musical performance was performed by Taras Topolei, the frontman of the -Antitila- band, who also joined the ranks of the Defense Forces at the beginning of the large-scale invasion. -Today we honor those who set an example of what is right. An example of how it works. How it should be done,- said Taras Topolya. Project -Airport. 242- was initiated by Iryna Zubkova, the sister of the Hero of Ukraine -cyborg- Ivan Zubkov, the organizer and founder of the annual commemoration and honoring of fallen -cyborgs-. -My brother as a commander and officer did not betray his oath to the end, stayed with his guys until the last minute at the Donetsk airport and died with them. When he was leaving our parents' yard, his mother said to him: -Vanya, you can die, you have two children.- And he answered: -Mom, I'm not the one to decide.- But it&#8230; I have you, my family.- And, perhaps, I bear the memory of not only my brother, but also those legendary soldiers who really volunteered and fulfilled their military and human duty to the end,- said Iryna Zubkova. Died on March 6, 2023 in the fighting near the village of Orihovo-Vasylivka, Bakhmut district, Donetsk region. Everyone will have the opportunity to view the exhibition within a month. The exhibition was held with the support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Department of Humanitarian Support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the Ternopil Regional Organization of the Right Sector political party, the Commander of the Operational Command -West- of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Brigadier General Volodymyr Shvedyuk , Oleg Kuzminykh (commander of the 90th separate airmobile battalion of the 81st separate airmobile brigade of the Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 2014-2015), volunteer Ivanna Yereyska, parents of Oleh Drobotskyi.

Roman Kachur will head the Sahaidachny National Academy of Ground Forces: what is known about him	Hero of Ukraine Colonel Roman Kachur was previously the commander of the 55th separate artillery brigade -Zaporizka Sich-. In 2022, the correspondent of ArmiyaInform recorded an interview with him, we suggest that he be recalled on the occasion of his new appointment. artillery-. Such feedback should be earned. As the combrig says about himself, -my hobby has combined with my professional activity. There are such lucky ones, and I am one of them. I love artillery, I do it, I do everything for its development at my level. The 55th Brigade sets the pace for the development of the artillery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. All of the commander's awards are a credit to his team. This is the reverse process. The commander forms, teaches the team, sets the vector of movement.- Roman Kachur was born in the Sumy region, after school he entered the Sumy Institute of Rocket Forces and Artillery named after Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, who graduated in 2005. Since childhood, he dreamed of doing real men's work. He is from a new generation of Ukrainian officers, from those who never served a single day in the Soviet army. From 2014 to March 2018, he performed combat tasks as the chief of artillery of the 81st separate air mobile brigade. From March 2018 to the present, he is the commander of the 55th separate artillery brigade -Zaporizka Sich-. He considers trained personnel, weapons and military equipment to be the key to success. He speaks briefly about the training of his subordinates: - Day and night, at any time of the year and in any weather, we prepared for the active phase of the war. The preparation paid off. The high morale of the trained combat personnel, who have fully mastered military work, their artillery systems and means of reconnaissance, became the key to success, stopping the enemy in all directions and defeating him. Artillery is a collective kind of troops, collective work, so here the question is not about the sergeant or the soldier, but about the collective, the calculation of the gun, the means of artillery reconnaissance - everything works in a complex. Yes, in our work we combine NATO complexes with still Soviet developments of the system, and we also use the latest Ukrainian developments. About half of the personnel of the brigade - with the experience of the first phase of the war, for the rest - the -hot phase- began now, in February 2022. On more than one occasion, the Zaporizhia Sich gunners were among the winners of the competition for the best artillery (mortar, mounted, self-propelled, rocket, anti-tank) battery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Regarding the requirements for subordinates in war, the brigadier confidently answers: - The requirements for subordinates are simple: honesty, decency, constant improvement of their professional skills and level of physical training. Well, to keep the high rank of soldier of the 55th brigade. Our units carry out round-the-clock fire damage to the enemy who set foot on our land, destroy the opponent. I do not follow the enemy's behavior. To me they are all whole, their behavior doesn't matter, they will all be destroyed. Units of the 55th brigade do not experience problems from the enemy's artillery. It also speaks to our training. We dictate our conditions for artillery duels, and as a result, the enemy withdraws his forces to longer ranges. The enemy is afraid of us. Now there is such a tendency that we begin to seek him out, lure him in order to impress him. To my question: -What was the most difficult thing for you personally from February 24 to today?-, Roman Volodymyrovych emphasizes: -There is nothing difficult except for the combat losses of comrades.- We do our work qualitatively and we enjoy it. Currently, we have received weapons from Western partners. It is already in operation, used for its intended purpose. The soldiers of the brigade master it in a very short time, up to one day, it is realistic. The latest samples are effective, only positive reviews. These are the French CAESAR and the American M777. We hit all possible targets, without exception: from the front edge to deep positions. Constantly, in which order we detect and destroy, in non-stop mode. We give priority to the enemy's artillery - so that it does not interfere with the destruction of the infantry, the destruction of strongholds, areas of concentration. We logically build a sequence of fire damage and -break them into molecules.- I have no doubts about the power of our brigade and the final victory of Ukraine over Russia in this war. Once and for all.

In addition, a group of criminals was exposed in Kyiv, including the commander of one of the volunteer formations. He -helped- his clients to avoid mobilization: he -signed- with them a fictitious contract on serving in the Armed Forces. -In the Cherkasy region, the former head of the department of the Zvenigorod State Central Committee, who tried to -write off- a potential conscript from the military record, was -hotly- detained. Also, in the territory of the region, an official of the VLK was detained, who falsified medical documents on disability for the petitioners,- the SBU said.

The Armed Forces explained why the number of women willing to join the army has increased	told the recruiting representative of the 141st OMBR motorized infantry battalion Mykhailo Chuplak. -If at the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the question of attracting women to the service was hardly discussed because of the long lines of men, then the situation changed later. After the hype among men subsided, women began to apply for these positions. They can replace men in some positions and do it successfully. That is why the percentage of women in the army has increased over the last three years,- he noted. According to the representative, they try not to recruit women to combat positions in order to avoid risks. The exception is combat medics. -Women have a higher level of stress resistance, are not afraid of blood and are quicker to calm wounded soldiers. This makes them indispensable in this role,- he added. Women are most often recruited into support and security positions such as cooks, accountants and drivers. At the same time, there are cases when women apply for combat positions, such as stormtroopers, machine gunners or infantrymen. The recruiting center emphasizes the importance of equal access to the service and celebrates the professional approach of women who choose a military career. As ArmiyaInform reported, the recruiting boom in the Armed Forces: more than 7 thousand applications were submitted for the new K-2 regiment in a month.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/u-zsu-rozpovily-chomu-zrosla-kilkist-ohochyh-doluchytysya-do-vijska-zhinok/	2025-01-19T04:48:38-08:00

It is the most intense not only in a week, but in general in a long period - in months. For comparison, there are 6-20 clashes on other routes. It is followed by the Kramatorsk, Toretsky, and Novopavlivsky directions,- he said. According to him, in all directions, Russian troops are looking for -gaps- to penetrate the Ukrainian defense. -I don't think that they will try to reach Dnipropetrovsk region, although the Russians cannot be ruled out in this case. But objectively, they set themselves the goal of taking control of the Donetsk region. For this, they theoretically need to capture Pokrovsk. Another thing is that, most likely, their plans are not implemented,- Viktor Tregubov noted. He said that in order to capture Pokrovsk, the occupiers need to bypass it, as they currently do not have the strength to -take the city head on.- -For this, they need to go to the west of the city, which they are trying to do now. They want to take Pokrovsk and then go on to seize the entire Donetsk region. I don't think that they should succeed in any of this,- said the spokesperson of the Khortytsya OSUV.

Under cover of the fog, the enemy managed to get inside, and a tense shooting battle ensued in the building. -Russian attack aircraft were outnumbered, so our brothers needed help. It was too dangerous to work with artillery, because the distances between the forces were no more than 20 meters. Therefore, at first they tried to knock out the occupiers with FPV drones,- the military said. It is noted that due to dense construction and weather conditions, this did not give the desired result. -Then the knights decided to release the -beast-. Tankers of the 28th Brigade arrived to help,- the defenders reported.

A Russian agent in the judicial system: the story of the exposure of a traitorous lawyer	informs the Security Service of Ukraine about this. In Kyiv, counterintelligence and SBU investigators exposed a lawyer who worked for the military intelligence of the Russian Federation. He not only recruited new agents, but also defended exposed accomplices of the enemy in the courts. The investigation established that the lawyer was recruited by an employee of the Russian game Vitaly Naumov back in 2015 during a personal meeting on the territory of Russia. After the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the lawyer actively cooperated with the enemy: he transferred data about SBU employees who were engaged in the investigation of cases against traitors, copied procedural documents and handed them over to the Russian special services. The attacker also helped the occupiers find a fire adjuster in Ukraine, and after his exposure, acted as a lawyer in court. He received monetary rewards for his actions through anonymous transfers.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine disclosed the details of the first laparoscopic operation to remove a ki...	He told about this in interviewArmyInform. -Typically, a modern combat trauma is a large incision where the surgeon makes a laparotomy (cuts open, for example, the abdomen and operates on the internal organs) or a thoracotomy (cuts open the chest and operates). We have started to implement minimally invasive surgery - when not an incision is made, but a small puncture, and the surgeon, watching the situation through a video camera on the monitor, operates with micro-instruments,- Kostyantyn Humenyuk said. He explained that at that time military medics implemented minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy, thoracoscopy) for modern combat trauma. -And we are pioneers in the world, because we were the first to do it in combat conditions. In May 2022, I was in one of the military hospitals in the eastern direction. Then he performed a laparoscopic nephrectomy - laparoscopically removed the kidney, which was destroyed, with bleeding,- continues the chief surgeon of the ZSU. He said that in the past, with such injuries, an incision would be made on the abdomen, and the surgeon would remove the kidney with his hands, tying the vessels, etc. -I managed to do it laparoscopically: only small punctures in the stomach - and I could see all the internal organs on the monitor. I found that kidney, stopped the bleeding, removed it and saved the fighter's life. And you know: the next day, the same injured person arrived with a destroyed kidney. Having experience behind him, he performed the second operation much faster, because he knew all the technical points. Such an operation was carried out for the first time in the world, because then I looked through all the professional literature - but I did not find any examples. Then I asked myself why I was not told in the academy or universities that it is possible to do this (smiles). Therefore, it is military surgeons of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who are pioneers in the implementation of modern operations.- According to Konstantin Gumenyuk, now in mobile hospitals, surgeons also perform many such surgical interventions for modern combat trauma, namely laparoscopic and thoracoscopic. To the journalist's clarification, what guided the surgeon during the first such operation in the world, the officer replied: -I then started this laparoscopic operation - I went in, saw a large hematoma. And I had a choice: go to open surgery or continue laparoscopically. I'm not a gambling person, and it was definitely not gambling, I always weigh everything very much and take into account all the risks&#8230; But I just told myself I could do it. And with God's help, everything worked out. The operation lasted almost an hour and a half. Now we work on such cases for up to an hour.- You can read the full text of the interview with the chief surgeon of the Armed Forces at this link.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/u-zsu-rozpovily-detali-pershoyi-v-ukrayini-laparoskopichnoyi-operacziyi-z-vydalennya-nyrky/	2025-01-19T01:31:16-08:00

About 12,000 members. I gave a speech in a very large hall, I spoke very briefly about our surgical capabilities and how we save our boys. The hall applauded. And I am not praising myself now - they applauded not me, but the entire surgical service of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I simply put my hand on my heart and bowed,- Kostyantyn Humeniuk said. And he added that he has many new acquaintances. In particular, partners from other countries were very supportive — Israel, for example. They talked about their own challenges and scope of work. -But when I told that we can have up to 100-150 operations per day on just one direction of the front, they looked at me with wide-open eyes. Yes, we operate on wounded people with light, medium, heavy, and extremely heavy injuries. But the fact itself. Do you understand?- - said the chief surgeon of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

In 60 seconds, even on three wheels: how -Mexican- and -Khohol- tamed the predator -Husky-	ArmyInform talked about how to safely deliver soldiers as close as possible to the positions on the battle line and take them out from there, what dangers await an armored vehicle during a mission and how to protect it from enemy damage, as well as a unique -three-wheeled- rescue from enemy fire. paratroopers The driver of the 46th separate airmobile brigade of the Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the call sign -Mexicanets- and his navigator, the machine gunner -Khohol-. A native of Poltava region has been in the -Mexicanets- army for more than a year - he was mobilized in September 2023. His father has been fighting since the first days of the -wide scale-, so the man had a reprieve for a while, but he was in contact with the local TCC and regularly updated the data. When the mobilization rules changed - arrived after the first phone call. The fighter was trained in Britain as part of the Interflex international training mission. He is satisfied with the training, although, according to him, some of what was taught by foreign instructors is unlikely to be needed in modern warfare. — We were sent to Britain for training, taught by Australian instructors. They taught skillfully, presented information clearly - I liked it. Although they teach according to the method, there are things that we do not use. But they listened to how our war was going on, and adjusted to it, tried to change the training so that we needed it, -Mexicanets- recalls. After basic combined military training, 15 of the best fighters of the combined training company were selected to take sergeant courses. They also underwent an advanced program in Britain compared to the BZVP, which also included courses in military leadership. — They look at who learns how, how they absorb information, and out of 200 people leave 15 for advanced training. At the sergeant's courses, they are already in command of the unit, each one in turn takes command and organizes the execution of the combat mission, says the soldier. After returning to Ukraine, the -Mexican- was appointed commander of the unit, he participated in battles in the Maryinka region. After getting to the hospital due to a hernia, he turned to the command with a request to be transferred to the position of a driver, which, based on his many years of civilian experience as a truck driver, was granted. -Khohol- is also in the army for the second year. A professional athlete, he also did not have any military experience and became a fighter of the 46th Brigade after the BZVP and training as a signalman. However, from the very beginning, -Khohol- was eager for combat tasks, so he soon became a machine gunner. - The machine gun is a heavy weapon. But I like it hard. He hits the enemy. That's why I saw myself here. I have skills and enough strength, so I am more needed here. And in general, I didn't come here just to -pat-, but to normally poke at the orcs, says the fighter. Khokhla's unusual appearance for a Ukrainian may surprise, but he is a native Kyivan from Darnytsia and almost the same age as Ukrainian independence - he is 33 years old. The Ukrainian language and the state of Ukraine are native to him, and he speaks in such a way that it is absolutely impossible to suspect him of being a foreigner. — Someone needs to defend the state. Therefore, we stand and will stand until the end. It doesn't matter that they (Russians - ed.) are healthy, big, how many weapons they have, how many resources they have. We have the land given by God, the truth is behind us and we will go to the end, he confidently asserts. As a -Khohol- machine gunner fought in different directions, he had to work against the enemy both from stationary positions with a machine gun on a mount, and from standard weapons on armored combat vehicles. Sometimes it was necessary to hit the occupiers at a distance of only 100-150 meters, which is extremely close for the heavy -Browning-. Now the fighter is in the position of a gunner in the crew of the Husky armored car, where he plays the role of a navigator and a machine gunner. The performance of combat missions and the lives of fellow soldiers depend on his endurance, courage, speed and accuracy. Since the spring of 2024, the -Mexican- was a driver, driving the -Cossack-. Later, the fighters -tamed- the Husky tactical support armored combat vehicle and since then have been providing front-line logistics on this highly maneuverable and well-protected Ukrainian foreign-made armored personnel carrier. The task of the -Husky- crew is to bring the fighters to the landing point and take them out during the rotation, evacuate the wounded and dead, deliver ammunition, water, food and everything necessary to the soldiers in the positions. The International MXT-MV armored car in the Husky TSV modification is the best for these tasks. — We deliver personnel to the positions, evacuate the -three hundred-, transport BC — we perform all the tasks of supplying the front line on the -Husky-. The passability of the car is excellent - a powerful engine, four-wheel drive, high ground clearance with regulation. Where there is a funnel - she jumps through it - says the -Mexican-. Comparing -Husky- with -Cossack-, the driver praises BBM of foreign production. He says that the -Cossack- only has wheel inflation, while there is no clearance adjustment - the chassis is all on shock absorbers, so it is more difficult for him to overcome potholes. -More maneuverable, faster and more energetic,- says the fighter about Husky. Another advantage of a powerful military vehicle is its capacity. Usually, in addition to the crew from the driver and the second number, 3-5 paratroopers can be accommodated in the cabin. However, if necessary, -Husky- can take on board 6-7 infantrymen, and in extreme situations - even much more. — At most, such a car took away 24 people, and I personally picked up 10 people, -says the -Mexican-, showing the small, but sufficient body of the car to accommodate a considerable load. They try to transport fighters in it only in case of urgent evacuation, because it is the least protected part of the armored car. -Husky- has strong protection, its armor easily withstands not only automatic and machine gun fire and debris, but also close bursts of mortar mines and artillery shells. The armored capsule reliably saves the crew and the paratrooper in the event of hitting an anti-transport mine receives a concussion, but remains unharmed. — They came under artillery fire more than once. Armor is strong, saves lives. Both 120 and 152 caliber can withstand a close gap - protection from debris is reliable. Mines were also hit and the capsule survived, the entire crew was alive, only contused, says the driver. In order to protect against FPV drones, the armored vehicle was additionally equipped with grilles-screens. Welded or bolted at a distance of 15-20 cm from the -Husky- armor, they are, according to the military, quite helpful, as they disperse the cumulative jet, reducing its penetrating power. — Lattices help a lot, because the momentum is lost, there is dissipation, and it hits the main armor only partially. They often have to be welded and twisted, because the -barbecue- cannot withstand shaking on a bad road - something often falls off, says the -Mexican-. Another level of protection is electronic warfare equipment against enemy UAVs. Several of them can be installed in the car so that they work and send a signal to the enemy at once on several frequencies. — We install 3‒4 REBs at different frequencies to protect ourselves and the infantry. -We turn them on when approaching a dangerous zone where enemy drones can reach,- says the fighter. - Logistics is determined by time - everything is always done in a gray, dark way. The task takes about an hour to an hour and a half to complete. It usually takes 30-40 seconds to stop the car, so as not to wind up. In a minute at most, you have to turn around completely, unload or load - and go fast, says the -Mexican-. -Husky- has infrared headlights that allow you to illuminate the road without exposing the car with bright light. However, usually the driver also uses a night vision device, looking at it continuously for 30-40 minutes. During the stop, the driver never leaves his seat in the armored vehicle, and the process is organized by the second number of the crew, who can perform various roles as needed, from the navigator to the machine gunner. It is he who knows the fastest and best way to place fighters and cargo in the Husky. — I always have an assistant, number two, with me. It constantly monitors, exits and helps to load or unload. He makes sure that all the people are seated so that no one is forgotten. And while driving, he is a navigator - looks at -Kropyva-, tells where there is a turn so as not to pass, - explains the driver. — I drive up, immediately turn the car around. Even before the stop, the navigator opens the door and prepares to jump out to quickly help someone get in or out. He distributes people by car so that there is no crowding and all this does not take a long time, says the -Mexican-. When the car moves, the second number is the last to jump into it almost on the move, because every second of delay can be fatal. And in just one minute, a powerful engine allows you to accelerate a multi-ton armored car to a speed of about 100 km/h. A vehicle near the frontline is always a prime target for the enemy. To put it out of order and destroy it, the occupiers try to aim first at the driver, because his damage will immobilize the car and allow them to finish it off with subsequent blows. -They hit the driver's seat if they can,- says the -Mexican-. — It's scary, of course, but what to do? During the night, we have to make 2-3 trips to drop in and take out our fighters and provide them with everything they need. Apart from us, no one will do it. However, -Husky- is not only a means of delivery and a target for which the enemy hunts. From fleeing prey, the armored car turns into a formidable predator when necessary. Its standard weapon — a universal 12.7 mm Browning machine gun — allows you to destroy the enemy at a distance of up to two kilometers. - There may be a task to move to the -front- and work on the enemy. The enemy is detected from the drones, they give us the coordinates - and we -take off-, fly away. We can shoot right on the move, if necessary - the main thing is to listen to commands on the walkie-talkie, -Khohol- says about combat work. Evaluating the survivability of the armored vehicle, he recalls the case when, during the approach to the position, the -Husky- on three wheels confidently took the crew out of fire. Then the enemy managed to hit the right rear wheel of the armored car, but the armored car reached the safe zone even though it had to drive literally on the rim. — They were given the task of taking the group out. When he climbed to close the door and flew into our rear right FPV wheel. Of course we were stunned, we got a slight concussion. But they closed the door and moved on three wheels. -Husky- took it out! - -Khohol- recalls enthusiastically. Fighters treat Husky with love and respect - almost like a living member of their friendly fighting team. It is taken care of, carefully checked and, if necessary, repaired with high quality before each departure, because the lives of fellows and their own depend on the health of the cheerful predatory armored car.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/za-60-sekund-navit-na-troh-kolesah-yak-meksykanecz-i-hohol-pryruchyly-hyzhu-haski/	2025-01-18T20:55:12-08:00
-Hood- over PT-91 Twardy, streaming and the enemy at 200 meters: -Dagger- about the features of tank...	The commander of the tank company 117 of the separate heavy mechanized brigade, senior lieutenant Oleksiy with the call sign -Dagger-, told ArmyInform about training in Poland, the advantages and disadvantages of the PT-91 Twardy, streaming from reconnaissance drones and the evolution of defensive structures, as well as the specifics of the use of tanks in Zaporozhye and Donetsk region. Oleksiy is an economist by education - in June 2022, he graduated from the National University of Bioresources and Natural Resources of Ukraine in Kyiv, having obtained a bachelor's degree. At the military department of the university, the young man studied to be a tank driver - this determined his combat path after the start of a large-scale invasion. — On February 24, 2022, we were supposed to have the day of the military department. Then the classes were postponed, but later continued. They completed their studies at the university in June, at the military department in August, and took the oath at the same time. In October, he was given the rank of junior lieutenant, he says. In January 2023, Oleksiy was mobilized and sent to study at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Peter Sahaidachny in Lviv. — If there was no military department, it would be much more difficult. I took something useful from there, because it provides the minimum necessary base from which to start. True, at the department we studied the T-64 more, and already at the academy we also started to master the T-72, - Oleksiy assesses the importance of initial training at the military department. According to him, it was useful even to older brothers who graduated from the department 20-30 years ago, although, of course, it was more difficult for them to renew their knowledge than those who graduated from the military department at the university recently. In February 2023, the young officer went to Poland to master the PT-91 Twardy and train personnel. The Polish military, he emphasizes, received Ukrainian colleagues hospitably and organized extremely intensive and useful training. — The Poles received us very well. They have a nice military town, very high-quality security there. They did everything to make learning as comfortable and productive as possible, Oleksiy remembers with gratitude. There were no problems with mastering new equipment, because the PT-91 Twardy is basically a T-72 with a number of useful modifications. According to him, the dynamic protection of ERAWA showed itself well, but the thermal imagers of the old generation caused complaints. In addition, some of them did not work on a full-time basis. — Twardy, in fact, it is the same T-72, just slightly modified. The gun and undercarriage are the same, but there is a thermal imager, a thermal sight, a more powerful engine, some differences in the turret. In general, this is a high-quality combat vehicle, characterizes the military Polish modification of the T-72. The tanker is very satisfied with the Tvardoy engine - compared to the T-72, it is significantly more powerful, thanks to which the armored vehicle -runs- much faster and more energetically. The young officer began his military career in August 2023 in the Zaporizhzhia direction, immediately becoming a temporary acting company commander. Before that, during training, Oleksiy commanded a platoon - they improved the skills of crews, maintained equipment, and maintained combat capability. — The battalion commander decided that I was the most prepared of all the platoon commanders to become a company commander. At that time, the company was already participating in hostilities, and I joined them. I had to -merge- into a new direction, because at that time I had no experience of commanding tank units directly during hostilities, the officer recalls. The specificity of the fighting in the south was the use of tanks as ersatz artillery to fire at the enemy from closed positions, since the terrain and the combat situation did not allow direct contact with the enemy. — The terrain in the Zaporozhye direction was not too favorable for a direct direct battle between the tank and the enemy. Therefore, they mainly worked from closed firing positions. It was quite effective - the tank was 6-8 kilometers away from the target on the front edge and like artillery fired in a hinged trajectory, the tank operator explains. True, artillery systems, he believes, are more effective because they have a larger caliber and a longer range, but tanks are also an effective means of fire, the presence of which should not be neglected. -Otherwise, it would just sit idle,- notes the tanker operator. -Without streams, it would be ineffective- The key to successfully hitting a target when firing from closed positions, the officer calls adjustments with the help of video streams from drones. — The crew arrives at the location, orients the car, attaches to the location, to the landmark. I am at the command post and coordinate them with the help of streams from drones. We find the target, calculate the output data for them. They practice and we can already see from the stream where they hit, where we need to hit and correct and I am already correcting directly, - he explains the organization of the combat work of the tank crew. Mainly, the tankers had to work on identified clusters and shelters of enemy infantry, they rarely had to deal with artillery positions or armored vehicles. -Without currents, it would be ineffective and quite difficult,- emphasizes the tanker commander. They also performed combat tasks related to offensive actions, during which tanks hit the enemy with direct guidance. — The guys left, they worked very well. In offensive actions, we supported infantry with tank firepower. Unfortunately, things did not always go smoothly, we also had losses. But in most cases, everything worked out, the tasks were completed, the officer assures. In addition to the active use of reconnaissance drones, another important innovation of the combat work of tankers in the Zaporozhye region was the development and installation of protective anti-cumulative superstructures on tanks - lattice or mesh structures, which were popularly nicknamed -barbecues-. — At first, our tanks had only dynamic protection units and on-board anti-cumulative screens. Then, based on the experience of hostilities in the Zaporozhye region from the fall of 2023, from November to December, we started installing additional protective elements with the help of volunteers, Oleksiy says. They tried to develop them in such a way that they did not prevent the crew from occupying places in the tank and leaving it in case of damage. Another important requirement was to maintain the maneuverability of the combat vehicle and the movement of the turret. Later, in the fall of 2024, factory designs resembling a hood also appeared. It does not limit the movement of the tank tower and the ability of the crew to leave the armored vehicle, and its only drawback is that in dense forest it can be broken by tree branches. — This car now has a factory-made protective structure. It's pretty effective stuff. Already here we tested it - there was damage by an FPV drone to the aft part of the tank and it was this net, this -hood- that saved it, - says Oleksii approvingly of the protective structure. The officer has a very negative opinion about the -sheds- that the Russians build on their tanks, noting that they limit the maneuverability of the machine, make it impossible for the turret to rotate, block the view and prevent the rescue of the crew from the damaged armored vehicle. Comparing combat work in the Zaporizhzhia region and in Donetsk region, the officer notes that the topography of the area and the experience accumulated over the past year, both by the Defense Forces of Ukraine and by the enemy, are a very significant factor. — In Zaporizhzhia, these are plains, very large fields cut by forest strips, and few villages. There are more settlements in Donetsk region and there are significant differences in altitude, much greater than in Zaporizhzhia - 200 meters high, then 130, 160, - says Oleksiy. Also, here you often have to engage in direct combat with the enemy, hitting infantry and shelters with direct fire. It is necessary to fire not only from a cannon, but also from a machine gun, sometimes at very close distances of 200-300 meters. -Under Pokrovsk, literally during all combat sorties, the crews had to work on enemy infantry at a distance of 200‒300‒400 meters,- the officer says. It is this use of tanks that most noticeably distinguishes the situation in Donetsk from Zaporizhzhia, where tankers in most cases performed the role of ersatz artillery.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/kapyushon-nad-pt-91-twardy-stryming-ta-vorog-za-200-metriv-kyndzhal-pro-osoblyvosti-tankovyh-boyiv/	2025-01-18T20:41:02-08:00
Inconspicuous and missile dangerous: Great Britain took up the development of the newest marine dron...	As informs the UK Defense Journal portal, the search for manufacturer companies to participate in the development will begin on January 22 2025 during the first meeting within the framework of the COOKSON Challenge Session project in London. Partners from NATO countries, -Five Eyes- states (interstate intelligence alliance) and some other interested parties are invited to cooperate, ArmyInform notes. -If you have experience with boats and ships, launch systems, surface-to-surface weapons, anti-aircraft systems, marine navigation with GNSS protection, sensors, integrators, autonomous systems or line-of-sight communications, this session can help you to interest,- said the Ministry of Defense of the United Kingdom. As the experts of the defense site IKK Defense Express (DE) told, at this time not only indicative characteristics of the future development, but also the date when the first prototypes should be shown - at the beginning of 2026. -Moreover, it is not easy to talk about innovative, but also mass development, because the conditions of the project include, in particular, the fact that in 6 months of serial production, it is necessary to reach the pace of two or three unmanned attack boats per month,- emphasized experts from DE. According to their findings, the future unmanned missile boat should have a cruising speed of up to 40 knots, a maximum range of up to 800 nautical miles, and a minimum patrol duration of 72 hours. At the same time, the platform must carry at least two missiles with a launch range of 30 to 100 kilometers, and must be able to operate even in conditions of active enemy electronic warfare. The UK Defense Journal, in turn, noted that the COOKSON project involves the creation of a small fast assault ship equipped with a modular payload and capable of operating in difficult conditions. The Ministry of Defense of the United Kingdom, according to British reporters, described the technical tasks of the project as follows: -The COOKSON system consists of a small, fast, low-visibility craft with &gt;2 unilateral effectors mounted on it, including a suitable launch system and supporting equipment. The COOKSON system must be able to travel to the delivery point via ground lines of communication (GLOC) (and) must fit into a 40-foot container, ideally even a 20-foot container.- The craft should be designed to be reusable across multiple missions, with a modular payload that provides flexibility for different operational needs. Once deployed, the system will operate autonomously or semi-autonomously to deliver payloads, conduct missions and return to friendly coastlines for rearmament and maintenance. In addition, according to the conclusions of DE experts, the future unmanned attack boat of the COOKSON project should have means of self-defense against enemy air targets. Here we are talking about large-caliber machine guns, MANPADS or other means. Also, this platform should be compact enough for convenient delivery, and missiles for this boat should be produced in the amount of at least 20 units per month. At the same time, what is particularly interesting, COOKSON is intended, first of all, to destroy coastal objects, and only then, in the second place, to destroy surface enemy targets.

propaganda produces a fake about -Nova Bucha- in Suja	According to the version of Russian propagandists, the Ukrainian military is apparently planning to carry out a mass massacre of civilians in Suja (Kursk region). This story was peppered with drone footage taken somewhere in a garbage dump and comments from anonymous -experts- with a sofa instead of a podium. 1. Don't forget Bucha. Apparently, Russian propaganda remembered Bucha, because they still itch. The world remembers who actually committed war crimes in a Ukrainian city. It was not possible to get rid of it, so now the enemy is trying to transfer everything to Ukraine. But, as they say, a thief's hat is on fire. 2. Suja is a border town, but not a training ground for fakes. If the Russian army is afraid of guerrilla movements and drone strikes, this does not mean that the Ukrainian military plans to act like Russian soldiers. War in the 21st century looks different than in the textbooks of Soviet propaganda. But the Russians stubbornly live in 1943. 3. A fake without evidence is a classic of the genre. There is no evidence other than hysterical headlines in the Kremlin-controlled media. No satellite images, no intercepted conversations, no videos - just fantasy. Unless they will add some old photo and sign -here they are, Ukrainian fascists and what they are doing in Suja-. Because it is designed for fear and mass hysteria. Frightening Russians with mythical Ukrainian -punishers- is a traditional song of the Kremlin. But no matter how many times it is not twisted, words will not get better. 1. To justify the shelling of Ukraine. They said, you see, we are bombing Ukraine because they are preparing a -new Bucha- on our land. An old method of justifying aggression. 2. Strengthen mobilization. It is necessary to explain to the Russians why their sons continue to be dragged into the meat grinder. To avoid unnecessary questions, they are shown horror stories about -bloody dills-. 3. Distract from internal problems. When things are falling apart in the country, the best way is to invent an external threat. Russian propaganda copes with this task -perfectly-. 1. To ironize. Propaganda -throwbacks- do not withstand any criticism, so it is best to break them with sarcasm. 2. Don't behave. If someone seriously starts discussing the -genocide in Suja-, it's worth just calmly laying out the facts. 3. Spread the truth. The more people see the real facts, the less chance there is for fakes. The truth is on our side. -Nova Bucha- in Suja is another cheap thriller from Russian TV. But this script fails even before the first scene. Ukraine is fighting for its land, not for the fictional stories in the minds of propagandists. And if someone in the Kremlin is really afraid for their civilians, they better remember who started this war and why.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/rospropaganda-produkuye-fejk-pro-novu-buchu-v-sudzhi/	2025-01-18T20:01:15-08:00

The occupiers use ammunition equipped with poisonous substances	This was reported on Saturday, January 18, by the Support Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. They said that, in addition to conventional means of fire damage, the enemy uses munitions equipped with chemical substances, such as K-51 and RG-VO, which are means of fighting riots and are prohibited for use in the conduct of hostilities.

Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General of Justice Serhiy Melnyk told about this. -Basic military training will be included in all higher education institutions and will be implemented for our students, citizens of Ukraine, in the second year.

The Defense Forces explained why the enemy attacked Borova and whether he had any success	The deputy commander of the 3rd of a separate assault brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Rodion Kudryashov. The officer explained that since Borova is a logistics hub of the Defense Forces, the enemy wants to capture it, which will make it impossible for the Armed Forces to have a presence on this side of the Oskil River. -Therefore, there is a fierce struggle for this village. All summer and autumn, the enemy tried to attack the front, that is, the line of responsibility of the 3rd OSHBr. There was no success. And now he began to move along the flanks, where in some places he went to the river bank. And from those directions it will try to move to the settlement of Borov,- said Rodion Kudryashov. According to him, this week the enemy resorted to numerous assaults, even in spite of unfavorable weather conditions. -Used a lot of equipment and a lot of infantry, all accompanied by a lot of artillery strikes. The enemy tried to break through the front edge, tried to advance again towards the settlement of Borov. During this week, the enemy had no success and suffered heavy losses. And the 3rd OSHBr replenished the exchange fund,- the Ukrainian defender noted. He also added that at the moment, in the Kharkiv direction, there is at least one enemy division opposite only one battalion of the 3rd OShbr. -This is three times the size of the brigade. Therefore, the enemy has an advantage not only in the number of infantry, but also in the number of weapons. And even with such superior forces, the enemy did not achieve any success this week, both along the line of the 3rd OSHBr and along the line of adjacent brigades,- the officer summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, trying to cross the Oskil's Russian troops use improvised watercraft.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/u-sylah-oborony-poyasnyly-chomu-vorog-pre-na-borovu-ta-chy-ye-u-nogo-uspihy/	2025-01-18T07:52:53-08:00

As noted, the head of the enemy cell turned out to be an active engineer of the Kyiv Metropoliten utility company. According to the case materials, he was recruited back in 2015 in Moscow during a personal meeting with an FSB staff member. &nbsp; -A recruited agent was put on 'standby' and 'uncanned' after the start of a full-scale war via instant messaging. He was immediately instructed to create an agent network. The task of this group was to collect information about the locations and routes of movement of Ukrainian troops and their cargo, as well as launch missile and drone attacks on them,- the report says. At the same time, the perpetrator involved his own brother and mother, as well as several other acquaintances, in his agent activities. -A native of Kharkiv, who left the military unit after mobilization, and before that worked for Ukrzaliznytsia for 10 years, and is a driver of international road transport. The task of the deserter was to monitor the movement of military echelons of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the driver, under the guise of work trips, to merge the coordinates of checkpoints and units of the Defense Forces,- the SBU said. Having received from his henchmen the necessary coordinates for the assignment of strikes, the person involved summarized them and handed them over to his Russian curator. -The resident personally launched missile strikes on Kyiv, which is confirmed by his intercepted conversations. SBU employees documented the crimes of the Russian agency and detained its resident in Kyiv. At the same time, a deserter agent was detained in Kharkiv. During the searches, mobile phones with evidence of work in the Russian Federation were seized from the suspects. Firearms were also found, which were sent for examination,- the intelligence service added. Detainees were notified of suspicion for h. 2 Art. 28, ch. 2 Art. 111 (treason committed by a group of persons under martial law in accordance with a previous conspiracy) and ch. 1, 3 st. 436-2 (justification, recognition as legitimate, denial of armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, glorification of its participants). The issue of reporting suspicion to a third member of the group - a driver of international flights who is hiding outside the border - is being resolved. The rest face from 8 years of imprisonment to life imprisonment with confiscation of property. As reported by ArmyInform, The SBU detained an official of Ukrzaliznytsia who, through her militant husband, -leaked- data about echelons of the Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/inzhener-stolychnogo-metro-stvoryv-agenturnu-merezhu-yaka-navodyla-vorozhi-rakety-na-kyyiv-i-harkiv-sbu/	2025-01-18T07:11:51-08:00

-Limited suitability- must re-pass the VLK before February 4 - clarification of the Ministry of Defe...	About this reported on January 18 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The Ministry of Defense explains why it is necessary to undergo a medical examination and what the consequences may be in case of violation of the requirements of the law. On May 4, 2024, the Law of Ukraine dated March 21, 2024 No. 3621-IX -On Amendments to Certain Laws of Ukraine Regarding Ensuring the Rights of Servicemen and Policemen to Social Protection- (hereinafter - Law No. 3621). This document excludes from the provisions of the legislation on military duty and military service such definitions as -limited fitness for military service- and -unfit for military service in peacetime, limited fitness in wartime.- Order of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine dated August 14, 2008 No. 402 -On approval of the Regulation on military medical examination in the Armed Forces of Ukraine-, which defines the procedure for conducting military medical examination military medical commissions (hereinafter - VLK). During the medical examination of servicemen and other persons (including conscripts and conscripts) of the VLK, resolutions of the following general content are adopted: =-_blank- rel=-nofollow- href=-https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/3621-20#Text->By law No. 3621, i.e. up to and including February 4, 2025. What is the procedure for conscripts to change their status? Territorial recruitment and social support centers at the place of residence of conscripted citizens of Ukraine organize a medical examination and clarify information. According to the Military Accounting Rules (appendix 2 of the Procedure, approved by the resolution of the CMU dated 30.12.2022 No. 1487) conscripts, conscripts and reservists must arrive at the TCC within the specified time in mobilization orders, summonses, orders, respectively, for military registration and determination of appointment for a special period, registration of military registration documents, passing a medical examination, referral to training for the purpose of obtaining or improving a military accounting specialty, conscription for military service or training (verification) and special meetings of conscripts and reservists. At this stage, passing a military medical examination is possible only with a referral issued by the TCC. In order to issue a referral, the TCC must summon the conscript with a summons. If there was no summons, then the conscript can personally apply to the TCC to receive a referral to the VLK. We also note that according to clause 3.8 of chapter 3 of the section II of Order No. 402 Resolution of the VLK of district, city TCCs and SPs on the degree of suitability of a conscript for military service under conscription during mobilization, for a special period and/or under the period of validity of the legal regime of martial law is valid for one year from the day of the end of the medical examination. Therefore, conscripts need to update their medical information annually.

According to Code of Ukraine on Administrative Offenses (KupAP) for this, a fine in the amount of one thousand to one thousand five hundred non-taxable minimum incomes of citizens - or from 17,000 to 25,500 hryvnias. If a person with the status of -Limited suitability- does not pass a re-examination by February 5, the electronic military registration document in Reserve+ will remain unchanged. However, if the TCC sends a summons to pass the VLC, and the conscript does not fulfill the terms of this summons, the -wanted- status will be displayed in Reserve+. The Ministry of Defense is implementing a reform of the VLK. At the first stage of its implementation, it will be possible to send a request for a referral to the VLC through the Reserve+ mobile application, receive a notification with details and go to the health care facility indicated in the referral, without the need to visit the TCC. This stage should be implemented in January. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense implements systemic reform of the military medical examination (MME) in the Armed Forces. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/obmezheno-prydatni-mayut-povtorno-projty-vlk-do-4-lyutogo-rozyasnennya-minoborony/	2025-01-18T06:31:38-08:00
The occupiers are trying to cross the Oskil on improvised watercraft — Viktor Tregubov	This was announced by the speaker of the Khortytsya operational and strategic group of troops on the air of the telethon. - Major Viktor Tregubov, answering the question whether the occupiers manage to gain a foothold on the shore controlled by the Armed Forces. -The Russians constantly, especially at night, try to cross the Oskil on one or another watercraft that can carry five to 10 people. These are different types of inflatable, motor and other boats. The only way they do this is to try to sit down somewhere in a forest plantation and wait for a new group until there is a certain number of them,- the officer said. At the same time, he noted that Ukrainian defenders -are dealing with this issue with the help of fpv drones and drops.- -They catch them and just blow them out of the sky. But some are caught, and some are caught less. That is why the zone in which they like to cross most of all is a zone of constant fighting. But these are not the same battles as, for example, under the same Pokrovsk. This is a completely different intensity, a completely different scale, but this is really an attempt by small groups to infiltrate across the river to create trouble for Ukrainians there,- explained spokesman Viktor Tregubov.

Starting in July 2022, the People's Deputy sent letters on his behalf to the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine to grant permission for the departure of men in the guise of drivers who were supposed to accompany him across the border. 23 cases were documented when, on the basis of letters from a people's deputy, 18 men of draft age crossed the state border without him, because at the time of their crossing he was either already outside the border or did not leave the country at all. At the same time, sometimes he needed up to 5 drivers at the same time for trips abroad. Three of these -drivers- never returned to Ukraine. The People's Deputy was notified of the suspicion of organizing illegal transportation of persons across the state border using official position and official forgery (Part 2 of Article 332, Part 1 of Article 366 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). The sanction of the articles provides for punishment in the form of imprisonment for a term of up to 7 years. The people's deputy was also handed a petition to choose a preventive measure in the form of detention, which will be submitted for consideration by an investigating judge. People's deputy and persons who traveled abroad in this way are being searched.

OSUV - Khortytsia - denied the information about the alleged battles for Pokrovsk	This was told by the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational and strategic group of troops on the air of the telethon. - Major Victor Tregubov. According to him, although the Pokrovsky direction remains the hottest, battles with the Russian invaders are taking place to the south of the city. -We have to emphasize once again that we are not talking about the city - we are talking about small settlements to the south of it, which are not part of it or part of its agglomeration&#8230; The Russians still set themselves the goal of covering the city: they do not even try to enter the city directly. They are trying to cover it from the sides, advance west of it and cut the relevant logistics routes,- the officer explained. As Tregubov notes, Ukrainian defenders are currently focused on preventing the occupiers from doing this. -And it is around this that the direct battle is going on. Our task is to prevent the Russians from entering the west of the city, to prevent the Russians from getting hold of the settlements southwest of the city and to try to cut the logistical arteries that lead to it. There is no question of a threat to the city itself. The Russians are only trying to create a situation in which the Ukrainian troops in the city will be weakened due to the deterioration of logistics,- added the speaker of the -Khortytsia- OSU. As reported by ArmyInform, today in the Pokrovsky direction, every meter of advance is given to the enemy at a high price, since only in the area of ​​responsibility of one brigade about 300 die per day on average occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/osuv-hortyczya-sprostuvalo-informacziyu-pro-nibyto-boyi-za-pokrovsk/	2025-01-18T05:39:40-08:00

The enemy uses meat assaults: assaults with infantry until they are wiped out - the 77th OAeMBr told...	Viktor Petrovych, a serviceman of the Dnipro Brigade, told about the situation there on the ArmyTV stream. — What has changed since the moment of our last communication? What is the situation in your brigade's zone of responsibility? — Due to extreme communication, the enemy has somewhat run out of armored vehicles. Currently, they are using meat assaults, that is, they are trying to attack our positions with infantry in waves. Previously, these were mass assaults with the use of armored vehicles. Then more than 10 units of armored vehicles were used twice. They have been repulsed and are now apparently restocking armored vehicles. But, nevertheless, the infantry is still used. — How actively do they break on the right bank of the Oskol River? That is, are they trying to cross, or are there no such attempts? — In our line of responsibility, no crossings have been made so far. We have destroyed all the water vehicles that have been abandoned there and they do not currently have this capability. In them, firstly, there is not a very wide wedge, and secondly, there is a very swampy riverbed and it is very wide, extremely difficult to wade through. That is, it is not enough to swim across, there is also a very wide strip of reeds and high banks. Well, in a word, it is difficult to move there. Therefore, so far no such attempts have been recorded, I have not been informed about them. — Mr. Viktor, can you tell us a little more about your visas, which are standing in front of you. Perhaps you know what these brigades, regiments and units are. Maybe there are some radio intercepts of them or communications with the captives? - At the moment I can't say for sure who is against us, but my comrade, who is now wounded, recorded and sent me a video showing all the chevrons he collected from the killed enemies . And there's storm-z, wagner chevrons, there's some of their widow chevrons. That is, in principle, there are a lot of different divisions, which, obviously, are not permanently here, but are like dowries. That is, let's say they form an assault company in another unit and attach it here to those who are standing here. And they storm until they are wiped out. Then the command takes them out of here, relatively speaking, the next ones are recruited. And the next ones are also sent to our positions until they are erased to zero. When massed infantry are used for assaults, fpv drones are most effective. When there are both mass assaults and in small groups, fpvs calculate the infantry well, hit them accurately, unlike artillery, which has a certain spread and with its help, it is quite difficult to catch a group of three infantrymen, relatively speaking. FPV is more efficient in this regard. They are also effective against moving armored vehicles, which are also difficult to hit with artillery. And in order to prevent the enemy from getting to our infantry, we need more fpv drones, we need a lot of components for them, we need a lot of material base in order to save the lives of the soldiers of the 77th brigade.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/vorog-vykorystovuye-myasni-shturmy-shturmuye-pihotoyu-poky-ta-ne-zitretsya-u-77-j-oaembr-rozpovily-pro-sytuacziyu-na-kupyanskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-18T04:57:14-08:00
A judge of the Economic Court of Kyiv was suspected of working for the Ministry of Defense of the Ru...	The State Bureau of Investigation reported this on January 18. It was established that as early as 2011, the aggressor country involved the then president, prime minister of Ukraine and a judge of the Economic Court of Kyiv, as well as heads of various branches of the judicial system, in subversive activities against Ukraine. The leadership of the Russian Federation has developed a plan according to which the defense capabilities and armed forces of the aggressor will be financed at the expense of the State Budget of Ukraine under the pretext of fulfilling the decision of the Economic Court of Kyiv to repay a non-existent debt. For this purpose, in 2011, the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation addressed the leadership of Ukraine with a letter of assistance in repaying the debt of one of the economic entities in the amount of $405.5 million. And for the supplied natural gas back in 1996-1997. Our state had nothing to do with the debt of a commercial enterprise and could not bear responsibility for it. However, in 2011, the former leadership of the country began to emphasize in the mass media that Ukraine should repay the specified amount to the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. In addition, a letter was prepared to the Security Service of Ukraine with a request to prosecute the head of the economic entity for allegedly transferring this debt to the state. Trying to artificially create grounds for direct financing of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation at the expense of the Ukrainian state budget, high-ranking officials involved the leadership of the judicial system and the judge of the Economic Court of Kyiv to recover $405.5 million in favor of the Russian Federation based on an illegal court decision. According to the scheme developed by the participants, in August 2012, the Ministry of Finance filed a lawsuit against the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine to the Commercial Court of Kyiv to collect more than 3 billion hryvnias from the state budget. The Russians were counting on the fact that back in 2004, the then Prime Minister, and later the President of Ukraine, promised to assist them in the implementation of these court decisions. However, due to the lack of contractual legal relations between the plaintiff and the defendant, the judge had to refuse to open proceedings in the case. Moreover, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation did not attach any evidence to the lawsuit to confirm why Ukraine should pay this debt. However, the judge of the commercial court made an illegal decision and transferred the duty of gathering and providing evidence in the case to the defendant. According to this decision, the Cabinet of Ministers provided copies of correspondence between the heads of the governments of Ukraine and the Russian Federation in 1996. They were dated even before the business entity concluded the agreement that resulted in the debt, so these letters could not be evidence of both the existence of the debt and its transfer to Ukraine. In addition, the originals of these letters never existed, but the court ignored this fact. Despite the expiry of the statute of limitations and the absence of state guarantees for the company's debts, as well as the absence of evidence of the very fact of the existence in 2012 of the company's debt under the contracts of 1996-1997, the judge satisfied the lawsuit of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation and decided to collect from any account of the State Budget of Ukraine in favor of the Russian Federation more than 3.1 billion UAH Part of the funds were collected from Ukraine in order to implement the aforementioned illegal court decision in favor of the Russian Federation. After the beginning of the aggression of the Russian Federation against our country and the change of the state leadership, in 2014 another judge of the Economic Court overturned this illegal decision, but it was not possible to return the money unjustifiably collected in the interests of Russia. According to the investigation, these funds were used to finance the so-called svo. As reported by ArmyInform, the people's deputy of several convocations was notified on suspicion of treason.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/suddyu-gospodarskogo-sudu-kyyeva-zapidozryly-u-roboti-na-minoborony-rf/	2025-01-18T04:33:30-08:00

A People's Deputy of several convocations has been notified of suspicion of treason	This was announced on January 18 by the Prosecutor General's Office. According to the investigation, the former deputy of the People's Republic, who was a member of the -Party of Regions- and -Opposition Bloc- for a long time, has been spreading Kremlin narratives since the beginning of Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine in 2014. In order to preserve the influence of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, which supports armed aggression against the country, the suspect spread the so-called ideology of -Russian peace-. With the help of the Patriarch of the Russian Federation, he became a curator for the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine. The suspect carried out his instructions and instructions in order to ensure that a significant part of Ukrainian society, who are believers of the UOC-MP, were under the direct influence of the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church. The People's Deputy also used the right of legislative initiative in order to hide the existence of a church-canonical connection and the entry of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church into the structure of the Ministry of the Russian Orthodox Church and to ensure the preservation of the Russian Orthodox Church's influence on the territory of Ukraine. The suspect gave an interview to the media, in which he made statements against other faiths operating in Ukraine, characterizing them in negative terms. His actions were aimed at inciting hatred and enmity on religious grounds. Before the start of the full-scale aggression, he left for the European Union on a charter flight, where he continued to work in the interests of the Russian Federation. As reported by ArmyInform, the TV presenter Medvedchuk was informed of the suspicion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/narodnomogo-deputata-kilkoh-sklykan-povidomleno-pro-pidozru-u-derzhzradi/	2025-01-18T04:02:45-08:00
TV presenter Medvedchuk was informed about the suspicion	This was announced by the Security Service of Ukraine on January 18. The Security Service of Ukraine collected a large-scale evidence base and received the conclusions of independent examinations confirming the anti-Ukrainian activities of the ex-host of the sanctioned TV channels -Nash- and -NewsOne-, which belonged to Viktor Medvedchuk and Yevhen Murayev. According to the case materials, after the start of the full-scale war, the person involved created his channel on the video hosting YouTube, where he continued to spread the narratives of the Kremlin. To do this, the blogger regularly invited pro-Russian -polite experts- to his broadcasts, a large number of whom are currently hiding in the Russian Federation. During the interview, both the author himself and the guests of the studio repeatedly tried to justify Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine, as well as the war crimes of the Russians, in particular, missile strikes on the civilian infrastructure of our country. Another pro-Kremlin blogger was a frequent guest of the figure, who in February 2024 had already received suspicion from SBU investigators. Then the court chose a preventive measure for him - house arrest, but later the blogger continued his subversive activities in the interests of Moscow. Both figures publicly tried to discredit Ukraine in the international arena and shook the social and political situation within our country. Forensic-linguistic expertise initiated by the SBU confirmed the facts of crimes committed by both bloggers. Currently, the investigators of the Security Service have informed them about the suspicion under Art. 2, 3 Art. 436-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (justification, recognition as legitimate, denial of armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, glorification of its participants). The question of choosing a preventive measure in the form of detention for the accused is being resolved. They face up to 8 years in prison with confiscation of property. As reported by ArmyInform, a banker was detained in Kyiv /a>, who donated to the occupiers. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/televeduchomu-medvedchuka-povidomyly-pro-pidozru/	2025-01-18T03:42:06-08:00

-Technology is a little outdated - the Russians rely on infantry and UAVs in assaults	Major Viktor Tregubov, the spokesman for the operational-strategic group of the -Tavria- troops, told on the ArmiyaTV stream about this. -The tactic consists in infiltrating in small groups: they have infiltrated and try to gain a foothold, wait for reinforcements, and then move on. The technique is used to a limited extent and not in all areas. Especially when compared with the amount in which the enemy used the technique a year ago. Now, firstly, it has come to an end a little, and secondly, the use of FPV drones and mine barriers has significantly reduced the level of use of equipment. That's why a link is now used: infantry plus various types of UAVs. And that's how they go on an assault,- Viktor Tregubov said. As reported by ArmyInform, Russians are scraping the bottom of their arsenals.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/tehnika-trohy-pidzakinchylasya-rosiyany-pokladayutsya-u-shturmah-na-pihotu-ta-bpla/	2025-01-18T00:50:32-08:00

Yevhen Alkhimov, press officer of the 28th mechanized brigade named after the Knights of the Winter Campaign, told this on the ArmyTV stream. -The enemy continues to use the tactics of small infantry groups, but the groups have become larger. If earlier the group consisted of up to 8 people, now it has increased to 20. If earlier they accumulated 1-2 people each and the group went on an assault, now the Russians use equipment for faster delivery of assault groups. Now the rolling starts right away,- said Yevhen Alkhimov. According to him, the large deployment of enemy drones creates significant problems for our logistics. At the same time, the enemy's use of anti-tank missiles decreased from 7-10 to 1-2 daily. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers are increasingly trying to -kut-i-znyshhyly-v-lysyachyh-norah/->apply new tactics — when a small assault group enters first, hides as close as possible to Ukrainian positions and waits for reinforcements.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/zavalyuyut-pihotoyu-na-toreczkomu-napryamku-vorog-zbilshyv-kilkist-shturmovykiv/	2025-01-17T22:33:21-08:00

About the lost -golden hour- after the injuries, the world's first unique operation near Bakhmut and...	Today we meet the doctor who performed that unique operation. This is the chief surgeon of the Armed Forces, colonel of the medical service Kostyantyn Humeniuk. -I had a choice: switch to open surgery or continue laparoscopically. I am not a gambling person, and it was definitely not gambling, I always weigh everything very much and take into account all the risks&#8230; But I just told myself I could do it. And with God's help, everything worked out. The operation lasted almost an hour and a half. Currently, we process such cases for up to an hour,- says the officer. In 2017, he was the chief surgeon of the ATO, in 2018-2019 — the chief surgeon of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. He met the large-scale invasion at the front - and since then he spends a lot of time in the area of ​​hostilities, in direct contact with the doctors of mobile hospitals and advanced surgical groups. In addition, he works a lot with partners, having a number of foreign business trips. During one of these, in the USA, Konstantin Humenyuk (and, therefore, the entire surgical service of the Armed Forces) received a standing ovation, seeing only a part and fragments of the work of our military medics in saving the lives of defenders. Next is an ArmiyaInform interview with Kostyantyn Gumenyuk. — What was your area of ​​responsibility when the full-scale invasion of the Russians began in 2022 and what is it now? — The entire surgical service of the Armed Forces is my area of ​​responsibility, starting with all advanced surgical groups, military mobile hospitals, military medical clinical centers located in different cities of Ukraine. And accordingly, all wounded, traumatized and patients of a surgical profile are under my responsibility. With the beginning of the war, of course, their number increased significantly, and the load on the entire surgical service accordingly also increased. He met the war in Donetsk region, where he went a few days before the invasion - at that time, the 65th military mobile hospital was stationed in Chasovoy Yar. At 5 a.m., I woke up to do the traditional morning workout — but around the same time, the OOS headquarters was attacked. From then on, it began: a non-stop stream of ambulances, many wounded with modern combat trauma, in particular, in a serious condition - with amputations of the lower and upper limbs. Many had to operate in various mobile hospitals in Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Druzhkivka, Pokrovsk, Dnipro, Kharkiv; deal with organizational issues regarding the flow of the wounded and change their evacuation routes, taking into account that Kharkiv was already being shelled at that time. The issues of medical supply with blood preparations and medicines were also important. Subsequently, he was engaged in moving the Odessa military hospital to another region, after that he returned to the front. We had to work a lot in the operating theaters in Dnipro - the Mechnikov hospital, the military medical clinical center and other civilian hospitals received a large flow of wounded, for which I thank the civilian surgeons and all other doctors and medical personnel who saved our wounded. As the chief surgeon, I am responsible for the wounded from the moment of his admission to the advanced surgical group. This is my very first link. —The war, unfortunately, became an impetus for progress in various fields. How was this reflected in military surgery? What do you think has been the quantum leap for military medicine since the start of a full-scale invasion? What has become a game changer for military surgery? - It is worth understanding that the more operations there are, the more experience surgeons gain. The more a surgeon works with modern combat trauma, the more he understands all the complex life-threatening moments, what are the consequences of this combat trauma, and, accordingly, the mastery of operative interventions increases, this is very important. Yes, since 2014, since the time of the ATO/OOS, we have also been gaining experience. At that time, there was a relatively small number of wounded. Yes, we were wounded by various types of weapons and sniper fire, then we could quickly deliver the wounded to mobile hospitals, the -golden hour- was observed, which is very important. After a large-scale invasion, we have a large number of wounded for the entire surgical service of the Armed Forces. And then we clearly understood that in order to save all these wounded, there must be a tactic of Damage control surgery. This is a special tactic that was introduced by our American partners, they used it in Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan. Its meaning is that during surgery, the surgeon should perform a shortened stage of the operation precisely to save life, without performing the full scope of operations. This is especially true for the unstable seriously wounded. After stabilization of the condition, the final stage of the operation is performed. And this tactic has proven its effectiveness in severe wounds of almost all localizations, especially the organs of the abdominal cavity, as the heaviest in the war. And it was during a large-scale invasion that we saw that when we use Damage control surgery, the results are better. We now apply this tactic to almost all injuries. An extreme case was when a wounded man with a fragment in the heart, signs of hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade, which is life-threatening, was operated on in a mobile hospital, the tamponade was removed, and the wounded man was evacuated to the Amosov Institute in 9 hours. There, high-class surgeons using high-quality equipment performed an operation, removed the splinter and saved lives. This applies to any other complex surgical interventions. In case of injury, the task of the surgeon in the mobile hospital is to save life. The priority is a saved life! Restoration of blood loss begins already at the stabilization point of the brigade, followed by rapid evacuation. And it is precisely this tactic in interaction with clear and professional assistance at all stages that allows for high-quality results, and the survival rate of wounded soldiers is much higher. In addition, there is another complication: all gunshot wounds are infected. We also have the problem of antibiotic resistance in the treatment of soldiers, it is difficult to deal with sepsis, and severe pneumonia is starting as a complication of combat trauma. There are cases where surgeons perform unique operations, but the wounded may die from bilateral pneumonia or multiple organ failure. Such complications are frequent and can lead to fatalities, unfortunately. — When was the peak of the arrival of the wounded to the advanced surgical teams? What is the intensity and stage of the war? - Spring 2022. But in general, the front is changeable. It may be a little quieter in Donetsk region, and it may get worse in the Zaporizhzhia direction. Then everything quieted down in this direction, but the number of wounded in Kharkiv region increased. It all happens very locally. — The burden on both the advanced surgical teams and the hospital due to the full-scale Russian invasion was colossal. How did you cope with this challenge? — Due to the professionalism of the managers of all departments. These are the heads of mobile hospitals and leading surgeons&#8230; If we talk about the surgical service, everyone performed their functional duties, their work, and thanks to this, we managed to survive. In addition, many surgeons and operating room nurses came to the army for mobilization. This also saved the situation, especially when there was a large flow of wounded 24/7, when surgeons could not sleep for two or three days. - What dynamics do you observe in the context of the frequency of fatalities in case of combat injury, icomparing the spring of 2022 and the beginning of 2025? — Seasonality greatly affects the survival rate of our boys. Yes, hypothermia, frostbite, for example, aggravate a combat injury. If a wounded serviceman spent 2-3 hours in some cold dugout, then this general hypothermia will also affect the soldier's survival. What we have seen during this time is that the faster the wounded are transported from the battlefield to the staging area of ​​a brigade or forward surgical team, the better the survival rate. We now often talk about the -golden hour- - that a soldier must be taken to a surgeon within an hour from the moment of injury. In this case, the results of treatment and survival will be better. We currently spend over an hour on this - sometimes 6, 12 or more. Often, during speeches at conferences, foreign colleagues ask me: -How so?!-. It has to be explained that the wounded man can put a tourniquet on himself, but for several hours he is not evacuated from the battlefield, and the combat medic cannot reach him - shelling continues, drones overhead, etc. Therefore, the evacuation of the wounded to the advanced surgical group or the stabilization point of the brigade takes place at night or in the evening, when there are fewer drones and there is an opportunity to approach with armored vehicles. - Actually, in continuation of the topic. According to the NATO protocol, the wounded should be in the hospital within an hour. In our realities of war, this -golden hour- is being lost. Do we somehow adapt these protocols to our war? Do we develop our own? Please tell us how we are dealing with this. - Yes, even from the experience of the ATO/OOS, we saw that if a wounded person is already at the surgeon's place within an hour, the survival rate is higher, the number of amputations due to tourniquets would be significantly less . But now we have such a situation that a military man puts a tourniquet, a certain time passes, and he cannot loosen it, for example, because the battle is going on or there is no combat medic, or he died. Then it is no longer possible to save the limb, we perform amputations. — In this context, another question: what do you see as the real volume of interventions for a paramedic? Is it planned to expand the training of doctors, to allow them to perform certain interventions? After all, there are rare cases when a person cannot be evacuated from the battlefield for a day or more - Currently, there are many centers in Ukraine that conduct training in tactical medicine, prepare combat medics, senior combat medics. Such courses are also held on the basis of the Ukrainian Military Medical Academy. Plus there are training centers, public organizations that deal with this training. Currently, this training is qualified and of high quality. But it is clear that there are not enough specialists to train such a large number of people. But my personal opinion: every Ukrainian, starting from high school, should have the skills to provide first aid to himself and others. These classes in Ukraine should start from school. People need to know how to apply a tourniquet or stop bleeding. A person must be psychologically prepared for extreme conditions - we have shelling of cities every day, sometimes, unfortunately, with a large number of wounded. A person should know what to do if there is no tourniquet at hand (therefore, there is a belt or laces), how to stop arterial bleeding or how to free the upper airway and provide quality resuscitation. Therefore, as the chief surgeon of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, I believe that within the borders of the state, the issue of providing first medical aid should begin at school. — In one of your interviews, you said that military surgeons of the Armed Forces of Ukraine implement and develop modern surgical techniques, especially in minimally invasive surgical interventions. In May 2022, in a military mobile hospital, you performed a modern laparoscopic operation for the removal of a kidney for the first time in Ukraine in a gunshot wound with destruction of the organ. Judging by open sources, such an operation had no analogues in the world at that time. Tell me more. - Usually, a modern combat trauma is a large incision, where the surgeon makes a laparotomy (cuts, for example, the abdomen, and operates on the internal organs) or a thoracotomy (cuts the chest and operates). We have started to implement minimally invasive surgery - when not an incision is made, but a small puncture, and the surgeon, observing the situation through a video camera on the monitor, operates with micro-instruments. Therefore, we introduced minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy, thoracoscopy) in modern combat trauma. And we are pioneers in the world, because we were the first to do it in combat conditions. In May 2022, I was in one of the military hospitals in the eastern direction. Then he performed a laparoscopic nephrectomy - laparoscopically removed the kidney, which was destroyed, with bleeding. Previously, an incision would be made in the abdomen and the surgeon would remove the kidney with his hands, tying the vessels, etc. I managed to do it laparoscopically: only small punctures in the abdomen - and I could see all the internal organs on the monitor. I found that kidney, stopped the bleeding, removed it and saved the fighter's life. And you know: the next day, the same injured person arrived with a destroyed kidney. Having experience behind him, he performed the second operation much faster, because he knew all the technical points. Such an operation was carried out for the first time in the world, because then I looked through all the specialized literature - but I did not find any examples. I asked myself then, why I was not told in the academy or universities that it is possible to do this (smiles). That is why the military surgeons of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are the pioneers in the implementation of modern operations. Even now, when I come to the mobile hospital, and there is appropriate equipment, and surgeons already perform many such surgical interventions for modern combat trauma - namely, laparoscopically and thoracoscopically. During one of the conferences abroad, when I talked about our experience, my colleagues simply did not understand how this could be done. Because if they perform such surgical interventions, then only in large basic hospitals, where there is equipment and a large team. But in our country it is done in combat conditions, where surgeons operate laparoscopically on the wounded. - What guided you when you performed the first such operation in the world? - I then started this laparoscopic operation - I went in and saw a large hematoma. And I had a choice: switch to open surgery or continue laparoscopically. I am not a gambling person, and it was definitely not gambling, I always weigh everything very much and take into account all the risks&#8230; But I just told myself I could do it. And with God's help, everything worked out. The operation lasted almost an hour and a half. Now we work on such cases for up to an hour. - Tell us about three unique operations of yours personally. - Not that they are unique - I will tell you about the most memorable ones. Once, a wounded man with a gunshot wound to the abdomen arrived at the mobile hospital, and the anesthesiologists were just about to give him anesthesia. And he opens his eyes and says: -Kostyantin Vitaliyovych, you operated on me in 2017, look, there is a scar on the side of my thigh, they took a bullet out of me.- And I did not remember him at all, even in which hospital he operated. It was so fate that he came to see me for the second time for surgery. Currently, he continues to serve on the front line. From the memorable still&#8230; You know, when there is a large flow of wounded, the surgeons do sorting: they determine who goes to the operation first, who goes to the second, and so on. And in civilian polyclinics, there are always disputes and quarrels about who will get to the doctor first. But among the wounded (severely wounded!) there is no such thing - they lie quietly. No one is saying that he should be saved first. There was no such case. And I have been to many sortings. They are concise: -Doc, as you say, you can see better.- Although I understand that waiting for you to be taken for surgery is psychologically very difficult. In many guys who wake up from anesthesia, I don't see fear in their eyes about not having, for example, a limb. He just says, -Amputation? And nothing could be done?... Well, there will be a prosthesis.- This cannot be expressed in words&#8230; They support me and help, in a big way, to communicate this difficult news. Many soldiers with prostheses continue to serve. I saw how one soldier's titanium prosthesis was pierced by a fragment. Such cases also happen. - Tell us about the three most unique operations in the army since the beginning of the full-scale invasion? - The first operation is a thoracoscopic operation for a gunshot wound to the heart and the presence of hemopericard and cardiac tamponade. The shrapnel entered the heart and hemorrhage occurred in the pericardium. As a result, the heart begins to work poorly, because it is unable to contract, blood accumulates in the heart bag. The wounded man suffocates, his neck veins swell. And at this time, the operation must be done quickly. And we went thoracoscopically - we made small punctures in the chest, installed a video camera, cut the pericardium, the blood came out of the heart, and it began to function normally. The wounded man's condition stabilized, and we sent him by helicopter to Amosov, where he was operated on and his life was saved. It was also the first such operation in the world. The second operation is the removal of the kidney, which I have already talked about. The third is when the fragment enters the large blood vessels, the inferior vena cava, or the aorta. These are large blood vessels and if the bleeding is not stopped in time, the person will bleed quickly. There was such a case when a fragment got into the inferior vena cava and got stuck in its wall. The surgeons saw this and asked me what to do. And this is a mobile hospital, and I understand that professional experience is needed, and that there is no threatening bleeding, you need to have a sufficient amount of blood, besides, other wounded people arrive. The military was stable, and we made an important decision: they made a tamponade, put drainage, quickly sent to the Institute of Shalimov, where it was operated. Life is saved. These are unique operations, but properly made decision - is also very important. It could be said that we operate there in a mobile hospital. But as the chief surgeon, I understand that the risk of bleeding was very high. And I understood that surgeons could not cope at that level, and we would lose life. Proper solution = saved life, and this is the most important thing. - How does work with partners continue? Do they come and take experience? What are their emotions when you talk about the experience of our combat doctors? About 12,000 participants. I had a performance in a very large hall, very briefly told about our surgical capabilities and how we save our boys. The hall applauded. And now I do not praise myself now - I was applauded not to me, but all the surgical service of the Armed Forces. I just put my hand on my heart and bowed. Many acquaintances of new ones. Partners from other countries were very supported by Israel, for example. They talked about their own challenges and volumes of work. But when I told that we can have up to 100-150 operations a day in only one direction of the front-I was looked at me with wide eyes. Yes, we have the wounded both with slight injuries, with medium, with severe, and extremely difficult. But the fact itself. Do you understand? .. - What is the most difficult operation you have performed? Lasted seven hours. Successfully. As for the wounded &#8230; When I operate guys, I do not allow myself to think that we will not handle somewhere. I clearly know that we will do everything. Yes, there are difficult cases where I see: 50 to 50, I ask myself how to do &#8230; At such moments, I never shy and call my senior colleagues, academics - and will always tell me. So now I say surgeons - call and ask. They even call at night, apologize who have woken up, but advise what to do with one wound. It is often the case that they need support or a hint. And they always get it from me. And I am proud to manage to today such a powerful professional surgical service of the Armed Forces. - What would you advise military doctors to prevent mental maintenance? Since we understand that such a load is difficult to withstand &#8230; - when I come to my colleagues, I always ask them what they do in my free time. Laughing answers that there is no free time. And if so - then fall asleep. Yes, monotonous work and constant load lead to psycho -emotional burnout. I ask them to watch beautiful movies. Be sure to play sports - necessarily! Sometimes the boys even order themselves small expanders, simulators, dumbbells, put tennis tables. Sport is a little distracting, and mental and physical activity should be combined. I advise you to monitor the webinars, new operations around the world. If possible, stroll in the open air. Well, key - communication with relatives and relatives. - What is your recipe to keep yourself mentally during this war? be able to separate from basic work and salvation. Be able to find joy in a little one: good music, good communication, a beautiful book, a beautiful movie. Sport. All in general leads to the fact that a person is distracted and there is no psycho -emotional and physical burnout. -what will be the completion of the Russian-Ukrainian war? I understand that options ( end of war. - Ed. ) can be very different. We really want our victory. But for me personally, the end of the war will be the moment when I get the following information: -Konstantine Vitaliyovich, no 200, no 300's.- This is the stop for me, definitely. So then we will operate in the boys hernia, appendicitis, cholecystitis or broken legs ( laughs ). We will continue to rescue both the military and the civilian population - but then all there will be non -adhesive injuries. - What will you do the first after the end of the war? Not even in the sea-but in any river: just swim, just sit on the shore of quiet and peaceful Ukraine.

Division-level breakthrough operation, late Soviet team and cementing -axis of evil-: expert on Nort...	Why did Russia resort to deploying troops from North Korea and for what reasons is it still hiding their presence there? Military expert Petro Chernyk answered these questions. -It is not a secret why this operation was organized. First of all, it is a diversion of troops from the strategic eastern bridgehead, especially in the Donetsk direction. And, of course, this debunks the myth that a non-nuclear country cannot attack a nuclear one. A nuclear apocalypse did not happen. But there is another very important and principled element in this operation: North Korean troops. They had a lot of questions at the beginning of their entry. A few months ago, the Russian Federation publicized this phenomenon that, they say, such forces will appear that will immediately knock out our troops from the territory of Kurshchyna. This did not happen. Therefore, the strategic question is being revised, whether these troops are so combat-ready and whether they are capable of performing the tasks assigned to them. We can definitely talk about it now from a certain experience. Now just a few analytical points. It was declared that it was used within the limits of up to 12,000 personnel (North Korean troops — ed.). First of all, these are mechanized units. Is it a lot or a little? This is a full division. The division, according to Soviet and current Russian standards, is 12,500 people. According to the classic statute, the same Soviet-Russian one, the division must break through brigade combat formations along a front of 10-15 kilometers, up to 30 kilometers in depth. The North Korean troops could not demonstrate anything like that. This is a very important detail. At most, if you scrupulously check and study their equipment, especially those already confirmed cases of their death, then this is the late Soviet Union, well, maybe a little improved. And let's not forget that combat experience is a very important detail. Our military is probably the most experienced military in the world at the moment—well, second only to the United States of America—but in the type of war we're fighting right now, especially in FPV drones. And here is another small cut. We recall that postcard of the North Koreans, where they tried to shoot down a drone as a bait, that is, a live person. What does that mean? This means that they are treated as biomass, and biomass cannot and will not perform any other option besides meat assaults. So, the summary. If the North Korean troops really had real combat potential, they would have organized at least one division-level breakthrough operation. This did not happen. Now a logical and understandable question arises: why is Russia beginning to hide the facts of their presence? But everything is elementary simple. Everything rests on strategic propaganda. It is similar to -we will take Kyiv in three days- and -we are at war with NATO-. And here it is the same: units on which a huge bet was made in the propaganda sense do not justify themselves. Therefore, this issue should be removed from the agenda. Plus, no matter how strange it sounds, there is also a certain geopolitical component of this phenomenon. What does it consist of? We have no doubt that the allies are conducting serious negotiations behind closed doors with both the Chinese and the Russian Federation regarding the fact that such a flagrant violation of the rules of international warfare is unacceptable. Because there was great geopolitics here for Putin - and not only for Putin, but also for China and for North Korea - this is the cementing of the so-called -axis of evil-. Therefore, they went into hiding and, in my opinion, will continue to do so. It is important for us to hold the bridgehead and to destroy as much as possible, both the occupiers - the Russians themselves - and the North Koreans. Why? Because it is a signal to world dictatorships that such frank adventures will have a certain value in terms of the destruction of their personnel.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/proryvna-operacziya-dyvizijnogo-rivnya-piznoradyanskyj-ekip-ta-czementuvannya-visi-zla-ekspert-pro-pivnichnokorejcziv-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-17T20:44:18-08:00
Bridging the gaps: France to develop new long-range ballistic missile	According to data reporters of the French magazine Challenges, the implementation of this defense project will be the first such initiative since 1997 year, ArmyInform reports. This potential development reflects the growing global reliance on ballistic missiles, which have proven effective in various conflicts. The proposed missile aims to fill a gap in France's capabilities, as its current ballistic missile systems are exclusively submarine-based and designed for nuclear deterrence. In turn, the experts of the Dutch portal for the study of defense prospects Army Recognition reminded that currently the French Republic is armed there are no land-based ballistic missiles. Its only -ballistic- is the M51 missile, which is launched from a submarine and serves as a means of nuclear deterrence. Discussions between the French Armed Forces and the Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) were focused on creating a ground-based missile system that would be controlled from mobile platforms such as trucks. Early design concepts suggest that this missile may have end-phase maneuverability similar to other advanced systems, making it more difficult for enemy defenses to intercept. Historically, France developed several land-based ballistic missiles after World War II. Between 1946 and 1947, German engineers in France worked on the Super V2, a medium-range ballistic missile project with planned variants capable of a range of up to 3,600 kilometers and warheads weighing up to 1,000 kilograms. However, in 1948 this defense program was terminated. The S2, in service since 1971, was a two-stage, solid-propellant medium-range ballistic missile equipped with a 1.2 megaton thermonuclear warhead. In 1980, it was replaced by the S3 missile, which had similar characteristics and remained in service until 1996. In 1974, France introduced the Pluton missile, a short-range tactical ballistic missile with a range of up to 120 kilometers designed for nuclear or conventional warheads. In 1991, the Pluton was replaced by the Hades missile, which had a range of approximately 480 kilometers. The Hadès missile, designated as a pre-strategic nuclear deterrent, was decommissioned by 1997. This new program differs from the French Long-Range Land Strike initiative (FLP-T), which is focused on the development of a replacement for rocket artillery with a range of up to 150 kilometers. In contrast, the proposed ballistic missile would exceed 1,000 kilometers, offering additional strategic options for deep strikes in conflicts. However, funding remains a serious problem, as the French military budget is already allocated to such priority projects as the modernization of M51 missiles and the development of the ASN4G air-launched missile. This potential program could also align with the European Long-Range Strike Approach (ELSA), a joint initiative involving Germany, Italy, Poland, the UK and Sweden. If developed, the missile would complement France's current capabilities, such as Rafale jets and cruise missiles, increasing its ability to launch strategic strikes. Ballistic missiles are designed to deliver warheads over long distances using an arc trajectory. They are powered during the initial phase of flight, after which they move on a ballistic trajectory under the influence of gravity and air resistance. This design allows them to hit targets at different distances from short to intercontinental. Their high speed and height make interception difficult. Some ballistic missiles are equipped with multiple independent warhead units (MIRVs), allowing a single missile to deploy multiple warheads at different targets. These features underscore the strategic importance of ballistic missiles, as evidenced by their effectiveness in recent conflicts and their potential to close capability gaps similar to those found in France's current arsenal. On October 1, 2024, Iran launched 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, several of which penetrated Israel's multi-layered missile defense system and struck key military bases. In response, Israel launched airstrikes using Blue Sparrow ballistic missiles carried by F-15 fighter jets. Analysts consider these exchanges part of the first -ballistic battle- since similar events in April 2024. China has invested heavily in ballistic missile programs with systems such as the DF-21D and DF-26 capable of targeting installations in the western Pacific. In addition, the flight range of the DF-100 supersonic missile was increased to 4,000 kilometers. The South Korean Hyunmoo-V missile, which is detailed told ArmyInform, capable of carrying an eight-ton warhead to a distance of more than 3 thousand kilometers, targeting underground and strategic facilities in North Korea. North Korea has also tested an intercontinental ballistic missile, potentially a solid fuel, capable of reaching the United States. These developments underscore the growing importance of long-range ground strike capabilities in modern defense strategies. How is a ballistic missile different from a cruise missile.

Russian fake about the mobilization of Ukrainian rescuers: what did they make up this time	Propagandists are actively dispersing fake -documents- and fictitious orders that refer to sending rescuers to the front lines. The manipulation is supported by false comments on behalf of Ukrainian officials and -testimonies- of allegedly dismissed employees of the State Emergency Service. Their goal is to create the impression that the state leaves civilians defenseless in wartime conditions. 1. The State Emergency Service performs exclusively humanitarian tasks. The State Service for Emergency Situations is not part of the defense forces and does not have the authority to participate in hostilities. Its main task is to eliminate the consequences of shelling, rescue people, clear mines and provide first aid. 2. There are no orders for the mobilization of rescuers. No information about the mobilization or other changes in the work of the service has been published on the official resources of the State Emergency Service. Official statements of representatives of the State Emergency Service deny any assumptions about the involvement of rescuers in hostilities. 3. Russian propaganda systematically attacks humanitarian services. This is not the first case when the enemy spreads fakes about the State Emergency Service. Previously, there were rumors about a -mass flight- of rescuers from front-line cities, -weapons supply- under the guise of humanitarian aid, etc. The purpose of these information attacks is to destabilize the situation in the rear. 4. The lack of logic in the fake. In the conditions of constant missile attacks and terror on the part of the Russian Federation, the reduction of rescue units would be illogical and harmful to the country's security. On the contrary, the Ukrainian authorities are strengthening the State Emergency Service, providing it with modern equipment and technology. Such emissions are aimed at inciting mistrust of the authorities, undermining the morale of the population and devaluing the work of rescuers. They try to create the impression of chaos and disorder in the rear. As a result, citizens may begin to doubt the effectiveness of critical services and panic. How to counter fakes 1. Trust only official sources. Information should be checked on the official resources of the State Emergency Service, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other verified media. 2. Do not spread unverified information. If you see suspicious news, do not repost it without checking. It is better to clarify the facts and make sure of their reliability. 3. Report fakes. Block accounts that spread false information and report them to social network administrators. Russian propaganda continues to use fakes as a tool of hybrid warfare. The enemy will not be able to sow panic among Ukrainians, because society has already learned to distinguish truth from lies. Ukrainian rescuers remain in place, fulfilling their noble mission of saving lives. And we must all support them without allowing the enemy to undermine our faith in the state and victory.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/rosijskyj-fejk-pro-mobilizacziyu-ukrayinskyh-ryatuvalnykiv-yak-vorog-manipulyuye-pravdoyu/	2025-01-17T20:10:59-08:00

Ukrainian border guards rescued a petitioner who fell into an abyss on the border with Romania	About this on Friday, January 17, told in the press service of the DPSU. As it is reported, while trying to cross the border illegally, the man became ill, as a result of which he fell into an abyss. -He was found unconscious 200 meters from the border. The Transcarpathian was in a deep abyss, where he fell, being in a helpless state, because during an attempt to enter Romania illegally, he had an epileptic attack,- the report says. It is also noted that the evader went on his -hiking- with his relative, but he left him only after calling the victim's wife to inform her of what had happened. -The border guards called emergency medical workers to the location of the Transcarpathian. With the use of special equipment, he was pulled out of the abyss and taken to a medical facility. Currently, the man's condition is serious. Doctors diagnosed him with hypothermia of the II degree,- the border guards added. As reported by ArmyInform, three Ukrainians wandered the snowy mountains for seven days in search state border.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/17/ukrayinski-prykordonnyky-vryatuvaly-uhylyanta-shho-vpav-u-prirvu-na-kordoni-z-rumuniyeyu/	2025-01-17T10:42:18-08:00
Financial support for the military: what payments are guaranteed to defenders	The relevant clarifications were published by the department on Friday, January 17. -Servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine receive not only basic monthly allowance, but also additional one-time payments. One of the types of additional one-time monetary support is aid,- the Ministry of Defense notes. In particular, we are talking about payments for: Among them, assistance in concluding the first contract, for rehabilitation, for solving social and household needs, and in the event of release from military service. -The Ministry of Defense is making efforts to improve the material and social security of the military. Today, we have a line of payments designed to ensure a dignified life for active military personnel, and also serve as an incentive for those who are thinking about joining the Armed Forces of Ukraine,- emphasized Nikita Nikitenko, State Secretary of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/17/finansova-pidtrymka-vijskovyh-yaki-vyplaty-garantovani-zahysnykam/	2025-01-17T10:09:41-08:00
Soldiers of the Patrol Police convinced the occupier to shorten his life	The corresponding video published in its Telegram channel by the -Predator- brigade. As can be seen in the released footage, the main argument of the Defense Forces fighters to induce the occupier to commit suicide was several drops from a quadcopter. Having received shrapnel injuries as a result of the bursting of grenades, the Russian realized that no one would evacuate him and made the only correct decision for himself. -They gave the Russian a nightmare with resets. He decided not to wait for evacuation with broken legs, and&#8230; shot himself Predators can safely be called masters of persuasion!-, the patrol officers noted.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/17/bijczi-patrulnoyi-policziyi-perekonaly-okupanta-ukorotyty-sobi-viku/	2025-01-17T09:54:50-08:00
-Samovolka-, injury and service with his father: the story of Denis Governor's return to the front	The story of the fighter was publicized on the page of the 13th Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine -CHARTER-. After returning to the army, Denys turned to the command with a request to join the -Charter- brigade, where his father was already working as a driver of the -Novator- armored car. This decision became important for him - fighting together with his father was fundamental for him. -When you serve next to a loved one, it gives you extra support. We work in the same crew, one helps the other, we transport the infantry and evacuate the wounded together,- says Denys. He works on a Browning machine gun, covering his comrades. Despite the danger that is always present at the front, Denys and his father feel that their strength lies in unity. The armored car driven by the father can withstand heavy fire, but at the front, even the best equipment cannot guarantee complete safety. -The main thing is to save personnel, protect people, even if you have to risk your life,- Denys emphasizes. He recalls cases when their armored car came under heavy fire, but thanks to quick actions and support of each other, they managed to get out of the most difficult situations. For the family of Governors, it is important not only to fight, but also to be together. The support they receive from each other gives them the strength to overcome the hardships of war. -My father and I are together, and this helps us keep up,- Denys concludes.

-Hare- who hunts tanks: the story of a platoon commander of attack drones	The story of the fighter was shared on the page of the 22nd separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Before the start of the war, -Zaets- had a peaceful profession - he worked as a helicopter electrician. This knowledge became a solid foundation for him in his new role. Now he leads a platoon of strike unmanned aerial systems that play a key role on the front line. -I quickly learned to work with FPV drones. Knowledge of electronics and practical experience made it possible to adapt quickly. Now I am responsible for receiving, checking, transferring drones to positions and using them,- says Zayets. He notes that FPV drones are an indispensable tool on the modern battlefield. -On one of the directions, we received the coordinates of an enemy tank moving in our direction. With the help of two drones, worth up to 50 thousand hryvnias each, we were able to destroy this tank. It was a significant victory, because a tank is a serious piece of equipment,- he says. -Hare- is sure that modern war requires not only bravery, but also a deep understanding of modern military technologies. He and his comrades work every day to improve their skills and stay one step ahead of the enemy. -The main thing is to fly out, hit and come back,- shares the credo of -Hare-. As reported by ArmiyaInform, Serhiy under the pseudonym -Bala- is a serviceman of the Chernihiv Territorial Center for Recruitment and Social Support.

Goodbye school, hello assault - the Russians are attacking yesterday's schoolchildren	Maksym Taran, press officer, told about this on the air of the -Edyny Novyny- telethon teams of NSU -Rubizh-. Among other things, according to him, the enemy works in combination with small groups of infantry. As a rule, these are 4-6 people who advance on Ukrainian positions every 20-30 minutes. Such assaults happen all the time. The stormtrooper contingent is the most diverse. -We are looking at the documentation of the killed, destroyed enemies. We see that passports of military personnel born in 2005-2006 are more common. This is if someone thinks that only drunkards and grandfathers are sent to mass assaults. They also send young men who don't even have a weapon record yet,- Maksym Taran said. As reported ArmyInform, -Rubizh- showed a selection of Russians' attempts to hide after the failure meat assault.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/17/do-pobachennya-shkola-pryvit-shturm-rosiyany-kydayut-v-ataky-vchorashnih-shkolyariv/	2025-01-17T08:52:48-08:00
a Russian passport is a pass to the Russian army: a new tactic of the occupiers in the Luhansk TOT	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. According to him, obtaining a Russian passport now automatically means the threat of mobilization. Local residents receive summonses without warning, right along with the document. -In Starobilsk, men face the risk of being captured by the Russian army when they issue a Russian passport. That's how they decided to strengthen mobilization measures there. Local residents receive summonses, without warning, of course, together with a new passport,- the report says. As reported by ArmyInform, more than 1,000 copies of propaganda literature were brought to the libraries of temporarily occupied Mariupol from St. Petersburg.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/17/rosijskyj-pasport-perepustka-do-armiyi-rf-nova-taktyka-okupantiv-na-tot-luganshhyni/	2025-01-17T08:46:53-08:00
Near Vovchansk, the occupiers walk over the corpses of their soldiers - DPSU	About this notify fighters of the State Border Service of Ukraine. -With the arrival of bad weather, the occupiers do not stop trying to push the Defense Forces away from the city of Vovchansk. Their tactic is to storm our positions under cover of rain or fog. Under such conditions, it is more difficult for Ukrainian drones to detect the movement of the enemy's equipment and manpower,- says the comment to the released footage from the frontline. Speaking about the tactics of the Soviet Union of the Russian Federation in this area, the head of the outpost of the first commandant of the rapid response brigade -Forpost- on the pseudo -Moroz- draws attention to the fact that the fields there are currently literally littered with dead occupants. -Thanks to remote field mining, drone strikes, use of FPV systems and artillery fire, the invaders will suffer devastating losses. Fields and landings are literally littered with enemy bodies. But even these losses do not stop the occupiers - they continue to move forward, stepping on the corpses of their comrades,- the DPSU notes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/17/bilya-vovchanska-okupanty-jdut-po-trupah-svoyih-bijcziv-dpsu/	2025-01-17T08:12:28-08:00
Three new types of reports have been added to Army+ — Rustem Umyerov	About this Friday, January 17, notified the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov. -Instead of paper work that distracted from service, the military can submit a report in a few clicks and track its status in the application,- he wrote on his Facebook page. In particular, the updated version of Armiya+ has added electronic reports for accepting and handing over a position. -These are two of the most common documents in the military.

It works even under water — the Defense Forces received a new metal detector	About this reported on January 17 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The Trembita metal detector has earned positive feedback from Ukrainian deminers. With its help, metal objects and weakly electrically conductive materials are detected without reducing sensitivity in difficult conditions, for example, in mineralized soils. The metal detector is intended for individual use and has an appropriate degree of protection. It is sealed, shockproof and waterproof, so it can be used for underwater demining. Also among the advantages of the metal detector: — Ergonomic (speed of transition from compact to working condition). — Compact. — Lightweight (no more than 2.4 kg). - Easy to use (easy automatic configuration). - The time of continuous operation is not less than 48 hours. This indicator is higher than that of foreign counterparts. — Can show the presence of anti-personnel or anti-tank mines in the soil, identify the most common types of Russian mines, such as TM-62M, PFM-1, F-1, RGD-5, PMN-2 and many others. -Ukraine is currently the most mined country in the world. Our sappers use various means of detecting mines and unexploded ordnance. Among them is the Trembita detector, which not only meets world standards, but sometimes surpasses foreign analogues. This is confirmed by positive feedback from demining groups,- emphasized the head of the Main Department of Mine Action, Civil Defense and Environmental Security, Colonel Ruslan Beregulya. According to him, another advantage of the Trembita metal detector is the presence of the Pinpoint function, which is necessary to determine the exact location of mines or unexploded ordnance that the deminer is looking for. This not only facilitates the search, but also avoids physical exposure to dangerous war remains during their excavation. As reported by ArmiyaInform, during 2024 the defense department codified and put into operation in the Defense Forces of Ukraine, almost 30 samples of automotive equipment for movement in difficult terrain and off-road conditions. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/17/praczyuye-navit-pid-vodoyu-syly-oborony-otrymaly-novyj-metalodetektor/	2025-01-17T05:53:54-08:00

In Kurshchyna, the Russians are gathering forces and attacking only in small groups	About this on the ArmiyaTV stream the commander of the 47th mechanized brigade company with the call sign -Grek- told about it. -This is their tactic: they attack with large forces, then they reformat for 2-3 weeks and during this time they storm in small groups. Now is just such a phase where they are reformatted. Our positions are attacked in small groups, using lightly armored vehicles, quad bikes and motorcycles. Literally yesterday, a group of the enemy with 8 ATVs, each of which had 3 servicemen on them, advanced on the adjacent unit,- -Grek- reported. According to him, the Russian assaults on foot are groups of 5-6 people who move along the landings and feel our defenses.

- Meat stormtroopers - under concrete slabs and an attack on a tank with 6 FPV drones at once: comba...	-The main task of the tank units here is to stop the advance of the enemy's infantry, destroy enemy dugouts and shelters, destroy fire equipment, armored groups, and various heavy equipment of the Rashists. That is, to make the assault actions of the occupiers in the Kurakhovo district impossible as much as possible. Usually, on this part of the front, tanks work with -direct fire-. This is a very effective way of deterring offensive actions. The targets of the rockets, which are located at a distance of up to 4-5 kilometers from the tank, are hit. Recently, our tank crews have been carrying out combat missions, inflicting fire damage on the occupiers who were near the settlement of Zelenivka. The enemy suffers losses in manpower and manages to stop his advance to the Donetsk route. The enemy wants to enter this road at any cost, cut the communication and logistics routes for our units and create a new -bag- in Dachny. Just the other day, our tanks -dismantled- enemy infantry in shelters. Then it was possible to bury the -meat attack aircraft- under the concrete slabs of the hangar, which were about to carry out offensive actions. How many of them there were, of course, cannot be counted. But it was on this day that the Rashists from this village did not attack. Played to get ahead. We perform such tasks constantly, there is no such thing as a tank just standing in the waiting area. There is always plenty of combat work. Considering that the tank battalion was formed relatively recently, I think that the guys are well done. All are mobilized, of different ages and from different regions of Ukraine. Military tours continue, work is boiling day and night. There are no such tank duels now. Yes, it was more massive at the beginning of the invasion and in 2022-2023. But now the enemy is afraid to enter the line of fire, he perfectly understands the threat. And, in addition, today the occupiers feel a certain shortage of combat equipment. According to the extreme calculations of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the enemy lost about 9,800 tanks in the war against Ukraine. Tank battalion 157 of a separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine fights on T-64 tanks of various modifications. In combat, these machines have proven themselves in a very positive way. A 42-ton diesel tank with hundreds of millimeters of armor, three crew members and an automatic loader for the 125 mm main gun. Compared to the -72-, the T-64 has a simpler fire control system, and this gives a higher rate of fire. This is how it happens in battle: the one who fired and hit the target faster remained alive and won. More reliable undercarriage, but at the same time the engine is a little weaker than the T-72, T-80 and tanks of other modifications. The charging mechanism in the -64th volume- is a little more complicated, again, unlike the T-72. Here, the charging mechanism consists of three main parts. These are electric, hydraulic and mechanical. In the -72- it's simpler: electrical and mechanical. That is, there is no intermediate link - the hydraulic part. The 5TDF engine is generally very picky about temperature conditions. If the T-72 engine can be started without warming up at a temperature of minus 10-15°, then the T-64 must be warmed up. Sometimes it even happens that during higher temperatures it is necessary to warm up additionally. This is a problem at the moment. But in terms of other parameters and combat capabilities, this tank is almost not inferior to the T-72. About reservation, the tower in the -64th- is better protected, the armor body is almost the same. In terms of speed on the track, these two tanks do not differ in principle. But in hard-to-reach areas of the terrain, the T-64 still has better passability, it has tracks that -squeeze out- the swamp. The T-72 has a flat track, so it is heavier. Today, the T-64 remains the main battle tank of the Armed Forces. The maximum firing range of the cannon is up to 10 km, and the effective fire is 8.5 km. It is equipped with night vision devices, a thermal imager, which is integrated into the gunner's aiming system, and modern navigation and communication systems. The biggest threat right now is enemy UAVs. What exactly does the anti-drone protection of the T-64 tank consist of? There is passive and active protection against enemy FPV drones. Passive is a welded grill, -shroud-, protective -crowns- or they are also called -grills-. Active protection is, of course, electronic warfare systems. But as combat experience shows, now the enemy is actively using FPV on fiber optics. And, unfortunately, anti-drone protection is actually leveled off, so EW means can neither detect enemy FPV drones nor interfere with their work by suppressing radio communication between the remote control and the -fpvish- itself. Therefore, passive protection of the tank is currently playing a more effective role. In real combat, it saves the crew from destruction. The other day, the T-64 crew was working on a route and was attacked by 6 enemy FPV drones. They hit the motor-transmission compartment, because of which the tank stopped. But the -mangal- fulfilled its protection mission, the crew is alive. In our direction, the enemy is trying to use anti-tank missile complexes less. With what this is connected, perhaps with a shortage of anti-tank guided missiles. A tank without a crew is nothing. It's just a combat vehicle with armor and weapons. A trained and motivated crew is needed for a tank to effectively perform tasks in battle. The Training Centers of the Armed Forces carry out professional training of mechanics-drivers, gunner-operators and tank commanders. It lasts only 20 days. This is far from enough to professionally train the mobilized to drive a car and deliver targeted strikes at the enemy. Training should be increased and, most importantly, the quality of the training should be improved. Theory is great, but the practical component needs to be increased. This is especially true for driving and shooting. People of absolutely different age, psychotype and motivation come to us. Some grasp everything quickly, while others learn slowly. Some do not want anything at all: neither to know nor to learn. This especially applies to those people who came to us very recently. It can be seen that people do not fully understand why they join the army, that they need to protect the state and their native homes from an aggressor. The enemy will not stop himself, we must destroy him. Therefore, it is impossible to expect that, after professional training, a soldier who was previously a civilian will come and fully fight the enemy on tanks. Of course, we are trying to make up for certain shortcomings in his training on the ground, in the military unit. In order for the level of execution of combat missions to be better, and there were fewer losses. It also happened that such -specialists- came that they did not know how to fix even small technical problems. For example, the coarse fuel cleaning filter is clogged. Tankers are required to know the technical capabilities, operation and maintenance of the tank. And to constantly keep the combat vehicle in combat readiness. This is the Aziz. In modern warfare, tanks are a key element in both defensive and offensive operations. They provide mobile firepower and are well protected by armor. Some a la experts say that the role of tanks in the modern Russian-Ukrainian war has been somewhat downplayed, arguing that this is due to the scale and intensity of the use of UAVs. Especially FPV drones. But this is not the case. When a tank comes at you with anti-drone protection and EW plus it shoots and there are no anti-tank means to knock it down, it's very scary. This is a destructive force that is almost impossible to stop. Do not forget about shooting from closed firing positions. This is also an effective way to defeat the enemy, but at a longer distance. The tank can maneuver, change positions for strikes. But most importantly, it stops the advance of the enemy, who attacks continuously. This is colossal fire support for our infantry units. Ultimately helping to keep our frontline defenders alive. How many cases have there already been when using fire from tank weapons in interaction with drones and other technical means, columns of heavy armored vehicles of the enemy on different areas of the front were -dismantled- at a long distance. Tanks do this job effectively. One thing is a direct hit by a 125 mm projectile, then the equipment is completely destroyed and becomes inoperable, and another thing is drones, which carry a much smaller warhead and do not always manage to hit the enemy. Therefore, I would not be so categorical, unlike some experts. I have a counter question: how are you going to win back territories captured by the enemy, break through their defensive positions, and so on? The question, of course, is rhetorical! Tank Battalion Commander Stanislav is a 2018 graduate of the National Academy of Ground Forces. He is from Uzhhorod. Immediately after graduation, he got the position of tank platoon commander of the 17th separate tank brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He met the Great War as a company commander in the city of Shchastya, Luhansk region. Then, with paratroopers, the 79th brigade held the defense of the city. For a short period of time, he was the deputy commander of the battalion, then he was promoted - he became the chief of staff of the tank battalion. In 2022, he performed combat missions in the Severodonetsk, Kreminnaya, Lysychansky Refinery and Lyman areas. Then the direction of the village of Velika Novosilka. He participated in the counteroffensive and the liberation of the territory of the right-bank Kherson region. Then again the defense of Donetsk region. Last year, he headed the tank battalion of the 157th separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/17/myasni-shturmovyky-pid-betonnymy-plytamy-ta-ataka-na-tank-odrazu-6-fpv-dronamy-kombat-zhulik-pro-boyi-pid-kurahovym/	2025-01-16T21:06:52-08:00
IRIS-T is not the only one: experts talked about the newest drone fighter from the German manufactur...	The manufacturer of these special equipment is the Diehl Defense company, which is well known in our country thanks to the IRIS-T air defense system developed by it, about which our editors have repeatedly told in their reviews. Researcher of military equipment and armaments, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities of the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny Andriy Haruk told about the new complex for combating Russian UAVs in a comment for ArmiyaInform. - Andrii Ivanovich, what do you know about this complex, which is marked with the rather mysterious name Kinetic Defense Vehicles (-Kinetic Defense Vehicles-, in Ukrainian)? - It should be noted that this system, which is also known by the acronym -KDV-, is a fairly new product of German gunsmiths. It was first introduced less than a year ago, in February 2024, at the Enforce TAC exhibition. - In the very name of this special equipment, -sewn- and the determination of the mobility of this weapon. - The KDV is based on an extended version of the Mercedes-Benz G jeep, known as the Enok MBB, which ensures high mobility and cross-country ability. A remote-controlled Slinger (R400S) turret from the Australian company Electro Optic Systems (EOS) with a 7.62×51 mm machine gun is installed on the chassis. The mass of the module is 355 kg. This turret is versatile and can be equipped with a 12.7 mm machine gun, a 40 mm automatic grenade launcher, or a 30 mm M230 cannon. From 2023 It is supplied to the Armed Forces of Ukraine and installed on modernized M113 armored personnel carriers and armored vehicles of the Praktika company. The detection system includes the Diehl Defense electro-optical system with machine vision technology for automatic target detection with a 360° field of view and the EchoGuard radar of the American company Echodyne, capable of detecting drones of the Phantom 4 type at a distance of up to 1 km and Matrice 600 at a distance of up to 1.4 km. - What else did the German gunsmiths put in this device? - Thanks to the combination of optical and radar systems, the KDV effectively detects and tracks small UAVs in various conditions. The minigun provides a high density of fire, allowing you to effectively destroy drones. The design allows the system to be adapted to different requirements, including the replacement of the chassis and the combat module. - And who manages KDV? - The crew of the complex consists of two people. The calculation is housed in an enclosed rear cockpit with control consoles for the anti-drone system. A report posted on the official portal of the German government states that according to data for December 2024, Germany transferred to Ukraine 12 such systems. — Your expert opinion on this latest piece of equipment? To what extent is this weaponry promising? - The Kinetic Defense Vehicle is a good solution in the field of local combat against UAVs. The high-density minigun in combination with the EchoGuard radar and opto-electronic station allows you to effectively neutralize both reconnaissance and strike drones. And from the point of view of the modularity of the design, it is quite possible to mount such systems on Ukrainian chassis (for example, on Kozak armored vehicles). In turn, experts of the defense portal IKK Defense Express (DE), who also studied the Kinetic Defense Vehicle pointed out that the Diehl surveillance system looks like a rather interesting addition to the capabilities of the combat module from EOS, because it allows you to detect targets in passive mode without exposing yourself to the radiation of the surveillance radar. -It should be added that the armament of the Kinetic Defense Vehicle can obviously be changed at the request of the customer, and instead of a minigun, an automatic cannon can be installed there. The chassis can also be changed, the requirements for which are quite moderate, because the weight of the Slinger is 355 kg,- stated researchers from DE.

-Antichrist- on the coat of arms: -narrow- invented new sensations about Ukraine	On the coat of arms, in addition to the anchor and golden wheat, Russian -symbolism experts- saw something more sinister. For example, anchor lines form ancient satanic symbols, and the waves of the Black Sea are nothing more than a coded sign of the devil. A little more, and they would find there a secret QR code for a ticket to hell. I was especially pleased with the comments about the colors. Blue and gold? Of course! These are symbols of universal evil! Although, if you recall, these colors are also on the coat of arms&#8230; of Ukraine. But who looks at such trifles when it is urgent to save the world from -Satanists-. Russian propaganda seems to have taken a new course: if they fail to intimidate with missiles, they will try to demoralize with mystical horror stories. Because what could be scarier than a regional coat of arms with supposedly hidden signs of dark forces? Well, except that it's a Ukrainian FPV drone with hello on board. What's next? Will Ukrainian vyshyvanka be called clothing for occult rituals? And the borscht is an elixir of immortality created according to the ancient recipes of dark magicians? Oh, sorry, there was already borscht. Everything is simple. When the country is going nuts, prices are rising, and rights are disappearing, it's always convenient to distract people with stories about an -external enemy.- Especially when the enemy is not just -Nazis- (that record is already broken), but entire followers of the Antichrist! It immediately becomes clear why nothing works for them: evil itself is at war with them! While Russian propagandists invent yet another fairy tale, Ukraine continues to fight, work and keep order. The coat of arms of Odesa is a symbol of history, strength and freedom. And we will leave all this nonsense about the -seal of the Antichrist- to the conscience of those who see -Ukronazi Satan- even in a cloud in the sky. And you know what's the funniest thing? There is nothing to scare Ukrainians anymore. Because if we have not been broken by shelling, war and even Russian propaganda, then some invented -seal- certainly will not. And if someone really wants to see real evil, let them look in the mirror. P.S. And yes, next time throw something more original. Because the Antichrist is fed up with everyone.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/17/antyhryst-na-gerbi-uzki-vygadaly-novi-sensacziyi-pro-ukrayinu/	2025-01-16T20:10:37-08:00

Ice swimming for $8000: the violator's attempt to cross the border failed	About this informs State Border Service of Ukraine. The response group stopped two men - residents of Poltava and Chernihiv regions in front of engineering barriers. The third violator overcame the barrier and ran into the water. Having crossed a few meters, he turned towards the shore. Then he went into the water again and came back again. -The body shrinks, the lungs narrow, there is nothing to breathe, as convulsions take place- - these are the impressions of the attempt to overcome the icy Tisza River shared by a resident of Lviv Oblast, who was saved by border guards of the Mukachevo detachment. After that, first of all, the border outfit gave the violator an opportunity to warm up. He then said that the current was very strong and the water was cold, so he turned back. -It's better to give up. Than to swim across and drown,- concluded the detainee and does not recommend others to test their fate in this way. All three detainees were issued administrative reports for attempting to illegally cross the border. 2 Art. 204-1 of the Code of Administrative Offenses. They admitted that they paid the organizer of the illegal transfer $8,000 each. The search for organizers who send people to the cold Tysa continues. -It should be noted that the organization of the illegal transportation of persons across the state border of Ukraine, to a dangerous place for the life or health of the person being transported, is punishable by deprivation of liberty for a period of five to seven years,- the DPSU noted. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/16/kryzhanyj-zaplyv-za-8000-sproba-porushnyka-peretnuty-kordon-provalylasya/	2025-01-16T11:53:48-08:00

Ruins instead of rails: public transport in the style of the Russian world	informs about this Center of National Resistance.

I have been working at the computer since I was three years old: first it was computer games. I always had an interest in technology, and it helped me develop analytical thinking and intelligence,- says -Molfar-. Today, he directly participates in combat missions, controlling the drone together with his comrades in positions. -Molfar- conducts reconnaissance, detects targets and helps destroy the enemy. -Computer games helped me adapt faster to the realities of war: from controlling a plane to being able to navigate in space and work with a map,- says the young pilot. At the same time, he emphasizes that controlling the drone is different from the game. However, the skills of working with the screen and maps allow you to track the enemy's equipment from a bird's eye view and even descend inconspicuously to -see the enemy in the eyes-. -Molfar is an example of how a combination of enthusiasm, technical talent and determination can lead to success in the most responsible tasks of the defense of Ukraine,- the brigade said in a statement.

They made false documents about the alleged participation of a woman in hostilities on the front line. So, for the period from July 2023 to April 2024, she illegally received more than 922,000 UAH additional reward. All this time, she served alongside her husband and engaged in horse breeding at a special farm. The woman even managed to spend two weeks in Poland, voluntarily leaving the military unit. The former commander of the brigade, his wife and two of his subordinates were informed of the suspicion of taking possession of someone else's property by abusing their official position based on a prior conspiracy by a group of particularly large individuals (Part 5 of Article 191 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). In addition, the men and another subordinate brigade commander are suspected of official forgery (Part 2 of Article 366 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine), and the woman is suspected of voluntarily leaving the military unit (Part 5 of Article 407 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). The sanction of the articles provides imprisonment for a term of up to 12 years with confiscation of property.

The video of combat operation appeared on page 95 of the separate airborne assault Polish Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Ukrainian defense officials said that there are many North Korean mercenaries on the battlefield, but they are actively reducing their number. -They are good with weapons, but our skill is better. Koreans often shorten their ages so as not to be captured - making it easier for us. the russians use them as cannon fodder. As the Buryats and Kadyrovs ended, the same awaits the Koreans,- the fighters commented. In the video, you can see how enemy infantry are walking across the field, but they are hit by Ukrainian drones. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Kursk direction intense hostilities continue, where Russian troops, reinforced by the North Korean military, carry out massive assaults on Ukrainian positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/16/yak-zakinchylysya-buryaty-j-kadyrivczi-tak-i-korejczi-desantnyky-likviduvaly-kilka-stad-vorozhyh-najmancziv/	2025-01-15T22:02:49-08:00

Surrounded Mariupol, complex operations at headquarters and wounded from Kurshchyna: the story of an...	The Russians came to his home, his native Donetsk region, twice: in 2014 - in Horlivka, and in 2022 - in Mariupol. He is an anesthesiologist. During the siege of Mariupol, he rescued the wounded for 21 days. Later, he left the city on the coast of the Sea of ​​Azov - when the Russians entered the territory of the hospital where he worked. Now Yelizar Grankov is in the ranks of the 71st military mobile hospital in the Sumy region. Coordinator of the department of anesthesiology and resuscitation, intensive care. Together with their brothers, they rescue the wounded from the Kursk direction. The resident of the department of anesthesiology joined the ranks of the Defense Forces in June 2023. He managed to get the primary officer rank - junior lieutenant. ArmyInform talked to the doctor during his vacation and shortly before his new business trip - about working in surrounded Mariupol and how he left the city (on a scooter, imagine!); about how he joined the ranks of the Defense Forces and rescued the wounded in the Sumy direction; about why science and military medicine should walk side by side in the current Ukrainian realities. And not only that. - Doctors in Mariupol civil hospitals are probably the people who first felt the war, because they had to work with a large number of wounded civilians. How intense were those days for you? - We felt the war very quickly. Literally half an hour after the first massive strikes, 5-6 AM on February 24, 2022. And then three weeks of intensive work, 24/7. At that time, I worked in several public institutions: in the 1st hospital in the city of Mariupol, a regional hospital, and in one private hospital. The footage from the Mariupol hospital in the tape -20 days in Mariupol- was filmed in our facility. Journalists found refuge in us and worked. — Mariupol in the spring of 2022. What was the most difficult thing for a doctor in a surrounded city? - We ran out of drugs, but we were allowed to take everything from the hospital pharmacy, and pharmacists and pharmacists brought drugs from the nearest pharmacies. But still: there were not enough drugs for the volumes and the number of people who came. Too many people, too great a flow of wounded. —What is the scariest memory you have during this time? And what, on the contrary, is a warm memory from that time that warms you? - You know, there was actually a lot of different things. But the worst thing is to hide children&#8230; It will be remembered forever, until the end of life - when it is simply impossible to save a small child who was torn apart by shells, fragments, bullets. I don't know what could be worse&#8230; Among the good memories is working with colleagues. Yes, then everyone was tired - but they helped each other, insured, worked, despite the fatigue. We lived these difficult three weeks in Mariupol as one big family, which fulfilled the main task of our lives: to save. In the surrounded Mariupol, there was purely -pure- medicine, without any other unnecessary thoughts at all. Just like now in the army - together with your brothers, your team, you don't think about money or anything - you just stood together and did your job. —You were leaving Mariupol through Berdyansk, and in one of the interviews you said that you managed to successfully pass one of the roadblocks thanks to your mother. Please tell us more about this episode. How many roadblocks were overcome in total? — There were more than 20 roadblocks. Some were passed quite quickly, some had long checks, they almost got into their underpants. The most difficult checkpoint was, in fact, in Berdyansk, where the -DNRivtsi- were stationed. We were also put under machine gun barrels to be shot, and when they saw that I was born in Horlivka, they asked why I didn't fight for -Mother Russia-. At first I traveled from the city on a scooter. Drove on it to a roadblock outside the city - then it discharged. We wanted to catch up with the car where my wife and father were. But it didn't work out, I realized that I wouldn't make it. There was a rather depressed state. Then my brother and I found the minibus where our mother was - and it turned out that there might be places for us too. There were six other young men there. Agree, it is difficult to drive through roadblocks with such a composition(smiles - ed.). And so it began at the checkpoint in Berdyansk: they were clinging to tattoos, to the residence permit - to everything. And our mother said: -If you take them away, take me with them, with my sons.- So we were quickly let go with the -get the hell out of here- argument. Six of our fellow travelers remained. But that was the decisive moment&#8230; The scooter also left with us, it is still with my parents. The road from Mariupol to Dnipro took a day. - What was the trigger when you decided to take a scooter and leave Mariupol? - We have been under the Russians for three days - they captured our hospital. On March 9, the last journalists left us, and on the 12th, the Russians arrived. They were even in the operating room. I had enough for three days. Medicines were running out, shelling did not stop, FABs were beating. Well, the Russians came in - it was clear that there would be further filtering, everyone would be closely watched. And since 2015, I have been -excluded- from the DPR - I expressed my opinion a lot, let's say. That is why I decided to leave Mariupol. —You became a part of the Oscar-winning film -20 days in Mariupol-. Do you feel like a part of the weapon in the information war, which works for the benefit of the civilized world, telling the truth without embellishments and propaganda? - Understanding this media has never been &#8230; But if there is any help and it's a way to convey some of the truth about Mariupol, not obscured by Russian bullshit propaganda&#8230; They simply destroyed Mariupol. There was a terrible cauldron. And the tape did not convey the horror that was happening in the city. If there was an opportunity, it would be possible to shoot even more that would shock the world. Because from time to time it is necessary to get such a terrible truth of ours in order for it to be heard and seen. — What brought you to the ranks of the Defense Forces? After all, you initially worked in the maternity hospital in Dnipro, and this work, in your words, became -therapy- for you. Why did you decide to join the ranks of military medics? - Yes, seeing how life is born is wonderful. But in March 2023, I came to work at the Main Military Clinical Hospital, first as a civilian doctor in the cardiac resuscitation department, and three months later I was mobilized. Until then, he worked in the 4th hospital of Kyiv for seven months. Yes, I actually worked for the Ministry of Defense and was booked, but there was an opportunity to get an officer's rank in two months, and for that I had to mobilize. That is why I made this decision. - What is your impression of the courses of the military medical academy? - The general idea is ok, but I believe that few people take this course, although we have a lot of medics who do not have a military department. And they either do not go to the Armed Forces, or, having a medical education, are in the positions of sergeants. Such courses are a great idea. Although when I was studying, the teachers operated according to norms that existed even before the large-scale invasion. This, I believe, is an outdated approach, because during this time the battlefield has changed a lot, to put it mildly, in military medicine. There was a lot of outdated information when I was studying. I don't know how it is now, maybe there are already changes. But science has to keep up with real war. A banal example: now there are FPV drones on the battlefield, which did not exist two years ago. Therefore, the academy must also change very quickly, transform its approaches, introduce new information into educational courses. - They say that war is always a catalyst for some kind of change. How is this reflected in your work as an anesthesiologist, for example, now in Sumshchyna? What has changed for the better, and what has changed for the worse? - There is development. As an anesthesiologist, I worked in operating rooms, in various departments, with adults, with children, in intensive care units, with seriously ill patients, etc. That is, there was a structure to how you work. Then covid began - the structure of work changed radically. And so the war began. And here, too, medicine is actually completely different: with injuries, with massive defects, with tourniquet syndromes, with bleeding, lung injuries. This was something special in the non-war period, and it is, unfortunately, the absolute norm now, during the war. And it is necessary to adjust to this new norm - to save and treat completely different injuries and other patients. Yes, the hospital has cool moments in terms of possibilities, analyses. There you are treated both in the operating room and in the intensive care unit. And when you work abroad, then&#8230; you are constantly -travelling-. 2024 I spent almost entirely in -travel-. When you arrive at a point, you need to get to know the doctors, the chief, other battalions and brigades, and medics. Lots of communication. It also happened that when we arrived at the stabilization point, we had to start everything from scratch: find a place to live, how to arrange and prepare everything. This is not taught anywhere - it comes with experience. In addition, standing in the northern direction, where the seriously wounded, learned many manipulations. It was at the -stabik- that he discovered a new picture of his work as an anesthesiologist: this work is fast, and the result of this work is whether he saved or not. Only this price. I can be proud of the fact that, thanks to the work of our team, thanks to the number of people there, none of our wounded died, everyone was saved. We had the maximum efficiency. Yes, there were -two hundred- - but they were already brought to us as such. And we tried to get people from that world anyway. We have had several such cases. But, unfortunately, the dead cannot be revived&#8230; - Can you remember a case when a seemingly hopeless wounded man arrived, and you pulled him out of the other world by an invisible thread? - There are more than enough such cases&#8230; From what can be remembered&#8230; Once a soldier was brought in with a wound in the leg, the surgeon began to apply an anastamosis to him in order to save the limb&#8230; And at the same moment, a senior lieutenant, unit commander, was brought to us. He was in agony, just gasping for air, pale, bleeding. He was given oxygen. There was a wound to the chest. Intubated. Adrenaline turned on. Intensive work continued, but the lungs still did not work and he could not keep the pressure. We transfused him with blood, put plasma&#8230; All this lasted about an hour. We tried to stabilize him, while the surgeon simultaneously saved another wounded man and his limb. Before that, he also placed a drain in the wounded officer's chest. After some time, it was thanks to this drainage that we realized that there was internal bleeding - a hole in the lung. We fully stabilized this injured person only after the surgeon had sutured the vessels and tissues. Sent to Sumy. Later it turned out that the officer had six broken ribs and six bleeding arteries. Our surgeon sewed up five of them in the initial conditions. Military survivor. This is one of the cases. And there were many of them in the conditions of the stabilization point. Our surgeon even performed an open heart massage several times: he cut the ribcage and pumped it. But these are just those cases when, unfortunately, a dead person was brought to us. And it was already such a gesture of last hope: either it will start or it won't. - What advice would you give to civilians who are afraid right now? Afraid, including joining the ranks of the Defense Forces? How to overcome fear? God&#8230; Being afraid of an uncle from the Military Commissariat is not something to be afraid of in life. Absolutely not. And in open access there is a lot of information about how to learn something, understand or motivate yourself and join the ranks of the Defense Forces. People are tired of war. Unfortunately But this is a normal, natural reaction. A person does not want to fight for 5 years, does not want to fight for 10 years. Everyone generally wants a little, little triumphant war - that would be class! - You left home twice: in 2014 - Horlivka, in 2022 - Mariupol? What gives you stability and the strength to hold on, go forward? - Good question&#8230; But in this context, I ask myself more about something else: what gives my parents the strength to hold on? They are now in their 70s. She lost her home 11 years ago. Three years ago, they lost their second home. And for them, the motivation to live is family, grandchildren&#8230; Neither money nor housing is a motivation here. Yes, the Russians took my house, then they took my house a second time. But&#8230; life was not taken away? I continue to live. And you have to continue living anywhere. The main thing is to be in Ukraine. What motivates me is that the Russians do not come here and destroy everything here, kill my child and my wife. Because I saw with my own eyes what happens where Russia comes. I am motivated by the idea of ​​my Ukrainian world. And in order not to be under the -Russian rule-. - What will be the end of the Russian-Ukrainian war for you? - And this is a very good question&#8230; Okay, so a truce is called—how much? A month, two, a year, three? The threat will still hang over us as long as the Russian Federation and its ideology exist. As long as the government and ideological attitudes in the heads of the Russian Federation do not change, until they realize that it is not necessary to trespass on their own land - until then there will be a constant permanent threat. Because this is an absolutely frozen nation. Well, we will go to the borders, for example, in 1991 - but who will prevent the Russians from unexpectedly launching a hundred missiles at us? And come here again? The Russians must admit and say that Ukraine is no longer part of the -development- plans of the Russian Federation. And the guarantees of the Western world are also important. Although we understand that now the world is shaking in all directions&#8230; And no one really knows what will happen next.

Economic results of 2024 and forecast for 2025: expert opinion	The year 2024 - the third year of a large-scale war - passed under the sign of the stabilization of the Ukrainian economy. After falling by 29% in 2022, our gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an initial 5.3% in 2023 and is expected to grow by around 4% in 2024. Thus, the national economy was able to avoid further declines, but it will take several more years to reach the level of 2021. The main factor of stabilization is the timely arrival of foreign financial aid. At the end of 2023, the situation was as uncertain as possible, as the European Union and the United States constantly postponed the adoption of multibillion-dollar support packages for Ukraine. However, in February (EU) and April (USA), the votes did take place, and we were able to cover the budget deficit in the amount of $3-5 billion every month. We start 2025 with a much greater margin of confidence. Ukraine can expect to receive more than $13 billion from the EU (Ukraine Facility program), more than $19 billion from revenues from frozen Russian assets under the ERA 7 plan, $3 billion from the IBRD, almost $3 billion from the IMF, as well as $1 billion from Great Britain. During the year, these funds should be enough to compensate for the deficit of the state budget in the amount of 25% of GDP. The gradual transition of the Ukrainian economy to a military mode continues. During the large-scale war, the capacity of the defense-industrial complex (OPK) increased 20 times, and in general, more than 500 companies of various forms of ownership work in the industry. During 2024, the volume of current contracts for the purchase of weapons exceeded half a trillion hryvnias (almost $15 billion), about half of which were concluded with Ukrainian manufacturers. to more than $400 million. Currently, there are more than 300 defense tech companies operating in Ukraine, the largest market segments are drones (19%), robotics (13%), artificial intelligence (13%). The most dynamically developing defense technology sector is production of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Substantial government investments contributed to an increase in the production of drones by more than 100 times. By the end of 2024, almost 100% of UAVs purchased by the state will be manufactured in Ukraine. According to the strategy of the Ministry of Strategic Industries, in 2024 Ukraine should have produced one million FPV drones and two million drones of all types in general. Unlike Ukraine, which thanks to foreign support has not yet before the full transition of the economy to military rails, the Russian economy is now completely dependent on the war machine. Moscow is forced to apply extraordinary fiscal and monetary policy measures to keep the country in normal economic conditions. For example, to constantly raise the central bank's discount rate in order to reduce the level of inflation. In July 2024, the Ministry of Finance tried to increase tax revenues by 4-5% of GDP, but due to the negative reaction of citizens, this initiative was withdrawn. However, in September, the Parliament still adopted a less rigid package of tax changes: an increase in the military levy on salaries from 1.5% to 5%, an increase in taxes for individual entrepreneurs, etc. Increasing taxes by itself for any which conditions are a heavy blow to the economy. In times of a large-scale war, it will have a particularly severe effect, taking away a significant potential for growth from the national economy. Shifting the burden of war onto the shoulders of the citizens of a belligerent country has always been a last resort when it is no longer possible to finance the war through income from abroad. Probably, the government takes such a step, having realized that Ukraine is in for a significant decrease in foreign support, or it will not be enough in the future. It is not yet known whether the Cabinet of Ministers will be able to collect the planned amount of tax revenues in full. However, it will definitely have the following consequences: the tax base will decrease due to the shadowing of the economy and conflicts between business and administrative bodies will increase. According to various estimates, in 2025 up to 50% of our economy will be in the shadows. Risks for the Ukrainian economy remain unchanged throughout the entire period of a large-scale war. Conducting active hostilities inside the country, constant shelling of peaceful cities, problems with electricity supply lead to the following negative consequences: a reduction in the number of economically active population due to emigration, a decrease in the volume of domestic and foreign investment in Ukrainian business, a significant increase in the costs of doing business. The increase in the inflation rate in 2024 to more than 10% is precisely due to the fact that entrepreneurs need to spend significantly more than before. The National Bank predicts a decrease in unemployment to 10-12% in 2025 (it was 14% at the end of 2024), but this is primarily due to an increase in the labor shortage. Another risk is the instability of the hryvnia exchange rate, although Ukraine is now able to control the main monetary variables without extreme actions. In particular, thanks to foreign revenues, the National Bank has been maintaining a sufficiently high level of international reserves for the third year - $35-45 billion, which makes it possible to prevent significant changes in the hryvnia exchange rate. But in 2024, the NBU's currency interventions to support the exchange rate increased by 20% compared to the previous year, which means that it costs us more and more to keep the exchange rate from sharp jumps. Ukraine's national debt is 92% of GDP, and in 2025 will exceed 100% of GDP. This signals high risks for the debt sustainability of public finances. However, in relation to our own GDP, we owe less than most of the completely peaceful G7 countries: the USA, France, Great Britain, Canada, Japan. 2025, the Ukrainian economy begins with slogans of readiness to continue a large-scale war in the long term . The increase in defense spending should strengthen Ukraine's stability in the long-term resistance to the occupiers. Hopes for Western support remain key, but the government is already preparing for possible challenges caused by a potential reduction in foreign aid, even if these preparatory actions harm the national economy. Given Russia's colossal military budget, our allies must realize the inevitability of military realities in the center of Europe for many years to come. Even if the front line is frozen, the pursuit of weapons will continue, because Russia is not going to give up its territorial claims. At most, the resources of the entire West, which can be freed up thanks to the cessation of active hostilities, should be thrown into the maximum strengthening of the Ukrainian war machine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/16/ekonomichni-pidsumky-2024-go-ta-prognoz-na-2025-rik-dumka-eksperta/	2025-01-15T20:51:16-08:00
Never Sleep: The Pentagon has announced the deployment of a new AI-based aerial surveillance system	This advanced system, designed to protect strategic facilities such as the White House, the Capitol and the US Supreme Court, is a significant step in strengthening air security, ArmyInform reports. -This is part of a broader effort to prevent threats similar to the events of September 11, 2001, when hijacked aircraft targeted important symbolic and strategic facilities, including the Pentagon,- the United States Department of Defense emphasized. The new system, known as Enhanced Regional Situational Awareness (ERSA), combines advanced visual recognition cameras and lasers. It includes AI-based identification and tracking capabilities, offering significant improvements over older similar equipment. Manufactured by technology company Teleidoscope, this system replaces equipment installed in 2002, which itself was a post-9/11 replacement for previous technologies. ERSA cameras feature both electro-optical and infrared imaging, high-definition resolution, and features such as infrared coloration that improve target detection using thermal signatures. These capabilities are further supported by a laser rangefinder that accurately measures the distance and height of objects. According to US Air Force Master Sergeant Kendrick Wilburn, who directs operations at the Joint Air Defense Operations Center (JADOC), the system can automatically engage and track moving targets using machine learning algorithms. The more the system is used, the more accurate it becomes, improving its own overall efficiency. -If we need to verify some radar data that we can't say for sure what the object is, we can use the camera system as a viewing asset at that fixed location to assist our technicians in the verification process,- Wilburn noted. . If ERSA operators determine that an unidentified aircraft poses a threat, they can provide early warning to unauthorized air traffic by notifying the pilot of the need to change direction and leave the special flight rules area in the Washington metropolitan area. The system also includes a visual warning device using a red-green laser that alerts aircraft that do not respond to commands to immediately leave the Special Flight Regulations Area (SFRA). These eye-safe lasers help avoid the need to deploy expensive military aircraft to investigate potential breaches. Wilburn explains that these visual cues, which operators call -sparkles,- often prompt pilots to correct their course and, if necessary, contact the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This advanced protection system was developed to solve the complex challenges of protecting urban airspace. Testing conducted in 2022 compared several camera prototypes, with the Teleidoscope emerging as the better choice due to significant software improvements. Two cameras are currently operational, with plans to deploy seven more cameras each year in future phases. The improvements made by the ERSA system have already changed the way air threats are identified and managed. Wilburn notes that the cameras are capable of detecting and tracking small targets, such as birds in flight, capabilities that were not possible with previous systems. In addition, the partial automation of the equipment allows operators to focus on more complex analytical tasks, such as assessing the intent of suspicious aircraft.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/16/nikoly-ne-splyat-pentagon-ogolosyv-pro-rozgortannya-novoyi-systemy-povitryanogo-sposterezhennya-na-osnovi-shi/	2025-01-15T20:36:38-08:00
More than 100,000 kilometers for the sake of support: how the patronage service of the 46th DSHV bri...	Captain Vadym Volynsky, senior officer of the psychological support department, told ArmyInform about the work of the patronage service of the 46th separate airmobile brigade of the Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. - The patronage service is a freelance structure of the brigade. Her main task is to work with wounded servicemen, visiting them in all medical, treatment, and rehabilitation facilities within the borders of Ukraine. An equally important task of the patronage service is to support the families of dead, missing and captured servicemen. The need for such a structure increased significantly after a large-scale invasion. The charity foundation -Angels- of -Azov- and the Third Assault Brigade became a role model. We monitor their work, try to adopt the best practices and implement them, based on our available forces, means and financial capabilities. The full patronage service of our brigade started working in February-March 2024. Before that, we had already worked with the wounded, but at first selectively in the nearest hospitals — we start working with the wounded by interacting with representatives of the medical service, medical company, and civil-military cooperation. Our psychologists from the combat stress control group, the psychological recovery group deal with all this. Representatives of our medical company provide them with lists of servicemen - who is being treated where, and they travel around Ukraine and visit the wounded. Usually there are two crews, in each of which one or two representatives of the brigade. In 2024, they covered more than 100,000 kilometers and visited more than 500 servicemen of the brigade in all corners of Ukraine. Representatives of the patronage service help to solve all problematic issues faced by the wounded - from providing basic household items to drawing up all the necessary documents. There can be a lot of problematic issues, but we try to solve them either on our own, or we already reach out to some public organizations, charitable foundations, volunteers who can help with this. We engage famous people, bloggers, and influencers to draw attention to wounded servicemen who need our help and support. — The main goal is to help and support a wounded serviceman. It is also a way to show that no one is left to fend for themselves. So that everyone feels: they are not forgotten, issues are resolved, and the team takes care of their own. The work of the patronage service has a very good effect on our soldiers, increases their morale and fighting spirit. Thanks to this, more servicemen want to return to their units and rejoin the ranks after being wounded. It also increases the reputation of the brigade, the Airborne Assault Forces and the Armed Forces of Ukraine as a whole. One of the components of comprehensive assistance to the wounded is the preparation of all necessary documents. A soldier reports a problematic issue, and we immediately call the deputy battalion commander for psychological support of personnel on the spot and try to resolve everything immediately. Accordingly, he further interacts with other representatives of other departments. It is usually possible to resolve everything within a period of one to three days. And then we send the necessary document by mail to the fighter where he is. This is such a bureaucratic procedure, but in the army there is really a lot of paperwork that someone has to do and do it well. — I will tell you how we worked in 2024. Together with representatives of civil-military cooperation, we compiled lists of the number of children in the families of dead, missing and captured fighters. We established cooperation with the management of the -Roshen- confectionery factory and, before the International Children's Day on June 1, held an event for children with animators and gifts: children up to 7 years old were given Lego sets, 8-12 years old - tablets, and 13-18 years old - mobile phones . Before the Day of Knowledge on September 1, a joint action with volunteers was also held - we sent school backpacks and stationery sets to children who were going to the first grade. Some were even able to be visited in person, and gifts were sent by mail to those we were unable to visit. The same was true for St. Nicholas Day on December 6, Christmas on December 25 and New Year on December 31. We are also in constant contact with the families of these three categories of servicemen - dead, missing and captured. The children and their relatives saw that the brigade remembers the service and feat of their sons, fathers, brothers and husbands, who gave the most valuable thing for Ukraine - their lives. — Work with the families of the missing is the most difficult, because it is the unknown that exhausts people. We provide the following advice: The psychological state of children depends on the mother or wife. It is important to take matters into your own hands and contact psychologists. Children feel their mother's condition. Keep them as stable as possible and pay attention to their emotions. We advise you to reduce the time spent in Telegram channels in search of loved ones. It is exhausting and mentally damaging. Instead, contact the units where the missing person served, relatives or witnesses to get more information. Many regions have free support programs for families of missing persons or prisoners. Many veterans' administrations and centers have support programs where families can get legal, psychological and practical help. We also provide contact information for such organizations. If you suspect that your loved one has been captured, contact the Red Cross or other humanitarian organizations that deal with prisoners of war. — It is possible to reliably confirm information about the serviceman's stay in captivity through the International Committee of the Red Cross. As practice shows, this is the only way to do it. It is there that they should confirm which person was recorded on the video found on the information resources of the occupiers. It is necessary to work with the families of the missing as much as possible, to be in constant contact with them. For this purpose, we hold various briefings, organize video conference calls, and work together with the Coordination Headquarters on matters of treatment of prisoners of war. This is done by our civil-military cooperation representatives. Also, the patronage service has pages on social networks, where we publish information about where to go for psychological help and support for family members of missing servicemen. This is also an important aspect of the job. - In a purely human way, I understand why people do this. They want to engage in some activity that they believe will have a result, will bring benefits. However, it is not really worth doing this, because no one will give you more information than a military unit, but this way you can cause serious damage to a soldier who is in captivity. It is a very bad idea to put a photo in open access, publish personal data - surname, military rank, position, unit or brigade in which a soldier serves. The release of such information does more harm than good. Having more information about the serviceman than he himself provided, the enemy will be able to find additional leverage and pressure on him. After learning about the rank and position, the occupiers will begin to demand from him to provide information of interest to them. Therefore, it is not worth publishing such ads, because they will only harm. — These people should be given psychological support, explained and convinced that sooner or later everything bad ends. Psychologists, representatives of the patronage service visit the families of prisoners, help them cope with tension, overcome despair. It is very important for people to see that they are not left alone with their grief, with their problems. Likewise, psychologists work with families of seriously wounded soldiers who have special needs and require special care. An important role is played by our chaplain service, which meets the spiritual and religious needs of such families, helps them not to despair and not to give up. This always has a good result.

Russia invented the fire - cottages of Ukrainian generals - in Los Angeles	One of the latest fakes claims that eight cottages belonging to Ukrainian generals, worth a total of $90 million, allegedly burned down in Los Angeles. This fiction was actively spread through various Russian media and Telegram channels. The information about the -burnt cottages- was first published by the Voenny obozrevatel Telegram channel on January 11, 2025. Subsequently, this -news- was picked up by such Russian media as Gazeta.ru, Lenta.ru, EADaily, Komsomolskaya Pravda, and Tsargrad. In their publications, they claimed that Ukrainian generals purchased real estate in the United States with funds received from Western financial aid to Ukraine. This information is completely baseless and untrue. The video shared with this fake is fake. No reputable media, including the United24 platform, published similar materials. In addition, the commander of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Major General Mykhailo Drapaty, who was credited with commenting on this event, never made such statements. The main purpose of this fake is to discredit the Armed Forces of Ukraine and create a negative image of the Ukrainian military leadership. By spreading such fictions, Russian propaganda is trying to undermine the international community's trust in Ukraine and reduce the support provided by Western partners. This case is another example of the information war that Russia is waging against Ukraine. It is important to be critical of such -news- and to verify information through reliable sources so as not to fall prey to propaganda and misinformation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/16/rosiya-vygadala-pozhezhu-kotedzhiv-ukrayinskyh-generaliv-u-los-andzhelesi/	2025-01-15T20:08:19-08:00

The aggressor continues to populate the occupied territories of Ukraine with migrants	informs about this Center of National Resistance. It is noted that the Russians are agitating wage earners from Central Asia to the Russian Federation to move to TOT, promising relief from migratory pressure and a residence permit. Thus, the number of migrants to replace Ukrainians who left the city due to the occupation is growing rapidly in the TOT of Donetsk region, in particular in Mariupol.

In Zhytomyr Oblast, a man cut off a dead soldier's wedding ring and handed it over to a pawn shop	About this reported on January 15 the prosecutor's office of the Zhytomyr region. According to the investigation, a flagrant and cynical crime was committed in January this year by an employee of one of the branches of the Zhytomyr Regional Bureau of Forensic Medical Examination.

The commander of the unit is obliged not later than within 72 hours to resume service for these persons, extend their contract and renew all types of security, including monetary, food and material. The changes were introduced to ensure the stability and proper functioning of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the conditions of war and the need for maximum mobilization of resources for the front. Resuming the service of such persons also makes it possible to promptly fill the needs of the military and ensure the continuity of combat missions. The Verkhovna Rada also noted that this decision is an important step in maintaining the morale of servicemen and stimulating voluntary return to the ranks of the Armed Forces in difficult times.

The Defense Forces declared an advantage in the use of drones in the Lyman direction	This was told by the commander of the 63rd on the air of the telethon -Only News- of a separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Pavlo Yurchuk. According to him, in the Lyman region up to 90% of Russian equipment is destroyed thanks to drones and artillery.

The enemy has not yet managed to achieve parity, our forces are superior in terms of the number and accuracy of the use of unmanned systems,- Pavlo Yurchuk noted. As for supplying the brigade with drones and artillery, there are almost no problems. The brigade commander noted that the supply of ammunition is also at an adequate level, although not ideal. The main problem remains the limited replenishment of personnel. However, as Colonel Yurchuk emphasized, even in such a situation, the Ukrainian army acts rationally, not wasting human resources thoughtlessly, as the enemy does. -We really need more people to better maintain the defense line. But even with thousands of soldiers, we will not use human resource like the Russians do. We perfectly understand that the enemy cannot be defeated with human resources alone,- Pavlo Yurchuk emphasized.

Stepping over the wounded — in Kurshchyna, the Russians are once again showing cruelty to their own ...	The video was published on January 15 on the channel of the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Two Russian attack aircraft were heading towards our positions when they were attacked by a drone. The first stormtrooper was wounded and fell. His friend just walked by without even trying to help.

The second assault was less successful for the enemy: four more pieces of equipment and up to 35 military personnel were destroyed,- noted Yuriy Fedorenko. Despite the setbacks, the enemy continues to accumulate reserves and actively use manpower, especially in areas where armored vehicles cannot operate effectively due to difficult weather conditions. -We ensure stable defense dynamics thanks to the coordinated work of various units and the support of the Ukrainian people. The enemy is not making any progress, and his deadlines for seizing our territories continue to be missed,- Captain Fedorenko concluded.

A fake about the execution of a Ukrainian soldier who refused to fight	First, the Armed Forces of Ukraine operate exclusively within the limits of the law and statutes. The Ukrainian army is not a Russian army, where punitive methods are common practice. There is a clear system of disciplinary sanctions in the Armed Forces, and no illegal actions, let alone executions, are allowed. Second, the widely circulated videos and -testimonies- of such massacres usually lack any evidence. There are no identified individuals, confirmed sources, or facts that could even partially support the truth of these claims. All these videos are created either with the help of editing, or with the involvement of actors, or with the use of artificial intelligence. Thirdly, the very source of the spread of this fake is Russian Telegram channels and pro-Russian resources. They have lost credibility long ago due to the systematic spread of lies and manipulation. Their goal is not to inform, but to intimidate. The goal is obvious - to sow panic and discord among Ukrainians. The enemy wants to make the military doubt its command, and society doubt its army. Such throws are aimed at undermining confidence in the leadership, demoralizing fighters and destabilizing the situation in the rear. Russia cannot win a war on the battlefield, so it is waging a war in the information field. It is important for them to shake us from the inside, to make us doubt the correctness of the chosen path. But Ukrainians have already learned to recognize these cheap manipulations. Ukrainian soldiers are united not by fear, but by love for the Motherland. We are fighting for freedom, for the right to live in a free country where people have dignity and the right to choose. In our army there is mutual respect, support and brotherhood. This is the basis of our indomitability.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/15/fejk-pro-stratu-ukrayinskogo-vijskovogo-yakyj-vidmovyvsya-voyuvaty/	2025-01-14T20:47:23-08:00

Under what circumstances did he destroy the two invaders? He told our correspondent about this: -Soon after the large-scale invasion began, I told my parents that I would join the army. They tried to refuse. I, in general, am a religious person and taking up weapons is not my thing. But, as my brother said: you can serve, because our enemies are butchers, and they are not people. Well, in any case, I'm defending my country, defending my nation. &#8230;I can recall an incident at the front that happened in May 2024 on one of the southern directions. We entered the position of the first number, in the evening. We were told to meet -bunnies- on a moped. It should be noted that the enemy was moving there on mopeds. At the position, we were together with my brother. The enemy started working against us with the AGS. A case came to me. And it felt like you were charged with all your might into that place with the handle of a shovel. Then I see something flowing from me&#8230; On the walkie-talkie, I said that I was -300-. They asked how I am now, can I move? I replied that I could. It was in the evening, nothing was visible, and we were also wearing -invisibility- cloaks that hide you from thermal imaging cameras. I unbuttoned my bulletproof vest and put on a bandage blindly. And just at that time we were told on the walkie-talkie that two katsaps were coming in our direction. I looked: there are actually two people walking and still shining their flashlights. I let them get closer, 150 meters away. I -struck- one, then our drones finished it off with drops. The second one on the right passed me at first, but I wounded him too. And just like that, it was finished off with resets. But we were to meet more Muscovites on mopeds that we were told about. I told the company over the radio that I was fit for battle: my arm was not yet numb at that time because I was hit in the shoulder. That is, he could shoot. However, the company commander said that I was the 300th, and therefore -in the gray- (at the very dawn - ed.) I had to get out of the position. But I understood that the work had to be finished. And my brother and I heard a moped going. They also said on the radio that the enemy is moving in our direction. Later it was reported that our mortars had worked, and the enemy had turned his moped around and turned back. Then, injured, at one point I lay there for 12 hours. Changed his bandage&#8230; Lasted -to the gray-. And -evak- (evacuation vehicle - ed.) came after me. This was my third injury. And the first was from F-1. She was dropped from a drone on me by katsaps&#8230; It fell on the left side, closer to the leg, and broke. I remember that I had such a hiss in my side then! But luck still. Because I have a habit of carrying all my things with me. I even took a military ID and wallet with me to the position. And it saved my left leg: the fragment hit the military ticket, pierced it through and stopped on the leather cover. I didn't even think that a military ticket could save me one day.

Instead of oil platforms — anti-aircraft missiles: the path of a Kharkiv student to the front	The story of the fighter was published on page 61 of the separate mechanized Steppe brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine . When a full-scale war broke out in 2022, Bohdan was studying in the last years of university. Although his desire to immediately join the Armed Forces of Ukraine was strong, the Military Committee refused him, noting that a student without combat experience was not yet suitable. However, after graduation, Bohdan decided not to stop. He voluntarily came to the Military Commissariat, trained as an anti-aircraft gunner and joined the ranks of the Armed Forces. Currently, Bohdan is a platoon leader specializing in the detection and destruction of enemy air targets. Together with the team, he hunts kamikaze drones, cruise missiles and other threats from the air. The work of his unit requires maximum coordination: in the event of an alarm, they have only 1-2 minutes to take combat positions and open fire. -In Kurshchyna, we were greeted quite -warmly-. As soon as they started driving in, UAVs and drones flew in our direction. But the guys are well prepared, everyone knows their role. This is a friendly team, and I am proud of their work,- says Bohdan. In the breaks between combat missions, he thinks about his native Kharkiv and his family, which remained in the city, which regularly suffers from shelling. -I worry about them, they worry about me. They joke that I am -stupid- because I decided to go to war when I was young. I could continue my studies or go abroad. But I said: ``Do what you want, but I'm leaving.'' They were afraid for me then, and they are afraid now. But, in the end, they are proud of my choice,- says Bohdan.

From January 1, it is impossible to top up a mobile account through the post office in the so-called -LNR-.

Bad machine guns — low-quality weapons got into the troops and caused more than 190 million hryvnias...	About this reported on January 14 State Bureau of Investigation. With the assistance of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, SBI investigators established that officials were supposed to put 400 certified large-caliber machine guns on the front in 2022. Instead, they turned around the device, which instead of high-quality weapons got into the troops cheap analogues that are not suitable for their intended use. In addition, only half of the declared machine guns were delivered. 200 machine guns purchased at state expense did not have any markings, relevant technical documentation and any supporting documents. During their combat use, the weapon could not fire continuously and after the first shots, it generally failed due to the destruction of parts and mechanisms. As a result, the state budget suffered losses of more than 193 million hryvnias, and the Ukrainian military put themselves at risk. As reported by ArmyInform, the employees of the Security Intelligence Service completed the investigation regarding the commander of one of the military units of the Dnipropetrovsk region, who at the expense of the state organized the purchase of low-quality clothes for party subordinates komandyra-vijskovoyi-chastyny/->for almost 140 million hryvnias. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/pogani-kulemety-neyakisna-zbroya-potrapyla-u-vijska-i-zavdala-ponad-190-mln-gryven-zbytkiv/	2025-01-14T03:38:03-08:00

-The Rock- That Can't Be Moved: The Story of a Marine Sgt	The soldier's story was published by the 38th Marine Brigade. Ilya grew up in the city of Pidgorodnoe, in the Dnipropetrovsk region. He decided to become a soldier while still studying at NKV No. 4. He began his service in the 1st separate battalion of marines, where he received his first knowledge of combat tactics and learned to survive in extreme conditions. When the full-scale invasion began, Ilya was already serving his military service. In the first days of the war, he took part in the defense of Mykolaiv, stopping Russian attempts to break through to the city. Later, as part of the 38th OBrMP, he participated in the de-occupation of the village of Urozhaine in Donetsk region and the defense of the liberated territories. Then there were the battles for the Podstepne in the south of Ukraine and the difficult days of the defense of Krynok. It was here that Ilya, together with his brothers, repelled numerous -meat- assaults of the enemy, working under constant artillery fire. In Krynyk, he was seriously wounded in the leg. Long rehabilitation did not break the fighter - he returned to his medical company to continue his service. Despite all the difficulties, Ilya remains an optimist. His life motto: -Never lose confidence in tomorrow.- -Skala- was awarded the award of the President of Ukraine -For the Defense of Ukraine-. He is sure that his struggle is a contribution to the future of his native country. -I believe in our victory, and this belief helps me move forward,- says Ilya.

Took it apart — Ukrainian drones were happy to meet the enemy tank	The video of combat work was published on January 14 on the unit page. Ukrainian drones of the -Phoenix- division systematically destroy both the enemy's manpower and its equipment. Recently, another victim of the Ukrainian defenders was an enemy tank that tried to break through the defenses. According to the fighters, the occupiers are already going as far as to throw single units of equipment into the battle. The fate of this tank was predictable - it was completely destroyed. -Our guys disassembled this iron down to the screw.

-Some take their own lives, some are killed by their fellow citizens - how Russia hides the presence...	On January 14, the head of the Center for countering disinformation of the NSDC, officer of the Defense Forces, Andriy Kovalenko, told about this on the air of the telethon -Yedini Novyny- on January 14. -When North Koreans first appeared in Kurshchyna, we reported that they would issue Russian documents and pass them off as Tuvans, Buryats and others. So it is. They are now operating on the fact that, they say, the Tuvans were taken captive, where the North Koreans are,- he said. According to Andriy Kovalenko, the authorities of the Russian Federation are trying to disguise the participation of the North Koreans in the war, so that it is more difficult to study the actions of the DPRK on the battlefield. -Kim Jong-un is interested in this because he plans to use the knowledge gained by the North Koreans in Kurshchyna for provocations on the border of the Korean peninsula against South Korea in the future. He is preparing for a hybrid war there, let's say that for a start. the Russians are trying to help in this,- he noted. In his opinion, the Russian special services train North Koreans according to special methods, which describe what to say in case of possible capture. -But they are doing everything so that North Koreans do not get captured. They are pumped in such a way that some of them simply take their own lives if they are wounded, some are killed by their comrades if they are wounded, some manage to be evacuated very quickly, earlier than the Russians from the battlefield,- Andriy Kovalenko said. He noted that the North Koreans operate in limited infantry groups. -They are young, they are, unfortunately, progressing in terms of training on the battlefield. It must be recognized. And they are progressing from the point of view of countering drones and modern methods of warfare. This, too, must be acknowledged. But, once again, the value of life is still invisible,- Andriy Kovalenko emphasized. We will remind you that Russia is trying to hide the presence of troops from North Korea, -> issuing them false documents. As reported by ArmyInform, on the eve of January 12, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky made public video interrogation of the first captured soldiers from North Korea. It is about two North Korean soldiers, one of whom on January 9, 2025 -pivnichnokorejczya-na-kurshhyni/->captured by the fighters of the tactical group No. 84 of the SSO, and another - paratroopers of the Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/deyaki-pozbavlyayut-sebe-zhyttya-deyakyh-vbyvayut-pobratymy-yak-rosiya-pryhovuye-prysutnist-pivnichnokorejcziv-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-14T02:07:46-08:00
The Ukrainian defense industry has increased production volumes by more than 20 times — MOU	About this informs January 14 Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for European Integration Serhiy Boev spoke at the meeting of the national arms directors of the member countries of the Contact Group on Defense of Ukraine held at the NATO headquarters in Brussels. -The Ukrainian defense industry is not fully utilized, there is a lack of capacity financing. At the same time, only in 2023-2024, the Ukrainian production of artillery systems increased three times, armored personnel carriers - five times, anti-tank weapons - twice, and ammunition - 2.5 times,- Serhii Boev said. According to him, Ukraine can produce more than 4 million UAVs per year under the conditions of full production financing. The deputy minister emphasized the need to increase and accelerate the production of equipment and ammunition. He also emphasized the importance of Ukraine's combat experience for the development of innovations and technological improvement of existing equipment. -Ammunition remains the No. 1 need, even with a view to increasing production. Anti-aircraft defense, heavy equipment, engineering equipment are potential products of joint industrial facilities,- noted Serhii Boev. Separately, he emphasized that the use of income from frozen Russian assets can become an additional resource for the Ukrainian defense industry and joint ventures. In addition, the issue of localization of enterprises engaged in the repair of equipment transferred by partners is becoming even more relevant. This will greatly simplify the logistics chain and save funds that can be redirected as needed. Serhii Boev also emphasized that jointly produced and tested on the battlefield weapons can be exported to partners after the end of the war. As a reminder, Ukraine expects record production of weapons in 2025. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov summarized the results of the 25th meeting of the Contact Group on issues of defense of Ukraine in the -Ramstein- format, which became an important stage in the strengthening of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/ukrayinska-oboronna-promyslovist-narostyla-obsyagy-vyrobnycztva-bilsh-nizh-u-20-raziv-mou/	2025-01-14T01:46:43-08:00

Marine drone + R-73 missile: the GUR disclosed the details of shooting down enemy helicopters	reported this by the GUR Ministry of Defense of Ukraine with reference to an interview for the channel -TSN. Week- The commander of the -13th- said that this operation was the result of many months of preparation and continuous work of their team. According to him, they used a naval drone for the first time to destroy an aerial target. He noted that the task was risky, but the team was confident in its abilities. -We saw the goal and understood that time was passing by minutes. In this operation, we did not hide from aviation, as usual, but, on the contrary, sought a meeting with the enemy. A helicopter is a quick target. Once it comes into view, it's only a matter of minutes to get into a good launch position. We calculated everything, and the missile hit the target from the first launch, -recalls the commander of the Group 13 unit. It is about an operation during which Ukrainian-made Magura drones managed to disable two enemy helicopters and seriously damage another one. According to the commander, it was possible to do this thanks to the modernization of the missile complex adapted to launch from the surface of the water. -In this operation, we used a modernized R-73 missile, which was adapted for launching from a water platform. This is a difficult task, because the rocket was originally created for air launch from aircraft with a higher initial speed,- — -13th-. According to him, the modernized R-73 missile, which previously belonged to the -air-to-air- class, was equipped with a new guidance system capable of operating at a wider angle. Its damage range reaches up to 40 km, and the weight of the warhead is about 8 kg. To adapt to the water launch, Ukrainian engineers significantly improved the launch system, making it possible to use it effectively on board a marine drone. -This is the first time in history that a naval drone shot down an aerial object. We proved that even from the water surface it is possible to work effectively on air targets. This opens up a new horizon in naval warfare,- the 13th emphasizes. The Group 13 division already has 9 sunk and 6 damaged enemy ships. And now a new milestone — air targets. The team is currently adapting new tactics to combat enemy aircraft. -Russia is forced to reconsider its strategies. Their navy and air force are no longer untouchable. We effectively paralyzed the Black Sea Fleet of Russia. They are afraid to go beyond their bases,- the 13th summarizes. As reported by ArmyInform, Magura V5 naval drones had already attacked enemy air targets several times before, but earlier -rosijskogo-mi-8-morskym-dronom/->inflated equipment still -lasted- to the coastline or airfield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/morskyj-dron-raketa-r-73-u-guri-rozpovily-podrobyczi-pro-zbyttya-vorozhyh-gelikopteriv/	2025-01-14T01:19:39-08:00

The one who is very much awaited: the driver - Ural - from Transcarpathia on how to survive under sh...	The story of the fighter was published by the 128th Zakarpattia mountain assault brigade. Oleksandr is not new to war — back in 2014-2015, he served in the same division when the brigade was encircled near Debaltseve. It was then, during the exit, that Alexander not only saved his comrades, but also took away ammunition from the encirclement, the rest of which had to be detonated so that it did not reach the enemy. Now he is the oldest in the battery, and on his -Ural- he delivers ammunition, logs for fortifications and equipment to combat positions. Since the truck is a -fat target,- as Oleksandr says, he tries to drive at night or in bad weather to reduce the risk of coming under fire. Like all drivers on the front lines, Oleksandr knows that every departure can be the last. His -Ural- repeatedly came under fire. Once, while driving in a landing, a 152-millimeter projectile flew by, and although the shrapnel damaged the truck, Oleksandr did not stop — he continues to perform his duties. -We're moving on,- he says. However, his service at the front is not only about risk. It is also about the family, because Oleksandr joined the brigade for her sake. His relatives, including an officer son-in-law and a brother who served in the infantry, are also connected to the army. -After the victory, I will return to peaceful work, but I will always remember why this became possible,- says Oleksandr, knowing that his relatives are waiting for him at home. For him, every day at the front is a struggle for the future of his children and grandchildren. As reported by ArmyInform, medic -Norman- from the 23rd separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the repulse of the attack destroyed six Russian servicemen, while kept the personnel subordinate to him at that time.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/toj-kogo-duzhe-chekayut-vodij-uralu-z-zakarpattya-pro-te-yak-vyzhyty-pid-obstrilamy-ta-dostavyty-vantazhi-na-peredovu/	2025-01-14T00:14:22-08:00

From 5 to 10 rolls per day: the occupying infantry is the main force in the Pokrovsky direction	About it on the air of the telethon -The only news- told artist duties of the press officer of the 33rd Mechanized Brigade Nazar Voytenkov. According to him, the occupiers' equipment is currently used mostly for logistical needs or rotational operations, and the main burden of attacks falls on infantry. -The Russians are mostly on foot, running from cover to cover, waiting for reinforcements to come and then storm our positions. It is also worth noting that Russians have learned to spread out, move at a distance of 15-20 meters from each other, it depends on the weather conditions,- explained Nazar Voytenkov. The intensity of the attacks is constantly increasing: in the current month, more than 130 invaders have already been killed or injured, and this is far from the limit. -They don't stop, they attack much more intensively, every day we have from 5 to 10 raids in small groups of 2-3 people,- the press officer added. Due to the small distance between groups and the frequent use of natural shelters to mask movement, it is much more difficult to destroy the enemy on such a stretch. However, the Ukrainian military does not give up, despite the difficulties. Nazar Voytenkov emphasizes that the Rashists are losing more and more people on the battlefield, and the reason for this is the complete indifference of the Russian army command to the fate of their soldiers. -They just throw their subordinates to their deaths, and they don't care at all,- he concluded. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Pokrovsky direction our defenders stopped 77 offensive actions of the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/vid-5-do-10-nakativ-za-den-pihota-okupantiv-ye-osnovnoyu-syloyu-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-13T23:54:32-08:00

The Armed Forces introduced four qualification levels for UAV operators	informs about thisJanuary 14 Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The initial level of BKR I is designed to control micro- and mini-UAVs. It allows visual flights in the airspace of classes E, F and G according to the ICAO classification at an altitude of up to 900 meters above the ground. The operator must understand the basics of aviation meteorology, know the characteristics of their drone and have basic navigational skills. The second level of BKR II expands the capabilities to control small Class I UAVs and adds access to Class D airspace at an altitude of up to 1,500 meters. At this level, there are requirements for working with radar stations and advanced flight planning, taking into account the wind at different altitudes. Level BKR III opens access to the control of tactical UAVs in all airspace, except for class A, at an altitude of up to 5,500 meters. The operator must be able to control the flight by instruments, work with collision detection and avoidance systems, and also perform take-off and landing at various airfields. The highest level of BKR IV gives the right to control operational and strategic Class III UAVs in any airspace and under any weather conditions. The operator must have skills in instrument flying, working with satellite communications and interacting with air traffic control authorities. The MOU noted that each basic qualification level contains a clear list of knowledge, skills and competencies of the UAV operator. Such standardization will allow units to effectively interact at the front and maximize the combat potential of unmanned systems. -It is important to note that flying beyond line of sight requires BKR level IV, regardless of the size of the drone. Each subsequent level includes all the requirements of the previous ones and requires the completion of appropriate training with the demonstration of practical skills. The requirements are developed in accordance with the resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine from 01.10.2024 No. 1129 on the implementation of an experimental project on the certification of schools of UAV operators. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukraine will receive 30 thousand drones. a> from the Drone Coalition.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/u-zsu-vprovadyly-chotyry-kvalifikaczijni-rivni-dlya-operatoriv-bpla/	2025-01-13T23:29:26-08:00

Meat Assaults 2.0: North Koreans die in Kurshchina like Russians	The commander of the platoon of the first battalion 95 said this in the Army TV stream on January 13. Lieutenant Stanislav Krasnov of the separate amphibious assault brigade. -The situation is steadily tense. Attacks occur daily, continuously throughout the day and night. Russian assault groups are trying to advance, but we successfully destroy them with the help of UAVs and artillery,- Stanislav Krasnov noted. He stressed that North Korean units operate in large groups. At first, they accumulate in the number of 20 to 50 people, and sometimes up to a hundred in landings, and then begin to move towards Ukrainian positions in open terrain. -I haven't seen such a number of people just moving around the field since the beginning of the large-scale invasion in 2022,- Stanislav Krasnov added. Unlike the North Koreans, the Russian military, trained by bitter experience, moves alone or in pairs, trying to minimize losses. However, such experience does not help the enemy avoid losses. The commander also shared his experience of communicating with a captured North Korean. According to Stanislav Krasnov, in North Korea, the Russian language is part of the school curriculum, so the soldier understood the basic commands well enough. However, the most important factor was the captive's desire to survive, which makes speech and gestures universal means of communication. -When a person wants to live, he will understand any language,- the officer added. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ukrainian side is going to use North Korean soldiers captured by the Armed Forces in the Kursk region, in their own interests.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/myasni-shturmy-2-0-pivnichnokorejczi-gynut-na-kurskomu-fronti-yak-rosiyany/	2025-01-13T22:25:51-08:00

Smart-REB: the Ukrainian manufacturer has created technologies that will change the course of war	—Please tell us how EW/EPR tools changed during the period of large-scale invasion? —At the beginning of large-scale, all analog EW was white noise. There were 7 Ukrainian manufacturers at that time. Currently, there are already 177 of them. And 99% of these manufacturers use this same white noise, which essentially clogs the communication channels and makes it impossible for the signal to pass between the drone and the operator. That is, we take this to be a standard WB. A year ago, at a meeting with representatives of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, in particular, the EW administration, the majority of EW/REP manufacturers were also present. It was then that we discussed plans for 2024. Among other things — frequencies, powers, and the like — manufacturers faced the task of making a Smart-REB. The stronger the connection between the drone and the operator, the more powerful the noise generator must be to suppress it. If in 2022 there were enough generators for 10-20 W, then at the end of 2024 the required power increased to 100 W. This increases the need for electricity. Previously, drones operated at stable frequencies (868 and 915.5 MHz), but over time, they began to use a wider range - from 170 to 1200 MHz. Effective suppression requires multi-channel oscillators: 8 modules of 50 W are needed to block frequencies from 300 to 1100 MHz, i.e. 400 W. Together with other electronic devices, the power reaches 600 W. Providing such power supply is difficult: powerful generators or large batteries are required. This became a challenge for the General Staff, which commissioned the development of Smart-REB - a system that automatically adjusts to the frequencies of drones and effectively blocks them. — What are the main innovations of the new EBU that make it unique on a global scale? — Now we smoothly moved on to the question of what our new generation EBU is. In our work, it should be noted that we have our powerful RND center, which is constantly working on the development of some new technologies. This is how we got the -Azimuth- PEP tool, now its new generation -Ranger- is on its way out - it's a direction finder. We realized that without specific, even in a certain kind of unique developments, we will not overcome drones, because they are constantly becoming more powerful, begin to fly further, carry larger and heavier projectiles, so we need to think about what and how to do so that there is an obstacle . So, our team first studied LoRa radio protocols. This is, in fact, the channel through which the drone and the pilot communicate. That is, not just one frequency, but a channel through which information is transmitted. Our PEP tool -Azimuth- sees the LoRa protocol, which in general is quite a complex thing that is quite difficult to crack and adapt to. Our -Azimuth- sees the LoRa protocol in real time. It has a zoom function, that is, a magnifying glass. There is such a -waterfall-, as if the frequencies are running, we zoom in, scale this -waterfall- and see in what mode the drone works. When we broke down the LoRa protocol, we realized that the main communication in FPV drones in general goes through it, and we concluded that this white noise is how to work with consequences. For example, when a person is sick, he has a runny nose - he drops his nose so that there is no swelling, but he does not treat the disease. Working with the LoRa protocol is like treating a disease. We started looking into what we could do, how to get into that protocol and disrupt that channel of communication between the drone and the pilot. I will not say that we claim mega-uniqueness in the whole world, but for this year 2024, I participated in 15 different exhibitions. The world is still dominated by white noise, 20-30 W modules, and there is no understanding of antenna power, repeaters, and the fact that a drone can hang in the air and transmit a signal, etc. This made us realize that we are moving in the right direction. Actually, we have chosen a key against the tamper resistance of the protocol. We understood how to interfere with the interaction at the protocol level and made a new type of digital oscillators that can tune to different frequencies. In its final form, this device should work perfectly with our Azimuth. One such device can work and detect a drone in a 25 km area, so 5 Mirage devices can work (this is a new technology). Therefore, -Azimuth- detects anything that moves at frequencies from 30 to 6000 MHz and accordingly transmits to -Mirage- a signal that some drone is flying, transmits at what frequencies, and it already generates at these frequencies at the protocol level. It is very simple to explain what makes this technology unique. - What were the difficulties during the trials or testing of your EW/PER means? - When you talk about EW in general, the average citizen thinks that it is some kind of box with antennas, but few people understand how it works . This is physics. It is not necessary for an ordinary person to understand it, it is difficult. I would like it to be interesting, because this is a new technology, and not everyone understands how effective it is. We constantly travel to the front for tests. And where the defenders see how this technology works, our Defense Forces, are first surprised and then delighted. After all, no one believes that this is possible. When we come and tell the military that launch any drone, we will spell it out and put it out, then at first they say that it is unrealistic, and we answer that we don't even say at what frequencies the drone will be launched. You don't need to know the distance, we will see everything ourselves and fill it up. Literally recently, we had tests - we launched a drone. We saw it on Azimuth, which was one kilometer from our position, so the drone could not even take off. We turned it off, the drone began to fly, and the device has such a feature that it takes 8 seconds to get a bearing, transmit a signal, fill forms on the Mirage. During this time, the drone flies a certain distance. We let it take off, pressed the button, and in 8 seconds the drone fell 300 meters away. This is actually surprising. In order to correctly and quickly adapt to the changes that are currently taking place very dynamically on the front, we have installed SDR boards. This is a new word in EW tools, because they are usually based on conventional cooling modules, connecting to an antenna. An SDR is a board with a chip, a microprocessor, capable of handling a large number of operations. In itself, it is not know-how, that is, it is a technology in the electronics market that is widely used. We learned how to use this microchip to generate interference at the protocol level. It takes us 3-4 hours to make this SDR board and teach it the functions we need. Download some functionality, test it, and it starts working. We synthesize electronic circuits and implement the microcircuit directly on this chip. The problem is written on a mathematical level. Basically, a mathematical method of creating an obstacle is used by the EW system. This is no longer just an analog technology, it is a new solution that required a lot of investment, fruitful team work, but at the end we got a unique tool that works logically. Another feature of this device is that the more powerful the repeater it has, the further our Mirage works. Our record is that we landed a drone at a distance of 3.7 km on twenty-watt modules. This is a very cool result. The distance to the operator was 4 or 5 km. In fact, they just took off and immediately fell. Our technical team immediately got these math calculations right. And all we need is a digital synthesis of the necessary tasks. Currently, the Mirage is an EW against FPV drones. It operates between 300 and 1600 MHz. Since this is a new technology, it is just beginning to be mass produced, we have primarily made a decision on FPV drones because it is the most massive phenomenon that primarily harms our defenders. The next stage is we are developing 1600-6000 MHz to cover the entire frequency range. It will look like this: there will be a complex called -Atlas-. It will include the -Azimuth- PEP tool and 5 -Mirage- REB tools. It will be able to protect against all types of drones. -Atlas- will represent all the assets that have already been developed. —How long did it take your team to create the latest tools? What challenges did you face? - I can't say exactly how long it took us to create it. We have several directions now, but I can say that a year ago we had a meeting at which the General Staff set us the task of creating a digital smart EW, and we worked throughout 2024 to bring it to life. The main challenge is people. In general, there are few technicians today, a significant part is serving and fighting. Some abroad. In fact, there is a competition for such people. We always go beyond the limits, we worked not only with our team, but also involved people from abroad. All this created a synergy, somewhere they were testing, somewhere they were finishing, for the whole year there were more than 40 trips. For example, let's go, conditionally, to Donetsk region and test. Everything may be perfect in the laboratory, but not so in war. We declare certain characteristics, go to the field, test, analyze how it works. The first 20 times, almost nothing worked for us. That is, we were programmed, but we turn it on - and it does not work. Antennas have been redesigned many times. Now the Mirage can actually work with quad-filar antennas (these are the ones that give dome protection and can work with directional antennas (they are also provided in the kit). Accordingly, the military will choose according to need. Moreover, this tool can be controlled remotely, which is not no one. We test it like this: the team goes to the front, displays everything, gives us a signal that that you can start the drone, and our technicians are in Kiev and turn it on. We made such a decision to turn on the analog interference. But -Mirage- can be integrated into the combat control system. so that regardless of government programs, we can provide solutions at the brigade level or at the level of an operational-tactical group and build into the system. Our stationary systems that protect critical infrastructure are also implemented through remote access. On it, we see the environment on the fly and simply enter it. We are an innovative company that suits the development asking questions is quite non-standard. We made the first EW robot on a crawler platform. It is a combination tool that protects against drones at all frequencies and can be used everywhere. It's called Berserk. For example, a group goes out for demining, the EW robot covers them with a dome, and people work safely. Evacuation: it can be attached to a trailer to remove a person, because cars often simply cannot. A group comes to clean up a settlement, our -Berserk- goes in front of them, which provides a dome of protection against drones, and the defenders can safely clear the settlement. This is the first such tool in history and on the market. Even in China, copies of our products have started to appear. We are making the Atlas complex based on the vehicle, that complex will include direction finding, EW neutralization and physical neutralization, we are considering a turret or small missiles that are designed specifically against Orlans, Shaheds, etc. At the end of 2025, we will have -Radar- - an active radar station, three-coordinate, with a phased active array. We will essentially have two types of detection, one will be a frequency ether scanner that sees everything that is moving and at what frequencies. They can simultaneously see up to 200 targets and accompany one to its destruction, give instructions to air defense, and we will be able to work against the Shaheds. The final will be the -Orchestra- complex, based on radar, direction finder, EW and physical destruction. - Tell me, please, how the development of your EW tools affects the development of high technologies in the field of defense in general? - I was recently at a business festival where we had a panel discussion, we discussed high technologies. It was about the fact that these are not always high-tech technologies, but sometimes low-tech. The main task is to perform its function. This is what Ukraine is now valued for in the world, because we have such solutions that no one else has. First of all, this is an example of how defense innovation starts the cycle of high technology, this cause and effect relationship. It is a process that takes a period of time to start, but once it is started, it cannot be stopped. Modern challenges, such as Russia's massive use of drones against Ukraine, have created motivation because we are defending our land. This aspect is very important. It's not enough to come up with something, it constantly needs to be improved. What was relevant 6 months ago may not be necessary at all now. Therefore, white noise products are gradually becoming a thing of the past. If earlier the tool provided protection for 300 meters for cars, now it is 200-250 meters, in a year it will be 50-70 meters. We also need to grow. In general, before, few people perceived that Ukraine and high technologies could be together, but now we see that DFTEK, our drones, EW and REP are what we can strengthen our combat positions. Unfortunately, our country has become such a training ground where we test all of this, but on the basis of this and what is in the world, we can create the latest developments, and this takes us to a completely different field of international image.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/smart-reb-ukrayinskyj-vyrobnyk-stvoryv-tehnologiyi-yaki-zminyat-perebig-vijny/	2025-01-13T21:12:47-08:00
It will come in handy everywhere: German gunsmiths are working on a new cruise missile with a wide r...	According to the authors of the portal Defense Industry Europe, the MBDA Deutschland company has unveiled a new concept of a universal Remote Carrier cruise missile Multidomain Multirole Effector (RCM²). This system will be developed to complement the existing air-based missiles -Taurus- and will ensure the versatility of deployment on many platforms, according to ArmyInform. The German branch of European missile giant MBDA has released a concept image showing the proposed RCM² remote launch vehicle, similar to a missile, launched from a warship, a transport aircraft and a mobile ground launcher. Analysts of edition The war zone in their turn state that the latest renderings of the RCM² published by the German missile manufacturers include an example of launching their charge from a warship's vertical launch system (VLS), probably Mk 41 VLS or similar model. The German Navy already uses the Mk 41 VLS on most of its frigates, and the system is widely used by NATO and allied navies. Although Germany has already ordered the Kongsberg Naval Strike Missile (NSM) as its future anti-ship and surface-to-surface missile, it is launched from box launchers rather than the Mk 41 VLS. Our editors told about these products in one of his previous materials. The following image from MBDA Deutschland shows several examples of RCM² -falling- from the rear ramp of an Airbus A400M military transport aircraft. The use of transport aircraft to drop winged munitions is now of increasing interest, highlighted by the concept of launching palletized munitions from the air Rapid Dragon US Air Force . It's also worth noting that Airbus has already conducted some experimental testing, including launching what it called a -remote flight demonstrator on a carrier.- And finally, the RCM² is shown to be launched by a tracked mobile ground launcher. Presumably the M270 multiple rocket launcher system (RCMS), which can fire 227mm artillery rockets as well as short-range ballistic missiles from the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). In the first rendering for this material, the M270 launcher is shown with a mixed payload of artillery rockets and RCM² remote launch vehicles. It will also provide compatibility with the M142 or HIMARS High Mobility Artillery Missile System. The RCM² missile is equipped with a turbojet engine that provides enough thrust for a range of about 500 kilometers. Weighing around 340 kilograms, this product can be configured with different payload options. This makes it adaptable to the specific needs of combat missions. Payload options include an explosive warhead for use as a barrage munition, electronic warfare payloads with jamming capabilities, and sensors for intelligence gathering. The design of the forward-looking rocket from MBDA also allows combining different payloads within the framework of a single mission, increasing the versatility of the rocket. The ability to mix payloads gives commanders increased flexibility in adapting to changing mission requirements and responding to new threats. The RCM² is also planned to be integrated into the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), a new generation fighter project aimed at developing advanced air combat capabilities for Europe. This missile system, with its versatile design and advanced capabilities, is expected to play a central role in the FCAS program, strengthening Germany's air and missile strike capabilities in the coming years. German gunsmiths are working on the new RCM² cruise missile. Visualization of Defense Central Missile presentation by MBDA Deutschland.

-Run-in with drones-: how defenders are prepared to face UAVs. ArmiyaInform report from Donetsk regi...	ArmyInform visited one of these trainings for combating enemy UAVs in the 21st separate special purpose battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky near the front in Donetsk region. More recently, one of the most difficult tests during the psychological preparation of soldiers for combat conditions was -tank run-in- - a set of exercises designed to teach servicemen to overcome their fear of a multi-ton enemy armored vehicle and to effectively destroy it. Tanks have not disappeared from the battlefield, but the chances of an infantryman engaging in close combat with a heavy tracked enemy tank are much smaller today than they once were. Instead, it is almost inevitable on the front line to encounter an enemy drone - a scout, a bomber with dropouts or an FPV kamikaze. -Fighters must know this sound, constantly move and be able to hide,- emphasizes the UAV pilot with the call sign -Asian-, who conducts training together with other instructors. The BZVP, according to them, provides only the minimum necessary basis for interaction with aerial drones, so additional intensive training after arriving at the unit is mandatory. During today's training, servicemen practice moving in fours and twos, firing from awkward positions from behind cover and, most importantly, detecting and reacting to enemy UAVs. The crew of the pilot and the drone operator will be located a few hundred meters from the training site and will raise the -bird- under the command of the instructors. A quadcopter simulating an enemy drone appears above the infantry at the most unexpected moment. Sometimes it simply flies or circles over a training ground, other times it rapidly approaches a group of military personnel or even simulates something similar to an FPV kamikaze drone attack. — We teach fighters how to interact with drones so that they get used to the sound of UAVs. This is necessary so that when they hear or see a drone, they do not freeze, but move, move, find shelter and hide. Because often they see a drone and freeze, because they think that thanks to it they are hiding, while from a drone they are perfectly visible, -Asiat- explains the meaning of training flights over infantrymen. Today, the main focus is on countering drones with drops, so after the first few flights they start attaching drops to the drone. First, these are imitations of ammunition without charges and with weak charges of the level of a loud firecracker, later - smoke grenades capable of covering the entire training ground with thick smoke. Instructor -Norman- emphasizes that one of the important skills is the ability to communicate with each other, informing each other of danger. Loudly shouting, informing your comrades about the drone and indicating the direction from which it is approaching, is no less important for survival on the battlefield than fast movement and finding reliable cover. — We see here a simplified version of what the guys will face on the battlefield. A drone is one of the elements of what may be waiting for them. The first thing a serviceman should do when he discovers a drone is to warn his comrades about the danger. Communication among themselves, exchange of information is the key to the survival of the whole team, he explains. This also needs to be taught, because quite often fighters not only freeze and freeze, but also shut up - either because of fear or because they think that the drone can -hear- them. Instead, the pilot controls the drone based on video, so it is impossible to express yourself with sound. Practices like today's take place regularly, and not only the newly arrived rookies take part in them, but also those who are taken out of the rotation positions. -This is my third training,- says the fighter with the nickname -Tima-. — The day before yesterday we were in positions, and now we are training again. This is the second time we work with drones. Training after BZVP may last longer, the same fighters who are removed from the positions are trained for a few days less - they already have combat experience and an understanding of what they will deal with on the front line. So there is no need to psychologically prepare them for shooting, explosions and smoke, unlike their newly arrived brothers. Drone operators note that progress during training using UAVs is noticeable after a few days — fighters not only get used to the buzzing of propellers, but also automatically perform the learned algorithm of actions. On the battlefield, this will significantly increase their chances of avoiding damage. — I personally train a little, but drones from other units come. During all the training, while they are working, learning to move in a group, to walk in pairs - all work is accompanied by a drone. That is, they should know this sound, get used to the drone and not be afraid of it, says -Asiat-. In addition to the skills of detecting a drone in time by observing the airspace, informing the group about it, moving quickly and finding cover, the fighters also practice firing at UAVs. However, despite the live cartridges in the stores when firing at targets from the firing range, now shots at the drone are only simulated. - The chance of shooting down a drone bomber is quite high, depending on where it is spotted. If he was spotted on the approach and started shooting at him in time, before he took aim, then at low altitude it is quite easy to shoot him down. The pilot will see that you are shooting at him, and this will prevent him from calmly hovering and making a reset, -explains the -Asian-. After several dozen activities on two groups of fighters who replace each other on the training ground, the instructors note a significant improvement in the skills of the fighters. Despite the fact that they were exhausted, the errors in the implementation of the algorithm were noticeably reduced - the actions of the soldiers became more and more automatic. In view of this, today the training with drones is completed and after a short break they are preparing for new exercises. This time it will be throwing live grenades. They, as well as patrons, are not spared for training.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/obkatka-dronamy-yak-zahysnykiv-gotuyut-protystoyaty-bpla-reportazh-armiyainform-z-donechchyny/	2025-01-13T20:39:27-08:00
Fake hysteria: Skabeeva revealed the theft of Koreans in Kurshchyna	Sound like a joke? But this has long been the working style of the Kremlin media. Creating a fake, blowing it up to the scale of a -world conspiracy- and presenting it as evidence of -Ukraine's aggression- is a standard scheme. This time the fiction is so absurd that it is difficult to understand how even the most ardent fans of Russian talk shows can believe it. The fiction about -kidnapped Koreans- in Kurshchyna looks like a propaganda attempt to once again shift responsibility for the failures of the Russian army to Ukraine. Kurshchyna, which has become one of the hot spots in the border battles, has long demonstrated the weakness of the Russian defense. However, instead of acknowledging their problems, the Russian media portrays -Ukrainian saboteurs- who are engaged in anything but real struggle. Obviously, there is no evidence in this -news-. No video, no witnesses, no statement from the North Korean government. But this was never a problem for Russian propaganda. For her, the important thing is not the confirmation, but the emotion. Hysteria, fear, hatred - this is the currency that Skabeeva trades in. First, it is an attempt to distract Russians from domestic problems. When there is instability in the rear and growing dissatisfaction with the war, it is convenient to show the -enemy- who supposedly threatens everyone. Secondly, this is a way to discredit the Armed Forces, which actually demonstrate effectiveness even on Russian territories. Thirdly, such delusion is needed to intimidate the own population. If you believe that -Ukrainians are kidnapping Koreans-, then anyone could be next. This is a game on fears and the creation of an image of an -all-powerful enemy- to be feared and hated. The reality is much simpler. The Armed Forces conduct combat operations against enemy military facilities and logistics. In addition, the military from North Korea, who joined the Russian army, also became our enemy. Our Defense Forces operate exclusively according to the rules of warfare and can capture soldiers from the enemy's army. In fact, Ukrainian FPV drones, strikes on warehouses and command posts - this is what worries the Russian command. And this is what forces Russian channels to invent all sorts of stories in order not to tell the truth about failures on the front. For Ukraine, information warfare is no less important than armed confrontation. And while Russia is inventing fables, we are telling the truth. And this truth is stronger than any lie. Therefore, let Skabeeva continue to invent -kidnapped Koreans-, -war mosquitoes- and -black biologists-. We know what we are doing - we are fighting for truth, freedom and for those who believe in our victory.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/14/fejkova-isteryka-skabyeyeva-rozkryla-kradizhku-korejcziv-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-13T20:23:51-08:00

The Ministry of Internal Affairs told how many soldiers submitted a report on their return from the ...	Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Digitization, told about this in the Yedyni Novyny telethon. -That is, more than half of our soldiers who expressed a desire to continue to serve either return or have returned to the army in the military unit they chose,- she emphasized. Kateryna Chernogorenko recalled that about three weeks ago, the Ministry of Defense launched the possibility of a quick return from the SZCH through a report in Army+. -We launched this capability with the reason why the serviceman left the service. And the absolute majority of servicemen wanted to transfer to another part, but could not do it, so they went to the SZCH. This is a very big signal for us,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko. She noted that there are several advantages of returning from the SZH through a report in the Army+. -The first thing is that you come back absolutely quickly and without any additional complications. The second is that you choose the part in which you will still feel motivated,- explained the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for digitalization issues. According to her, if the report is not approved, a clear reason is always given. -Most often, either the soldier did not have time to arrive at the VSP branch within 24 hours, or if, for example, he gave unreliable, inaccurate data in the report. But a clear reason is noted. You can resubmit the report,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko. We will remind you that in the Army+ mobile application for military personnel na-povernennya-z-szch/->a report appeared for the return from the voluntary abandonment of the part.

- We will use it in our interests - GUR on the interrogation of soldiers from the DPRK	The representative of the Main Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defense Yevgeniy Yerin. -In any case, this is a correct and necessary incident for Ukraine and for our position, which we will use in our interests. This is interesting and necessary information that we can get from them. Plus, the very fact of confirmation of participation from direct participants from the territory of North Korea is also a very necessary fact for us. Everything they tell will be used in the interests of Ukraine,- said the representative of the State Government. Commenting on the results of interrogations of captured North Koreans, he noted that he could not divulge any details at the moment, but said that Ukraine was preparing for this, so specialists who know the DPRK well are working with them now. -We were preparing. And not only us, but all relevant services involved in this process were preparing. And, accordingly, we are absolutely ready within the limits defined by the legislation of Ukraine,- assured Yevgeny Yerin, adding that the military and political leadership of the country will decide the further fate of the prisoners. As for the role of North Korean soldiers in the hostilities in Kurshchyna, the representative of the GUR assessed it not too highly. -Their main task is to participate in assaults or other operations. They are, as a rule, used as part of units of the marines, amphibious assault troops, and Airborne Forces of the Russian Federation. And they, first of all, are conventional cannon fodder. However, among them there are various specialists who deal with various issues, but in general, it is, relatively speaking, infantry,- the scout stated.

-Aramis- and his iron birds: how drones become the key to victory	The interview with the soldier was published on January 13 on the DPSU page. Aramis began his journey to work with drones back in 2020, when he studied unmanned systems on the western border. But already in 2023, he headed an air reconnaissance and strike group that performs tasks in the combat zone. According to him, the experience of working with drones in the rear and on the front lines are two completely different worlds. The first combat flight fell on an operation in the Serebryansk Forest. -It was a completely new level. During training, you have time to think and analyze, and in real combat conditions, everything is decided in seconds,- says Aramis. Today, the main challenge for his group is the enemy's use of various EW tools. -Each target requires at least five or six drones,- he explains. -One is looking for EW means, the second is finding out the frequency, and the third and fourth are performing strike missions on specified targets.- One of the main priorities of Aramis and its unit is the elimination of Russian UAV operators. -Their operators are the key to their aerial intelligence. Depriving them of this advantage means bringing victory closer,- he notes. Despite the intensity of combat, Aramis emphasizes that constant training and skill improvement is critical. -We work constantly, analyze mistakes, train. As a sniper feels the recoil of a weapon, so I feel the -recoil- of a joystick. This is a delicate science that needs to be perfected,- he adds. As reported by ArmyInform, the sniper with the call sign -Malysh- is only 25 years old, but vich-z-vorogom-istoriya-snajpera-na-psevdo-malysh/-> he went through the horrors of the environment and fought with the enemy both at a distance of hundreds of meters and face to face.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/13/aramis-i-jogo-zalizni-ptahy-yak-bezpilotnyky-stayut-klyuchem-do-peremogy/	2025-01-13T05:09:00-08:00

Germany handed Ukraine the first of the 54 RCH 155 self-propelled guns ordered: what it is capable o...	This was reported by Tagesschau. The handover ceremony took place at the factory in the city of Kassel, where the KNDS company produces this weapon system. -This is a signal that Ukraine can count on us. And Germany is ready to take responsibility in Europe,- said Boris Pistorius. The first self-propelled RCH 155 was symbolically received by the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany Oleksiy Makeev. In total, Ukraine is to receive 54 RCH 155 artillery systems. The first six of these systems will initially remain in Germany and will be used for training the Ukrainian military. In 2023, it became known that the German company Kraus-Maffei Wegmann started production RCH-155 self-propelled artillery installations for the Ukrainian army. Artillery installation RCH 155 (Remote Controlled Howitzer 155 — remotely controlled howitzer) was created by the German company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (now KNDS). When creating a new artillery installation, German engineers took the best solutions from the PzH 2000 and Donar self-propelled guns. The RCH 155 is based on the chassis of the German-Dutch GTK Boxer wheeled armored personnel carrier with an 8×8 wheel formula. The newest 155 mm self-propelled gun was introduced in 2014. It is positioned as the world's first artillery system that can fire on the move. Primarily, this is needed to avoid return fire by enemy artillery during counter-battery combat. The RCH 155 self-propelled gun has a fully automatic loading system with an ammunition set of 30 equipped shells and 144 modular projectile charges. The maximum range of fire with a standard projectile is up to 30 km, and with a long-range active-reactive projectile V-LAP - up to 56 km. At the same time, the maximum rate of fire can reach 9 shots per minute. The RCH 155 has an advanced fire control system. The crew of the machine receives targeting via radio communication or using a data link. The shot is fired remotely by the crew located in the cabin of the self-propelled gun. Although in the event of an accident or failure, this artillery system can be loaded and fired manually. The interval between arriving at the firing position and opening fire is approximately 30 seconds. After firing the last projectile, the self-propelled gun is able to quickly leave the position to avoid counter-battery fire. The body of the machine is made of modular armor combined with ceramic protection. The triple bottom is shaped to provide maximum protection against anti-tank mines and improvised explosive devices. Damaged armor plates can be easily replaced in the field. The tower is made of lightweight aluminum armor and provides protection only against 12.7 mm small arms and artillery shell fragments.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/13/nimechchyna-peredala-ukrayini-pershu-z-54-zamovlenyh-sau-rch-155-na-shho-vona-zdatna/	2025-01-13T04:32:10-08:00

This is reports the press service of the K-2 regiment. -We expected a maximum of a few thousand applications, but by no means seven. This is a huge level of trust for which we are grateful. At the same time, this is a test, because most of our servicemen continue to perform combat tasks, and the resources for processing applications turned out to be insufficient,- the department said. According to the message, some applications are still being processed due to technical difficulties, but the recruiting process is already being improved. The regiment plans to increase the number of people involved in recruiting recruits and streamline the process from application to interview. -We will do our best to provide feedback to anyone who is interested in joining our regiment.

Military counter-intelligence agents detained an unemployed woman who was preparing a Russian drone ...	About informs SBU. It was noted that the priority targets of the aggressor were administrative buildings of state institutions and energy-generating enterprises of Ukraine. -In order to program enemy kamikaze drones to hit Ukrainian objects, the agent turned on GPS coordinates on her phone and took photos of the objects in such a way that their exact geolocation was included in the file properties,- the report says.

Why orders for transfer through the Army+ sometimes have to wait a long time: the Ministry of Defens...	Relevant information is available at site MOU. The function of changing the place of service has been working in the Army+ application for almost two months. Already 7,000 servicemen have received approval to continue their service in the part they chose independently. At the same time, in recent weeks, the Ministry of Defense has received about a hundred appeals from servicemen who are still waiting for the order or face its being ignored. The MOU explained each of these cases. Why do we have to wait for an order sometimes for a month, or even longer? Every day, up to 1,000 reports are submitted to the Personnel Center of the Armed Forces through Army+. Currently, they have already submitted 30,000. Some military personnel submit 5-7 times, correcting errors following the prompts of operators, or receiving a rejection each time due to rejection of the transfer by the commander of the unit, where his approval is required by the resolution. This increases the burden on operators who work around the clock. Sometimes orders are formed in a few days, and the military can immediately see its number and date in the application. And sometimes it takes weeks. What have we done to simplify the work of operators? We analyzed the most common mistakes made by the military and improved the report template in Army+. Added a link to sample recommendation documents and a list of typical military documents with tips on which pages to attach. The order is already in the formation, but the commander ignores it and avoids appeals There are artificial barriers that can be created on the ground. They are already being overcome. For example, in December, amendments were added to Cabinet Resolution No. 1291 and the formation of orders for soldiers and non-commissioned officers was simplified by the order of the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, removing the post of military officer from him. It is enough to indicate only his name, rank, part numbers and tax payer cards. Yes, cases were removed when the transfer order was ignored due to a change of position in the staff list. In addition, the Central Office for the Protection of Servicemen's Rights, together with military administration bodies, respond to servicemen's appeals and monitor the execution of orders by unit commanders. The main thing is that if there is an order to transfer, it must be carried out. And the commander should not detain a soldier who legally chose another unit for himself, where he will feel motivated. If there are such cases, fill out the form in the application, which is located on the route: Menu → Support service → Frequently asked questions → Change of service location. Select the question above. The status of the order will be recorded and clarified. A contact e-mail is indicated in each form. It is he who will be notified of the result of the inspection.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/13/chomu-nakazy-na-perevedennya-cherez-armiya-inkoly-dovodytsya-dovgo-chekaty-roz%ca%bcyasnennya-minoborony/	2025-01-13T02:10:40-08:00

Some of them were immediately destroyed by the crews of Kurt & Company and the Unmanned Systems Battalion. And the rest were driven by heavy drones into dugouts and foxholes, taking them at gunpoint,- the fighters said. At that time, the infantrymen of the 2nd mechanized battalion went on a sweep. -And now every position has become a death trap for the occupiers. With the help of grenades, small arms and an iron will, the soldiers cleared each trench step by step. -Only in the last one did an enemy attack aircraft try to throw a grenade at the knights, but it caught the bullet, dropped it and exploded,- the fighters said.

- The enemy is completely destroying the city - - in the direction of Kurakhiv, the Russians intensi...	About this on the air of the telethon -Social News- he told Oleksandr Nevidimy, chief communications branch of the 46th separate air mobile brigade. -The enemy does not abandon the goal of capturing the entire settlement of Kurakhove. The advance of the enemy has not been recorded recently, because we detect all such attempts in time and inflict adequate fire damage on the enemy,- he said. According to him, the nature of Russian assaults has remained unchanged for a long time. -These are small groups of infantrymen and groups on motorized vehicles with the support of attack UAVs. The work of barrel artillery and the use of multiple rocket systems became more active. The enemy is constantly working on our positions with all types of MLRS. Well, in general, it just completely destroys the city,- noted Oleksandr Nevidimy. He said that over the past year, his brigade destroyed 118 tanks, 63 artillery systems, 2,318 UAVs of all types, 243 units of armored combat vehicles, 144 vehicles, 52 light armored vehicles, 53 units and 4,206 enemy personnel killed and wounded. -But again, these figures do not include the number of Russian servicemen who were in dugouts, in equipment and the like. That is, we could not count how many were there. These are just the numbers we saw in the streams on the battlefield. And 61 occupiers were captured,- he said. As reported by ArmyInform, last day the loss of the Russian invaders vtraty-rf/->made 1510 people. Also, Ukrainian soldiers neutralized 8 tanks, 26 armored combat vehicles, 37 artillery systems, a rocket salvo fire system, 2 air defense vehicles, 183 operational-tactical UAVs, 110 vehicles and a unit of special equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/13/vorog-vshhent-znyshhuye-misto-na-kurahivskomu-napryamku-rosiyany-posylyly-obstrily-z-rszv/	2025-01-13T01:41:33-08:00
Pokrovsky direction: why the Russians do not launch a frontal attack on the city	This was reported by the spokesman of the operational-strategic group of troops -Khortytsia- Major Viktor Tregubov. -Pokrovsk is now a key direction for the enemy, but the Russians are no longer ready to attack it in the same way as it was before, for example, in Mariupol or Bakhmut. They cannot afford to use attacks in the forehead, due to significant losses,- Viktor Tregubov noted. According to him, the Russians are no longer ready to storm large Ukrainian cities using the same methods as before: head-on, with waves of offensive forces in urban battles, recruiting recruits and untrained soldiers for the assault. Recalling the experience of Russian attacks in 2022, Viktor Tregubov emphasized that Russian forces lost too many people to repeat these tactics. -They understand that urban battles in Pokrovsk can become a real -meat grinder- for them, especially considering that the city is well fortified and defended by experienced Ukrainian defenders,- the speaker said. In addition, significant Russian losses in urban battles, in particular in Kurakhovo, Toretsk, and Chasovo Yar, proved how high the cost to the enemy of such attacks is. Therefore, given the situation, they will probably not risk their forces in direct assaults, and will continue to try to bypass and surround the city. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Pokrovsky direction, our defenders napryamkah-ta-kurshhyni/->stopped 58 offensive and offensive actions of the aggressor.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/13/pokrovskyj-napryamok-chomu-rosiyany-ne-jdut-v-lobovu-ataku-na-misto/	2025-01-13T01:36:25-08:00
Passed through the environment and fought face-to-face with the enemy: the story of a sniper on pseu...	His story was told in 23 separate mechanized brigades. -Our hero is only 25 years old, but with the experience he gained in the war, he could already be writing a memoir. -His path to the sniper craft began long before the front,- the report said. In civilian life, he worked as an underground machine operator at a mine. However, at the age of 23, he left his usual life and volunteered to defend the Motherland. At first he wanted to serve next to his twin brother in the Navy, but he was transferred to another unit. In 2023, he joined the 23rd Brigade, where he is still serving. Subsequently, he was trained at a sniper school and began a new phase of his life - on the front line. In the hero's opinion, -a sniper is more than just a fighter with a weapon, he is a person who is able to work where an ordinary shooter cannot.- -Malysh- works with the UR-10, a Ukrainian semi-automatic rifle with a caliber of 7.62×51, capable of accurately hitting targets at a distance of up to 800 meters. However, the effectiveness of the shot depends not only on the technique or weapon, but also on the understanding of many factors: wind direction, temperature, atmospheric pressure. Before each exit, the team conducts thorough reconnaissance. -We choose a position so as to remain inconspicuous. Camouflage is the key to survival. The position can be our base from one day to five, depending on the task,- explained -Malysh-. Once, while on a combat exit at an observation post, a sniper pair spotted the enemy running in the direction of their positions. -At first they wanted to neutralize him, but they took a closer look: he was moving strangely, as if he did not realize what was happening. They decided not to shoot, detained. It turned out that the occupier was a Yakut. It was also surprising that he was laughing all the time after being detained,- the fighter said. -Kid- suggested that it was caused by stress and panic. Then it turned out that all the information he gave during the interrogation turned out to be false. But war is not only about relative control of the situation, but also about incredible challenges. Once -Malysh- and his siblings found themselves surrounded. The enemy attacked as many as 16 BMPs, but they managed to destroy one with the help of a large-caliber machine gun. Then four infantrymen and two snipers confronted the enemy who went on an assault. Unfortunately, everyone died except for -The Kid-. -The hero's partner later fell under the bullet of a wounded occupier, whom they did not notice at first when they were making their way back to theirs. Left alone, wounded and exhausted, receiving instructions from the platoon commander via walkie-talkie, the hero made his way to his positions,- the 23rd Brigade said. The guy came across an anti-tank ditch with very steep slopes, which he was able to overcome with the help of improvised means. In the end, -The Kid- managed to get to his own. After this incident and treatment in the hospital, the soldier returned to duty in his unit, even though fragments still remain in his body. As for the work of a modern sniper, as the hero claims, it is changing rapidly with the advent of new technologies. Drones make it difficult to choose positions, forcing you to work closer to the infantry, to perform the work of a -marksman-. But even in such conditions -Malysh- continues to fulfill its mission. -Camouflage cloaks, thermal imaging devices, night vision devices, weather stations - all this makes us effective. But the main thing is knowledge, patience and faith in one's own abilities,- he says. The guy is only 25 years old, but he has more on his shoulders than the average person can handle. -Therefore, Malysh's story is not just a story about one man's courage. This is a symbol of the indomitable spirit of all defenders of Ukraine, who prove day after day: their heroism and devotion to the Motherland have no limits,- noted the 23rd OMBr. Earlier, ArmyInform reported on the story Shahed hunter. Oleksiy joined the ranks of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as a volunteer in the summer of 2022. Before that, he worked as a land surveyor in the bodies of the State Geocadastre.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/13/projshov-cherez-otochennya-i-borovsya-vich-na-vich-z-vorogom-istoriya-snajpera-na-psevdo-malysh/	2025-01-13T01:09:04-08:00

North Koreans at the front: if not to shoot, then to explode	This was reported by the deputy commander of the air mobile battalion of the 95th DSHV brigade Major Anton Zakharchuk According to him, North Korean soldiers often blow themselves up with grenades when they realize that they are surrounded by Ukrainian troops or that they may be captured. -This has become commonplace,- the officer says. -We try to identify them using aerial reconnaissance, they hide in trenches or holes, and when we get closer, we hear explosions.- Another important point that Anton Zakharchuk drew attention to is the role of North Korean soldiers in Russian assault groups. They are the first to attack, often acting as -meat- for the assault, while Russian troops take a more passive position, entrenching themselves in already captured territories. This tactic shows how the North Koreans are being used as human shields for the Russians. As ArmiyaInform reported, soldiers of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine repelled the assault of the North Korean troops, which lasted from morning to night in Kurshchyna.

Water supply at TOT: Lysychansk is still without water, and attempts to restore it are fruitless	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. According to him, the occupation administration tried to start the water supply system, but the result turned out to be predictable - numerous surges at the water wells. At the same time, we are talking not only about apartments, access to which is difficult due to the lack of owners. Key infrastructure elements that the occupiers have been trying to -restore- for over 2.5 years have been destroyed. It is worth noting that the situation with water supply in the city of Lysychansk remains critical since the moment of its occupation. Devastated budgets, corruption in the ranks of the occupiers, and the lack of real work to restore infrastructure mean that even such basic services are out of reach for local residents.

-There is no way without him at the front now-: the Ukrainian armored car -Cossack- saves the marine...	The commander of the marine infantry company with the call sign -Borziy- told ArmiyaInform about the combat capabilities of the -Cossack-5- and how these armored vehicles help the marines hold back insurgents in Donetsk region. Here the Russians attack the most. The enemy is trying to take Pokrovsk -in a pinch-, storming the surrounding settlements from the flanks. Their goal is to reach the Pokrovsk-Kostyantynivka-Chasiv Yar line. At the same time, the enemy wants to pass along the road, parallel to the road connecting Pokrovsk with Pavlograd, and reach the administrative border of the Dnipropetrovsk region. They cannot perform these tasks. In Donetsk region, the marines are fighting with an enemy superior in manpower. the Russian occupiers throw forward all available forces, trying to break through the defenses. But our soldiers effectively -quench- the assault actions of the Russians in difficult conditions. Marines say: Kozak-5 combat vehicles perform well during combat missions and are a significant reinforcement at the front. -The tasks are performed in a variety of ways. This is a fire support vehicle, and the delivery of troops to the task area, and the evacuation of the wounded and the transportation of ammunition. Built on a Ford F-550 chassis. Fully Ukrainian armor with an American engine, the power of which is 440 horsepower, automatic transmission. The operating range is 1000 km. Speed ​​on the track up to 120 km/h. Good passability in fields and hard-to-reach areas. But you need to -trust- the chassis a little more so that it does not throw strongly to the sides while driving. The landing compartment accommodates up to 8 people. Plus 2 crew members. A Ukrainian-made 12.7-mm NSVT large-caliber machine gun is mounted on top of the capsule cabin. But in fact, according to the characteristics, it is the Utyos machine gun. This weapon is used by marines to suppress enemy fire activity during amphibious landings in the area. Ukrainian armor is of very high quality. The other day, the enemy hit us with 120 mm mines, the shells exploded nearby, the cabin and the driver's side window were slightly cut by shrapnel. The car survived, everything is fine with the crew and the people who were in the landing compartment. According to the stated characteristics, the car can withstand an explosion on an anti-tank mine, but, fortunately, I did not have to test it on myself. The work on the battle line and the approaches to it is very difficult. Mobility and unit cohesion are important here. The guys on the front edge keep the defense, after the combat rotations, they need to be quickly changed. On -Cossacks- it comes out very quickly. There is a point in the area where we are supposed to meet our guys who need to be picked up. Let's preferably leave at night. A replacement group is eliminated with us. Of course, close to the positions, we can't drive up. raiders use reconnaissance UAVs and FPV drones. Therefore, to go to the very -front- is to become easy prey for the occupiers and commit suicide. No one fights like that now, we value every life of our brothers, unlike the enemy. And in general, the time when you could safely go to the front line has long passed. The replacement has taken place, the new marines are in position and with fresh forces they are hitting the invaders who are advancing in infantry groups. The enemy's tactics remain unchanged: assault groups of several people advance in the -gray zone- and die before even reaching our positions. Next comes another group, which is also destroyed. -Borziy- has been in the army for a long time, since 20 years. Born in Cherkasy. Started in a separate battalion of marines of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He was a simple driver, got into a mortar division, worked on 120 mm mines. Went for promotion - became a platoon sergeant major. First contract from 2016 to 2019, served three years faithfully and resigned. Worked for a -citizen-, earned good money. Then he returned to the army again, to the air defense unit, which was located not far from home. -The commander of the unit, when he found out that I was a marine, told me: -you will be bored here, the adrenaline is not the same.- But soon a large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation began, so it was no longer boring for anyone. But I still wanted to join the Marines. The 38th Brigade was just being formed. And here I am. A year ago, he received the rank of officer and headed a platoon. -Recently promoted to the commander of a company of marines,- says -Borziy-. To the question of how to encourage men to join the army, Borziy answered: -For example, I could not just watch how these Russian bastards occupy our land. Every reasonable person sees that Russia is the aggressor and the occupiers have come to Ukraine to kill us on our land, destroying everything in their path. I believe that every man should take up arms and defend his family and the territorial integrity of Ukraine. And not to sit at home, under the skirts of their wives. I do not condemn anyone, but a person appears to be in trouble. That's why such trouble happened to us. We are obliged to protect Ukraine.- Let's meet the driver of -Cossack-5- Yaroslav with the call sign -Mudriy-. The guy says: the call sign was given in honor of Prince Yaroslav the Wise of Kievan Rus. He is 29, from Zhytomyr Oblast, in the brigade since March 2023. Before the Armed Forces, he worked as a construction worker. -In the first year of the invasion of the Russian Federation, I went to the local TCC six times, I was directly kicked out of there. They said: there are no vacancies for you, boy, go home for now. Wait for your time,- says the -Wise One-. The marine fought in difficult areas of the front of the Russian-Ukrainian war. -In 2023, our unit was in Donetsk region in the Kurakhiv direction, then it was transferred to Kherson region, carried out combat missions in Krynyk, and then again in Donetsk region. It was very, very difficult in Krynyk. The Katsaps covered us with artillery, they did not spare the KAB, their tanks worked on us. I was injured there last December. The mine flew, the fragment went under the shoulder blade. After treatment, he returned to action,- says Yaroslav.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/13/bez-nogo-zaraz-na-fronti-niyak-ukrayinskyj-bronovyk-kozak-ryatuye-morsku-pihotu-na-peredovij/	2025-01-12T21:09:34-08:00

A counterbattery's best friend: Swedish fighters have developed a high-tech radar	As informs in an official release, the developer Swedish company Saab, five Arthur systems of the next generation, which named TAIPAN by the British Army, were delivered, adopted and are in service with the 5th Regiment of the Royal Artillery of the United Kingdom Armed Forces, ArmyInform reports. Scandinavian gunsmiths emphasize that, replacing the MAMBA equipment - the latest generation Arthur radar - TAIPAN offers the British Army rapid deployment and redeployment, high operational mobility and precision counter-battery operations, locating an increased number of targets at greater distances with reduced electronic warfare signatures, using the Saab digital antenna. This ensures survivability, reliability and high availability. -We are extremely proud to support the British Army with our state-of-the-art TAIPAN systems. Our relationship with the Army through the Arthur system is based on years of service in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Saab team is looking forward to continuing our support for the UK as it has become an early adopter of the new systems for the current and next generation Arthur,- said Andy Fraser, Group Managing Director of Saab UK. -Saab is our key partner for both MAMBA and TAIPAN, and what it as a company has and continues to provide to our Armed Forces is extremely impressive. MAMBA has proven its worth, and TAIPAN is a step in changing capabilities,- said Lieutenant General Sir Andrew Gregory, Head of St James's Park. According to analysts of the Dutch portal Army Recognition, which studies the arms market, the TAIPAN counter-battery radar is the latest iteration of the ARTHUR series (artillery radar) Saab. This advanced radar system is designed to detect and locate enemy artillery, mortars, and rocket launchers, greatly enhancing counter-battery operations. With advanced technology, TAIPAN provides real-time intelligence that allows artillery units to quickly identify the source of enemy fire and respond effectively. TAIPAN mounted on a high mobility truck MAN SV 9T, equipped with digital antenna technology and an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, which allows it to track multiple targets simultaneously with unsurpassed precision. This system has an impressive detection range, capable of identifying various types of threats at significant distances. As for artillery fire, the radar can detect shells at a distance of up to 40 km. For mortar fire, the system can detect incoming projectiles up to 20 km away, and for missiles it can track projectiles up to 60 km away. Radar coverage in azimuth spans 360 degrees, providing full tracking of the operational area and allowing the system to detect incoming threats from any direction. TAIPAN offers reliable stability in challenging environments. Its advanced signal processing provides accurate tracking of artillery, mortar and missile trajectories, providing accurate data on the location of enemy positions with minimal delay. The system's digital beamforming technology increases its resistance to jamming and electronic countermeasures, making it survivable in electronic warfare scenarios. In addition, the ability of this equipment to be rapidly deployed and redeployed provides flexibility in the fast-moving environment of the battlefield. This combination of long-range detection, high mobility and resistance to electronic warfare makes the TAIPAN radar system an invaluable asset to today's military forces. This not only increases the effectiveness and speed of counter-battery fire, but also significantly contributes to the overall coordination of artillery operations, ensuring a quick and accurate response to artillery threats. With the integration of TAIPAN, British Army artillery units are better equipped to dominate the battlefield, providing a critical edge in modern warfare. The British Army demonstrated its advanced TAIPAN anti-battery radar system during the Dynamic Front exercise recently held at the Rovajarvi training ground in Finland. More than 250 British Army soldiers and more than 5,000 soldiers took part in these exercises. multinational NATO forces from 28 countries. The event provided a unique opportunity to demonstrate the integration of advanced artillery and radar technologies into a tactical environment. One of the key moments of the -Dynamic Front- exercises was the combat firing of the 155-mm self-propelled howitzer -Archer-, which is in service with the 19th regiment of the Royal Artillery and about which told our editorial office It was the first time the British Army had deployed the Archer system in a tactical setting during a multinational exercise. Known for its mobility and accuracy, the Archer howitzer complements the TAIPAN radar, with the two systems working in tandem to provide a rapid response to artillery threats. Swedish company Saab delivered a new generation TAIPAN Artillery Hunting Radar to Great Britain.

propaganda invented a fake about Ukrainian medics and wounded at the front: what this time	The favorite Russian fable about -nationalist battalions- received a new sound. This time, Kremlin propagandists decided that the Ukrainian system of medical evacuation and front-line aid works according to the principle: -Nationalists first, then everyone else.- To create the effect of -horror-, they even added that ordinary soldiers were supposedly specifically denied help in order to save -right-wing radicals-. In fact, the system of medical care in the Armed Forces works smoothly and as efficiently as possible. Priority in the provision of assistance is determined solely by the severity of injuries, regardless of rank, battalion or any other factors. Ukrainian medics work heroically in extremely difficult conditions, saving the lives of every soldier. As for the -nationalist battalions-, this is an old cliché of Russian propaganda, which has long ceased to be true. All units currently defending Ukraine are integrated into the Armed Forces, and there is no privilege for individual groups. Russia really needs to maintain its myth of a -split- in the Ukrainian army. Creating an image of -privileged- and -discriminated- soldiers helps them invent reasons why the Armed Forces continue to successfully defend their land. Moreover, it is a way to devalue the heroism of Ukrainian doctors, who actually perform titanic work. Imagine a field hospital under artillery fire, where doctors with a stopwatch check IDs and determine the -degree of nationalism- of the wounded. In reality, doctors rush to save everyone, risking their lives, and priority is given according to the degree of severity of injuries. The propagandists must have been too engrossed in their own series. The fake about -priority aid to nationalists- once again demonstrates how far Russian propaganda has gone in its fantasies. But let them invent nonsense rather than win real battles. The truth is simple: every Ukrainian soldier and medic proves every day that humanity and professionalism will always win.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/13/rospropaganda-vygadala-fejk-pro-ukrayinskyh-medykiv-ta-poranenyh-na-fronti-shho-czogo-razu/	2025-01-12T20:19:44-08:00

Serhii Bratchuk. -The enemy is trying to invade our islands. To climb in order to try to create certain bridgeheads there. The calculation is to continue attacking the right bank, which looks suicidal today. The enemy does not have such a resource, but he still tries to storm,- he said. According to him, Russian troops do not reach either the middle of the Dnieper or the Ukrainian islands. -They have three such favorite locations - it's Kozatskyi Island, it's clear why, and there they pick up, as always, full tomatoes. If we are talking about the Great Potemkin Island, the same is the Zabych Island. These are precisely the locations where the enemy is trying to attack,- Serhiy Bratchuk noted. He said that these unsuccessful attacks were carried out by 61 separate brigades of the Russian marines. -This cannon fodder, which is sent to storms, understands very well that this is a one-way ticket, this is a ticket to Kobzon's concert, and even the slaves are beginning to raise their voices there,- the man remarked. Serhii Bratchuk added that those who refuse to go on an assault are sent to the -pit-. -And if you sit in the hole for three days, of course, without water, food, there is a huge 110% chance that you will still get caught in the storm and will not return. I know that there are a lot of such cases, and they even try to injure themselves,- he emphasized. The spokesperson of the Ukrainian Volunteer Army -South- emphasized that the best thing is to surrender to the Defense Forces of Ukraine. -Such a situation occurred in the Zaporizhzhia direction. In particular, with our National Guardsman from the -Spartan- brigade. -Several men of the enemy surrendered as prisoners, and today they are definitely alive,- he assured. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian military, which send to storm the Dnieper islands began to sabotage the performance of their tasks, putting the watercraft in a non-working state.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/12/tam-navit-raby-pidijmayut-golos-rosiyany-vidmovlyayutsya-jty-na-shturmy-a-najmudrishi-zdayutsya-v-polon/	2025-01-12T01:24:46-08:00

For example, during a week of work of our unit, 100 representatives of the Russian Federation and even more die easily. At the same time, with minimal and sometimes zero losses among the Defense Forces of Ukraine, this is also very pleasing,- he assured. According to him, the tactics of the Russians have not changed. They continue to use small assault groups of 2-3 military personnel and try to pin them down in certain positions. -While sending from a distance of 30-100, sometimes 150 meters from each other. Whoever survives will be established.

The French -Caesar- for Anna of Kyiv: how the artillerymen of the 155th brigade studied and fought. ...	ArmyInform was told about this by the commander of the 155th artillery division of the separate mechanized brigade named after Anna of Kyiv, Major Nazar Balagutrak with the call sign -Cossack- and the commander of the 2nd self-propelled artillery battery, Lieutenant Petro Molodik with the call sign -Apostol-. On the position of the CAESAR self-propelled artillery installation, we leave in anticipation of combat work. You don't have to wait too long after arrival - before the command -Cannon to battle!- we barely have time to inspect the positions of the gunners. This is a deep caponir, in which a considerable French self-propelled gun is completely sheltered, as well as a dugout of artillerymen and two separate ammunition storages, one with shells, the other with gunpowder charges, far from the gun and the shelter of the gunners . Positions are disguised so that they can be seen at a distance of several dozen steps is almost impossible. Even knowing that gunners are stationed somewhere here, one has to look closely to see traces of people and equipment. Separate storage of ammunition in two stacks away from the gun and the dugout is necessary so that the shelter of the gunners, the -self-propelled gun-, projectiles or gunpowder could not be hit with one ammunition. At the same time, from two to five dozen charges at a distance of 20‒30 meters from the gun. This amount is enough for effective combat work and at the same time it allows not to expose the position to the danger of losing a significant amount of ammunition. — Depending on the situation and tasks, there may be 50-60 charges at the same time, but, as a rule, we try distribute them so that the enemy's random projectile does not cause terrible damage, - says the commander of the artillery division, Major Nazar Balagutrak. Later at the command post, the officers will explain the priorities of such arrangement of the position: in the first place is the preservation of the lives of the soldiers, in the second place - equipment, in the third place - ammunition. live contact with settlement fighters, find out their needs and monitor combat work. — I try to visit positions, look people in the eye, thank them to them for their work. Or not to thank, but to scold, if they suddenly become stupid. But in most cases, I praise them, because they not only try, but also do well, - says the commander of the artillery division, Major Nazar Balagutrak. humanity in wartime should also be taken into account purely economic criteria, no matter how cynical it sounds, for the first view. - People are an irreplaceable resource. You can sacrifice any equipment just to save a human life. This is primarily from a purely human point of view. But if you calculate how much it costs the state to train one artilleryman, prepare a calculation, then the sums will be huge, - the military officer explains his opinion. So finding ammunition, repairing damaged or replacing lost equipment is much easier and ultimately cheaper than to train experienced artillerymen, provide treatment and rehabilitation of the wounded or pay the families of the dead. Major Nazar Balagutrak is a military man who has connected his life with the Armed Forces since his youth. Since 2019, he has participated in Operation United Forces, at the front from the very first day of a large-scale invasion. Comparing the combat operations of the time of the OOS with the current war, the officer draws attention not only to the colossal increase in the intensity of combat operations, but also on the delegation of authority and responsibility, which did not exist before. — It is difficult to compare the war of the time of the Soviet war after 2022. It was much easier in the OOS — everyone already knew the positions and simply changed brigade to brigade during rotation, handed over and organized combat duty, he says. Now it is necessary to completely organize combat work in a new place from scratch - move the military body, set up positions, establish management and logistics, solve many related issues. — You understand that there are people behind you, there are weapons behind you, and it is necessary to protect, firstly, people, and secondly, to fulfill the assigned combat task with the available forces there. You have to make accurate and correct decisions, because your life and the lives of your people depend on them, - explains the commander of the art division. Lieutenant Petro Molodik, who participated in the anti-terrorist operation in 2014‒2015 , says that all his experience of about one and a half years at that time can be invested in three days of war after the start of a large-scale invasion. In France, fighting on -Caesars- both experienced combat gunners, such as the officers we are talking to, and newcomers, who over the course of two months underwent basic combined military training and professional training in Ukraine, studied. training for gunners at the 199 training center of the Military Academy in Zhytomyr. Even before we went to France, we had a formation of batteries and tactical exercises with live fire, says Major Nazar Balagutrak. fighters to perform combat tasks and the suitability of the unit to participate in combat operations. The first stage is BZVP, the second is individual training in a specialty, the third is collective training as part of an entire unit. - Studying in France is a great experience, because the opportunity to form a unit from scratch is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. As you make him, so he will fight. We were very lucky with the fighters, especially with the firemen, because the people all came with the right attitude, says Lieutenant Petro Molodik. like clockwork — quickly and flawlessly. From the team -Cannon to battle!- just over a minute passes before a shot is fired. During this time, the fighters have time to set up the gun, perform guidance, raise the projectile and gunpowder, and charge the self-propelled gun. Following the first shot, the next one takes place almost instantly - during this time, the calculation has already managed to make adjustments and deliver the charge. For their knowledge of the Caesar self-propelled guns and the ability to work with a cannon, the calculation fighters owe their training in France. It was there that they polished the skills acquired in Ukraine to an impeccable level and learned a lot of useful things about the -self-propelled gun- from experienced French colleagues. - The most important thing that the French taught us was the maintenance of the gun during combat work. From the beginning, we explained that fighters have general training, they can fire on a target, but they need to simulate combat work when the gun is damaged or malfunctions. Therefore, during the exercises, the French could specially pull out a pipe or damage something in the computer so that it malfunctioned, and taught the soldiers how to calculate how to detect and correct an error, says Major Nazar Balagutrak. Also significant attention was paid to individual training by specialty and combined training with simultaneous training in tactical medicine. However, Ukrainian artillerymen note, not everything taught by French colleagues in this regard is suitable for use in the conditions of modern war. — The French have combat experience, but these are completely different theaters of combat operations — Iraq, Afghanistan , Mali in Africa. But you understand that fighting a Muscovite is a completely different story. Therefore, we had to adapt what they taught us to our realities, because ours is not the kind of war they are used to, - explains Lieutenant Petro Molodik. and tactics of combat use of artillery. For example, according to French rules, gun positions are set up at a distance of 20 kilometers from the line of battle, but in Ukrainian realities we have to set up positions at a distance twice as close. because we must have a fire maneuver in the depth of the enemy's ranks. That is, based on the technical characteristics of the gun, we have no other option than to place it 10-12 km from the anti-aircraft missile system, - says Nazar Balagutrak. The French gunners note material support and well-thought-out and well-organized logistics as the strengths of the French. - Their logistics work perfectly - this is exactly what we were sorely lacking at the beginning of the war. The French have it very well thought out and adjusted, but we started to develop in this regard only during the war, - says Major Balagutrak. On the other hand, Ukrainian artillerymen, thanks to their combat experience, have serious advantages in communication and situational awareness. - When the French saw our Delta in action, they would be shocked. They have a similar thing called -Atlas- and it is very complex, it needs secure radio communication channels. Our system works much simpler and better, - says the officer. With special pleasure, the gunners remember how they impressed their French colleagues with the accuracy of shooting. - We showed class at the shootings. There was a training ground where old tanks were broken. The French bought 200 shots for us - and our -Nettle- and the use of drones simply shocked them. Because we simply raised the -Mavik- and from the third shot, having the plug -missed - flight-, put the projectile directly into the tank, - smiles Lieutenant Petro Molody. So the French gunners not only taught the Ukrainians, but also learned themselves, having tried to apply the acquired knowledge in practice at the end of the training. The officers say that the foreign colleagues succeeded quite well, because the level of their basic training is very high. - Everyone likes the comparison with cars. Let's put it this way, 2C1 -Carnation- against -Caesar- is like my father's old -nine- and a good -Mercedes-. The -Nine- drives and she doesn't care, and the -Mercedes- is comfortable, but if the on-board computer is covered there - that's it, call a tow truck, - Lieutenant Petro Molodik says about the advantages of the -Caesar- ACS. The advantages of -Caesar- are obvious, but a complex computerized system can cause an unexpected failure in small moments that can negatively affect the work of self-propelled artillery installations. As an example, gunners talk about the work of a -self-propelled gun- during frost. -Caesar- has many moving parts, and if moisture gets between them and freezes, the system may malfunction. — Because if a little moisture gets in, it freezes and this affects the operation of the sensors. The pressure of the hydraulic system is 200 atmospheres, it is definitely enough to expand the cannon. But the sensors are very sensitive and start to fail. Therefore, it is necessary to disassemble and assemble the cannon every two hours, - explains the officer. In addition, the gunners pay attention to the resource of the cannon barrel of 4 thousand shots, noting that during intensive combat work it will be good if it is enough for 10 months, if not less. And also for the failure of fighters during intense shooting. However, it is not difficult to replace them, because there are spare ones in the kit. However, -Caesar- has significantly more advantages - from several ways of quickly binding to the terrain to the ability to almost instantly calculate individual corrections for each gun when firing . A significant advantage of -Caesar- for ensuring shooting accuracy is the ballistic station, which measures the initial speed of the projectile at the exit from the barrel. Towards the end of the conversation, we return to the greatest advantage of Ukrainian artillerymen. These are motivated and well-trained fighters of gun calculations. During exercises in France, they gave a head start even to younger, stronger and more trained French colleagues and in competitions with crews of foreign colleagues on accuracy and speed of fire they won with a score of 3:1. — You know what they are in did we win In a tug of war! Because there are all young healthy guys, 18‒25 years old, many representatives of the peoples of French Polynesia — healthy, stocky, very strong. And we have older men, says Lieutenant Petro Molodik. However, when it came to combat shooting, the Ukrainians -showed their class- and performed better than the French teachers themselves. — When a person fights for his Motherland, when he understands who and what is behind his back, it is a completely different feeling than participating in military conflicts somewhere far from home on a foreign land. -Patriotism is not an empty word,- says Major Nazar Balagutrak, speaking highly of the soldiers of the gun combat units. Each of them bears the names of Ukrainian hetmans and military leaders — Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, Ivan Mazepa, Petro Skoropadskyi, Simon Petliura and even Nestor Makhna. This is how the French self-propelled guns -Caesar- received Ukrainian callsigns from the 155th brigade named after Anna of Kyiv. The gun, the combat work of whose crew we observed at the positions, is named after Hetman Petro Konashevich-Sagaidachny. Like her heavenly patron, who marched on Moscow, she strikes Muscovites with mercilessly murderous precision.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/12/franczuzkyj-czezar-dlya-anny-kyyivskoyi-yak-vchylys-i-voyuyut-artylerysty-155-brygady-reportazh-armiyainform/	2025-01-11T21:22:20-08:00

Hitchhiker stops drones: US companies join forces with AI to counter barrage munitions	As stated in the information from the authors platforms UNITED24, this partnership brings together IronDome IronNet , a cyber threat detection system, with Asterion's experience at neutralization of unmanned aerial targets. This synergy is aimed at meeting the Pentagon's growing demand for integrated defense solutions, ArmyInform reports. //www.newsweek.com/->magazine Newsweek, the advanced interceptor drone HitchHiker (-Hitchhiker-, in Ukrainian) is an advanced platform designed to counter a wide range of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), not only increases battlefield situational awareness, but is also an effective tool for neutralizing aerial threats. Its deployment underscores the growing role of advanced technology in modern warfare. HitchHiker is a multi-role unmanned interceptor aircraft capable of speeds of up to 450 km/h with a range of 200 kilometers. The system integrates advanced sensors for situational awareness and a secure network environment that enables early detection of enemy drones. Experts in the Netherlands portal Arms Market Research Army Recognition said that the HitchHiker is launched through the ASTERION PERIMASTER C4 system, a sophisticated command-and-control platform that integrates data from long-range sensors. This system places the HitchHiker directly behind incoming threats, allowing operators to visually inspect potential targets in real-time before neutralizing them or recalling the drone to base This flexibility makes the drone valuable for both surveillance and direct action missions. One of the defining features of the HitchHiker is its ability to automatically launch from fixed or mobile platforms. This capability allows it to quickly respond to threats and even counter swarms of drones, a growing concern in today's conflicts. By automating launch and operation, the system reduces response time and maximizes battlefield effectiveness. Looking ahead, Asterion Systems is developing a reactive version of the HitchHiker capable of engaging high-speed reactive UAVs. This upgrade will further expand the tactical application of the drone, allowing it to intercept targets beyond the reach of current electric models and solidifying its position as a leading anti-UAV technology. In today's fast-changing battlefield landscape, HitchHiker deployment is essential addition to the defense arsenal of any country. As conflicts increasingly use UAVs for intelligence, surveillance and strike, platforms like HitchHiker provide a significant advantage. By integrating advanced artificial intelligence and autonomous systems, HitchHiker not only strengthens defense capabilities, but also offers a glimpse into the future of drone warfare. Success in the trials could pave the way for wider deployment across NATO forces, setting a new standard for anti-drone solutions in modern warfare. Rear Admiral Mike Hewitt, director of IronNet, described HitchHiker as a -picture- for warfighters capabilities with the potential to change the dynamics of modern warfare. Economic operation of a drone that uses an all-electric propulsion system provides lower operational requirements and maintenance costs compared to traditional air defense systems such as expensive Patriot missiles.

A fake about NATO generals in Dnipro hospitals: why is it the enemy?	In the news circulating on Russian channels, it is said that Ukrainian hospitals, in particular in Dnipro, are receiving NATO officers en masse after the -defeats- of the Armed Forces on the battlefield. Kremlin -journalists- even invented -informants- who saw how -foreigners with expensive equipment- were allegedly brought to hospitals, and the entrance to hospitals was guarded by SBU units. And, of course, all patients speak English! In fact, hospitals in Dnipro, as well as in many other Ukrainian cities, are full of our soldiers who risk their lives every day defending Ukraine. They are heroes treated by dedicated doctors. There are no -high-ranking NATO officers- there and there cannot be. This fake is another attempt by the Kremlin to explain to its own audience why the Ukrainian army turned out to be stronger than they thought. Such fakes help Russian propaganda to create the illusion of a -war with NATO- and not with Ukraine. After all, to admit that the Ukrainians themselves are defeating the Russian army is to destroy the myth of the -second army of the world-. That is why the NATO generals appear, who allegedly flooded the Dnipro hospitals. Apparently, Russian propagandists completely forgot that Ukraine has enough of its own talented commanders and strong soldiers who destroy the enemy even in such difficult conditions. As for hospitals, if there are -high-ranking- persons there, then these are our heroes, who deserve this title by their exploits. The story about the NATO generals in the Dnipro hospitals is another example of how Russian propaganda tries to hide its failures. But the truth is simple: Ukraine is fighting without needing fictional heroes. And let fictions remain for Russian talk shows - they fit there.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/12/fejk-pro-nativskyh-generaliv-u-likarnyah-dnipra-navishho-cze-vorogu/	2025-01-11T20:15:49-08:00

In practice, the occupiers will be entertained in hospitals: the new student policy at TOT	About informs Center of National Resistance. Mostly in the so-called rehabilitation centers for -svo- terrorists. There they will work in local clubs and entertain decommissioned -heroes- with cult events. This production practice of cultural studies students is part of the Kremlin's policy of occupying Ukraine. First of all, to Russify the youth and destroy their Ukrainian self-identity.

According to the official version of the occupation authorities, the reason for the delays was a -technical failure- due to which the data of tens of thousands of pensioners was lost. Now everyone who applied for Russian pensions is forced to update the information in the databases. At the same time, the situation in the field of passenger transportation in Luhansk remains critical. Back in October, transport companies complained about a shortage of about 300 drivers due to forced mobilization. Despite an attempt to attract workers by offering one-time payments of 100,000 rubles, a job as a driver in Luhansk can only be obtained through the Military Commissariat. The shortage of personnel and delays in social payments are becoming increasingly obvious consequences of Russian aggression in the occupied territories. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers closed entry to Lysychansk for civilians without local registration and Russian documents.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/11/zhyttya-v-rezhymi-zbij-okupanty-stvoryuyut-soczialnyj-haos-na-tot/	2025-01-11T05:15:02-08:00

The capture was made possible thanks to the coordinated actions of tactical group No. 84 of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and paratroopers. Despite the injuries, the prisoners survived and were taken to Kyiv. They are currently communicating with SBU investigators. -This was not an easy task: the Russian military usually finishes off its wounded to hide any evidence of the participation of other countries, including North Korea, in the war against Ukraine,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyi. Detainees are provided with necessary medical care in accordance with international standards. The President also instructed the Security Service of Ukraine to ensure journalists' access to these persons so that the world learns the truth about North Korea's participation in the war. This case is yet another proof of Russia's use of military personnel from other countries for aggression against Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, the soldiers of the Defense Forces of Ukraine -na-kurshhyni/->captured the first military personnel of North Korea who fought for the Rashists on Kurshchyna	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/11/prezydent-ukrayiny-rozkryv-detali-operacziyi-zi-vzyattya-u-polon-pivnichnokorejskyh-soldativ/	2025-01-11T04:32:37-08:00
One with a broken jaw, the other a talker - the first North Korean prisoners from Kurshchyna	About this reported on January 11 by the Security Service of Ukraine. Thus, the Security Service of Ukraine, which documents and investigates relevant crimes, received indisputable evidence of North Korea's participation in Russia's war against our country. We are talking about two North Korean soldiers, one of whom was captured on January 9, 2025 by the fighters of tactical group No. 84 of the SSO, and the other by paratroopers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Immediately after capture, the foreigners were provided with all necessary medical care, as provided for by the Geneva Convention. They were taken to Kyiv to carry out primary investigative measures. They are kept in proper conditions that meet the requirements of international legislation. The captives do not speak Ukrainian, English or Russian, so communication with them takes place through Korean translators in cooperation with South Korean intelligence. At the time of capture, one of the foreigners was carrying a Russian-style military ID issued in the name of another person with registration in the Republic of Tuva, Russian Federation. And the other was without documents at all. During the interrogation, the DPRK soldier, who had the ticket, told the SBU employees that this document was issued to him in Russia in the fall of 2024. Then, according to him, part of the combat units of North Korea were coordinating with Rashist groups for one week. He himself stated that he was born in 2005, held the position of a rifleman and served in the military in North Korea since 2021. It is noteworthy that the prisoner, as well as the Russian military at the beginning of the full-scale invasion, emphasizes that he was allegedly going for training, and not for the war against Ukraine. Another prisoner of war confirmed the testimony of his -partner-. He gave part of the answers to the questions in writing, because his jaw was injured. According to preliminary data, he was born in 1999, and has been serving in the North Korean army since 2016 as a sniper-reconnaissance. Currently, the SBU is conducting the necessary investigative measures to establish all the circumstances of the participation of the North Korean military in the Russian war against Ukraine. The investigation is conducted under the procedural guidance of the General Prosecutor's Office under Art. 437 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (planning, preparation, initiation and waging of an aggressive war).

How to get to the top sniper world league: about the marksmanship course and techniques from experie...	The sergeant-instructor of the sniper training school of the 199th training center of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the call sign -Zub- told ArmyInform about how the role of a sniper on the frontline has changed and how future snipers are trained. The future sergeant-instructor chose contract service in the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2019 after, as a young man, he tried himself in various professions, but never found his vocation in civilian life. — I worked in many places, tried my hand at many things. At some point, he decided to go to serve on a contract, not knowing at the time what service in the army was like. A representative of the 79th Airborne Assault Brigade offered two vacant positions for selection - a scout and a sniper. A sniper sounds cooler, it sounds proud, so I decided to become a sniper, says the soldier. The first visit of -Zuba- to the OOS zone was in 2020 to Maryinka district - half a year before the silence regime was introduced. A year after returning from Maryinka, the district of Stanytsia Luhanska and Shchastya was included in the second rotation. There, at the end of the rotation, the sniper met a large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. After several injuries, including a serious one, the soldier was transferred to the position of an instructor at the sniper school at the 199 training center of the DSHV, where he has been serving for almost a year - since February 2024. The sniper was not even interested in the possibility of leaving the service, because he wanted to continue protecting Ukraine from the Russian invasion. — As long as I'm alive and head-hands-legs are in place, I will serve. I love Ukraine, and although I don't like everything in our country, I am ready to fight for it. the Russians simply attacked, invaded, ruined our lives, ruined the lives of my relatives, friends, and relatives. So it's a matter of principle for me, he says. It is an honor to wear a military uniform and to be among fellow soldiers, to have respect among them, to give them and to receive support from them. Because oath and brotherhood in battle are extremely important. -Zub- says that during the large-scale invasion, the role of the front-line sniper changed a lot compared to the previous period of the war during the ATO/OOS. During the three years of the war, the sniper turned from a highly specialized fighter into a universal soldier. Before full-scale, a sniper is some kind of -semi-legendary figure- who works in a -detachment- from the main forces and no one knows what, where and how he does. A little like in the movies - your tasks, your subordination. Everything is its own, everything is separate. Now a sniper can go to war with a machine gun, and with a grenade launcher, if necessary. If he is near the positions that the enemy is storming and he understands that at that distance it is impractical to work with a rifle, then he will work with a machine gun, says the soldier. Now a sniper must be a universal soldier who cannot work exclusively with a sniper rifle, because during urban battles at short distances of 30-50 meters, an automatic rifle with a thermal imager is much more appropriate and effective. — At the beginning of the war, the first seven months, I didn't even know what a pit was. And many did not know what a pit was - especially those who worked in intelligence units, in sniper units. Arta was met simply: when flying, fell to the ground - and you are already safe, -Zub- explains. Instead, drones now — with skids and kamikaze — require reliable shelter and careful camouflage, and even that is far from always helping to escape them. — The buzz of a drone now feels scarier than the whistle of a falling mine. Because it is enough to fall on the ground from a mine - and 80% that you will not be affected. And with a drone - fall, don't fall, but if there is no shelter, then it is much more difficult to escape. And even if there is cover, the FPV can fly after you, says the sniper. Camouflage has also become significantly more difficult, because often drones are equipped with thermal imaging cameras, from which it is almost impossible to hide. — If earlier it was necessary to camouflage primarily from infantry, now everything has changed — first of all, it is necessary to camouflage from the sky, from drones. That's why we now teach cadets to take cover and camouflage from UAVs to the greatest extent, the instructor emphasizes. Enemy infantry, he says, are now virtually incapable of detecting a trained sniper and rarely attempt to do so. Instead, drones have become a major threat, so hiding from them is critical. — It is now better to spend more time learning to cloak from drones, aerial imagery, and thermal imaging drones than infantry. This is much more important now, because the enemy tries to detect snipers primarily using UAVs, says Zub. Suffering from enemy drones, the sniper is able to help his own drone operators, who cannot provide surveillance and reconnaissance due to difficult weather conditions - strong wind, high humidity, a significant drop in temperature. — In autumn and winter, with worsening weather conditions, the sniper's role as an observer increases, because these are eyes that can watch 24/7. The guys in the trenches can't look at the thermal imager or the -nightlight- continuously, every 5-7 minutes they give their eyes a rest. A sniper is trained not to take his eyes off the sight almost constantly, says the soldier. This allows you to carefully monitor the -gray zone-, because the lack of reliable round-the-clock and every-second surveillance is extremely important - according to the law of meanness, the enemy will try and be able to move unhindered precisely at the moment when no one will see him. It is impossible to start training for a sniper immediately after the BZVP, even with a very significant training target and high indicators of accuracy and accuracy of shooting - it is necessary to pass the selection at the next stage within the limits of separate training. — First of all, you need to take a marksmanship course. This is a 45-day basic course that trains infantry snipers, the entry level of sniping. -We try to take people to the basic or advanced level only after marksmanship courses,- says the instructor. Already after that, training begins for the basic and advanced level of sniping, during which specialists who work with large calibers at significant distances are trained. First of all, they teach night shooting from awkward positions, camouflage and interaction with UAVs. - Shooting - at least 3 times a week. We learn to shoot both at night and during the day, although with the start of a full-scale invasion and especially with the widespread use of drones, day work has lost its relevance. That's why we switch to night work - classes with thermal imaging cameras - how to shoot, where to shoot, how to work, how to adjust, how to install, says the instructor. The course of enhanced intensive training lasts 45 days and is mainly aimed at acquiring practical skills. Theoretical training is also available, but it is tried to be given at the same time as practical training during training, rather than spending time on separate long-term courses without a rifle in hands at the range. — It turns out that we show and explain how it works in practice, and from practice we go to theory. Often the theory written in books is for competition, for shooting in ideal conditions. -We are training a sniper for war,- Zub emphasizes. — We are trying to give the cadets as much shooting as possible from awkward positions, shooting under loads. Just lying down, let's shoot minimally, because it's very simple. We let them do it so that they -scored- their plates and understood how ballistics work. And then there are loads and awkward positions, explains the sniper. This is how preparation for real combat takes place, during which it is now very rare, almost never, to lie quietly with a rifle. — That is why we try to adapt the exercises described in the book in such a way as to adapt them to combat conditions as much as possible. Because the person we let out must be ready for the real conditions he will encounter on the front line, the instructor emphasizes. - The base course is a 308 caliber and an Archer thermal sight. Rifles, usually UAR-10 or Z-10. The increased level is already 338, 8.6 mm. And even higher is already 50 caliber, 12.7 mm. It's Barret and Cadex, says the sniper. Instructors undergo training in NATO countries - France, Britain, Norway, and then transfer knowledge and skills to cadets in Ukraine. However, -Zub- notes, foreigners also learn a lot from the Ukrainian experience. Ukrainian snipers already belong to the top world sniper league. Anyone who shows a high level and shows desire during the BZVP and marksmanship course can join their ranks after undergoing specialized training at the 199 training center of the DSHV.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/11/yak-potrapyty-do-vyshhoyi-snajperskoyi-svitovoyi-ligy-pro-marksmenskyj-kurs-ta-pryjomy-vid-dosvidchenyh-instruktoriv/	2025-01-10T21:13:09-08:00
Professionalism is not measured by age: which company is rearming sniper units of the US Army	The American publication We Are The Mighty, devoted to military topics and materials about military equipment, notes that such Thus, the history of the long process of procurement of new sniper rifles by the Ministry of Defense of the United States, which began in the early 2010s, is coming to an end. ArmyInform reports. The general contract with the Pentagon is for the Army's new sniper weapon system, the MK22 Adaptive Design Multi-Role Rifle. In turn, the official website of the development company Barrett Firearms Manufacturing Inc., late November -is proud to announce that the Marine Corps Systems Command has achieved full operational capability (FOC) to field the MRAD® MK 22 Mod 0 Advanced Sniper Rifle (ASR) one year ahead of schedule term-. -The MK 22 isn't just another rifle, it's a modular, mission-adaptive system that gives the warfighter unparalleled accuracy and flexibility,- said Brian James, Barrett CEO. -We are honored to contribute to this essential effort to modernize the U.S. Army and Marine Corps and to support our nation's elite forces.- The MK 22, according to its developers, offers unmatched versatility with caliber conversion kits that allow easy conversion between 7.62mm, .300 Norma Magnum and .338 Norma Magnum. This adaptability improves the ability to engage targets with accuracy at long ranges. Combined with the state-of-the-art M317 Precision Day Optic, a variable-power scope that calibrates 7-35x magnification, the MK 22 provides a significant leap in capabilities over legacy sniper systems. Barrett designed the MK 22 as a complete system that provides Soldiers with an integrated solution designed to create operational efficiencies. Each rifle kit includes three barrels, a hard and soft carrying case, 15 magazines, a set of cleaning tools and accessories, a silencer, an optic with a scope mount, and special components such as a sniper scout tripod kit and anti-glare. -The MK 22 combines what was previously two rifles into a single platform, easing the burden on the Marine Corps and improving logistics efficiency,- Mr James said. -The ability to change caliber in the field ensures that Marines are ready for any mission, anytime, anywhere.- Another important advantage of the MK 22 is its durability. Maintenance is simplified, most repairs will now be done at the organizational level. In the rare event of a barrel failure, the rifle can be quickly converted to a different caliber, providing continuous operational readiness, an improvement that was unattainable with previous systems. -At Barrett Firearms, we are committed to equipping our armed forces with the tools they need to succeed on the ever-changing battlefield,- said Brian James, Barrett CEO. -The advanced MK 22 Mod 0 sniper rifle exemplifies our commitment to precision, innovation and mission success. As the Marine Corps enters this new era of sniping capabilities, Barrett is ready to support their efforts and the future fight.- As the experts of the Dutch defense research portal Army Recognition told, the MK 22 Mod 0 sniper rifle was developed and manufactured by the American company Barrett, known for its high-precision long-range rifles. Barrett is well known in the market for the M82 .50 caliber sniper rifle, and the MK 22 continues their legacy of creating state-of-the-art sniper systems for military and law enforcement applications. The MK 22 Mod 0 is a large-caliber modular sniper rifle designed to engage targets at distances of 1,500 meters and beyond, meeting the growing need for long-range accuracy in a variety of operational environments. Despite the fact that Barrett Firearms is a young company by the standards of the arms world (it was founded in 1982), Barrett has already managed to make a name for itself as a manufacturer of quality small arms, optical devices and ammunition. The headquarters of the company is located in the state of Tennessee in the city of Murfreesboro. The main focus of the company's work for many years has been large-caliber sniper rifles. After completing the Full Operational Capability stage, the MK 22 Mod 0 ASR (Advanced Sniper Rifle) is now fully operational and available for use by Marine Corps sniper teams. The ongoing success of this program underscores the US Army's commitment to modernizing its equipment and equipping its military personnel with the best possible tools to succeed in any combat environment. As the US Marine Corps continues to improve its sniper capabilities, the MK 22 will become a cornerstone of its strategy to ensure long-range combat superiority. Emphasis will now shift to continuous training, maintenance and operational integration to ensure the MK 22 remains an effective and reliable asset for years to come. US Marines test the new MK 22 ASR bolt-action rifle.

Cash support in the Armed Forces: how much will be paid in 2025	For the year 2025, significant changes in the cash supply and various payments for military personnel are not foreseen for the most part. Unless, of course, changes are made during the year that will allow for increased payments to defenders. But there are those who are promised an increase in money - cadets of higher military educational institutions. How reported by the Ministry of Defense, this was stated by the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Serhii Melnyk at a meeting with cadets of the National Academy of Ground Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny: -As of March 2025, cadets of the 1st-2nd courses will receive payments at the level of the minimum wage in Ukraine, which is 8 thousand hryvnias. Taking into account that the salary will increase, the financial support will also increase in the corresponding ratio. Cadets of 3-4 courses, which are equivalent to contract service, will receive more than 20,000 hryvnias.- Currently, the minimum amount of financial support is 20,130 hryvnias for recruitment. And then everything depends on a very large number of factors: rank, position, seniority, etc. You can read in more detail about what the financial support consists of here. By the way, you can find out the amount of your allowance in just a few clicks. The Ministry of Defense introduced an online calculator /a>. It allows you to find out the amount of payments you should receive quite easily and quickly. You only need to know your rank, length of service and tariff class (you can find it out from the financiers of the military unit). Currently, -combat- pay is the largest financial source for many members of the military. Depending on the place of service and the tasks performed, the Ukrainian military can additionally receive 30, 50 and 100 thousand hryvnias. In addition, there is an additional payment of 70 thousand hryvnias for those who are on the front lines. 100,000 is given to servicemen who are directly participating in hostilities at forward positions, in occupied territory, or between the positions of the Defense Forces and the enemy. This reward is also given to those who carry out fire damage tasks - these are rocket launchers, gunners and anti-aircraft units. Of course, they are not directly on the conflict line. But their time working against the enemy is also counted towards the payment of the 100 thousand reward. 50 thousand are paid to those who perform combat (special) tasks as part of military administration bodies, headquarters and command, which carry out operational management of units. Including outside the areas of hostilities. 30 thousand are received by servicemen who perform combat (special) tasks in accordance with combat orders. In particular: Also, 30,000 gratuities should be paid to those engaged in demining (outside the areas of hostilities) and anti-aircraft cover and ground defense of critical infrastructure facilities. It should be taken into account that such a reward is paid in proportion to the time spent on the front line or the performance of combat missions. On average, a little more than 3 thousand hryvnias per day. For example, if you spent 10 days on the front line, the payment will be a little more than 30 thousand hryvnias. 70 thousand is intended for those who directly perform combat or special tasks on the front line with the enemy or in his rear. This surcharge does not replace -combatants-, but is in addition to them. But it works on a storage system. That is, this money should be paid only after a total of 30 days have passed on the front line. It can be for several months. This is a one-time benefit for servicemen signing their first contract with the Armed Forces. The amount of the benefit depends on the subsistence minimum for able-bodied persons, which is approved every year in the state budget, as of January 1. In 2025, it is UAH 3,028.00. So now, after concluding a contract, you can get: This payment is provided for the military: To get help, you need to write a report in the name of the commander. This is not a complete list of additional benefits that a serviceman can receive. Some of them, for example, regarding sublease or assistance for solving social and household issues, depend on the decision of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine. After all, the order of payments is determined for each year. As soon as the order for 2025 becomes known, ArmiyaInform will immediately report about it.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/11/groshove-zabezpechennya-v-zsu-skilky-platyat-u-2025-roczi/	2025-01-10T20:48:55-08:00
Intergalactic mercenaries on the side of the Armed Forces: another fantasy from the Kremlin kitchen	According to the Kremlin fantasists, these -mercenaries- are not only part of the Ukrainian army, but also plan to attack peaceful Russian citizens, disguising themselves in Russian military uniforms. Why not add flying saucers to it, or at least spies in the form of crows? It would be no less plausible. This entire narrative is a common attempt by Russian propaganda to explain its failures in its own border zone. The only real -threat- in the Kursk region is panic, which Moscow itself creates. Ukraine defends its territories and does not need to invent provocations or look for -mercenaries-. it is beneficial for Russian propaganda to paint the image of an -external enemy- that intimidates Russians and justifies the further militarization of society. Foreign mercenaries are a favorite subject that plays on people's imaginations. After all, how else to explain that the Kremlin will lose the war to Ukraine? This story about foreign mercenaries is another proof that propaganda in Russia works according to the principle: -It doesn't matter if there is logic, the main thing is to sound scary.- Meanwhile, the world is just wondering how deep this morass of absurdity can be.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/11/mizhgalaktychni-najmanczi-na-boczi-zsu-chergova-fantaziya-z-kremlivskoyi-kuhni/	2025-01-10T20:20:12-08:00

According to the officer, although the ammunition comes directly from North Korean factories and is -fresh-, it does not meet modern quality standards. Special remarks concern powder charges, which often have defects. -The North Korean ammunition currently used by the Russian Federation has low-quality powder charges and components. We have seen cases where shells have broken in the bore due to manufacturing defects. Such situations have already happened with the Soviet D-30 howitzers. If these defects are repeated with the North Keres self-propelled guns, it will only be better for us,- the representative of the Armed Forces noted.

About it on the air of the telethon -The only news- said the officer of the intelligence department of the brigade of NSU -Rubizh- Hero of Ukraine Vitaly Lytvyn. According to him, the Russians are actively using aerial strikes with guided aerial bombs (CABs), and the selective use of these bombs is a clear confirmation of the aggressor's intention to destroy civilian objects. -We are not observing serious strikes on military positions, on the contrary, the Russians are mercilessly destroying civilian infrastructure, in particular energy networks,- Lytvyn said. The destruction of energy facilities has become a serious problem for local residents. By the end of 2024, almost 90% of Pokrovsk's energy infrastructure was destroyed. This not only made life difficult for civilians, but also became part of the terror strategy. According to Lytvyn, at the end of 2024, the destruction of about 70 civilian buildings was recorded, which underlines the scale and systematic nature of this terror.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/vshhent-rosijski-vijskovi-rujnuyut-czyvilnu-infrastrukturu-pokrovska-za-dopomogoyu-kabiv/	2025-01-10T11:58:46-08:00
From armored vehicles to ATVs: how the weather changes the tactics of the Russians	He told about it on armyTV stream officer of the information and communication service of the 14th operational brigade named after Ivan Bohuna NSU -Chervona Kalyna- Maksym Bakulin. According to him, difficult weather conditions force the enemy to change their approach to combat operations, giving preference to mobile transport. -Today, the enemy does not use a single tactic. They use various means to carry out assaults. Most often, these are quadricycles or high-terrain vehicles, because heavy equipment or armored vehicles cannot overcome difficult terrain, especially swampy areas, due to weather conditions,- the officer noted. As Maxim Bakulin explained, the main assaults take place during the day, and the enemy uses the night time for preparation and planning. -The enemy mostly operates during the day, because now the day is shorter than the night. At night, they conduct preparations for assaults: reconnaissance of the area, reconnaissance and planning of attacks. Assaults are carried out in groups of up to 10 people,- Maxim Bakulin added.

If he used it not so actively before, then yesterday and today he uses it in large quantities and over a long distance. Today I noticed a range of more than 15 and up to 20 kilometers. They usually carry not very heavy ammunition, but fly very far,- said Roman Rudenko. As for the personnel of the Russians, it consists mostly of recruits. -There were prisoners who managed to serve less than a month.

And this is understandable, because we lose more than everyone, especially people. But before agreeing on something, it is very important that these are serious security guarantees for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe,- the president emphasized. According to him, such guarantees should make it impossible to repeat aggression on the part of Russia, as it happened after the occupation of Crimea in 2014 and subsequent events in 2015. During the interview, Zelenskyi also noted the importance of Italy's support for Ukraine and emphasized the need to maintain European unity in the fight against Russian aggression.

$300 per head — in Odesa, a border guard cut a hole for evaders to Europe	The State Bureau of Investigation reported this on January 10. SBU employees, in cooperation with the SBU and the State Border Service, exposed a law enforcement officer who organized money on the passage of men of conscription age through the transit section of the road with the Republic of Moldova. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine, the transit section of the Odesa-Reni road, which passes through the territory of Moldova, has been subject to regime restrictions. In particular, the control bodies must inform the TCC about men who are subject to mobilization and try to pass the checkpoint without registration documents. In December 2024, one of the law enforcement officers decided to make a little money from the unimpeded passage of conscripts and offered a businessman he knew to transport willing men under the guise of -goods-. For the passage of such a -transit taxi- he asked to pay him $300 per passenger. According to operational data, he could let dozens of people through the post. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/po-300-za-golovu-na-odeshhyni-prykordonnyk-prorubav-dlya-uhylyantiv-shparynu-do-yevropy/	2025-01-10T11:03:50-08:00

According to Volodymyr Zelenskyi, these measures significantly affect the financial basis of the Russian military machine, because they block key elements of the supply chain. Russian energy companies, insurance organizations, service providers in the oil and gas industry, 184 tankers of the -shadow fleet-, as well as logistics facilities and companies from third countries were sanctioned. -It is especially worth noting the pressure on companies such as Surgutnaftogaz, which is a key financial source for the Putin regime,- Volodymr Zelenskyi emphasized. The head of state emphasized that such steps send a clear signal: criminals should be held accountable for their actions. The less income Russia receives from oil and energy resources, the sooner peace will come. The president also noted that energy resources should not be used as a weapon, as the Russian Federation does. He called on countries that respect international law to ensure a stable and reliable energy supply for the world. -We are sincerely grateful for America's leadership in holding Russia accountable. I am sure that these steps will significantly reduce oil revenues, and with it Russia's ability to continue aggression,- concluded Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Medic -Norman-: six destroyed enemies and 16 days of steadfast defense	His heroic story was shared on its Facebook page by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine . -Norman- is a 48-year-old combat medic of a mechanized platoon who, together with three brothers, stopped the enemy's attempts to advance deep into Ukrainian positions for 16 days. As -Norman- tells, in the composition of four fighters, they occupied two observation points that were located close to each other. -Norman- divided his men in such a way that the experienced fighters were in the front post and the younger ones were in the rear. An important element of their success was a competent position, thanks to which they became almost invisible to enemy UAVs. -Thanks to our competent position, we were practically invisible to enemy -birds-, so the enemy, coming to our positions, practically did not see us,- he notes. Considering the situation, -Norman- decided to use the available weapons in order to stop the enemy. Three cluster mines were initially planted, and one of them stopped three Russian soldiers. After that, using grenades, -Norman- destroyed three more occupiers. -We let them get as close as possible and destroyed them&#8230; The main thing is to prepare the guys, to give them an understanding of who and what to do, to tell what everyone's actions are if the enemy approaches from one side or the other. When people understand what they need to do and what to expect, then they are more confident and calm,- he explains. His calm expression and confidence help to maintain the morale of his subordinates. -I don't know, it somehow works out that way. The fighters see me, my calm expression on their faces, and, probably, they are also less nervous. Even if I'm nervous or tense, it doesn't show in any way, so the fighters feel a certain confidence in me. I don't have any other explanations,- adds the military man.From anticipation of war to the front line: how -Matroskin- became a machine gunner	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/medyk-norman-shist-znyshhenyh-vorogiv-ta-16-dniv-nepohytnoyi-oborony/	2025-01-10T09:19:24-08:00

Russians are massively looking for their missing soldiers: the Ukrainian project received 52,000 req...	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. This figure does not include the dead and is 2-3 times less than the total number of missing Russians, because not all relatives turn to the Ukrainian project. The Russian authorities are trying in every possible way to hide information about the losses that the Russian army is suffering in the attempt to occupy Ukraine. The topic of missing, captured and dead occupiers is taboo in Russia. &nbsp; Using the information provided within the framework of the project, Russians get the opportunity to confirm the status of prisoners of war or the dead and to request exchanges from the Russian authorities. In 2024, information was provided about 1,570 Russian soldiers being held captive in Ukraine, of which 397 were exchanged for the Defenders of Ukraine. The statistics of appeals to the -I want to find- project show the increase in losses of the aggressor's army in Ukraine. The majority of applications relate to those missing in 2024, with 29,472 occupants. The largest number of invaders disappeared in the fields and plantations of Donetsk region — 19,025 occupiers, in particular in Pokrovsky (8,597) and Bakhmutsky (5,164) districts. Another 3,069 occupiers disappeared on the territory of Russia, mainly in the Kursk region. 63% of the missing are young men aged 17-39. Among the 20 units of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, which lead the lists in terms of the number of missing persons, 8 are staffed by illegally mobilized people in the ORDLO (-people's republics-). The Russian military leadership uses these units as -cannon fodder- and does not pay attention to the loss of personnel. 73% of Russians who contacted the -I want to find- project said that they do not support Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It seems that only after losing their loved ones, Russians begin to realize the real cost of the bloody war unleashed by their country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/rosiyany-masovo-shukayut-svoyih-znyklyh-bezvisty-vijskovyh-ukrayinskyj-proyekt-otrymav-52-tysyachi-zapytiv-za-2024-rik/	2025-01-10T06:26:49-08:00

-The earth was burning under his feet-: a soldier of the Armed Forces of Ukraine held off the Russia...	His heroic story was shared by on your page on the Facebook social network of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to the soldier, in the hottest periods, his unit had to repulse up to 15 enemy assaults a day, and even under conditions of constant shelling. -They started when we just got the boats to the shore. The ground was on fire under our feet in a literal sense. Immediately something exploded in front of our boat, we miraculously survived. That, it turned out, was only the beginning of hell. We were able to gain a foothold and repulsed Russian attacks around the clock,- the soldier recalls. And this happened for almost three months, until Dmytro and his comrades began to leave after the losses, but their evacuation actually failed in the end, as a result of which he was left alone on the shore with a serious wound. However, despite this, the Ukrainian marine managed to do the almost impossible, namely, to swim across the Konka River with a broken leg, and after that, to walk almost 2 km to get to his friends. -The current in the river, although it was narrow, was simply furious. I went in at one place, and went to the shore 200 meters from it. Crossed the river twice - there is an island between its arms. Then he walked through the swamps, leaning on a stick. Before that, I studied the map on -Kropyva- in detail, memorized everything, so it was as if it was in front of my eyes all the time. It took me a day and a half to reach our positions,- Dmytro said.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/zemlya-gorila-pid-nogamy-boyecz-zsu-88-dniv-strymuvav-z-pobratymamy-navalu-rosiyan-u-krynkah/	2025-01-10T01:48:13-08:00

Genocide of the occupiers, -secret laboratories- for -fpvishok- and printing parts for a drone on a ...	The Royal Brigade is defending one of the strategic cities in Donbass - Chasiv Yar. For more than half a year, the brigade has been destroying the occupiers and preventing the enemy from advancing. The enemy suffers colossal losses in manpower and equipment. ArmyInform asked Vyacheslav about how it is possible to deter raiders in battles in urban areas, why FPV drones have become -ambulance- on the battlefield for our infantrymen, about the work of the -secret laboratory- of maintenance of -fpvishok- and how much time requires a 3D printer to print one part for the drone. The city of Chasiv Yar is located on the heights. The occupiers really want to capture it, because it is actually the gate to Kostyantynivka, Druzhkivka and Kramatorsk. The Russian offensive on the city began back in April 2024, the 24th Brigade arrived here to replace units of the Defense Forces in June. The strategic advantage of our forces here is the channel, which makes it difficult for the enemy to move and use armored vehicles. However, the city is constantly under enemy fire: anti-aircraft missiles and constant artillery fire. the Russians are trying to cross the channel and advance in the city itself. In some areas of the city, there are heavy urban battles. -The main concept of functioning of our unit? We are organizing a local genocide of Russians in our direction. Our daily tasks are to make the world less dirty and cleaner. Fighting our defenders from the Royal Brigade is the Russian 98th Airborne Division plus attached units. Racist paratroopers are not some fools, not a bunch of mobs from the -DNR-, -LNR- or the Siberian hinterland. They know how to fight, there is nothing disorganized or chaotic, their offensive actions are thought out. But people do not mean anything to the Kremlin, the Rashists die en masse and this does not stop them for a single day. Currently, there are no significant changes in the tactics of the enemy. As before, the occupiers are betting on manpower, small assault groups. They try to cross the Siverskyi Donetsk-Donbas channel, accumulate in broken houses and basements, and then try to attack. This is a brief description of the enemy's actions. We stop enemy attacks with kamikaze drones and drops from FPV drones and Maviks. We cut the occupiers, wherever they are hiding. Our drones are always in the air. the Rashists, as they enter in small assault groups of 5-6 people, immediately disperse, run to basements, broken houses and sit. We use drones to -smoke- them out of hiding places. If it is not possible to get the Russian army out into the fresh air, we attach a powerful reset and hide the enemy under concrete slabs forever. Lately, this is what we do regularly, so as not to fly after each individual rashist, we -ground- them all together in the basements. And we destroy the enemy, and he will no longer use the shelter to entrench himself in the area. The main thing during combat missions is interaction with reconnaissance UAVs, strict adherence to the orders of the command, which determines the priority of targets and gives the go-ahead for use. In fact, FPV drones have become an -ambulance- for our front-line infantrymen. If the enemy did not reach our positions, then the task was completed perfectly. Once, during the occupier raid, two rioters ran into the basement of an apartment building. Our -fpvishka- flew there immediately and as many as eight Russians ran out. We were in shock. So, on that day, I remember, we caught these -paratrooper rats- hiding in the holes all over the city for more than three hours. They put everyone together. Ideally, how combat work should go: one drone - one sortie - one destroyed occupier. But it doesn't always work out that way. Sometimes more drones go to the same target. Depending on the nature of the terrain, weather conditions, pilot accuracy. Somewhere, the enemy may have been -silenced- or the radio horizon does not allow lowering, or they simply missed the target, something else, different things happen. How we work: a drone is attached to a reset system - it's a bomber. We have an FPV-kamikaze that did not catch a reset. Accordingly, the reset systems are very different, there are many variations. Incendiary substances, cumulative, fragmentation, high-explosive, thermobaric, in the word -love-dove-. Of course, in an urbanized area, we use fragmentation ammunition less, but they are always ready. There is a certain amount of cumulative ammunition in case enemy vehicles go on an assault. Russians also learn, they understand that during the day it is better not to use equipment, even with electronic devices, because sooner or later it will be -unwinded-. The enemy uses it during bad weather conditions, for example, when there is low cloud cover and a plus in the morning -in gray-. Armored vehicles jump in just to land a landing party and immediately run away. But it is quite often blown up on our mines.- The collection, maintenance, retrofitting and testing facility for FPV drones supplied to Royal Brigade units is hidden away from the front line. The boys jokingly refer to it as the -secret lab-. In fact, this place is a -fat- target for the enemy. From the outside, you'll never know what's hidden inside. Large room, multiple workstations, laptops, inspection and repair equipment, 3D printers, drone storage, staff rest beds. Work is also boiling in another room. Literally every meter of the -laboratory- is sharpened for working with drones. CCTV cameras are working so that no one from outside can enter the territory. Maintaining secrecy is important to the unit today. The guys are all in civilian clothes. The vast majority of military personnel are from Western Ukrainian regions. This is also, obviously, a brigade from Lviv Oblast. -FPV drones come to us both through government funds and through volunteer support. Almost all of them come in raw, to say the least. Before sending them to perform combat missions, it is necessary to -trust- them to a combat-ready state. The secrets to a long FPV drone life: careful maintenance and replacement of parts to ensure their reliability and durability. We check the integrity of the drone, inspect each component in detail to make sure there are no damages or weak points. These are the hull, propellers, electronics, engine and mountings. Quite often, -fpvishki- come with low-quality parts, especially the mounts for the camera, antennas and other important elements. Then -flashing- the electronic system, checking the signals from the radio system. Where it is necessary to replace the batteries, the duration of the flight depends on it. The greater the weight of the resets, the more capacious and more powerful the battery should be. Maintenance of motors and propellers is self-evident, everything is important here - noise, vibration. If the camera is weak, we change it, the same applies to the video transmitter. In general, the application of an FPV drone is a rather complicated system. This is the work of repeaters, ground stations plus remote controls, glasses. Everything must be collected and tested. Testing is carried out on a training ground. Our -lab- masters are all able to fly drones. To feel its work with your fingers. In fact, they check the maneuverability of the drone, its stabilization, how it performs at a long distance and other parameters. The FPV drone must show its best performance before sending it to combat. A priori, he must be combat-ready. This is an axiom. If there are defects, the guys find out the causes of the problems and further test them. Until it's ok. Work without days off, around the clock. Combat units for -fpvishka- are prepared in another place. Depending on the combat mission and its complexity, we prepare a certain number of FPV drones for combat sorties. Guys go to the position with a certain margin. If more is needed, we promptly deliver drones to the positions. There should always be plenty of them. It cannot be that there are few of them. Capable and abundant drones help save the lives of our infantry on the front lines. 3D printing makes almost everything for FPV drones. Parts, some fasteners, covers, different shapes, even a case for ammunition can be made. That is, it is cheap and very fast, which is the main thing. Anyone can make it themselves, you don't need to be a great specialist to learn how to work on a 3D printer. The software is launched, we draw the desired part, pour it onto the printer itself, and printing begins. For example, one mount for a video camera is printed in about 3 hours, of course, something simpler takes less time. We have plenty of plastic for printing parts. The printer works non-stop, 24/7. Honestly, I don't know how we lived without it, without a 3D printer. By the way, we also print the details on the -maviks- here. Fortunately, we have a guy who, before the Great War, was an architect in civilian life. Tyamushchy, -cuts- details on a printer like a chef ingredients for his dishes in an expensive restaurant. We are at war with the Russians, there are a lot of them. Russia presses and advances every day. Therefore, we will always lack people. More FPV drone operators and pilots are needed to destroy Russia. We must stop them and destroy them. Accordingly, as many people as possible are needed to prepare the drones for battle. We have guys with completely different specialties serving here. Humanitarians, teachers, journalists, builders, citizens of Aitiv, ordinary workers. All are self-taught, no one taught us how to hold a soldering iron in our hands. Only two of our -civilian- unit repaired computer equipment. Join the Ukrainian army. Now it is possible to independently choose a place of service, a specific division and a position, even without the participation of the TCC, if someone is afraid. Ukraine must be defended now, you cannot just sit at home and wait for Muscovites to come to your home. Our military part belongs to the list of priority equipment parts, so there should be no problems. There are recruiting centers where they will help you and the candidate will receive up-to-date information on available vacancies. By the way, the recruiting center of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo operates at the address: Lviv, st. Osmomysla, 9.

The actor from the series -Dilnychiy from the DVRZ- commands a platoon at the front: the story of Ju...	Before the large-scale invasion, Ihor was known to Ukrainians thanks to many films and series, in particular, -Dilnichiy z DVRZ-, where he played one of the roles. How is the Ukrainian actor doing now? Did previous production experience help in the army? But what should he say to the men who have not yet joined the Armed Forces? The junior sergeant told our correspondents about this: -I have two higher educations: one is acting, the other is economic, -Theatrical Business Organization.- It so happened that two of them helped me in the army at the same time. Because now I am acting as a platoon leader, and my organizational skills have turned out to be useful. I worked at the Kyiv Academic Theater of the Young Spectator in Lypki. By the way, the director Artur Artemenyev is there and he is also fighting now. But even on vacation, he tries to come and stage and rehearse plays. Asked me if I was ready to play. I think not yet, I cannot jump over this barrier and quickly return to civilian life. By the way, many actors from the theater have already been drafted into the army. Yes, I am known for my roles in the films -Iron Hundred-, -Mom, I love the pilot-, -District from the DVRZ-&#8230; In general, if you look at my filmography, some of my roles are military. For example, in the tape -Khalep for 5 bucks- I play a military man who was in the ATO. But when you see all this not on the set, but in real life, then, you know, in the war, everything is completely different, the other truth of life is cruel. I joined TCC in 2022. About two or three months after the beginning of the large-scale invasion, he was engaged in volunteering. Well, then I already said to myself: I can't be here, I must be there, because my duty as a citizen of Ukraine is to protect. After Buchi and Gostomel and many occupied cities, I felt that I should be there, with my brothers. My family accepted and supported my decision. Was trained in Britain. They really cooked well there. At least people do not get lost in a stressful situation after such training. The more you know and are able to do, the more chances you have to survive. When he got to the 21st separate battalion, at first they performed tasks in the Kyiv region. Then we moved to the Bakhmut direction. When commanding people, in my opinion, humanity should come first. You have to carry out combat orders, combat orders and always think about how to save personnel. But you must also have a core. Of the places where our platoon visited, the most difficult, perhaps, were in Klishchiivka, Vesely, Krasnohorivka. Although in fact it is difficult everywhere. We have enemy assaults almost 24 hours a day. Lots of drops, lots of drones, fiber optic drones. And here in civilian life you see: one is walking, the other is afraid, the other is at the border. The Great Abyss&#8230; If I had the opportunity to address the men who still live in rose-colored glasses and cling to women's skirts, I would tell them that they should understand who is behind their backs. Do I need to be reminded of this? You have to be ready to walk this path. If we don't do it, no one will do it for us. Otherwise, we will be destroyed, or the enemy will force us to fight for him. If the occupiers come, they will bring you to your knees, kill your wife and children. Because the present enemy is cruel. Therefore, civilian men should at least think about their families. This should be their main motivation. It is necessary to go to the army in order to restrain the enemy and in order for us to live normally in the future, raise children and grandchildren, work, talk and breathe freely in our country. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/aktor-z-serialu-dilnychyj-z-dvrz-komanduye-vzvodom-na-fronti-istoriya-molodshogo-serzhanta-igorya-pisnogo/	2025-01-09T20:33:22-08:00
Fragile killer -Shakhediv-: what is known about the anti-aircraft missiles that Ukraine will receive...	How reported ArmyInform, this was discussed at the beginning of November 2024 at a meeting in Kyiv of the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General Anatoly Klochka with by the management of the specified company. By data of the official Frankenburg portal, this defense firm from Tallinn aims to revolutionize the guidance systems in specialized weapons. The Mark 1 missile uses an AI-based situational awareness program. Frankenburg Technologies General Director Kusti Salm calls this technology reliable, and its testing in Ukraine should begin in 2025. According to him, everything is ready for testing, and the developed technology has attracted wide attention of representatives of the specialized market. -The technology is very reliable, and we will start testing it in Ukraine this year,- said Kusti Salm, which cited by Estonian news portal ERR.ee. According to the rocket builder, the project is already ready for testing. Probably based on the principles of military-commercial secrecy, this Baltic company does not reveal any details about their product. On the manufacturer's website, it is only stated that the mission of the Estonian gunsmiths is to -equip the free world with the technologies necessary to win the war-. Meanwhile, Bloomberg authors highlighted the Frankenburg company among the four leading European high-tech start-ups in the defense industry. -Estonian company with a simple motto - &#8220;Technology will win in war&#8221; — produces cheap missiles to shoot down drones that use software to accurately hit targets,- Bloomberg notes. According to Kusti Salma, a possible ceasefire in Ukraine will not reduce the demand for new weapons. > -There will be a new and much larger war in Europe,- he predicted gloomily in a conversation with Bloomberg reporters. In turn, analysts of the research portal According to information from open sources, the ICC Defense Express (DE) made quite meaningful conclusions about this product. The publication notes that the specific characteristics of the Mark 1 anti-aircraft missile have not been published. But an official image posted on the company's website gave them a hint. -Obviously, we are talking about a very small anti-aircraft missile, perhaps with a total length of about 0.5 meters. And this is really the only possible option to mass-produce such means,- DE experts state. That is why, according to them, the photo below is obviously a full-size mockup of this anti-aircraft missile, which received other aerodynamic surfaces. span> After all, according to the researchers from IKK Defense Express, the task of the Mark 1 is to intercept drones, and therefore it is quite logical to use a comparable means. -Because objectively, of course, it is possible to hit Shahed with 7-meter missiles from the S-300, but it is orders of magnitude more profitable - with much cheaper means, if they demonstrate the appropriate effectiveness,- DE emphasizes. According to the vision of the weapon under study, the publication's experts believe that considering everything in Frankenburg Technologies made a number of absolutely correct conceptual decisions. -Based on the given description, for example, (Estonians, ed.) could use a camera and &#8220;machine vision&#8221; as a homing head. with auto-detection and auto-targeting. And such a solution is orders of magnitude cheaper than any other option with a radar, infrared, or even semi-active laser guidance system,- DE believes. there is a radio command solution, when only control signals are transmitted to the missile itself, and the ground station takes over all calculations with the missile and target alignment in space. -The small size of the rocket immediately means that its creation requires many times less solid fuel and other materials. But there remains the question of the range, height and power of the warhead,- DE emphasizes. At the same time, they tentatively took the Stinger missile as a guide: with a length of 1.5 meters, it has a range of up to 6 km, a height of up to 3.5 km, and the weight of the warhead is 2.3 kg. -If Mk 1 from Frankenburg Technologies is three times smaller, then it is possible to expect approximate parameters to 2 km in range, up to 1 km in height and a warhead weighing about 0.5 kg. That is, it is quite sufficient for the destruction of drones, which is what the entire development concept is based on,- the experts of the IKK Defense Express portal summarized their conclusions.

Protests that did not exist: the factory of fakes of the Russian Federation created a new fact about...	This time, the Russian media decided to -hint- to Ukrainians that they themselves allegedly do not like their own struggle for freedom. According to the scenario of the propagandists, a wave of mass protests against mobilization and the continuation of hostilities swept across Ukrainian cities. Of course, there were no such protests. But when was propaganda about the truth? Russian media said war-weary Ukrainians took to the streets to demand an end to mobilization and talks with Russia. Fake videos circulated on Telegram channels purportedly show crowds with placards shouting anti-war slogans. This -information piece- was supplemented with classic elements: The first and main proof that this event did not happen is the complete absence of mentions in independent media or even Ukrainian social networks. The modern world leaves no chance to hide large-scale rallies, no matter how much some government wants it. The second proof is the absurdity of the idea itself. Ukrainians know what they are fighting for. Even in the most difficult moments of the war, society continues to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine. There are simply no prerequisites for such protests. This fake has several functions: We are all well aware that Russian propaganda has long since turned into a theater of the absurd, where fiction and manipulation play the main roles. But every such fake can and should be exposed. Ukraine is fighting not only for its territory, but also for the truth. And every exposed fake is another victory in this war. Therefore, the next time you see the -news- about Ukrainians protesting against themselves, remember: this is another scene from a Russian drama that has nothing to do with real life.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/protesty-yakyh-ne-bulo-fabryka-fejkiv-rf-stvoryla-novyj-fakt-pro-ukrayinu/	2025-01-09T20:01:06-08:00
Our prisoners were tortured - three jailers-traitors from Horlivka were informed of the suspicion	This was announced by the Security Service of Ukraine on January 9. The extras are three residents of the region: Andriy Kononenko, Dmytro Andreev and Artem Karyanov, who at the beginning of the full-scale war joined the occupation -department for the execution of punishments for the DNR-. There they were appointed guards of the Russian torture chamber, which the Rashists had set up on the basis of the captured correctional colony No. 27 in Horlivka. In the torture chamber, they organized so-called -receptions-, when during the first day of imprisonment Ukrainian prisoners were beaten to death with special PR-73 batons. According to the military counterintelligence of the SBU, in this way the Rashists immediately tried to psychologically break the victims and -beat- their consent to cooperation with the Russian Federation. In case of refusal, the perpetrators imprisoned the prisoners in solitary confinement or overcrowded cells, where they were left standing for a long time, without food and water. Another form of torture used by the perpetrators was an imitation of a -shooting- with firearms, when the victims were placed against a wall and shot next to them. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed Andreyev, Karyanov and Kononenko in absentia about the suspicion under part. 2 Art. 28, ch. 1 Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (war crimes committed by a group of persons based on a prior conspiracy). Since the perpetrators are in the temporarily occupied part of the territory of Donetsk region, comprehensive measures are being taken to find them and punish them. As reported by ArmyInform, law enforcement officers detained a couple suspected of involvement in the terrorist attack near the administrative building of the TCC in Dnipro.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/katuvaly-nashyh-polonenyh-povidomleno-pro-pidozru-3-tyuremnykam-zradnykam-z-gorlivky/	2025-01-09T11:58:22-08:00

Rustem Umyerov also thanked the Netherlands for significant and consistent assistance to the Ukrainian military. -This partnership has already significantly strengthened Ukraine's defense capabilities, and we are working to develop it further. The key topic of the meeting was the direction of investments in joint defense projects,- he noted. According to him, a particularly important direction is the production of long-range drones. They discussed in detail how to make this process as efficient as possible and analyzed the best direct financing mechanisms. The possibility of using revenues from frozen Russian assets to support the production of spare parts for drones was also considered. According to the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, this can become an effective tool for increasing Ukraine's defense capabilities. -Another key topic of the talks is strengthening our air defenses. The Netherlands will soon provide assistance that will significantly strengthen our defense of the sky. Grateful for the support, initiative and consistency,- he summed up.

Russian attack aircraft were coming, and then they flew away - the sniper work of our gunners	The video of the defeat was published on January 9 on the brigade's channel. The occupiers were moving along the road without observing distances, so the shell that exploded just inside the group had a great killing power. When the drone arrived at the site, it recorded the abandoned bodies of the dead. Another part could be torn apart by an explosion, and someone could later die from injuries. As reported by ArmyInform, the situation in the Pokrovsky direction remains tense due to significant concentration of enemy infantry, which is carried on motorcycles. This was reported by the head of the communications department of the 117th heavy mechanized brigade, Lieutenant Yuliya Stepaniuk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/rosijski-shturmovyky-ishly-a-potim-rozletilysya-snajperska-robota-nashyh-artylerystiv/	2025-01-09T11:41:24-08:00
The Defense Forces explained why the Russians began to use less equipment and small assault groups	On January 9, deputy told the commander of the battalion of the 68th separate hunting brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush -The Italian-. -Now the advance of small groups of the enemy is slower. Weather conditions will play into our hands a little. As long as the enemy does not use either light armored or heavy equipment. We are talking now about an infantry advance, about an infantry effort to storm our positions,- he said. According to him, the enemy has recently started shelling Ukrainian positions more with artillery. He is looking for our firemen and begins to have a little nightmare. Here they became more active. And the heavy bombardment intensified,- he noted. The -Italian- noted that there was fog for most of the day, so the enemy began to use artillery more. -It is very difficult to work with drones. And due to the fact that they have more ammunition, it seems to me that they like to shoot at random, like artillery training,- he explained. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Pokrovsky direction the enemy 31 times /->started collisions of varying intensity. Our defenders repelled 20 enemy attacks in the areas of the settlements of Baranivka, Myrolyubivka, Elizavetivka, Promin, Lysivka, Zelene, Zvirove, Novy Trud, Pokrovsk, Kotlyne, Uspenivka, Novovasylivka, and Novoelizavetivka.

Drivers and doctors - what kind of specialists is the top division of the HUR looking for?	published answers to common questions about service in military intelligence on its social media pages. subdivision of GUR MOU -Artan-. In particular, the post refers to the salary and material support of intelligence officers. -Salaries are calculated according to a separate tariff grid. It can reach 200 thousand. per month: depending on the tasks and duration of stay in the area of ​​execution of the combat order,- the post says. The unit also provides personnel with food, medical aid, ammunition and transport for the period of stay in the district. At the same time, the intelligence representatives emphasized that most of the positions in -Artan- are combat positions. Therefore, the unit created an effective system of rotations of the military, so that people could restore strength after completing tasks. -We compensate the load on the military with regular rotations: after each task. This year, the unit has grown across the state. Additional positions of driver mechanics, medics, and engineers have appeared,- the department's page reports. Separately, the special officers commented on the current topic regarding the possibility of transfers. According to the published post, it is currently easier for civilians who wish to serve in intelligence to immediately mobilize to Artan than to later look for ways to transfer to GUR from the Armed Forces. The main difficulty lies in the different subordination of structures, so the procedure can be extremely long. Earlier, the officer of -Artana- with the call sign Favorite congratulated Ukrainians on the New Year and summed up the year 2024. According to him, during the year, the unit has grown many times over, and it has also been possible to significantly improve the system of intelligence support for planning operations.

Independent Supervisory Boards were also established in both agencies, most of whose members were chosen by recruiting companies as a result of open tenders. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense responded to criticism regarding changes to the charters of procurement agencies.

The aggressor uses its research fleet for sabotage against NATO countries — the SZR	About this reported on January 9 the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. We are talking about the Baltic, Barents and North Seas, as well as the world ocean as a whole. The capabilities and threats posed by Russian research vessels are being explored on the University of Texas platform. At first glance, the study of the world ocean is a peaceful field of activity, but in the execution of the Russian Federation it poses many risks for the modern world. Experts from the University of Texas recall the recent incident in the Irish Sea with the research vessel -Amber-, which was intercepted by the Irish Navy while deploying a UAV in the area of ​​vital underwater power and internet cables. Russia has been using hydrographic vessels for reconnaissance and sabotage against the underwater infrastructure of NATO and EU members for decades. They are taken care of by the -research fleet- of the Department of Navigation and Oceanography together with a unit of the Ministry of Defense of Russia called the -Main Directorate of Deep Sea Research-. In particular, the latter has at its disposal the special-purpose nuclear submarines BS-64 -Podmoskovye- and BS-136 -Orenburg-, research vessels -Yantar- and -Almaz-. The Russian Navy also has numerous hydrographic vessels designed for sea, river and lake surveys and pilotage work, catamarans and boats, which are often used with a dual purpose. However, despite all the alleged multifunctionality and technology, most of the vessels of the -scientific fleet of the Russian Federation- were built in the 1970s and 1980s. Soon the Russian Federation will be forced to decommission them without replacing them with new ones. At the same time, anti-Russian sanctions have significantly narrowed Moscow's opportunities to modernize and equip -scientists-. Thus, in the report of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation -On the state of national security of Russia in maritime activities- for 2017, it was emphasized the terrible condition of research vessels, the average wear of which already exceeded 80%, the average age was 34 years, and the technical condition of the majority of vessels was assessed as unsatisfactory. As reported by ArmyInform, the SSR believes that -z-pozyczyi-syly/->pressure from the USA and a negotiating track -from a position of strength- are predicted in Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/agresor-vykorystovuye-svij-doslidnyczkyj-flot-dlya-dyversij-proty-krayin-nato-szr/	2025-01-09T09:21:08-08:00

It was implemented by our team and we hope to multiply its gains, including at the expense of frozen Russian assets in the EU in 2025,- said Hleb Kanevskyi. As ArmiyaInform reported, thanks to the implementation of the -Danish model- of support for the defense industry of Ukraine, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have already received weapons for 538 million euros.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/zakupivlya-zbroyi-dlya-zsu-v-minoborony-hochut-aby-ukrayinskyj-opk-finansuvavsya-za-rahunok-zamorozhenyh-rosijskyh-aktyviv/	2025-01-09T09:17:21-08:00

The Ministry of Defense responded to criticism regarding changes to the charters of procurement agen...	The director of Radio NV told about this in an interview with Radio NV. Gleb Kanevskyi of the Procurement Policy Department of the Ministry of Education and Culture. According to him, in April 2022, changes to the Law on State Property were adopted, according to which the management entity is obliged to monitor and warn of risks to national security during the management of state-owned companies. The -Defense Procurement Agency- and the -State Rear Operator- are just operating in the form of state-owned companies. -The Ministry of Defense has developed a management policy for state-owned companies. Over the past year, the charters of six strategic enterprises have already been changed. They precisely contained the rule that in the event of risks to National Security during martial law, the governing body has the function of monitoring and preventing the threat and taking measures. Including personnel,- said Hleb Kanevskyi. He emphasized that this norm applies only during martial law and only under conditions of threats to national security. -How do we see it in the Ministry? Well, first of all, this is not the provision of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the war with a critical range of goods. But there is one problem. Threats are not clearly defined by law. And perhaps this is what worries the public,- noted Hleb Kanevskyi. Now, according to the Director of the Procurement Policy Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, there is active communication with the heads of the Supervisory Boards of the -Defense Procurement Agency- and the -State Rear Operator- in order to formalize and make more specific what the threats to National Security in the field of providing the Armed Forces may be during martial law.

-‎The Danish model of supporting the defense industry of Ukraine: the Armed Forces of Ukraine receiv...	About this reported in the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. These funds are the result of agreements concluded in 2024 with the Danish Ministry of Defense regarding the financing of arms procurement projects from Ukrainian manufacturers. The sources of funding are the governments of Denmark (125 million euros through the Danish national Ukraine Fund), Sweden (20 million euros), Iceland (2.7 million euros) and interest from frozen Russian assets (390 million euros). In 2024, Ukraine started with Denmark a new mechanism for financing the procurement of weapons for the Armed Forces, which was called the -Danish model-. It provides for the financing of Ukrainian defense enterprises by the Danish government. Ukraine forms a list of projects that need financing, and Danish specialists check the recommended companies, evaluate their capacity and experience in fulfilling contracts. -We are grateful to Denmark for its leadership position, steadfast support and effective implementation of the -Danish model- of cooperation with the Ukrainian defense industry. Purchased equipment is already proving its effectiveness on the battlefield, strengthening our ability to confront the enemy and bring victory closer. We hope that the example of Denmark will inspire other countries to take similar initiatives, because it will help to make a joint contribution to the future security of Europe and the world,- said the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov. -I am very proud of the cooperation between Denmark and Ukraine within the framework of the -Danish model-. I am also impressed by the speed that the Ukrainian defense industry can provide. Support already on the front line or on the way is important, and I hope that more countries will consider supporting Ukraine through its defense industry. Denmark will continue to lead,- said Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen. At the first stage of implementation of the -Danish model-, Ukraine received self-propelled artillery installations -Bohdan-. Subsequently, the production of long-range drones, anti-tank and anti-ship missiles was financed. Purchasing from the Ukrainian defense industry has significant advantages: In addition, such purchases support the Ukrainian economy in times of war, allowing to preserve jobs and promote the development of domestic industry. Denmark does not stop supporting Ukraine. 135 million euros have already been reserved for further purchases in the Ukrainian defense industry in 2025. In addition, approximately 43 million euros are planned to be sent from Norway.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/danska-model-pidtrymky-oboronnoyi-promyslovosti-ukrayiny-zsu-otrymaly-ozbroyennya-na-538-mln-yevro/	2025-01-09T02:08:51-08:00

Now this trophy vehicle is used for the needs of 117 separate heavy mechanized brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Russian equipment is very heavy - 15.5 tons, has large dimensions: length 7.1, width 2.5 m, and height is 3.5 m. -Linza- is built on the platform of the Russian armored KamAZ -Typhoon-K-. All-wheel drive, automatic transmission, electronics, all possible functions are available to improve off-road driving, anti-mine protection of quite high quality. Accurately withstands hits from large-caliber machine guns and hits even from a grenade launcher. It was checked in practice - machine guns failed to penetrate the car's armor and windshield. As for more powerful weapons, it has not yet been tested in practice. A comfortable driving speed on the highway is about 70 km/h. It is difficult to tell on rough terrain, because the car is not stable, high speeds cannot be in it in principle. Yes, it is -passable-, overcomes obstacles, but it does not have off-road speed. That is, 20, 30, sometimes it can be 40 km/h. This is if the road is straight, normal and level. And it is very difficult for her. After all, it has a lot of weight and a high center of gravity, so it is not maneuverable. -Lens- has a very high suspension above the ground, plus armor and a heavy rear compartment, and all the weight in it is located not closer to the bottom, but in the center - closer to the top. Therefore, it is very dangerous -on bends-. It is necessary to have a very experienced driver who knows how to drive this car with confidence. Of interest, there are also tire inflation, hydraulic brakes, a winch in front of the car, and a crane installed in the back. the Rashists used it to load their wounded into the car. This crane can also be used to assist other vehicles. The car is quite economical, fuel consumption is more than 20 liters per hundred kilometers in more or less calm driving conditions. First of all, a local communication network based on ASL-SAN devices is installed inside for crew communication. Previously, this was not the case, in fact, it was impossible to contact the driver on the move. How the Russians communicated with each other is not clear. Five workstations are equipped: desktop, screen, radios and laptops. Equipped workplace of the brigade commander. Plus, the work is provided by two -starlinks-, one in the automotive version to provide communication directly while driving, and one is completed as a regular -starlink- for already stationary deployment. There is, of course, a generator, its own autonomous power supply. The machine has the option of installing cryptographic protection devices. To provide secure communication during battle management or during unit communication and interaction. It is not always possible to deploy a stationary command post, such as a battalion or brigade, in a timely and operational manner. At this time, the command and staff vehicle assumes the role of this command point, can move, constantly change its location. And with it, a brigade commander or chief of staff can conduct quality management of troops. It can also be a maneuvering vehicle during some assault operations. The commander can be on it relatively close to the front line and competently manage his subordinate units. As much as this car, due to its large dimensions, attracts a lot of attention, you can't get too close to the collision line. Usually, this distance is 20-30 km, it can be even closer. If, of course, there is a need for it. Everything depends on the conditions and circumstances at the front. The work in this machine is built on the principle of a standard command and observation post of a battalion or brigade. There are main screens with a video image, on which any broadcast, for example from a UAV, is displayed for the commander. At his workplace, he sets tasks for subordinate units through communication channels. Next to the commander at the workplaces according to the directions are, for example, air defense, EW, artillery, reconnaissance, UAV control, etc. That is, people from the appropriate departments or services of the brigade also join the crew, work here, manage the battle and provide all the necessary information to the commander. The armed brigade has Roshel Senator armored vehicles, some of them are also used as command and staff vehicles. They were transferred as part of international military-technical assistance from Canada. If these machines are compared with the Russian -Linza-, they are ahead of it in some technical parameters. For example, Canadian combat vehicles are much lighter, weighing around 8 tons depending on equipment and upgrades. -Rochelles- are faster, more maneuverable, lower on the road and, most importantly, less noticeable. They are much better than -Lens- in the context of engine electronics. Because here in the Russians, everything is built on the basis of KAMAZ, plus their engineers tried to develop some -their own- engine control units and on-board computers for it. But it all looks very primitive like most all the built equipment of the Russians. It doesn't work quite as logically as it should. More time is spent to master it. Simply put, the -brain- is technologically not enough. In -Rochelle- this is all much easier to implement, because in fact it is a Ford. And this is the top level. The car is built on a Ford F-550 chassis. Seven-liter diesel engine, automatic transmission. -Canadian- is not as noticeable as this -Lens-. But at the same time, it is smaller, because of that there are fewer jobs. The landing compartment provides for 6 places. Also, the car is less armored, it has a maximum protection against a 7.62 mm machine gun. Mine protection in Rochelle is not of a very high level, unlike the Rashist machine. Due to the fact that the -Lens- has a V-shaped bottom of the case and is raised above the ground, it is more resistant to explosions. But the Roshel Senator is equipped with a system of protection against weapons of mass destruction. The car is equipped with a system that can counteract chemical, biological, radiological attacks, generating clean air inside the sealed cabin. This is definitely a big plus.- Oleksandr from Poltava. Before the large-scale invasion, he worked in areas close to the IT industry and communications. Entered the ZSU at the end of 2022. The -military commissars- flatly refused to call up, the state of health did not allow. But the boy was very persistent. At first, he served in the 5th tank brigade, over time he was transferred to the 117th brigade, which was just being formed. Back then it was just a mechanized brigade. The call sign -Turetsky- was given to Oleksandr by the commander of his unit. -It's a bit of a funny story. We lived together with the commander at the same location. Once, before the first combat deployment, I spent the whole night watching some Turkish TV series, it was a melodrama. For some reason, I was tired of action movies about war and I decided to watch something -light-. Commander in the morning: -You will be -Turkish-! That's how it took root,- Oleksandr told Komvzod.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/shtab-na-kolesah-zatrofeyena-rosijska-linza-stala-brygadnoyu-komandno-shtabnoyu-mashynoyu/	2025-01-08T21:07:02-08:00
-One mine destroyed three enemies at once-. The story of -Norman- from the 23rd OMBR	-Managed the position of the detachment, skillfully organized the all-round defense, maintained the stable and morale of the subordinate personnel in the position,- - say about this sergeant of the Armed Forces in the higher command. So let's get to know -Norman- better: about how he got into the army, about his combat path, interesting and funny memories from the war and a lot more - the military man told in a conversation with the correspondent of ArmiyaInform. Before the start of the full-scale war, he worked for 15 years at the insurance company PZU Ukraine in his native Kryvyi Rih. For the last 5-6 years, he was the head of the department. -We were engaged in motor insurance, housing, corporate sector insurance, medical, personal property, as well as long-term life insurance. We cooperated with banks, car dealerships, and large and medium-sized enterprises of our city,- he recalls his civilian experience. Joined the Armed Forces of Ukraine on March 3, 2022. -Then I got a call from the Military Commissariat (I already had a term of service behind me) and was offered to come to issue a summons. He passed the medical board in one day, and two or three days later he was already in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I was sent to the Kryvyi Rih automobile battalion, which transported fuel and ammunition to the front. I was in the security company, which was engaged in the protection of transport,- he recalls. At first, the service was in Kryvyi Rih, then in Kharkiv region, then in Donetsk region. This is how the first two years of the full-scale war passed. In April 2024, he was transferred to the 23rd separate mechanized unit, where he still serves. At the BZVP, he recalls, they taught exactly those things that would be needed in battle. -There were no old -scoop- methods of fighting, such as -cover-run- and so on. There were practical things that would save my life and help me in real battles,- states the serviceman. Once, in the area of ​​the combat mission, -Norman- during the repulse of the attack, thanks to the ability to use the available weapons systems, destroyed 6 military personnel of the aggressor's army, while preserving subordinate personnel. -I don't think it's a feat - we were just doing our job. There were four of us. We occupied two SPshkas that were practically next to each other. I divided the people: so that two experienced fighters were in the front SPshka, and the young fighters were behind us. I consider the key to our success to be the fact that, thanks to our competent position, we were practically invisible to the enemy -birds-, so the enemy, entering our positions, practically did not see us. We also installed three anti-personnel mines of the fragmentation type, with which we managed to destroy three enemies at once with one mine,- recalls -Norman-. And he continues: -Then six grenades, thrown in the direction of the enemy, finished their work. Three other Russians were leaving the landing from 12:00, where we let them as close as possible and destroyed them&#8230; The main thing is to prepare the boys, to give them an understanding of who and what to do, to tell what actions everyone should take if the enemy approaches from one side or another. When people understand what they need to do and what to expect, then they are more confident and calm,- the interlocutor emphasizes. We ask how the military manages to support the morale of the soldiers. -I don't know, it somehow works out that way. The fighters see me, my calm expression, and probably feel less nervous too. Even if I'm nervous or tense, it doesn't show in any way, so the fighters feel a certain confidence in me. I have no other explanation,- says the soldier with a smile. He emphasizes: -You have to remember that thoughts materialize. If you think good and good, so it will be. If you set yourself up for a bad scenario, it will wait for you at the end. I understood this a long time ago, in everyday life - when, for example, you drive into a supermarket parking lot and already draw in your head a parking space for your car - and yes, it appears! Or a car pulls away, and your parking spot is waiting for you. It's the same in the army: I program in advance how my combat exit will be: OK, let's get to the position, we won't have any -birds- above us, or if they fly, they won't see us. But the problem with today's guys who get into the Armed Forces is that they want to get injured as soon as possible and go to the hospital for treatment.- On the same note, we ask -Norman- about the recipe for a successful commander. He modestly replies that he is not a commander, but he has the vision of such a commander. -He should be close to the fighters, breathe their life, understand their problems and what awaits them there. He himself had to go through everything that boys go through. After all, the boys' lives depend on his decisions. And subordinates should remember that their lives also depend on their actions in battle, on how they behave. You need to give your all, do everything that depends on you, as they say, -we will always manage to give up.- He recalls -Norman- and his most vivid memory, which will forever be etched in his memory - when he carried his first wounded. -We came to the dugout into which the mine landed and saw there one alive and one wounded out of four fighters. Others, unfortunately, have already died&#8230; So we saved this soldier with the call sign -Ternopil-. It was the first wounded person that I carried out of the battlefield, so I think it is like the first girl - it will be remembered for the rest of my life.'' There are also happy memories of the war - although few, but the interlocutor admits, sometimes a smile still appears on his face. -I remember Chasiv Yar, we hide from drones in the private sector. Not all locals left, some -Zhduns- lived there until the last. Almost all the houses were damaged and destroyed. Only a few survived. And so we hide from the drones, look out the window, and see a picture: a grandmother runs with a bucket through the water, crosses the road in front of her, and an FPV drone flies behind her. He only made sure that she was a civilian and flew on. But the way the grandmother christened the road,- Norman laughs. And after catching up, he tells another story: -Or we remember two local drunkards who met us before going to war. One with a bandaged head, the other with roses&#8230; Apparently, they were going on a date. Petal mines are scattered underfoot, landing pits are everywhere, and they are on a date&#8230; Sad and funny are next to each other.

Command of time: Britain plans to increase the submarine fleet with the help of unmanned submarines	As the authors of the French naval defense write edition Naval News, a team of British engineers based in Portsmouth, successfully demonstrated a new type of autonomous submarine designed specifically for military use off the southern coast of England, reports ArmyInform. BAE Systems reviews ultra-large autonomous underwater vehicle with wide customization and modification capabilities (XLAUV) Herne (-Эрн-, - Ukrainian) as a flexible platform, adaptable for various operations, including anti-submarine warfare, reconnaissance, surveillance, intelligence and electronic warfare. Commenting on the development, Scott Jamieson, BAE Systems Maritime Managing Director, said: -This will be the first time any British company has tested its advanced autonomous capabilities in this industry and I am very excited to be working with Cellula Robotics.- He further emphasized the goal of creating a system that would be -faster, more functional, more flexible and cheaper for customers-. underwater infrastructure, as well as intelligence. -We are very excited to work with BAE Systems and look forward to a demonstration that will pave the way for the future of enhanced underwater security and intelligence,- he said. a target=-_blank- rel=-nofollow- href=-https://www.baesystems.com/en/product/nautomate->Nautomate, a high quality autonomous military management system naval surface and underwater vehicles. She was successfully tested on a surface vessel earlier this year. The vessel is built within a lightweight aluminum frame that maintains a total weight of 8-10 tons, depending on payload and energy storage configuration. The Ern is 12 m long and its body has an approximately 1.7 m square cross-section. It does not have the single cylindrical hull found in typical submarines, instead the bow and stern sections are sealed, and payload bays fill freely. Therefore, items carried in payload bays must be sealed in their own pressurized containers. Payload bay modules are easy to remove and replace. The entire space of the Herne UAV could theoretically be quickly swapped out for new payloads and power packs in less than an hour. There are forward and aft payload bays, each with a volume of 2.5 thousand liters The power modules are centrally located between the bays, but the layout can be changed to create a single 5K bay. liters for larger items. These could be anti-submarine torpedoes, small UUVs, sensor arrays, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUGVs), or an anchor for anchoring to the seabed. Erne can also winch deploy fine-line towed arrays or deploy flanking sonar for anti-submarine detection/tracking missions. The vessel is designed to have neutral buoyancy and cells filled with foam to provide buoyancy , approximately equivalent to its empty weight. There are also sophisticated passive and active ballast systems to keep the vessel afloat and compensate for weight loss when payloads are deployed from the vessel underwater. In the event of a major malfunction, the Herne can be programmed to fail-safe mode, forcing the drone to ascend to the surface or sink to the bottom. The movement of an unmanned submarine is provided by two electric motors that independently drive two propellers, which provides a measure of redundancy in the unlikely event of engine failure or propeller damage. The maximum speed of the sprint is 8 knots, although it usually develops a speed of about 3 knots. Herne's diving depth reaches 3 thousand. meters, which is much deeper than any SSN or SSK. The vessel, which was originally designed to work on underwater energy infrastructure, is highly maneuverable, equipped with two sets of lateral and vertical thrusters. Power is provided by a set of lithium-ion batteries, which guarantees its operation for approximately 7-10 days . Additional batteries carried in the payload bay will allow for increased sprint speed if needed. Cellula has tested a solution where the batteries are replaced by hydrogen fuel cells, which provides a range of 5,000 km. km and 45 days of work. Due to this coverage of the water area, -Herne- has a real potential to participate in the fight against UAVs in the depths of the ocean. For example, a small Herne fleet permanently stationed in the GIUK Gap could provide a continuous guard with greater persistence and with much more lower costs than manned platforms. A successful anti-submarine weapons mission does not necessarily require sinking a submarine, but rather deterring and disrupting their operations. Such vehicles could reportedly give the military the ability to control large underwater areas without crew restrictions. span> Herne unmanned submarine.

-And the voices, -not in the topic-: propaganda voiced the American talk show in its own way. Anothe...	At first glance, the video looks like a typical fragment of a television broadcast: two presenters in the studio are commenting on something with a smile and sarcastic notes in their voices. For Russian propaganda, this is a -perfect blow- to Ukraine: they say that even our allies are already tired of the war and consider us -expendable-. But behind this -sensation- hides a rather trivial and at the same time dangerous disinformation mechanism&#8230; Wait! Let's take a closer look. The attention of disinformation researchers immediately focused on the inconsistency between the presenters' lip movements and the text behind the frame. The voice sounds -off topic- and this is the first signal to the disclosure. It turns out that this video is a mix of two completely different sources. The first component is a real excerpt of a talk show, but without context, where the presenters comment on a curious case in the United States. The second is a fabricated audio track created using deepfake technologies. Russian -fake masters- put a new soundtrack to give the video a completely different meaning. Russian propaganda uses the weakness of human thinking: we tend to believe what we see with our own eyes. The montage looks so natural that most people don't even think about checking the source. In addition, the video is focused on emotions: indignation, anger, a sense of betrayal. In an emotional state, we are less prone to critical thinking. The fact-checkers' investigation revealed that the American journalists depicted in the video did not even comment on the situation in Ukraine. At most, they publicly expressed support for our country. And the -sensational statement- about the losses of the Armed Forces is just a lying audio track created to incite despair among Ukrainians. This situation reminds us that information warfare is not just part of modern warfare. This is a front where even fake laughter becomes a weapon. And if you come across a -sensational- video, do not rush to share it on social networks. Better take a closer look, think about it, ask yourself: -Who benefits from me believing this?- If we all pay attention, we can protect the truth, no matter how loud and sharp the lies.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/a-golosy-to-ne-v-temu-rospropaganda-ozvuchyla-amerykanske-tok-shou-po-svoyemu-chergovyj-deepfake/	2025-01-08T20:11:48-08:00

-Stopped, unwound- — remote mining helps our soldiers repel enemy assaults	About this on the ArmyTV stream on January 8, the commander of the unmanned systems battalion of the 30th mechanized brigade with the call sign -Prosecutor- told . -They are not guided by resets, but by remote mining. Our forces are on active defense and that is where our attention should be focused. Constantly mine, mine and mine. At the base of our battalion, there are engineering and explosive workshops that can afford to manufacture munitions for remote mining. Because if the enemy is not stopped and he enters the rear zone with a column, then big problems will begin there. And when mines stop him on the way, the enemy suffers losses and abandons planned actions. And then everything goes like clockwork, we destroy them in the fields,- the -Prosecutor- said. According to him, the enemy in the Kramatorsk direction behaves defiantly, constantly carries out assault actions, both in small infantry groups and with the support of armored vehicles. Actively uses buggies and tries to go to the rear with subversive and reconnaissance groups. As reported by ArmyInform, in Kharkiv Oblast there are 30 OMBR units repelled the assault, which was carried out by the forces of the company with the support of equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/zupynyly-rozmotaly-dystanczijne-minuvannya-dopomagaye-nashym-bijczyam-vidbyvaty-vorozhi-shturmy/	2025-01-08T11:42:11-08:00
The unholy trinity - a group that took up to $12,000 for crossing the border will be tried in Kyiv	This was reported on January 8 by the specialized prosecutor's office in the field of defense of the Central region. The specified persons are accused of aiding and abetting the illegal transportation of a person across the state border of Ukraine, receiving an unlawful benefit for influencing the decision-making by a person authorized to perform state functions, evading conscription for military service, abuse of influence (Part 3 of Article 332, Part 3 Art. 28, Part 1 Art. 369-2, Part 5 Art. 27, part 3 of article 15, article 336 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). According to the investigation, an ex-employee of the Metropolitan Military Commissariat involved in the criminal scheme of transporting conscripts across the state border a current official of the RTCC and a doctor of the city hospital. The medical worker provided the men with fake medical documents, and the employee of the RTCC facilitated the passing of the military medical commission. As a result, conscripted men were given the opportunity to go abroad. During the pre-trial investigation, the receipt of such -services- by the suspects was documented by four conscript men, one of whom crossed the state border of Ukraine using the conclusion of the VLK and the -Temporary ID of a Conscript-, with the specified data regarding his exclusion from military registration. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/nesvyata-trijczya-u-kyyevi-sudytymut-grupu-yaka-brala-do-12-tysyach-za-peretyn-kordonu/	2025-01-08T11:37:24-08:00

Finland's one-year chairmanship of the OSCE began on January 1. Volodymyr Zelenskyi noted that Elina Valtonen made her first visit in this position to Ukraine, and this is an important symbol of support for our state. -He thanked the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the government, the President and the entire Finnish people for supporting Ukraine from the very beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion. Finland provided 26 defense aid packages for a total amount of more than 2.3 billion euros,- the statement said. Separately, Volodymyr Zelenskyi noted Finland's participation in the first Peace Summit and the thematic conferences based on its results. -We count on your leadership and chairmanship of the OSCE. And I want to discuss with you and your team what the OSCE can do for Ukraine, first of all for our children, for our soldiers, for our heroic people who are held in Russian prisons,- the President said. Also during the meeting, they discussed celebrating this year the 50th anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act, the document on the basis of which the Organization was created. The principles of this act are also at the heart of the Peace Formula and the Victory Plan. Particular attention was paid to the strengthening of sanctions against the shadow fleet of the Russian Federation, which enables the aggressor state to finance the war. Elina Valtonen also emphasized that Russia uses the shadow fleet to undermine the ceiling price for oil, and it also poses a real threat to the environment. -As Finland and as the OSCE Chairmanship, we will do everything to achieve a just and sustainable peace for your country. Ukraine will remain a priority for the entire Organization,- she assured. The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs noted that she supports the -peace through strength- approach and Ukraine's right to self-defense in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression.

- We are told that they are being tortured here. And they gave us tea and sandwiches-: Russian soldi...	This is discussed in an interview with Russian prisoners of war published in social the -I want to live- project, initiated by the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War together with the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Oleksiy from the Novosibirsk region, one of those who was captured by the Ukrainian defenders, says: -The commanders told us that it is better not to surrender. It is better to have a grenade with you. Because there they cut off ears, cut other parts of the body&#8230; Various horror stories. But in reality everything was not like that at all.- -We were put in a trench, our hands were tied, but we were not beaten or touched. We were not even shouted at. They just gave me cigarettes.

The Ukrainian defender got his pseudonym because he worked as a taxi driver in Kyiv for 15 years. And this experience was not wasted for him. What's more, having passed through Novotroitske, Soledar and Bakhmut, Taxi Driver can now drive any type of transport, from Cossack to armored personnel carriers. -I don't care where I drive, as long as I drive forward,- says the man, confidently maneuvering along the roads of advanced positions.

Flying snakes of war: the Armed Forces told how they counter drones with -optics-	told about this on the telethon -Edyny Novy- > Orest Drymalovskyi, representative of the press service of the 79th Tavrian Assault Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Our fighters have already encountered such drones on the battlefield, but so far these are isolated cases, not systematic work,- he noted. Such drones resemble a flying snake, because their control is not through radio waves, but through a fiber optic cable. However, Orest Drymalovsky noted that such drones also have their drawbacks, in particular, they are inferior to conventional FPV drones in terms of speed and maneuverability, and are also more vulnerable to small arms, especially shotguns, which have proven to be quite effective. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 61st Mechanized Steppe Brigade na-kurshhyni/->repulsed the assault of several groups of enemy infantry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/letyuchi-zmiyi-vijny-u-zsu-rozpovily-yak-protydiyut-dronam-na-optyczi/	2025-01-08T05:01:14-08:00
Cheap soldiers: a prisoner told how much Russian conscripts are paid for the war	This is discussed in an interview with by Russian prisoners of war, published in the social project -I want to live-, initiated by the Coordinating Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War together with the State Government Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. One of the prisoners, Maxim from Novgorod, tells his story. He worked in a restaurant until he received a summons. After several months of service, he and other conscripts were sent to the Kursk region, promising that they would only have to dig trenches. -In the documents, we were listed at a training ground in Russia, but in reality we were sitting underground under fire. I was paid 2,500 rubles ($200) a month, which was enough for a pack of cigarettes and two cans of energy,- he says. The conditions of service became a shock for him: constant shelling, lack of food and communication. -The first two days we ate dry food, and then we picked grapes in the fields. And when we were captured, I was surprised - they didn't beat us, they even gave us tea.- Serhiy Tolmachov also notes that, according to the commanders, -it will be peaceful, we will only dig trenches and build dugouts,- but the reality of the front turned out to be brutal. Like many other conscripts, he ended up on the front line, where, lacking experience and the necessary equipment, he witnessed terrible battles. As reported by ArmyInform, two servicemen of the 79th separate airborne assault brigade of the Tavrya captured 14 Russians during hostilities in the eastern direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/deshevi-soldaty-polonenyj-rozpoviv-skilky-platyat-rosijskym-strokovykam-za-vijnu/	2025-01-08T04:47:11-08:00

Veteran Serhiy spent 35 days in the torture chambers of the Russian Federation, got out of there and...	His story told in the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the MOU with reference to Lyudmila Havrylyuk's interview for -We are Ukraine-. -After consulting with our brothers, we decided to stay because there were people staying,- said the man. After the capture of Novaya Kakhovka by the enemy, Serhiy left home and went into hiding. Collected and communicated critical information for the Defense Forces. The Russian invaders were hunting him - they had lists of participants in the Novaya Kakhovka ATO on the second day of the occupation. -On the third of May (2022), I got a call at 6:45 a.m. and they said, 'Surrender.' I answered that I was not in the city, that I was far away: -Look.- Well, that's how we started the game,- the man recalled. For several months, Serhiy continued to monitor the occupiers, the movement of their equipment, and passed on important information. On Independence Day, August 24, 2022, the man was detained by the Russians. He stayed in the torture chambers for 35 days. -For the first day, they scored so much that I was already saying: 'Kill,' because I couldn't take it anymore,- Serhii said. The GUR noted that the occupiers were not able to extract any confessions. After a month and a half, the man was released - he began to look for ways to leave the occupied Nova Kakhovka. I even considered the option of waiting for spring and swimming across the Dnieper. Or make your way to your relatives through the village of Krynky. Meanwhile, in Kyiv, the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of Ukraine Hayde Rizayeva learned about Serhiy Davydyuk from a mutual acquaintance who asked for help. Preparation and planning of the evacuation operation has begun. -It took me a few days to map out a common route. It was necessary to wait for certain rotational moments. It was necessary to determine the psychotype of Serhiy himself, because not every person can psychologically master the passage of enemy roadblocks,- said Heide. They were developing evacuation routes. The man had to issue a Russian passport to leave the occupied territory. On October 8, he went to Rostov-on-Don and was filtered in the city of Taganrog. Then Sergey went to Belarus and then to Ukraine. Earlier ArmyInform told the story of Serhiy with the call sign -Bear-, a soldier of the Sumy OTCC and SP, who served in the 31st separate mechanized brigade in the position of a unit commander - a combat vehicle commander and participated in battles in Donetsk region, from Rivnopil to Kostyantynivka.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/veteran-sergij-35-dniv-probuv-u-kativnyah-rf-vyjshov-zvidty-j-pokynuv-okupovane-misto-zavdyaky-operacziyi-gur/	2025-01-08T03:42:52-08:00

The Ministry of Defense has approved new standards of pre-medical training for servicemen	About this notified in MOU. The document includes two main standards: The first standard is designed to be used primarily in basic military training and covers training to provide care for critical bleeding, respiratory failure, chest, head and eye injuries, burns and fractures. Also, the standard includes the prevention of hypothermia, the use of an individual set of medicines and rules for the evacuation of victims. The second standard expands the list of knowledge and skills compared to the first, as it was created for the training of paramedic riflemen and their corresponding officers and sergeants, military specialists. Training units lasting from six hours focus on providing care in an adverse environment, techniques for moving victims to shelter, ensuring the patency of the airways, assessment and support of breathing and circulation, as well as features of care during evacuation. Training according to both standards involves the format of lectures with multimedia support, practical classes in small groups and simulation classes in field conditions with imitation of a combat situation. Certified instructors must use informative-evidential and explanatory-illustrative methods, as well as interactive tools, including computer equipment and educational mobile applications. Assessment of knowledge and skills will be carried out with the help of special sheets combining theoretical questions and practical tasks. Military personnel who demonstrate high potential may be recommended for further professional training in medical and military accounting specialties. -We hear the needs of the front, and one of them is quality training. The skills and knowledge required to successfully provide pre-medical care must be regulated. We formed new standards taking into account the unique combat experience of our medics and soldiers, gained in the fight against Russian aggression, and the standards of partner countries. Thanks to the implementation of this practice by the Ministry of Defense, servicemen will receive more relevant practical knowledge and skills that will help save lives on the battlefield,- said Oksana Sukhorukova, director of the Department of Health Protection of the Ministry of Defense. Implementation of these standards will ensure a high level of military training, which will allow them to effectively provide first aid in combat and other extreme situations, saving the lives and health of their fellow soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/minoborony-zatverdylo-novi-standarty-domedychnoyi-pidgotovky-dlya-vijskovosluzhbovcziv/	2025-01-08T00:44:21-08:00

However, the reality turned out to be completely different - he woke up already under artillery fire. -I managed to run into the dugout when the shelling started. And the guard was less lucky - his leg was immediately torn off, and another was pierced through the calf. There were a lot of explosions, artillery was constantly working.- Without proper training and equipment, the conscripts witnessed the Ukrainian offensive, during which the commanders fled, leaving them to fend for themselves. -Our platoon leader said that we are not the first ones here, everyone is going home. But I woke up to the shelling, and everyone's pants were full. All the commanders immediately -kicked in the slippers-, says Artem.

The enemy has intensified in the direction of Mirnograd, instead of armored vehicles they choose bug...	The staff sergeant of the department told about this on the air of the telethon -The only news- communications of the 25th separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade Serhiy Okishev. -The intensity of hostilities has changed, it has become greater. Now opposite us are a separate motorized rifle brigade and a motorized rifle regiment of the Russian Federation. According to our data, they were reinforced by one of the special units of the Russian army,- Serhii Okishev said. According to him, the Russians are currently operating formations that have come out of recovery in this direction. -They were forced to go to recovery, as they could not and still cannot break through the defense line at this point. That's why they obviously transferred fresh forces here for a new attempt,- explained the representative of the 25th OPDBr. Serhiy Okishev added that the occupiers use armored vehicles even less often, preferring more maneuverable vehicles such as buggies, golf carts, and passenger vehicles. In this way, they try to reach positions faster. As reported by ArmyInform, assault groups of Russians it is not possible to reach the positions of the defense forces in the Robotyn region of the Zaporizhzhia region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/vorog-aktyvizuvavsya-v-napryamku-myrnograda-zamist-bronetehniky-obyrayut-bagi-ta-golf-kary/	2025-01-08T00:03:26-08:00
The occupiers in Luhansk region raised fines: new rules hit the wallets of TOT residents	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. The fines officially increased by one and a half times, but the occupation authorities simultaneously reduced the discount for their payment during the first 30 days from 50% to 25%. As a result, the total amount of fines actually doubled. For example, if earlier a person had to pay 500 rubles in the first month for a violation worth 1,000 rubles, now a similar fine is 1,500 rubles, with the amount in the first 30 days — 1,125 rubles. The new rates include, in particular, a fine of up to 7,500 rubles for speeding or driving into the opposite lane, as well as 45,000 rubles for driving while intoxicated. In addition, in Severodonetsk, due to the lack of mobile communication and the Internet, residents call emergency services using payphones or radio communication. Several payphones installed by the occupation administration are available during the day. At night, during the curfew, townspeople use radio transmitters to communicate with the Russian ambulance or police on the UHF range. These changes cause significant difficulties for the local population, especially in critical situations. As reported by ArmyInform, Russia has approved a development strategy that /->provides for the closure of unprofitable mines in the temporarily occupied territory of Luhansk Region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/okupanty-na-luganshhyni-pidnyaly-shtrafy-novi-pravyla-vdaryly-po-gamanczyah-meshkancziv-tot/	2025-01-07T23:55:50-08:00
Our artillery hit the control point of the Russian invaders	The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine informs about this. Also, the enemy launched about five thousand artillery strikes, 139 of them from rocket salvo systems. The enemy carried out airstrikes, in particular, in the areas of Serebryanka, Verkhnyokamianske, Dilyivka, Toretsk, Katerynivka, Petrivka, Pokrovsk, Stepove, Kostiantynopol, Rozlyv, Velika Novosilka settlements of the Donetsk region. However, our soldiers inflict significant losses in manpower and equipment on the occupying forces and actively undermine the enemy's offensive potential in the rear. Over the past day, missile troops and artillery of the Defense Forces hit eight areas of concentration of personnel, weapons and military equipment and the UAV control center of the Russian invaders. As ArmiyaInform reported, the Armed Forces stopped 176 Russian attacks: tense situation in the Kursk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/nasha-arta-vdaryla-punkt-upravlinnya-rosijskyh-zagarbnykiv/	2025-01-07T23:38:37-08:00

The Armed Forces explained why the occupiers cannot reach Robotyny	The head of the communications department of the 118th of a separate mechanized brigade, Senior Lieutenant Dmytro Pelikh, commenting on the situation in the Orihiv direction. -We do not detect large enemy assault groups, the defense line is stable. We do not give a single meter of Ukrainian land to the enemy, but this does not mean that he does not take any actions against our forces,- he said. According to the military, the occupiers are forming small assault groups that try to storm the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine several times a day in order to find some weak points in their defense in order to carry out some more massive strikes on these points in the future. However, due to the peculiarities of the local landscape, all attempts of the enemy to reach Ukrainian positions will fail. -They are very bad at it. These assault groups of theirs are disposable, quite often they do not even reach their front lines, because our gunners work very well. There is such a terrain here that you can see for almost two dozen kilometers. Even from the moment the occupiers advance to our positions, we have the opportunity to see them and, accordingly, work with all available means. And to walk one and a half to two tens of kilometers towards our positions is quite a difficult task,- Dmytro Pelikh explained. According to him, the same applies to the enemy's attempts to advance with the help of armored vehicles. -In our direction (Russians - ed.) armored vehicles have not been used for a long time. Here is a rather specific place, which is mined very densely. It was replaced by the occupiers themselves back in 22-23 years. Our Defense Forces also carry out demining every day,- added the representative of the Armed Forces. As reported by ArmyInform, on the Pokrovsky direction the enemy continues its pressure, trying to bypass the city.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/u-zsu-poyasnyly-chomu-okupanty-ne-mozhut-dijty-do-robotynogo/	2025-01-07T23:09:10-08:00
A severed nerve, art--badminton-, revenge on the enemy dance and the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi: t...	Awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky III degree. What tasks did you perform during the anti-terrorist operation? But how did he get injured in 2022? This is what the officer told our correspondents. -After the end of the first contract, he resigned and rejoined the Armed Forces after mobilization in 2015. After distribution, he took the position of platoon commander in the 25th Parachute Brigade. At that time, it was the only brigade and the only military formation in Ukraine, which was able to carry out landings not only of personnel, but also of equipment. I did not have time to visit the hot spots because I got to the 25th in September 2015. At first, we performed tasks in Donetsk region. Later, we were sent to the Perekop district, to the administrative border with Crimea. And the main task there was to make throws to the dividing line. In this way, we found out what the enemy had on the other side. And on that side there was a lot then&#8230; If I'm not mistaken, at the factory in Armyansk there was, as a minimum, the enemy battery -Gradiv- and the D-30 division. And it was all reinforced by tanks, helicopters and their airborne units. &#8230;When you are a platoon leader, in my opinion, you should treat people the way you want to be treated. This, first of all. And secondly, you can't ask your staff to do something that you can't do yourself. Well, for example, during a large-scale invasion, when it was necessary to make wire lines of communication, to throw them directly along the front edge, then I, as the commander of the battalion communication group, brought soldiers from the communication platoon there and showed what should be done. When a commander walks with his staff, it inspires people. This is a first. And secondly, people see that if the commander leaves, he owns the situation: if something was wrong there, he would not leave. In 2016, I resigned and was enrolled in the operational reserve of the first line. In my personal opinion, OR-1 are those people who later in 2022 joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and thanks to whom, among other things, we are talking here now. &#8230;On February 24, 2022, of course, I returned to the army. Most of the people who came to the TCC at the beginning of the large-scale invasion were guys from OR-1, people who passed the ATO. And they had fighting spirit. Like hunting. They were predators. In a good sense of the word. Because the most dangerous predator on the planet is man. And a person who is motivated to kill as many enemies as possible brings more results. Many people then used their own automotive equipment. Most of the people who came came with their own gear. I ordered my plate carrier, for example, as far as I remember, in December or January. Because I thought it would all start in January. Because all the signs were there. And then at the beginning of a large-scale invasion, I found myself in the 95th Airborne Assault Brigade. The intelligence and sabotage group -Bravo- was formed there, and I joined it. She performed one of the tasks in 2022 in the Kyiv region in the area of ​​Kopylyv and Motyzhyn settlements. Thanks to the work of the group, many enemy armored vehicles were burned in that direction. I also want to add that our 3rd Battle Tank inflicted the main damage and liberated such settlements as Korolivka, and then Kopyliv and Motyzhyn, where the Bravo reconnaissance group worked before that. &#8230;In the summer of 2022, I performed tasks in the Kherson direction, already as part of the 46th Airmobile Brigade. I was the head of a communications group in one of the battalions. -At zero- time passes in a completely different way. You've been there for, say, two weeks, but it feels like you've been there for months. Probably because it is constantly on adrenaline. Every day then, about 100 enemy shellings took place on our site. Even on the KSP, you could not sleep properly, because this artillery -badminton- was constantly happening over you. Because we were also responsible. Initially, I had a concussion in that direction&#8230; I was leaving the room and about ten meters from me I saw the first break of the enemy NURS, and the whole package lay diagonally from me. Later, at the KSP of the battalion - and he was almost in combat formations - I received a greeting in the form of a fragment of a high-explosive shell from an enemy tank. His crew, by the way, acted very competently. Before that, I tried to destroy it with the help of our artillery for about a week and a half. But on that day, an enemy tank hit a tree with a shell near the KSP, where we were. The deputy combatant and I flew the most. It immediately felt as if the legs were dipped in boiling water and left there. The bulk of the debris passed through the notebook in the side pocket and entered the leg. It's like a shot from a shotgun at close range. And two fragments passed below the knee, cut the nerve responsible for sensitivity&#8230; But the most important thing is that we destroyed that dance after all.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/pererizanyj-nerv-art-badminton-pomsta-vorozhomu-tanchyku-ta-orden-bogdana-hmelnyczkogo-istoriya-kapitana-tkachuka/	2025-01-07T23:07:08-08:00

It became known how many Ukrainians voted for members of the Public Anti-Corruption Council	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informs about this. Despite the DDoS attack, the technical team protected the voting process. Attempts to influence the course of the competition were stopped. It was because of such attacks on the Ukrainian IT infrastructure that voting was available only to users of Ukrainian networks. Some users noticed a significant number of votes from the same IP address. This is explained by the fact that the Ministry of Defense uses Cloudflare services to protect against cyber threats. Similar technologies can also be used on users' devices with enabled software tools that anonymize traffic (for example, Private Relay on macOS or iOS). As a result, the IP address 127.0.0.1 was registered in the voting logs for a number of users who voted. The identity of each user was verified through authorization through partner services BankID and Diya.Signature, and a specially appointed rapid response team monitored the transparency of the process. Special attention was paid to ensuring the possibility of voting for military personnel at the front. Thanks to access to the site through Starlink terminals and technical support, defenders were also able to participate in the elections of the anti-corruption council. The results of the online voting have been submitted to the Competition Commission for verification and will be officially released within 5 working days. As reported ArmyInform, last week 717 citizens applied to the recruiting centers of the Ukrainian army with questions about entering the military service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/stalo-vidomo-skilky-ukrayincziv-progolosuvaly-za-chleniv-gromadskoyi-antykorupczijnoyi-rady/	2025-01-07T21:06:10-08:00

As reported by ArmyInform, soldiers of the battalion of unmanned aerial systems -Rarog- -stayetsya-z-tehnikoyu-rf-na-ukrayinskij-zemli/->destroyed two Russian BMD-4, two BMP-2 and hit two T-80 tanks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/za-dobu-159-boyezitknen-vorog-ne-prosunuvsya-na-zhodnomu-z-napryamkiv/	2025-01-07T21:02:01-08:00
How to shoot down an X-101 missile: a master class from anti-aircraft gunman Andrii Panchokha	How it is to shoot down air targets from an anti-aircraft gun and from a MANPADS system, the defender of the sky told the correspondent of ArmiyaInform: -The portable anti-aircraft missile system -Igla- is a simple weapon, nothing complicated, as far as I'm concerned. You just need to -capture- the target. And given the characteristics of the weapon, understand whether you will get it. Of course, you are given a command, a colleague with an aerial situation tablet in his hands tells you from which direction the target is coming, what is the azimuth, course, range&#8230; And you are already scrolling through your head, taking everything into account. So I worked on November 17 this year. A lot of rockets were flying by the enemy at that time. The rocket enters behind. I can see her clearly. The platoon commander shouts to me: -Shoot!-. Two seconds - and my anti-aircraft missile enters the target. I'm waiting I see that I hit it. Russian cruise missile shot down and falling. And then there was the effective combat work of December 13. Our mobile fire group moved into position. We have already been informed that enemy missiles are flying in our direction. Proved course and direction information. It was seven o'clock in the morning. I see that the enemy missile is coming, and I instantly make a -stab-, that is, I activate the power battery on the MANPADS. They just gave the command that it is possible to fire from MANPADS. The target enters. I launch, knock down and she falls. It all took one minute. After searching for the wreckage and analyzing the combat work, it was established that in both of these cases, the mobile fire group shot down the Kh-101 missiles. &#8230;In order to become a MANPADS anti-aircraft gunner, I learned to use the complex on a simulator. In my opinion, it is more difficult to hit a target on a simulator than in real air combat. In total, four missiles were shot down in my combat account. We destroyed the first two with anti-aircraft guns and small arms. I joined the Air Force in 2014. Then it was time to go to the army. They left together with a friend. He came to serve in the same unit where he once served his military service, in the anti-aircraft missile regiment. Participated in the defense of Donetsk Airport as part of the -Wild Duck- unit. It was a combined unit of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which defended the position of -Zenith-. Later, I was promoted to junior sergeant. He was the commander of the ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft installation department, the head of the radar station. Over time, he became the chief sergeant of the platoon. I'm on vacation now. When I hear about the launch of enemy missiles, I want to go on duty as soon as possible and hit some target again.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/yak-zbyty-raketu-h-101-majster-klas-vid-zenitnyka-andriya-panchohy/	2025-01-07T20:50:04-08:00
Heavenly punishment and a hot hunt for the invaders: -Fury- helps destroy the enemy at the front	Correspondents of ArmiyaInform visited the positions of the crew of the unmanned aerial reconnaissance and fire adjustment complex of the -Fury- artillery of the 148th separate artillery brigade of the Zhytomyr DSHV of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. By the way, the complex of Ukrainian production, which has deservedly earned the reputation of one of the most reliable and effective at the front. The positions of the boys are hidden in a Ukrainian village in the Donetsk region that was destroyed by the occupiers. The -place- is carefully disguised. Inside, there is a small room, a couch, a work table, and places to store UAVs. Let's get to know the crew: they are senior cameraman Oleksandr, pilot Mykhailo and signalman Bohdan. The guys talked about the combat capabilities of the drone, why reconnaissance of the front edge and the depth of the enemy's battle formations is important, at what distance the -Fury- can adjust the fire of our artillery on the targets of the anti-aircraft guns, and whether it really works in the mode of operation of enemy EW. The complex consists of three UAVs, three day payload modules and two night payload modules, a ground control and information processing station, an antenna and additional equipment. Oleksandr, the senior operator of the -Furia- complex, says that there is no way at the front without this UAV. Its main purpose is to conduct reconnaissance and identify the locations of the enemy: artillery installations, heavy armored vehicles, warehouses with ammunition, places of concentration of enemy infantry, etc. Plus the task of providing guidance on hitting targets and adjusting the fire of our artillery units. -Now, any movement on the front line, the approaches to it, as well as in the depth of the enemy's battle formations is almost impossible to hide. Usually, in our area of ​​responsibility, the occupiers use infantry to support tanks and artillery systems. How they mostly operate: to some point in the area, the enemy's armored vehicles deliver new -cannon fodder-, this is far from the line of contact, because they are afraid to go further. We find these places, and then our gunners destroy them. And this is just one of the typical examples of our daily work,- Oleksandr says. The paratrooper is 38 years old. He has been in the Armed Forces for almost a year and a half, mobilized, originally from the Dnipropetrovsk region. In civilian life, he was a simple electrician. -I studied like everyone else -from wheels-. The main thing is a desire to learn and constant training. I worked first on -maviks-, then switched to -wings-. Everywhere has its own peculiarities. Each technique is good in its own way. The pilot controls the UAV, the operator follows the flight, left-right, forward, control the movement. When the weather was normal, 9 flights were made. It all depends on the combat task and the circumstances,- Oleksandr shares. -Here on this section of the front, the flight range is up to 30 km. UAVs, of course, can fly even further. The flight time for this distance is up to one and a half hours. This is to fly to the destination, explore, adjust as needed and return successfully,- says pilot Mykhailo. He is 31 years old, from Ivano-Frankivsk region. Before the Great War, he worked abroad, then in Ukraine. In 2023, he enlisted in the army. He served for a short time in the 95th brigade, just when the formation of the 148th Artillery Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces began. -They said you will fly on wings, control a Furia-type UAV. Although I didn't even know what it was at that time. I said that I don't know how to drive trucks, I was then laughed at and told that it was a drone, not a car. Originally worked on the Estonian reconnaissance drone EOS. A month of training and on combat sorties. Later, he switched to -Furia-, Mykhailo recalls, smiling. Regarding other characteristics. The average speed of -Fury- is 70-80 kilometers per hour. It can fly at 120 km/h. The standard operating height is up to 1.5 km, although the -bird- can climb up to 2,500 meters. The guys say that speed is the main thing in their work, so the time to deploy the -wing- from the transport position is 5 minutes. -Furia- is able to work in semi-automatic and autonomous mode, as well as in -controlled camera- mode. It has protected digital control and data transmission channels, accurately determines the coordinates of enemy targets. Can automatically calculate corrections to adjust artillery fire on detected targets. Regarding installation of payload. These are day and night cameras for conducting reconnaissance. -Fury- works effectively under any weather conditions. Strong wind, rain, snow, frost do not harm her. We ask: is it resistant to the influence of the enemy's electronic warfare equipment. -We will not reveal our actions to the enemy. But I will say that we use some -tricks- in our work and we manage to -bypass- the means of the Electronic Security System of the Russian Federation. We carry out the combat mission in full,- Oleksandr explains. Everything is important here. You have to feel the technique. But the main thing is to navigate in the locality. For example, the pilot must constantly look at the indicators so that the board behaves -correctly-, that is, it acts correctly in the air. Day and night flights are very different. Sometimes a pilot perfectly navigates the area during the day, knows what and how, and at night the situation is completely different. It is necessary to visually remember landmarks and train. Of course, there is a program that significantly helps in piloting. It is very difficult to work when enemy EW suppresses the operation of the UAV. -Might sorties are always difficult, and even more so when suppressing the backup channel, or the video channel, or the -bird- itself. When you lose control of the video signal and so on. And you do not know any indicators, at what height the UAV is, where it is, where it was taken and, in principle, what is happening to it. This is a golden experience,- says Oleksandr. The value of using Fury at the front is obvious. The number of daily destroyed military targets of the Russian Federation in the Kurakhiv direction is a clear confirmation of this. Enemy artillery systems within the limits of counter-battery combat, armored vehicles, BMPs, tanks and even enemy air defense equipment are affected. -We work in close cooperation with all artillery units of the brigade, and sometimes we even adjust the fire of other units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which are equipped with HIMARS artillery systems. Once, during combat duty, an anti-aircraft missile complex of the Rashtites was discovered. The enemy target was located in the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region, more than 20 kilometers from the front line. The crew quickly recorded the coordinates of its location and handed it over to the gunners. The HIMARS calculation instantly reacted and destroyed the enemy's air defense system. In the same way, we help to -disassemble- the places where the Russians are concentrated, guns, self-propelled guns, tanks, and refueling stations. In a word, we are tracking the occupiers everywhere on our land. Once, during one sortie, -Fury- detected three -fat- racist targets: a camouflaged tank, a howitzer, and a -bekha-. This is a job we enjoy. Usually, the enemy hides equipment in forest plantations, in an urbanized area, in destroyed settlements. Masking the equipment doesn't help him much,- emphasize the guys from the crew of the -Fury- complex. But they add: they don't stay in one position for a long time, because you need to change your location often. The enemy also hunts them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/kara-nebesna-ta-garyache-polyuvannya-na-okupantiv-furiya-dopomagaye-nyshhyty-protyvnyka-na-fronti/	2025-01-07T20:32:39-08:00
Three-gun monster: A European consortium is working on a new version of the continental main battle ...	According to the experts of portal Popular Mechanics, after decades of stagnation, the world of main battle tanks is heating up again thanks to the war in Ukraine, ArmyInform notes. Among several new armored vehicles presented at the Eurosatory defense exhibition in Paris was the Enhanced Main Battle Tank, Ascalon Demonstrator Turret 140 or EMBT ADT 140. The EMBT is not only equipped with a 140mm main gun – the largest of any tank – but also mounted it has 20 mm and 30 mm automatic guns. The variety of guns reflects the range of threats that modern tanks face on the battlefield: from drones to fire duels with other tanks. During the presentation in the French capital, the EMBT ADT 140 was painted in contrasting gray-olive and black colors, emphasizing its difference from previous tanks. With its sharp angles and huge gun, it stood in stark contrast to other, more familiar tanks, including the American M1A2 Abrams and even the German Leopard 2A8 on display nearby. In turn, analysts of the Dutch defense site Army Recognition believe that it was developed by a joint venture KNDS, which combines the expertise of Nexter Systems from France and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) from Germany, EMBT aims to meet the current and future needs of European armored forces. This innovative platform embodies the continent's ambition to create a technologically advanced, autonomous defense capability. Launched in 2018, the EMBT project uses the strengths of two iconic battle tanks: the Leopard 2 and the Leclerc. By integrating the reliable and mobile Leopard 2 chassis with the Leclerc automated turret, the EMBT achieves a balance of mobility, firepower and adaptability. This hybrid design aims to redefine the standard for main battle tanks on the world stage, ensuring that they remain effective in the face of new threats. The EMBT design accommodates a crew of four, optimizing operation with two crew members in the turret (commander and gunner) and two in the hull (mechanic driver and combat operator). The tank's modular architecture ensures that it remains adaptable to future technological advances, a critical factor in the rapidly changing field of armored vehicles. The presentation of the EMBT-ADT 140 variant at Eurosatory 2024 was an important milestone. This upgraded version features the ASCALON 140mm cannon, a next-generation weapon designed to exceed current standards in range and destructive power. The developers claim that, thanks to the innovative automatic loader, the tank will be able to fire the first three rounds in 10 seconds, that is, with a record short break of 3 seconds. That being said, it is likely to be a new approach to the system using containers or rather -cassettes- for three shots, which will be fed from the ammunition stack in the aft part of the turret. The first of the secondary guns is a twin 20 mm gun mounted next to the main gun on the turret. Another, perhaps the most interesting, is the optional remote-controlled 30mm autocannon on the turret of the EMBT ADT 140. It also has a much smaller 7.62 machine gun mounted on a mini-turret that sits on the main turret. On the example of the machine, it is worth noting the growing tendency to strengthen the -anti-personnel- potential with an increase in the caliber of paired weapons, which on this machine was implemented in the form of a 20x102 mm automatic cannon with an ammunition of 300 rounds. According to release by KNDS, the tank features sensor fusion, artificial intelligence (AI), cybernetic and hybrid energy applications. However, it should be noted that what exactly it is about has not been made public. Designed with future interoperability in mind, this weapon meets the requirements of the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS), a long-term European defense initiative scheduled for deployment around 2035. To counter modern threats on the battlefield, the EMBT must incorporate modern defense technologies. They include active and passive armor, complemented by the Trophy Active Protection System (APS), which intercepts incoming projectiles before they hit. Additional features such as the E-LAWS laser warning system and GALIX smoke grenade launchers increase survivability by cloaking the tank in response to imminent threats. Multipurpose sensors provide 360-degree situational awareness, which is critical to countering challenges such as kamikaze drones and precision-guided munitions. The high-performance 1,500 horsepower EMBT engine provides an impressive range of 460 kilometers. Its adaptability to different environments, from open plains to urban environments, positions it as a versatile solution for modern warfare. Despite its technological promise, the EMBT program faces significant challenges. High development and production costs combined with system complexity may limit widespread adoption, especially among countries with limited defense budgets. The need for intensive crew training further complicates its deployment. Political and industrial differences between France and Germany also proved to be potential obstacles. Differing views on arms export policy, industrial sovereignty and the program's timeline could delay progress or require compromises that could affect the tank's ultimate capabilities. Recent trials of EMBT have demonstrated its operational relevance. The tests confirmed exceptional mobility in different terrains and proved the accuracy and power of the 140 mm ASCALON gun. The integration of advanced protection systems and sensors has proven effective against today's threats, enhancing EMBT's potential as an interim solution until the MGCS enters service. As told by /a> ArmyInform, in April 2024, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius and his French counterpart Sebastien Lecornu distributed national responsibilities for specific technologies within the framework of the MGCS. A total of eight components were identified: a platform with a chassis and automated navigation — under the leadership of the Federal Republic of Germany; In addition to France and Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Poland are interested in the project to varying degrees. Apart from its technical achievements, the EMBT is a cornerstone of European defense cooperation. In an uncertain geopolitical climate, the project underscores the strategic value of pooling resources and expertise to meet shared security needs. Bringing Nexter and KMW together, the initiative is an example of how collaboration can overcome national differences to achieve tangible results. The EMBT program is more than a next-generation battle tank; it is a testament to the potential of joint defense efforts in Europe. Its innovation and modular design make it ideal for today's operational needs, laying the foundation for future advancements. However, the success of the program will depend on overcoming financial and political obstacles to ensure its smooth progress. As Europe seeks to strengthen its strategic autonomy, the EMBT could become a defining element in the modernization of the continent's armed forces. Its development demonstrates the power of multinational defense cooperation, setting a precedent for future initiatives aimed at ensuring Europe's collective security in a rapidly changing global environment.

Bloody Pokrovsk in the style of Hollywood: Russian screenwriters write fake action movies	Such an accusation seems so absurd that it is difficult to take it seriously. But let's figure out why exactly this fake appeared, how it is spread and what goal the Kremlin masters of disinformation are trying to achieve. We are all already well acquainted with the tactics of Russian propaganda, when events are twisted so much that they become unrecognizable. One of their favorite tricks is to accuse Ukraine of allegedly carrying out terrorist attacks or mass crimes under the guise of Russian actions. This time they chose Pokrovsk, a city that is at risk due to constant Russian shelling. The propagandists decided to declare that the Armed Forces -plan to kill the civilian population- so that later -blame it on Russia-. However, they did not explain why Ukraine, which is constantly fighting for the trust of the international community, suddenly needed such self-discrediting. - was spread through Telegram channels controlled by the Kremlin. According to the standard set of manipulative techniques they use, this time the key ones are: - Links to -anonymous sources -. As usual, the propagandists do not provide any real evidence. All allegations are based on -reports- from unknown persons. - Engagement -experts-. So-called military analysts join the propaganda, convincing viewers that -the Armed Forces are capable of everything-.. span> - Using video without context. Fake news often publishes photos or videos that have nothing to do with Pokrovsk or the Armed Forces, but are accompanied by manipulative captions. - Link to emotions. Propagandists tell gruesome thriller-style details to sow panic and fear. Pokrovsk is close to the front line, and its residents face the consequences of Russian aggression every day. The choice of this city to create a fake is not accidental: Russian propaganda is trying to undermine the trust of local residents in the Ukrainian military, which protects them from the invaders. Such statements are also part of a wider disinformation campaign aimed at creating the impression that -Ukraine is a threat to its own citizens-. The main purpose of spreading this a fake is to divert attention from one's own crimes. After all, while Kremlin propagandists paint scenarios of fictitious -crimes of the Armed Forces-, Russian troops continue to shell civilian infrastructure, kill civilians and destroy Ukrainian cities. In addition, Russia is trying to undermine the credibility of Ukraine in the international arena, showing it as a state that -poses a threat- to its own citizens.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/kryvavyj-pokrovsk-u-styli-gollivudu-rosijski-sczenarysty-pyshut-fejkovi-bojovyky/	2025-01-07T20:06:53-08:00

-Five kilometers... This is a marathon of courage and brotherhood- — the story of -Bear-, who carrie...	His story was told in the operational command -North-. -I remember hearing the whistling of a mortar shell, then an explosion. Opening my eyes, I saw blood dripping from my shoulder onto my body armor, and every movement caused excruciating pain, and my comrade was wounded in the legs. I put tourniquets on him and put him on my shoulders,- said the fighter. According to him, every step seemed infinitely difficult - the bulletproof vest was pressing, his hand was shaking from pain. -Five kilometers&#8230; In combat conditions, this is more than distance. This is a marathon of courage, faith and brotherhood. Time passed, each new meter seemed like the last. We fell to the ground near the evacuation point - exhausted but alive,- the man recalled. For his courage and successful performance of tasks during the battle, Serhiy was awarded an honorary badge from the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the medal -Indomitable Heroes of the Russian-Ukrainian War-. As reported by ArmyInform, a Ukrainian F-16 fighter pilot during a massive attack by Russian troops in December 2024destroyed six enemy cruise missiles in one sortie. This is the first time in the history of the use of the American Fighting Falcon fighter.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/pyat-kilometriv-cze-marafon-muzhnosti-j-braterstva-istoriya-vedmidya-yakyj-na-plechi-nis-pobratyma-do-punktu-evakuacziyi/	2025-01-07T11:58:26-08:00
- We were stormed by both pros and homeless people or convicts - fighter Roman told about Robotyn's ...	His story was told at the General Staff of the Armed Forces. In the first days of the full-scale Russian invasion, he voluntarily joined the TCC, however, due to lack of military service, he was not accepted into the Armed Forces. In April 2023, Roman again volunteered and became a soldier of the 128th OGSHBr. -I got to the front line just before the counteroffensive in the summer of the 23rd, took part in the assaults, was the commander of a unit. It was hard fighting, but our company took a strip 1,200 meters wide and entrenched itself in the captured positions. the Russians have repeatedly tried to recover what was lost,- he said. According to him, he and his comrades held two points, one of which was a former Russian dugout. -And the enemy tank began to methodically -disassemble- them - in the morning, at noon and in the evening. Lupane from one position and hides, then from another position and hides again. They knew the location well,- Roman noted. During one of these attacks, a projectile hit an anti-tank mine in front of the bridge. -I was lying down and there was an explosion with a bright column of flame. Two comrades were sealed against the trench wall by the blast wave. One of them, coming to himself, shouted: -Elephant, where are you?- And then he saw my torn pants and said: -That's it, there is no Elephant-. I hear this and answer - here I am, everything is fine. I only got a concussion,- he recalled. Roman said that at night they were changed in their positions. -When we were leaving, my friend noticed two shrapnel holes in my hood. I always put a hood over my helmet, it's made of a strong, slippery fabric and it saved me - the shrapnel ricocheted instead of penetrating the helmet. I was very lucky then. And there were many such situations,- he assures. Roman has the most difficult combat memories from defending Robotyny. At that time, Ukrainian infantrymen withstood constant Russian assaults with the support of armored vehicles. -We were stormed by both pros and some homeless people or convicts without body armor and automatic weapons, with only grenades. We took many prisoners then. There were a lot of enemy corpses from past battles lying there - only bones and Russian jackets remained, no one took them away,' Roman remarked. Recently, classes with newly arrived fighters have been added to his duties. Before being sent to combat positions, everyone undergoes special training in conditions close to combat. -I immediately see how ready a person is. Sometimes, a beginner starts to get lost, he may, for example, not take the machine gun by the fuse and turn the barrel at his comrades. You have to work with them additionally. A significant part of the recruits understands where they got to, they will be useful. Although training is one thing, combat missions are another,- he remarked. Before each exit, Roman asks his group if everyone is ready. -Sometimes a fighter says he's ready, but I see he's not. Then I say wait, you will go next time. -I don't need problems at zero,- said the man. Carrying out difficult and dangerous combat missions made Roman a cold-blooded and sensible person. He treats young, healthy men who are resting and having fun in the rear without emotion. -If he doesn't want to fight, then there won't be much of him here. I personally will not take such a person to the position, because he cannot be relied on in a critical situation. I will tell you about such a case. One of our fighters successfully passed the training, but when he first got into combat positions, he couldn't do it - it didn't work for him. For some time he performed various tasks in the rear, was in another platoon, then he got to me. We talked periodically on different topics, and then I asked - are you ready to fight or not? -Ready,- he says. And he was able, he succeeded, he even became the commander of the department&#8230; Each of us has a fear, I was also afraid,- Roman emphasized. He has a comrade with the callsign -Bumper-, who was injured during a combat trip, after which he cannot fight. -Very good attack aircraft. He returned to us and is engaged in security, for which he is respected. But he will not go on combat tours due to his health. This is how one good person falls out, the other&#8230; New ones come in their place, and everyone has to find their own approach, start all over again. This is war&#8230;-, Roman summed up. As reported by ArmyInform, a Ukrainian F-16 fighter pilot during a massive attack by Russian troops in December 2024destroyed six enemy cruise missiles in one sortie. This is the first time in the history of the use of the American Fighting Falcon fighter.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/nas-shturmuvaly-yak-profi-tak-i-yakis-bomzhi-chy-zeky-boyecz-roman-rozpoviv-pro-oboronu-robotynogo/	2025-01-07T11:21:33-08:00

This was the forecast made by the Russian Academy of Sciences in its annual report -Russia and the World: 2025-.

Iran asks India to help circumvent US sanctions	This is reported by /a> Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. This proposal was voiced during the 19th Indian-Iranian political dialogue at the level of the foreign ministries of these countries, which took place on January 2-3 of the new year. Trade between India and Iran declined in mid-2019 when New Delhi halted purchases of Iranian oil due to the threat of secondary sanctions from the US.

It is a competitor to the Chinese-funded Gwadar port in Pakistan. The resumption of oil trade and the development of the Chabahar port is strategically important for Iran, as it allows bypassing US sanctions and increasing trade with Central Asia, India and other regions. In addition, it opens up the possibility of bypassing international sanctions for Russia, giving it access to the Indian Ocean.

About this on the air -Social News- Captain Yury Fedorenko, commander of the battalion of unmanned attack aircraft complexes -Achilles- of the 92nd Assault Brigade named after Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirk, said. According to him, Russian generals continue to -press- on commanders, sending their troops into battle, the results of these assaults are far from meeting expectations: lost tanks and armored vehicles are only part of their -achievements-. -The Russians lost almost 100 units of armored vehicles just to enter Kruglyakivka. As for the losses among the infantry, they are even greater, and it is even difficult to calculate the exact number,- Yuriy Fedorenko said. Despite the active attempts of the enemy to break through the defense, our defenders continue to hold their positions. Yuriy Fedorenko reported that in the last week the enemy tried to conduct an assault four times using tanks and light armored vehicles. -The enemy often uses rolling tactics, when tanks with trawlers clear the way, and light armored vehicles that transport infantry move behind them. They try to land the attack aircraft quickly and then withdraw the equipment, regroup the attack aircraft and attack again,- he explained. Oleksandr Danylenko also noted that during the last enemy attack, in which the enemy used ten units of equipment, five units were destroyed, and another five were hit. -After that, the occupiers decided to try again and advance under the cover of fog, but we detected them and destroyed 4 more vehicles, including a tank and three BMPs,- he added.

- Creeping tactics of the invaders: why the Russians emphasize the use of infantry	told about this on the telethon -Edyny Novyny- > Orest Drymalovskyi, representative of the press service of the 79th Tavrian Assault Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to him, compared to the end of November and the beginning of December last year, when the Russians used armored vehicles more actively, now their assault actions are mostly limited to infantry. -The occupiers use creeping tactics.- They are trying to advance in small groups of up to 7 people in order to infiltrate our forward positions unnoticed. These groups try to bypass minefields, but it is extremely rare to break through our defenses. To get to the front edge, they have to have several lives at once,- explained Orest Drymalovskyi. At the same time, the Russian group in the Kurakhiv direction is one of the largest and has a lot of manpower to continue attacks. In particular, units are constantly replenished with mobilized personnel to maintain a high offensive intensity. -Now, one of the largest groups on the entire front line is located in the Kurakhiv direction. Russian units consist mainly of conscripts who undergo two weeks of training and go into battle. Also, the invaders maintain a high rate of rotations in order to constantly attack. However, most of these units quickly lose their combat capability, and they are forced to enter additional reserves,- explained the representative of the press service of the 79th brigade. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Kurakhiv direction of the Forces -kurshhyni/->defenses repelled 26 attacks on the positions of our troops near Slovianka, Srybny, Andriivka, Petropavlivka, Kurakhovo and Dachny.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/povzucha-taktyka-okupantiv-chomu-rosiyany-roblyat-akczent-na-vykorystannya-pihoty/	2025-01-07T03:18:25-08:00

This domestically produced reconnaissance-strike robotic complex easily overcomes various landscape obstacles, and can also be equipped with a machine gun to destroy enemy infantry and work on its firing points. In addition, thanks to some improvements, this drone, which the fighters affectionately nicknamed -Butterfly- due to its small size, can be used to evacuate the wounded and deliver ammunition and provisions. -The wonderful appearance and small dimensions of this baby can easily mislead and, at first glance, it seems as if you are in front of a child's toy on the control panel. But when you follow the front-line work of the -miracle machine-, it takes your breath away: we have pride, the enemies have fear,- the Armed Forces emphasized.

The Ukrainian F-16 pilot set a historical record by shooting down six cruise missiles in one sortie	wrote the head of public relations service of the Air Command wrote about this Colonel Yuriy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Ignat. As Yuriy Ignat noted, the massive shelling took place on December 13, 2024. The enemy launched almost 200 drones, as well as dozens of ballistic and cruise missiles. The main target of the Ukrainian fighter was cruise missiles, the interception of which is a difficult task. The Ukrainian pilot used all four air-to-air missiles on board the F-16 to shoot down four cruise missiles. However, seeing another target, the pilot decided to use the aircraft gun. -Shooting down cruise missiles with a cannon is very risky because of the high speed of the target and the danger of detonation. But I acted as the instructors in the US taught me, and I managed to hit. As it turned out, two missiles flying next to each other were destroyed at the same time,- the pilot said. This case became unique: for the first time in history, an F-16 pilot destroyed six cruise missiles in one flight, two of them with the help of an aircraft gun. After the successful completion of the task, the pilot was greeted with applause at the airport. His success caused admiration not only among the Ukrainian military, but also in the United States. Although not the most advanced F-16 modifications were transferred to Ukraine, Ukrainian pilots demonstrate exceptional skills every day, using the available equipment to the maximum. This record is proof of their professionalism and fighting spirit. The Ukrainian Air Force expects even more modern weapons, in particular the F-35, which together with experienced pilots will become a powerful force in deterring aggression in Europe.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/ukrayinskyj-pilot-f-16-vstanovyv-istorychnyj-rekord-zbyvshy-shist-krylatyh-raket-za-odyn-vylit/	2025-01-07T01:48:35-08:00

Effective procurement: fuel and lubricants for the Armed Forces have become cheaper than the average...	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. -The procedures that DOT specialists began to apply in 2024 made it possible to make the procurement process more transparent and improve its efficiency. Thanks to this, the DOT purchased PMM at prices lower than the average market, which allowed the Ministry of Defense to save significant funds,- noted the director of the Internal Audit Department, Colonel Oleksandr Tytkovskyi. In particular, it was analyzed that in 2022-2023 DRZ specialists conducted purchases without regulated and substantiated approaches to determining the size of the expected cost of fuel and lubricant materials. This indicator was determined on the basis of the provided price offers of suppliers, with whom contracts were subsequently concluded. Taking into account the absence of competitive procurement procedures, this led to an overestimation of the cost of purchased products. For its part, the DOT Ministry of Defense uses a regulated and justified approach to determining the size of the expected cost of the PMM. In addition, the -State rear operator- ensured the conduct of competitive procedures using the electronic procurement system in 97% of cases. Thanks to this, price overpricing in the purchase of fuel and lubricants has not been established. Moreover, this indicator was lower than the average market prices. And according to the results of the auctions, the actual prices were lower than the announced size of the expected value by an average of 5.4%. -The DOT's implementation of competitive procedures for the purchase of fuel and lubricants from the beginning of 2024 to September ensured budget savings in the amount of over 867 million hryvnias. At the same time, the expenses for the activities of the DOT in this direction were reduced to less than UAH 60 million,- stated Colonel Oleksandr Tytkovskyi. As reported by ArmyInform, DOT purchased dyed diesel fuel for the needs Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/efektyvni-zakupivli-palyvno-mastylni-materialy-dlya-zsu-staly-deshevshymy-za-serednorynkovi/	2025-01-07T01:22:31-08:00
Defense forces destroy the enemy in the Kupyan region: Novomlynsk under the blue-yellow flag	About this on the air -Society.News- Captain Yury Fedorenko, commander of the battalion of unmanned attack aircraft complexes -Achilles- of the 92nd Assault Brigade named after Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirk, said. -Adverse weather conditions are something that the enemy tries to use as much as possible. With any kind of precipitation, fog, strong gusts of wind, the effectiveness of reconnaissance UAVs, both for us and for the enemy, decreases. However, during the three years of full-scale war, the Defense Forces learned to operate in all weathers. In adverse weather conditions, we use other means of detection and observation, so today we managed to inflict fire damage on the enemy's infantry, which was trying to accumulate and carry out shock-assault actions in the direction of Lozova and Zagryzovo,- Yuriy Fedorenko noted. Despite the enemy's activity, the Defense Forces of Ukraine are holding their positions. In particular, the units successfully blocked the attempts of the occupiers to move upstream in the direction of Kolesnikivka. And on the left bank of Kupyansk, near Kupyansk-Vuzlovoy, the enemy did not manage to realize their plans, even despite numerous assaults. -The enemy is trying to take advantage of the weather conditions to use boats to cross to the right bank of the river in the Dvorichny area. However, our units detect the enemy around the clock and inflict fire damage,- Yuriy Fedorenko said. According to him, Ukrainian forces continue to drive out the occupiers from settlements in the Kupyan region. In particular, Russian troops have completely lost control in Novomlynsk, and a blue-yellow flag is already flying over the village. -In general, the situation in the direction remains dynamic, but the enemy does not manage to implement their plans,- concluded Captain Yury Fedorenko.

How the TCC crushed Russian paratroopers — the story of the Poltava Wolf from the -Odin- squad	One such example is the story of Lieutenant Dmytro Vovka from Poltava, which shared operational command -North- of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He joined the defense of the Motherland from the first days of the full-scale Russian invasion. -On the morning of February 24, they told me to come with my things. I reported at work, went home to park the car and arrived at the TCC. I understood that the unit to which they wanted to send me was no longer relevant. Because in the first days, no one understood where the Russian troops would reach, where they could and could not pass. That's why I was enrolled in the security company of the regional TCC,- the fighter recalls. At that time, a separate combined assault unit -Odin- was formed under the Poltava district TCC and SP, as part of which Dmytro went on his first combat mission in the Bakhmut district. -At the end of June, we were already in position in the trenches, in a landing near the Vuglehirskaya thermal power plant. Then I saw war for the first time. We drive into Bakhmut — I see -mushrooms- of explosions. I think, well, it's a war, no big deal. They were in position for 7 days. There were no battles as such - the enemy shot at us, but from afar. This may have saved us, because it was the first experience for most of us,- the soldier shared. In the future, Dmytro Vovk visited various areas, including Lymanskyi, repelling enemy positions in Serebryansk Forestry. -I received the task to go in with my platoon and change the assault group in the positions where they were entrenched. We stayed there for six days. We were intensively stormed, the unit suffered losses. Unfortunately, it was not possible to collect all the dead. This is my personal pain&#8230; The soldier carrying the property and weapons of the wounded asked for help. We loaded everything into the car, and when we were leaving, for the first time in my life, I saw a KAB fly to the position,- the officer said. In general, the -Odin- detachment was in the Limansk direction for almost two months, and its opponent there turned out to be well-trained Russian paratroopers with a wide arsenal of weapons. -They used aviation, &#8220;Hradi,&#8221;, artillery, mortars against us. They simply went to the assaults, lined up in a chain. Of course, there was an understanding that either we or they. And we already had combat experience, so we managed to repel assaults. I am proud of my boys! Even then, I told them: if the Ivanivsk paratroopers knew that they were being crushed by the TCC, they would be very ashamed,- Dmytro jokes. At the same time, he expressed regret that there are still people in society who do not understand how much responsibility has fallen on the shoulders of the Ukrainian military, in particular, representatives of the TCC. -Sometimes they tell me to go and fight alone.- I answer that I fought while they lived comfortably in the rear. And the answer is -it's a bad fight if you talk.- In these people, I believe, fear speaks. They are afraid to change something in their lives, they cannot dare to act as an adult citizen. There are those who later change their minds, but not all, unfortunately. They also ask -why me?- I say, look: I went alone so that you would have these rights and freedoms. But you also have responsibilities. And no, then Russia will come, establish a totalitarian regime, and no one will even communicate with you,- explained the fighter. As reported by ArmiyaInform, with the beginning of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine, many citizens who had no relation to the army and connected their lives exclusively with civilian professions came to its defense. href=-https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/02/redaktor-perekladach-nyshhyt-vorozhu-tehniku-dobrovolecz-zsu-rozpoviv-pro-polyuvannya-na-rosijski-tanky/->among whom it turned out and an editor-translator with the call sign -Rumin-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/yak-tczk-kroshylo-rosijskyh-desantnykiv-istoriya-poltavskogo-vovka-iz-zagonu-odin/	2025-01-07T00:49:57-08:00

DOT purchased dyed diesel fuel for the needs of the Armed Forces	informs about this State rear operator. In order to maintain transparency and competition, DOT insisted on the identification of at least two independent manufacturers of paint additives. This allowed bidders to choose between different partners to provide fuel painting. This approach significantly increased the competitiveness of procedures, promoting a fair fight among participants. Special attention was paid to checking the physical and chemical properties of dyes and studying their effect on fuel. The conducted tests confirmed that dyes do not deteriorate the quality of products. Coloring makes it possible to identify and trace fuel that was purchased exclusively for the needs of the Armed Forces, and reduces the possibility of its illegal sale. The purchase was made with additional proven financing in December 2024. The DOT team quickly prepared and executed procurement through Prozorro. Thus, it ensured the availability of transitional fuel residues at the beginning of 2025. This made it possible to ensure a continuous supply of fuel for the military to carry out missions. The state rear operator demonstrates a successful combination of flexibility in planning, transparency and competitive procurement, which are important factors in the effective supply of the military.

Five months of the Kursk operation: the enemy lost more than 38,000 soldiers and hundreds of pieces ...	This was notified by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The operation of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation, which began on August 6, 2024, became the next stage of the resistance to Russian aggression and the struggle for the independence of our state. For the first time in 11 years of war, hostilities were transferred to the territory of Russia. The General Staff of the Armed Forces emphasized that the Kursk operation was aimed at preventing the enemy's offensive in the Sumy region and creating a -buffer zone-. The operation forced the Russian occupiers to transfer significant resources to the Kursk region, weakening their positions in other areas of the front. The invaders brought some of the most combat-ready units of the airborne troops, marines and special forces there. Also, Russia was forced to urgently ask for help from North Korea, which sent almost 12 thousand of its soldiers to the Russian Federation.

Digital video signal, homing and… cruise control: FPV drones with artificial intelligence will soon ...	A platoon of engineers is required to test and, in the vast majority of cases, refine, rework, and reprogram the resulting FPVs to meet current needs and combat realities. — This is the room where we collect all the batches of drones we receive. We sort them by size, control frequencies, video signal frequencies. This is necessary to understand where what lies for further work specifically with each drone. Here are -sevens- at 5.8 GHz, here -sevens- at 1.2 GHz, here -tens- at 5.8 GHz, etc., says Oleksiy, showing one of the rooms where the engineering platoon works. 5.8 GHz and 1.2 GHz are the video transmission radio frequencies. -Seven- and -ten- is the size of FPV drones, which is measured in inches across the diagonal of the UAV. Seven-inch ones have a diagonal of almost 18 cm, ten-inch ones - a little more than 25 cm. Its carrying capacity and flight range depend on the size of the drone and the power of the engines. A larger drone can lift a heavier and more powerful battery and, accordingly, ammunition, which can weigh up to 4 kg. Almost all drones that the unit receives from various sources - both from the state and from volunteers - need to be improved. Such that the UAV can be launched immediately, just by taking it out of the box, almost does not happen. — There is almost no such thing as making the drone work out of the box. It's like when the manufacturer asks what and how we need to produce right now and we give him a detailed description. Then the drone already arrives ready, it is enough to check it, fly around it and go into battle. But it is not often possible to do this - usually we finish the FPV already here, - says the platoon commander. This does not mean that the drone is completely rebuilt - it is about installing or replacing one or two parts, such as an antenna or a video transmitter, as well as downloading a package of necessary programs. The task of the -engineer- is to give FPV pilots ready to use In another room away from the warehouse, work is boiling - several specialists are soldering, removing and installing parts, choosing antennas, programming and testing the assembled drones. The complete setup of one UAV takes about 30 minutes on average. Military personnel do everything necessary to ensure that pilots on the front lines worked with maximum efficiency and at the same time had a minimum of additional work. Each of the specialists has a strong engineering and IT background, so they pick up any new information on the fly. — We solder everything ahead of time, install everything. The pilot can only work in software. If necessary, if the drone suppresses the enemy's EW, it can directly change signal channels from the remote control, switch and fly to others, - emphasizes the platoon commander, - says Oleksiy. — Here there is an outdated frequency for control, but it is not suitable for us in combat conditions. Therefore, we install others - depending on the specific day when the FPV will go to combat work. We are also installing a program that allows the pilot right in the dugout on the front line to change frequencies - and the drone will fly to the ones that are needed - shows one of the UAVs Oleksii. This is one of the typical situations where it is necessary to change the frequency of the signal, because a batch of drones manufactured earlier is no longer relevant to the existing requirements. Also, sometimes manufacturers who work with small batches of UAVs install parts on them that cannot be used in combat conditions. — But more work needs to be done here, because video transmitters are installed on these drones, which are no longer suitable for combat conditions. Firstly, it is not powerful, and secondly, it is easier for the enemy to intercept the pilot's video with such components. That's why we take them out and put in ones that are suitable for combat work, the specialist explains. Before sending the drones to the front line, specialists must check them in the field - install -props- (propellers) and fly the drones on the training ground. This makes it possible to make sure that UAVs do not have hidden defects or to eliminate them if found. — We conduct drone stress tests — fly far, fly with weight. We check the revolutions of the motors and see where the -props- are spinning. This is very important, because it happens that something goes wrong with the speed controller - you start the drone, and the propellers spin in different directions. Then it does not take off and turn over - and God forbid that this should happen with an already installed BC, - explains Oleksiy. So, after working with drones in the workshop, we then go to the training ground to test the operation of the UAV. Usually, such test and training flights are attended by combat crews of pilots who are taken from the front line for rest. This allows at the same time to teach pilots the basic skills needed to repair or adjust a drone in a dugout environment. - Every engineer is a good pilot, and every pilot is a good engineer. Of course, everyone has to do their job, but pilots should be able to quickly fix some of the simplest problems with the drone. -We have pretty cool guys with good engineering schools, so they pick up all the information quickly,- says the platoon commander. Now there are no pilots with us, so the engineers test the UAV on their own, confidently demonstrating a high level of piloting. The drones rapidly rise into the sky and, after flying several hundred meters in a few minutes, return to the starting point. With and without weight, all FPVs tested today perform almost flawlessly. — In case of fixing problems, we hand over the drones for revision, but this happens rarely, because the guys are already in the workshop preparing them very well. Small defects that sometimes occur are -fixed- already within the framework of the flight, says the engineer. The drone experiences the greatest load during takeoff, especially with significant weight. It is at this time that the battery -sags- as much as possible. Sharp maneuvering also leads to a significant loss of charge. Therefore, to preserve the battery, the pilot should go to cruising altitude and speed and avoid excessive movements of the drone. — When the FPV has already gained momentum, it is much easier to fly and the battery discharges gradually and evenly. The pilot must monitor the charge level, because in the event of a sudden discharge of the battery, the protection may activate, it will turn off and the drone will simply fall, - explains Oleksiy. You should monitor the on-board indicators especially carefully in winter, because the battery charge is lost faster in low temperature conditions. Therefore, until the moment of going to the target, you should save the charge as much as possible, which will be needed for fast and sharp maneuvering. Another important technical detail is when the charge detonation initiation board is turned on. This should be done at the moment when the drone flies past the forward positions of the Defense Forces in order to maximally protect the Ukrainian military in the event of force majeure. In the event that a drone with an activated initiation board accidentally falls into enemy territory, the combat unit will immediately detonate and prevent the enemy from taking possession of the entire ready-to-use Ukrainian UAV and investigating it. — The general rule is that the initiation fee is reduced as soon as we fly our positions. Then, if the drone falls or is shot down, the warhead will definitely detonate, because it is in the -gray zone- and in the territory of the enemy, says the platoon commander. The next extremely significant -feature- is to take off at minimum video signal power. This does not allow the enemy to catch the signal and see the place from which the drones launch the UAV. If the drone takes off at maximum power, it will make the task easier for the enemy and put the servicemen at unnecessary risk. In addition, the safety of the pilots is guaranteed by the so-called -Curtain- - a special program that blocks the video signal during the take-off of the drone. With her help, the military, raising the UAV into the sky, -closes- the video on the screen. When the drone flies to a safe distance, the -curtain- can be removed, because the enemy will no longer be able to see and calculate the place of take-off. — This is a program of a Ukrainian developer, it is used by many units, not only us, — says Oleksiy. Finally, to increase the range of the radio horizon, repeaters are used, which are raised on a mast or installed on an auxiliary drone on the basis of an Autel quadcopter. It can rise to a height of several meters and significantly increase the range of radio signal transmission. — The maximum working height is 150 meters, but it all depends on the altitude map in a specific sector. We usually put the repeater on Autel, because it has a higher load capacity, fly a few hundred meters away from the dugout - and we can already work, says the military man. Such a simple trick greatly expands the radio horizon within which FPV drones can operate. In combat conditions, this greatly helps drones to hit the enemy in their rear at the maximum possible depth from the line of battle. Among the promising innovations that can radically change the capabilities of FPV on the battlefield, Oleksiy mentions the transition to the provision of digital video communication, the spread of automatic guidance of the drone to the target with the help of artificial intelligence, and the so-called cruise control. Digital video communications are virtually impossible to jam and absolutely impossible to intercept. Nothing needs to be changed in it, because it itself -automatically jumps frequencies at an extremely high speed.- An adversary can see that a data packet is being transmitted, but cannot interfere with it in any way or use it for his own benefit. — We have drones where several sets of video frequencies are implemented, which we will not reveal to the enemy, as well as how this is implemented. But when they think they push the video and it works, we have some trump cards that allow us to control the flight further and hit the targets. They think that they are -suppressing- our video, because their suppression works, and we fly further, because we now have a digital camera that is almost impossible to suppress, - explains Oleksiy. Another innovation that is already being used on the battlefield and will soon become more widespread is an automatic homing system based on artificial intelligence. It allows you to hit targets protected by powerful EW devices. - These are boards for the case when the target needs to be destroyed by any means - a drone with artificial intelligence and a homing system. There is a computer here, I won't say which one, a special camera, it can capture a target several hundred meters away and you can already transfer control and then it hits the target on autopilot, says the military man. The only downside to digital video communication and AI homing is the higher final cost of an FPV drone. However, these are relatively small amounts in terms of benefits from combat work. Oleksiy does not reveal all the secrets, but he reports on another innovation - the so-called cruise control, which allows the drone to fly on autopilot in a given square despite being suppressed by enemy EW means. - There will be a new release soon, where a super convenient feature for pilots is added - cruise control. This is when the coordinates are given to the drone and it goes to them in autopilot mode on its own - it flies past all the REBs, any suppression, - says the platoon commander. He predicts the mass distribution of these and a number of other innovations at the front in about 5-6 months - already at the end of spring or at the beginning of summer next year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/czyfrovyj-videosygnal-donavedennya-ta-kruyiz-kontrol-fpv-drony-zi-shtuchnym-intelektom-skoro-na-peredovij/	2025-01-06T20:49:45-08:00
Bridges are not afraid of tanks: Sweden ordered a batch of amphibious bridge crossings M3	As the portal European Security &amp; The defense contract was signed by the Swedish procurement agency Försvarets Materielverk (FMV) with the amphibious systems manufacturer General Dynamics European Land Systems (GDELS) — Bridge Systems, ArmyInform reports. The deal is part of a project to deliver 25 bridges between 2025 and 2027 under a SEK 400 million ($39.2 million) contract. -It's extremely positive that we were able to take advantage of this opportunity,- said Jonas Lötsne, chief of operations at the Swedish Land Forces' Defense Materiel Administration. -This means that the combat units of the Army get a rapidly built communication system, more than for a single brigade. And it will happen much sooner than we thought possible.- The M3 amphibious bridge vehicles are used for a variety of missions, from combat to civilian, including during flooding to guide crossings or evacuation. The M3 system consists of self-propelled amphibious ferries on wheeled chassis with an integrated deployable bridge span. The M3 system has a load capacity of MLC 85 (77.11 tons) for tracked vehicles and MLC 132 (119.75 tons) for wheeled vehicles. In particular, it can support the weight of main battle tanks, including the Challenger 2, Leopard 2 and M1A2 Abrams. The M3 Amphibious Bridge and Ferry System can carry all NATO vehicles and military equipment and is capable of forming a 100m floating bridge in less than 10 minutes. On the march, the equipment works as a 4×4 wheeled vehicle with a maximum road speed of 80 km/h. The M3 self-deploys on a follow path to create a crossing. Before it is launched into the water for the amphibious operation, two large aluminum pontoons detach and deploy along the hull of their transporter. The amphibious system is operated by a crew of two. The crew exits the vehicle cab to maneuver the pontoon using controls located on the top of the transporter body. When moving through the water, the M3 is propelled and controlled by two fully movable pump nozzles at speeds of up to 14 km/h. These transport vessels will be equipped with -Arctic kits-, which will allow them to be operated in cold climatic conditions. Interestingly, the Swedish armed forces tested the M3 system 20 years ago, but due to geopolitical changes (the global war on terrorism) and the shrinking economy, the project was later postponed. FMV experience gained during these tests is now mainly implemented, reports Polish portal Military Magazine. Currently, M3 kits have also been delivered to the armed forces of Germany, Great Britain, Indonesia, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Latvia and Slovakia.

Matzka hysterit: Turkish bairaktars are not friends with propaganda	Turkey, as a manufacturer of advanced unmanned aerial systems such as the Bayraktar TB2, plays an important role in strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities. However, such cooperation causes significant irritation of the Kremlin, which in its traditional manner resorted to information attacks. The latest data indicate that Russian special services have launched a large-scale campaign aimed at discrediting the Ukrainian-Turkish partnership. The main goal is to create tension between Kyiv and Ankara, question Turkey's reliability as an ally and undermine trust in its technology. Now we propose to consider the key narratives of Russian propaganda. Propagandists are spreading fake videos with alleged -evidence- that the Bayraktar TB2 does not live up to expectations on the battlefield. These materials are actively disseminated through the Kremlin-controlled media, as well as on social networks and Telegram channels. In the information space, the perception of Turkey's -double game- is being actively created. They said that Ankara supplies drones to Ukraine, but at the same time trades with Russia in energy resources, which allegedly calls into question its sincerity. the Russian mass media manipulate facts about the financial aspects of cooperation, trying to convince that Ukraine is allegedly unable to fully pay contracts with Turkey, due to which the latter has lost trust in its partner. For the Kremlin, Ukraine is not only an enemy, but also an example of resistance that is not included in the plans of Russian imperial policy. Turkey, as an ally of Ukraine, prevents these plans by helping the Armed Forces to increase its combat capability. In addition, Turkey is developing joint projects with Ukraine in the spheres of space, shipbuilding and the production of new types of weapons, which significantly increases Ukraine's defense capabilities. The success of such a partnership undermines Russia's position in the geopolitical arena. In order to expose Russian information attacks, it is important: Russia is not only waging a war on the battlefield, but also an information war, trying to discredit everything that strengthens the defense of Ukraine. The campaign against military-technical cooperation with Turkey is another attempt to weaken our country. However, this disinformation wave only emphasizes the importance of the Ukrainian-Turkish partnership. Only by joining forces will we be able to overcome this challenge and continue the path to victory.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/maczkva-istyerit-tureczki-bajraktary-ne-druzhat-z-rospropagandoyu/	2025-01-06T20:21:04-08:00
-Christ is baptized- in Donetsk region: paratroopers celebrated the frontline Epiphany	ArmyInform visited the glorious 46th Brigade at the Vodokhreshche front. This year's Epiphany or Jordan - these are the traditional folk names of the holiday - the paratroopers met near the battle line in Donetsk region. Today's celebration of Jordan among paratroopers is organized with observance of not only church rites and folk traditions, but also strict military discipline. Despite the fact that we are quite far from the front, only a few people gather at the same time on the shore of a small reservoir. &nbsp; Fighters come in twos or threes to read a common prayer and chat with the chaplain, dive into a pre-cut hole in the thin ice, and quickly get dressed and warm up in a heated tent. As it should be in Vodokhreshche, it is frosty outside, so hot tea with sandwiches is very appropriate. - Today we remember how Jesus Christ came to John the Baptist and was baptized by him. For Christians, this is one of the great holidays - on this day we remember the origins of the Christian Church, because it was on this day that Christ appeared to people as the Messiah and Savior. At the same time, it is a reminder for every Christian why we were baptized, what we promised God and how we should live, explains the meaning of the holiday, military chaplain of the 46th brigade, Dmytro Semko. About ten people gather at the same time for joint prayer after a short sermon. Among them are not only military personnel, but also local residents who came to share with the paratroopers the joy of the bright holidays of the Epiphany and the Baptism of the Lord. All other volunteers have already come and will continue to come to the reservoir, which symbolizes the biblical Jordan, individually and in small groups. Despite the absence of lavish celebrations with a large gathering, the front-line Epiphany touches the warmth of the Christian and front-line unity of people in their faith with the Lord and among themselves. Today, in the midst of the terrible tragedy of war, stern, fire-hardened and iron-tested paratroopers smile and joke kindly, as if following Christ's command to become like children. -Christ is baptizing!-, we remember the traditional Ukrainian folk greeting at the Epiphany. -In the Jordan River!- - we hear the answer. Today, in Ukraine, every consecrated body of water is a symbolic Jordan. The paratroopers of the 46th separate airmobile brigade of the Russian Air Force, who celebrated Epiphany in 2025 at the front, also have their own Jordan.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/hrystos-hreshhayetsya-na-donechchyni-frontove-vodohreshhe-vidznachyly-desantnyky/	2025-01-06T12:02:47-08:00
Traveling karate fighters: in Kharkiv they covered up the master of sports from the legal escape of ...	reports this by the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office. The investigation established that a resident of Kharkiv helped men of draft age -legally- go abroad. He offered the client to issue military registration documents and ensure membership in the Ukrainian Karate Federation. This allowed the petitioner to leave Ukraine as part of a sports team. Dilok assured the client that he has influence on representatives of the TCC and the sports organization. For -legal escape- the person involved announced the sum of 5,500 US dollars. However, he informed the man that first it is necessary to give an advance - 4,000 US dollars. He did not come to the meeting himself, but asked his acquaintance, a former policeman, to collect the money. Law enforcement officers exposed the middleman while receiving the specified amount of money. His role in the criminal scheme is currently being established. Later, the law enforcement officers exposed the dealer and informed about the suspicion. He faces a prison sentence of three to eight years with confiscation of property. Other participants of the arrangement are installed. The investigation is ongoing. As reported by ArmyInform , in Transcarpathia, a resident of Kyiv region was detained, who tried to escape from the country by hiring two 14-year-old teenagers for this purpose.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/karatysty-voyazhery-u-harkovi-prykryly-majstra-sportu-z-legalnoyi-vtechi-uhylyantiv-za-kordon/	2025-01-06T11:54:10-08:00

Due to the war, the Russian economy has already lost 1.5 to 1.7 million able-bodied citizens	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The forecast for the development of the situation on the labor market in the Russian Federation in the long term is also negative - by 2045, the employment market in the Russian Federation will decrease by 7–10 million people from the current 76 million employed citizens. The deterioration of the situation on the labor market leads to the deepening of stagflation processes in the Russian economy - an increase in the level of inflation due to an increase in wages, a decrease in the level of production, and bankruptcies of a number of enterprises. The deficit of the working-age population of the Russian Federation is also one of the factors that prevent the Russian authorities from announcing a new wave of mobilization.

How to vote online for members of the Public Anti-Corruption Council: instructions from the Ministry...	About this informs the Ministry of Defense. Open nationwide online voting will take place from 09:00 to 21:00 on the official resource of the Ministry of Defense. You can also read the full list of candidacies on the website. The council will include 15 candidates who will receive the most votes. The results will be published on the information resources of the Ministry of Defense within five working days. Over the next two years, members of the Anti-Corruption Council will help assess corruption risks in the Ministry of Defense and will contribute to the formation of relevant anti-corruption measures. It is the votes of the citizens of Ukraine that will determine which of the represented persons will join the council. Therefore, the Ministry of Defense calls on citizens to participate in voting. All citizens of Ukraine on the territory of Ukraine are invited to participate. Authentication will take place using the BankID or Action.Signature service. Taking into account the enemy's constant attacks on the Ukrainian IT infrastructure, you can vote only from the territory of Ukraine. Each member can vote only once. Up to 15 representatives can be elected from 40 candidates. Candidates for participation in the contest were submitted by public associations whose statutory activities are related to the prevention and combating of corruption. Only NGOs whose state registration took place at least two years before the announcement of the competition were admitted. The list was approved by the Commission for ensuring the holding of the competition, created by order of the Ministry of Defense. The composition of the Commission included representatives of the Public Anti-Corruption Council itself, NGOs and advisory bodies. Representatives of the Ministry of Defense do not have the right to vote in the meetings of the commission. All NGOs provided a public report on their activities, indicating the sources of funding for the last year. All candidates are checked for compliance with the qualification criteria defined in the Regulations on the Public Anti-Corruption Council under the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. 42 candidacies were submitted to the competition. Among them, one candidate refused to participate, another was not admitted to the competition due to the submission of documents from a non-public association. Last time, during the voting, there were significant technical failures /a> in particular, the unstable operation of the site, as well as authorization errors through partner services BankID and Diya.Signature. Therefore, the results were annulled, and the voting was scheduled for a new date. The Ministry of Defense is taking all necessary measures to eliminate technical problems and to ensure the stable operation of the system throughout the voting process. For the new vote, the Ministry's team developed software for high load readiness, conducted thorough functional and load testing, and developed human-oriented scenarios for solving emergency situations. In addition, on the day of the vote, a rapid response team of three administrators has been appointed to monitor the transparency and democracy of the process. All digital systems of the Ministry of Defense are protected according to state and international cyber security standards. All sensitive data in the voting process are securely encrypted and processed in a secure data center for official electronic resources of the Ministry.

A Russian jailer who tortured Ukrainian soldiers came under suspicion	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on January 6. We are talking about a citizen of the Russian Federation, Oleksiy Khavetsky, the deputy head of the -correctional colony No. 7-, which is located in the Volodymyr region of Russia. According to the case file, at least from the end of May 2023 to February 2024, the official personally participated in the torture of captured Ukrainian soldiers who were imprisoned in a Russian prison. In the cells, the victims were tortured with electric currents and sentry dogs, which were used by the Rashists to guard the perimeter of the regime facility, were pointed at them. Also, on the instructions of Havetskyi, his subordinates regularly beat prisoners, and then left them for a long time without food, water, and medical care. Another common way of abusing the victims was to keep them without warm clothes in frozen cells without heating or at low temperatures in the open air. Using torture, the jailer tried to -extract- from the victims the -confessions- needed by the occupiers in pre-fabricated cases against Ukrainian defenders. In addition, he used physical violence and psychological pressure on prisoners in order to force them to cooperate for the benefit of the Russian Federation in the war against our state. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed Khavetsky in absentia about the suspicion under part. 2 Art. 28, ch. 1 Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (war crimes committed by a group of persons based on a prior conspiracy). Despite the fact that the perpetrator is in Russia, comprehensive measures are being taken to find him and punish him. As reported by ArmyInform, the prosecutors of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office sent to the court an indictment against a Russian serviceman on the fact of brutal treatment of a civilian population, committed by a group of persons based on a prior conspiracy (Part 2 of Article 28, Part 1 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine in the 2022 edition).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/pidozru-otrymav-rosijskyj-tyuremnyk-yakyj-katuvav-ukrayinskyh-vijskovyh/	2025-01-06T07:04:43-08:00

He said that during the last combat sortie of the -RAROG- unmanned systems battalion, three tanks and two BMPs were destroyed. And over the past few weeks, the number of destroyed equipment has been increasing. The press officer said that there were no significant changes in the enemy's tactics. As before, the occupier bets on manpower, small assault groups. -If earlier there were five, trying to get involved in shooting battles, now the groups are smaller, maybe two people each. But the number of such groups can increase and they can act simultaneously. From time to time, the enemy tries to use the technique, especially in bad weather, when the number of drones decreases,- said Ivan Petrychak. As reported by ArmyInform, on January 5, in the Kramatorsk direction, the occupiers -napryamku-i-na-kurshhyni/->attacked seven times in the area of ​​Chasovoy Yar, Stupochky and Predtechny.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/vorog-tysne-na-chasiv-yar-masoyu-ale-vtrachaye-i-soldativ-i-tehniku/	2025-01-06T06:51:16-08:00

In the end, the patience of the Ukrainian fighters turned out to be not infinite, as a result of which a few more drones flew to the insolence, which sent him after hundreds of thousands of the same ill-mannered invaders. As ArmiyaInform reported, there are also more prudent invaders who, after being wounded, prefer to lay down their arms immediately and surrender to the Ukrainian military, as happened to the Russian, captured captured during the clearing of a building in Toretsk by the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/pogani-manery-mayut-naslidky-okupant-poplatyvsya-za-serednij-palecz-u-bik-ukrayinskyh-bijcziv/	2025-01-06T06:43:39-08:00

-Wholesale- destruction of occupiers, city battles, hiding places of Russians: the Defense Forces sp...	On January 6, the spokesperson told about this on the broadcast of -Society News- Major Viktor Tregubov of the strategic group of troops -Khortytsia-. -They are really trying to break through the city center, while the Ukrainian troops stop them and destroy them. Heavy urban battles have been going on for more than a week. The city itself, from which the population had already been evacuated, turned into one big arena. And it caused damage to buildings and infrastructure,- Viktor Tregubov said. In the Pokrovsky direction, the enemy carries out the most offensive actions, in particular in the areas of Elizavetivka, Vozdvizhenka, Myrolyubivka, Promin, Lysivka, Pishchane, Solone and Novovasylivka settlements. -This is most likely south of the city, although the enemy would not mind going west of it. Everything is logical here, he does not want to interfere in direct battles in the city of Pokrovsk itself. This is a sufficiently large and protected city, so he is trying to bypass it, cover it from the same western side,- he said. According to him, Ukrainian defenders are trying to slow down the enemy and stop his advance. He noted that the enemy is more actively using armored vehicles in the Vremivsk direction, as there are fewer buildings there. -Actually, there are villages there, not a city, so the enemy is trying to advance more actively there and will launch combat operations more dynamically,- noted the spokesman of the -Khortytsia- OSU. However, he assured that the Defense Forces are destroying a sufficiently large number of enemy personnel and armored vehicles there. -Because when they're advancing in more open terrain, when some of the equipment that's advancing is just blown up on minefields or hit by FPV drones, it's, I would say, such wholesale destruction,- he explained. The enemy is also trying to cross the Oskil and reach its right bank. -It is north of Kupyansk. He tries to infiltrate in small groups there, tries to concentrate them in landings, so that later, when a certain amount is accumulated, he can advance further and take another landing. The intensity is much lower there, but there are certain threats,- Viktor Tregubov emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, on Vremivsk, Kurakhivsk and other directions, the enemy -v-taktyczi-voroga-na-riznyh-napryamkah/->changes tactics, trying to adapt to the situation. However, even such attempts as attacks with manual mines do not bring the desired results.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/optovi-znyshhennya-okupantiv-miski-boyi-hovanky-rosiyan-u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-pro-sytuacziyu-na-shodi/	2025-01-06T06:17:04-08:00
More than 7,000 people remain in Pokrovsk, enemy drones reach most areas of the city	Serhiy Dobryak, head of the Pokrovsk MBA, told about this on the air of -Suspilne Novosti- . -About 7,300 people still live in the city. And for those people, shops are still open here and there, several pharmacies are open, specialists from our territorial center are working, a small number of them are persuading the elderly who are still staying to evacuate after all,- the official said. He also emphasized that the city is constantly under attack by various means of attack, including artillery, guided aerial bombs and drones. According to the head of the MBA, currently only 15% of Pokrovsk remains inaccessible to them, while in the rest of the city, Russian operators are organizing a real hunt for civilians. -There is one small area, they don't fly there yet, let's put it that way. But it's a matter of time,- Serhiy Dobryak noted. However, despite the difficult situation, recently the Pokrovsk community managed to restore the stele at the entrance to the city, destroyed by the occupiers last week.

the Russians brought electricians from Chuvashia to TOT	This is reported by Center of national resistance. In 2022, the Russians liberated part of the south from civilization, economy and freedom. As a result of inefficient management by self-appointed individuals from the ROA, there are constant blackouts in the south, despite the absence of attacks on generation facilities. The reason is the inability of the Russians to maintain the energy infrastructure. Due to the lack of personnel, the Russians import energy workers from various regions of the Russian Federation on a rotational basis. In particular, this time from Chuvashia. The inability to recruit personnel for the TOT due to the departure of Ukrainians and unwillingness to cooperate with the enemy is an eloquent testimony to the real indicator of the -popularity- of the occupiers in the region. As reported by ArmyInform, in one of the industrial districts of Lysychansk, near the old mine, the occupiers set up a military training ground.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/rosiyany-zavezly-na-tot-elektrykiv-z-chuvashiyi/	2025-01-06T05:56:12-08:00

According to DeepState, the Russians tied their hands and shot them in the back of the head. -We are once again witnessing atrocities that show the true face of the aggressor state. Despite the fact that, according to the Geneva Conventions, prisoners of war are under special protection, and no country has the right to torture, abuse or take their lives, Russia shows disregard for international norms,- ​​the ombudsman said. Dmytro Lubinets said that he immediately appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations. -These organizations should condemn this crime and put pressure on the Russian side to stop such acts. Ukraine maintains its commitment to observe humanitarian law even in times of war, but we will not allow Russia to turn the world into a territory of lawlessness. The guilty must be punished,- the ombudsman emphasized.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/okupanty-jmovirno-rozstrilyaly-troh-ukrayinskyh-vijskovopolonenyh-dmytro-lubinecz/	2025-01-06T05:23:32-08:00

According to him, the enemy is currently trying to find any opportunity to restore the damaged buildings. -Of course, the period of storms is quite long in the Black Sea, in the Kerch Strait. Also, the weather is quite stormy. In this sense, it makes adjustments to the plans of the Russian occupiers. But, of course, they take maximum measures to protect this building. And so far, there are no trends to decrease their activity,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. He also noted that the Kerch bridge remains a strategically important object for the enemy. -You see that they saturated this facility with echeloned air defense systems as much as possible&#8230; The number of fuel tankers has increased. This is also not a coincidence. This is also a consequence of the use of the so-called Kerch bridge for fuel supply. Because you see the ferries are no longer running. It was the main tool. Accordingly, they should use more cities,- added the representative of the Armed Forces Navy. As reported by ArmyInform, in December 2024 the number of protective barges near the Kerch bridge reduced to 18 units due to storms.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/pogoda-dovoli-burhlyva-shtorm-rozkydav-zahysni-sporudy-bilya-kerchenskogo-mostu/	2025-01-06T05:17:59-08:00

According to him, the enemy began to use armored vehicles less. -The weather is such that it is difficult to use armored vehicles. They try, but where we work with our FPV drones, it's objectively very difficult to do. Because everything that goes, it burns: we destroy it quite effectively,- Mykola Volokhov explained. He noted that the Russian invaders continue to actively advance with infantry. -They decided it was more efficient to go on foot now. Of course, they don't lose a hundred people every day, but they can afford to launch up to a hundred people on assaults. They come wave after wave,- Mykola Volokhov said. In his opinion, the purpose of such assaults is to deplete the defense of the Ukrainians and reduce the amount of munitions.

the Kremlin is using the energy crisis in Moldova against Ukraine	About reports the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. At the same time, the country's government is working on diversification of gas and electricity supply sources. In January, the Moldovan government plans to cover 62% of electricity needs through imports from Romania, about 30% will be provided by thermal power plants and local producers of energy from renewable sources. Moldova received the right to increase the electricity import quota from the EU from 315 MW to 600 MW, if it is not used by other importers. Currently, the total quota for Moldova and Ukraine is 2,100 MW, of which 315 MW belongs to Moldova. Prime Minister of Moldova D. Rechan stated that the energy crisis provoked by Russia is aimed at using the Moldovan crisis against Ukraine in particular. In the Transnistrian region, the situation in the energy sector remains extremely difficult. At the same time, the so-called -leader- of the region in Krasnoselsky called the situation -under control- and called on residents to -warm themselves with firewood.- For its part, the management of JSC -Moldovagaz- offered JSC -Tiraspoltransgaz- assistance in purchasing gas through European platforms at market prices. However, the Transnistrian -leadership- rejected the proposal and hopes for the restoration of gas supplies by the Russian -Gazprom-. Most likely, Russia will use the deepening of the energy crisis to restore gas transit to Europe through the territory of Ukraine and bring pro-Russian forces to power in Moldova. In this way, the Kremlin hopes to use the situation with the supply of gas in the Transnistrian region to further blackmail European countries. How to ->reported ArmyInform, Ukrainian fighters conducted an operation to clear a building captured by the Russians in Toretsk, Donetsk region, during which they managed to take alive one of the invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/kreml-vykorystovuye-energetychnu-kryzu-v-moldovi-proty-ukrayiny/	2025-01-06T03:31:35-08:00

The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on January 6. 4 members of the Russian intelligence network were detained, who were preparing to detonate explosives at the entrance to the building where one of the units of the Defense Forces is stationed. According to the investigation materials, the improvised explosive device was in a tactical backpack, which was to be delivered to the regime facility by a minor agent of the Russian special services, dressed in a Ukrainian-style military uniform. The enemy tracked his movements online and planned to detonate explosives as soon as the young man entered the premises. At the same time, the agent himself, who was supposed to be blown up, did not know that a fatal end was being prepared for him. He thought that the SVP would be detonated after he left the building. Counter-intelligence of the SBU detected the enemy's plans in advance and took a series of measures to prevent a terrorist attack. As a result, a minor terrorist and 3 other agents involved in planning this crime were detained. As the investigation established, with this terrorist attack, the Russian special services wanted to destabilize the socio-political situation in Ukraine and create the appearance of a conflict within the Defense Forces, when one -military- detonates others as a sign of protest. According to the investigation materials, all four involved acted separately from each other, but had a common curator from the Russian Federation. One of the agents turned out to be a 16-year-old student from the Kirovohrad region. He received the coordinates of the cache from the occupiers, in which he took explosives and a military uniform. Another member of the network is a 19-year-old young man who, according to preliminary data, transported explosives and military uniforms from the -initial hiding place- to a cache, where they were taken by a 16-year-old agent. The -initial cache- itself was arranged by 2 residents of the Vinnytsia region. According to video instructions from a representative of the Russian special services, they made an explosive device and hid it in a designated place. During the searches, mobile phones with evidence of their cooperation with the aggressor were seized from the detainees. Also, 1.5 kg of an explosive mixture for the manufacture of a home-made weapon was seized from one of the agents.

In case of a storm of more than 4 points, the application usually does not take place. But the primary indication of readiness for the use of naval platforms is their number at sea and the presence of other means, such as strategic aviation in the air. -Usually they are used in a complex. Considering that there are no such signs now, and despite the fact that two units went out to sea yesterday, they returned to the base point. Now the danger is minimal,- the spokesman added.

In the first battle, he did not know how to reload the machine gun, but now he is an experienced ins...	The man was convinced by his own experience that patriotism and fighting spirit are not enough to participate in combat operations - serious military training is required. Therefore, after training and participating in combat operations, he became an instructor and teaches new arrivals to the brigade of fighters to survive and destroy enemies on the front lines. On February 24, 2022, Vladyslav joined the ranks of one of the famous Kharkiv volunteer units and took part in repelling attempts by the Russians to break through to Kharkiv. Then the occupiers tried to infiltrate the city in small groups using light armored vehicles. — At the end of February 2022, I picked up a weapon for the first time in my life, because I was ready to defend my native city and Ukraine. However, already in the first battle, when the bullets ran out, he did not know how to reload the machine gun at all and started shouting loudly for my comrades to help me, - says Vladyslav. Thus the volunteer realized that patriotism and fighting spirit are not enough - you need serious military training. Therefore, after the first skirmishes with the enemy, I went to the TCC in order to join the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and undergo appropriate training. - Already after the first battle, I realized that in order to fight well, it is necessary to learn how to use weapons professionally and decided to go study. Chaos reigned in the city, the TCC moved due to the danger of shelling. -We had to look for him by phone number,- Tamik recalls. During this search, Vladyslav joined forces with three more volunteers, so in the end, four of them came to the TCC. It was not possible to mobilize right away - we had to wait for about two weeks. - They talked to us, found out what kind of education we had, and promised to direct us to the place where we would be most useful. Then they collected data and told to wait for a call - as they say, -be on the bag.- They called after two weeks - and we went to the -training school-, - says the man. Vladislav recalls that during the training in the spring of 2022, time dragged on for an unbearably long time. Training seemed to go on endlessly, while reinforcements were desperately needed at the front. Everyone was following the news and wanted to finish training as soon as possible and go into battle. - They studied for two months - first basic military training, then professional training. I was sent to study as a signalman, because I am a programmer by education and I work well with computers, - says the military man. After training, he participated in battles in the area of ​​the Donetsk airport near Piskami in the Pokrovsky district of the Donetsk region. where for the first time I experienced firsthand how terrible modern war is. - Everything shown on TV or told by friends is one thing. And it's completely different when you yourself have been in a real hell, and everything wants to kill you - aviation, barrel artillery, mortars. It cannot be compared to an ordinary shooting battle, - recalls Vladyslav. There, starting with the battles in the summer of 2022, the soldier gained real combat experience, knowledge and skills, which now allow him to train new arrivals to the brigade of fighters for the front line. who have just passed the BZVP. - As a Kharkiv resident, of course I wanted to defend my hometown. But it turned out that I have been defending Donetsk region for the third year already - and I am very proud of it. Here, it seems to me, is the most difficult - I call it -Donbas 3.0-, - says the fighter. He became an instructor of -Tamik- a year ago - in January 2024. This was facilitated by the habit of constantly learning, learning something new, and improving one's skills and abilities, acquired even in civilian life. - Aitivites are the laziest people in the world. They will always find a million ways to make everything easier, they will never complicate things. To achieve the result, they will develop the simplest algorithm - and they will get what they want, - the military man jokes. This is what helped Vladyslav not only become one of the best communicators in the brigade, but also effectively help and teach others. When the qualities of a fighter were noticed by the command, the offer to take up the position of instructor became inevitable. - At one point, when I was the commander of the department and later the sergeant of the communications platoon, I was invited to try myself as an instructor. There aren't really that many intelligent communicators, and even fewer who can teach others. Therefore, my main task became to train signalmen, - says the instructor. Working with fellow instructors, the soldier also improved his knowledge in other areas of military science. So now you can help your fellows by assisting them or replacing them when working out simpler basic points. - Now there is no such thing as being a programmer or a communicator - that's all. It is necessary to be a universalist, to know one thing deeply — and at the same time to know the basics of everything else. Therefore, now I am engaged in both topography and tactics. I may not know the intricacies as deeply as some of my peers, but I can always help other instructors, - explains the senior sergeant. Now there are tremendous opportunities for development and self-improvement, Vladyslav is sure. Every instructor is obliged to do this and every fighter can, with the help of more experienced comrades. — YouTube is very helpful, our sergeants provide literature. The main thing is that there is a desire, and it is always possible to find the necessary useful information, there is an opportunity to constantly develop. Even just asking and listening to an explanation is already good, the instructor is convinced. After -Tamik- became an instructor, his main motive - to defend Ukraine from Russian invaders - underwent a transformation and addition. Now his motivation is not only to become a professional fighter, but also to teach everything he knows to others. - When you teach people and then the news comes that one of them is -300- or even -200- , then you always start to think that you didn't teach something, neglected something. You begin to think where exactly you need to work better so that there are as few dead and wounded as possible, - says the instructor. He is sure that it is under the condition of high-quality training and training of soldiers that losses can be reduced, giving soldiers maximum knowledge and skills for to maximize their chances of surviving the battle. Now and in the near future everyone fit for military service will have to undergo basic military training, because even provided that the hot phase of the war ends, hostile Russia will not disappear anywhere and will always hang over the border of Ukraine. - It seems to me that Ukraine as a state will be extremely militarized from now on and for a very long time. Even when this war ends in victory, we must be ready for action, because we have an inadequate neighbor, Vladyslav is convinced.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/u-pershomu-boyu-ne-znav-yak-perezaryadyty-avtomat-a-nyni-instruktor-z-dosvidom-transformacziya-ajtivczya-z-harkova/	2025-01-05T20:40:48-08:00
- It is reported that he is heavy, but he is smoking a cigarette bandaged and smiling: how does the ...	The head of the medical center, senior lieutenant of the medical service, Yuriy Faustus, told ArmyInform about how the medical center of the 21st separate special battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi works. To organize a medical center, you need a good knowledge of medicine, equipment and premises. It can be placed anywhere - in a well-furnished dugout, basement, house and even an apartment. Near the front line, of course, priority is given to protected underground structures. — Everything depends on your fiction and the conditions you have in fact. Ideally, the medical center should have at least three rooms. In one of them there will be a medicine warehouse, where you can place everything you need. The second room is a waiting room for examining patients. In the third, we carry out the necessary procedures, Yuriy explains. All rooms must be large enough to accommodate a significant number of medicines and drugs - a battalion needs quite a few - and to receive at least a few people in need at a time. Among the basic necessary conditions are water supply and sewerage, electricity supply, and heating in the cold season. Without them, the medical center can work, but its work becomes much more difficult. — When there is water supply, it is generally considered super conditions. Water is brought mainly to the front. It is also very cool when there is electricity - mainly it is a generator or EcoFlow batteries, you are lucky to have stationary power supply less often, says the doctor. For heating, UFO infrared heaters are often used, which allow you to direct heat directly to the patient. And if you are lucky, there may be not only solid fuel, but also gas heating. Despite the common perception that the medical center is intended primarily or even exclusively for the care of the wounded, in fact the doctors there provide assistance to servicemen for any health problems. — The medical center does everything possible. It's helping the wounded, it's treating illness, it's keeping records and referring people to other treatment. If a person came to us or was admitted, we must solve problems with his health, the doctor explains. However, the injury is really in the first place, and in the case of delivery to the medical center of a wounded soldier, all other cases and patients are postponed and the doctors deal exclusively with the wounded. The wounded are transported to the medical center by special evacuation teams, which include soldiers who are well-versed and have completed specialized courses in tactical medicine. Special positions are not provided for this. - It can be a shooter or a lawyer who knows medical technology and is not afraid of blood, can competently and skillfully provide first aid. If we see that he can prove himself well in the evacuation team, he will be directed there, says Yuriy. There are a total of three evacuation teams in the battalion medical center. Depending on the intensity of hostilities, the doctors of the medical center may also leave for evacuation, but they usually have to stay at the medical center. From -ground zero- the injured person is taken on foot to the evacuation point, from where he is picked up by transport. This is usually a car on which soldiers were brought to the front line. At this time, thanks to the report on the walkie-talkie, the medical center already knows about the wounded person and is ready to receive him. - Our medical center is the middle link between -zero- and the stabilization point of the brigade. This is the first moment when a wounded person is guaranteed to be in the hands of professionals, although it can happen earlier. But it is guaranteed - it is with us, says the officer. Sometimes the injured person is taken immediately to the medical center, but more often a transport leaves the medical center to meet and pick him up. Then specialists provide the necessary medical assistance immediately after the soldier is accepted into the evacuation team. — This is not always the case when you need to drive fast just to deliver. We can stop, examine him normally, start infusion therapy for blood loss. And even after that we take him to the stabilization point of the brigade, says Yuriy. So the doctors of the medical center can work on the road, rescuing the wounded immediately after taking them from the front line. By the time a wounded person is admitted, thanks to a radio report, they already know about the nature of the wound, the previously provided help and the condition of the soldier. — During the report, all this is recorded in the combat log, and we also learn about all this at the same time. And already knowing all this, we can prepare in advance for what kind of help we will provide, the doctor explains. It happens when we pick up an evacuation fighter, he seems to be doing well, talks nicely, asks for a cigarette. And at this time he has a fragment of a mine in his lungs. Such cases are very dangerous. That is why at the stage of medical evacuation, fighters are examined from head to toe. There are also cases when, during the report, fighters exaggerate the level of threat to the life and health of the wounded, reporting that he is in an extremely serious condition. — We are arriving — the guys are leaving, smoking cigarettes. -We were told you were 'heavy'!- - we say. And he replies: -I don't know who said that, I have this,- and shows something completely immortal. Such cases happen more often when it is reported that he is -heavy-, and he smokes a cigarette bandaged and smiles, glad to be alive. he says. In addition to wounds, the doctors of the medical center treat all possible diseases of soldiers. The most common are lumbago - lower back pain due to heavy physical exertion, gastritis due to an unbalanced diet and, depending on the season, SARS - acute respiratory viral infections. — Now there is an extreme shortage of neurologists, because many people with back problems come to us. And gastritis is mainly due to food. And one thing, when fighters are at -zero- - there really are no conditions. And it is completely different when they return from the front line and spoil their stomachs with dry spicy food. If there is an ability to monitor nutrition, then it is necessary to do it, the doctor emphasizes. This completes the basic list of typical diseases. Of course, some chronic diseases may worsen, which happens quite often, or specific cases may occur. A significant part of the work of the headquarters is the preparation of relevant documentation, including the formation of injury certificates, on the basis of which fighters receive appropriate payments. — First, the information is recorded in the log of combat operations, then the companies have to prepare certificates, reports on injuries. There should also be a short report and an extensive report on the fighter's injuries, which describes what injuries the fighter received and what he lost, says the officer. In order to receive the proper payments without any problems, it is necessary to check all the documents in detail so that all the diagnoses on the basis of which the head of the medical service issues the appropriate certificate match exactly. At the same time, the wounded fighter must send all the documentation about himself from the hospital where he is staying to the doctor or clerk. — Sometimes it happens that one diagnosis is written in form 100, and another diagnosis is written in the statement. Then the head of the medical service has to collect all these documents and a simplified investigation is carried out for each wound, which allows us to find out all the nuances, - explains Yuriy. This is necessary because the research and analyzes in the hospital can be carried out much more qualitatively, because there are available resources and specialists that are absent in the initial stages of evacuation. Thanks to a better examination and research, the diagnosis can be clarified and it should be in all documents. — It is enough for the fighter to send an extract and medical documentation so that the medic or clerk in the unit can make the appropriate certificate. You just need to send documents on time and don't be afraid to call. We often send documents by mail, and by other means of document circulation, appendix 5 - a certificate on the circumstances of injury. It is done for 10 days and given to the fighter, the head of the medical center explains. Usually there are no problems - it is enough to collect and store all the documents, as well as maintain contact with the party. Then everything will be fine and all documents will be prepared and given to the injured. — If a fighter is constantly in contact with his commander, will provide timely medical documentation that appears in his possession, and will report on his whereabouts, then he will never have problems with payments. In our battalion, everything is just like that, Yuriy Faustus assures.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/dopovidayut-shho-tyazhkyj-a-vin-czygarku-kuryt-zabyntovanyj-i-posmihayetsya-yak-praczyuye-bataljonnyj-medpunkt/	2025-01-05T20:28:06-08:00
Russia is sowing panic and fear: a fake about the forced evacuation from Kherson	Let's analyze this fake point by point and reveal the true motives of the Russian manipulators. Propaganda media claim that Ukrainian authorities are allegedly forcing residents of Kherson to leave the city through forced evacuation. According to them: These statements are accompanied by videos and photos intended to create the illusion of mass chaos, although often they are either old footage or staged. Evacuation is rescue, not coercion. The Ukrainian authorities, in particular the Ministry of Reintegration and the local administration of Kherson, are indeed organizing the evacuation of residents who have found themselves in the zone of increased danger due to constant shelling from the Russian army. However, evacuation is offered only to those who wish to leave. It is aimed at protecting people's lives, especially children, the elderly and people with disabilities. Also, these activities take place under full transparency of the process. Ukrainian authorities provide clear explanations of evacuation measures, and also provide transportation, temporary housing, food, and humanitarian aid for evacuees. The process excludes coercion, and the decision to leave home is voluntary. The biggest threat to the lives of the residents of Kherson is not the actions of the Ukrainian authorities, but regular shelling by the Russian military. It is because of these attacks that people are forced to leave their homes to save their lives. Russian propaganda often uses staged videos or old recordings made during the occupation to create the illusion of a -forced evacuation-. In reality, evacuation convoys are organized with the consent of citizens and at their request. The main reason for such fakes is the desire of the Russians to sow panic among the population. Propagandists are trying to intimidate the residents of Kherson in order to destroy trust in the Ukrainian authorities. This is part of an information war aimed at demoralizing the liberated territories. The occupiers are also trying to discredit Ukraine in the international arena. the Kremlin is trying to portray Ukraine as a state that -disdains the rights of its citizens.- This is an attempt to spoil the image of our country and to reduce the support of the international community. In addition, this is how the occupiers try to hide their own crimes. The invaders continue to shell the civilian infrastructure of Kherson, killing civilians. Accusations of -forced evacuation- divert attention from these crimes. The fake about the forced evacuation from Kherson is another attempt by Russian propaganda to distort reality. While Ukraine is protecting its citizens by organizing a safe exit from high-danger zones, Russia continues to shell the liberated territories, threatening the lives of thousands of people. Residents of Kherson have already seen the difference between Russian occupation and Ukrainian liberation. The lies of the Kremlin will not be able to convince those who have felt for themselves what real concern for human life is.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/rosiya-siye-paniku-ta-strah-fejk-pro-prymusovu-evakuacziyu-z-hersona/	2025-01-05T20:11:52-08:00

The occupiers have stopped repairing warships in Crimea, fearing damage	About this on the air of the telethon -The only news- said the spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. -The main forces of the Russians remained in Crimea. But we have already proven in practice that using repair bases for the Black Sea fleet of the Russians will no longer work. In order to restore ships, they must first be brought there. And now no one will do it,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. He recalled the examples of the destruction of the small missile ship -Zyklon-, which guarded the Sevastopol Bay, the destruction of the submarine -Rostov-on-Don-, which was already damaged for the second time, the destruction of the MRK -Askold- in Kerch. -These cases suggest to the Russians that, after all, using Crimea for repairs is not possible in principle. Novorossiysk also has repair capabilities, but they are not comparable to the capabilities that the Russians have left in the occupied Ukrainian Crimea,- the spokesman said. Dmytro Pletenchuk also said that the Russians have the opportunity to build small missile ships in Zelenodolsk in Tatarstan, but at the moment it is impractical for them. -The last two ships from the Karakurt project - Askold and Zyklon, two of the five were forced to leave the Azov-Black Sea region. Now they are in the Caspian Sea,- he said. As reported by ArmyInform, only a Russian submarine, but it performs the task of protecting the base point. The rest of the patrol operations are conducted by enemy aircraft.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/05/okupanty-perestaly-remontuvaty-vijskovi-korabli-v-krymu-boyatsya-urazhen/	2025-01-05T11:08:28-08:00
The Russians control the Black Sea with aviation: after two downed helicopters, this may change	This was said on the telethon -Edyny Novyny- the spokesman of the Naval Dmytro Pletenchuk, captain of the 3rd rank of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -That is, he is there not because he is a missile carrier, but because he is a submarine. He has a better chance of surviving after such a patrol. That's why the Russians have been using submarines for this for a long time,- Dmytro Pletenchuk said. He added that the Russians have been using aviation for a long time to protect the waters of the Black Sea due to the threat to their ships from the Defense Forces of Ukraine. -It cannot be said that the situation has fundamentally changed. They both used aviation and continue to do so. However, aviation became the answer to the impossibility of using the fleet to perform current tasks,- the spokesman said. Dmytro Pletenchuk added that the recent GUR operation, during which our naval drone shot down two Russian helicopters, could have a positive effect on the further actions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. -The Russians control the airspace and only because of this they control the water area around Crimea and near their shores.

This was told on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyvi- the spokesman of the Naval Dmytro Pletenchuk, captain of the 3rd rank of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Whenever it is completed, they will not be able to use it as a base that can either significantly affect the ability to safely accommodate Russian ships, or as a tool that will solve these problems in the future,- Dmytro Pletenchuk said. He explained that this base, in principle, is not designed for those units of the fleet that are in service with the Russians. This base was previously used for the coast guard. -The very parameters of the harbor will not allow to place any significant resources, serious combat units there. Therefore, this base should not be taken into account as an influential factor in the development of Russian activities in the Black Sea,- the spokesman added. The Russian Navy was forced to transfer most of its ships to Novorossiysk after the Defense Forces of Ukraine destroyed a number of enemy combat units in the temporarily occupied Crimea.

In the directions of Chasovoy Yar, Toretsk, and Kurakhovo, the enemy resorts to non-standard and even desperate methods. The spokesman gave an example when individual enemy fighters try to use outdated practices, for example, manually carrying TM mines to throw them at the positions of the Ukrainian military. -Some actions look like scenes from a movie: people carry two TM mines by hand and try to throw them in the direction of Ukrainian positions. It is ineffective, but the enemy is betting on the mass of such attacks,- Viktor Tregubov said.

The German instructors were surprised at our speed - the anti-aircraft gun Volodymyr switched from -...	On January 5, the Air Command -West- told about the fighter. -It was a Russian -drone- that was conducting reconnaissance of the positions of our infantry. And then we started shooting down Russian planes and helicopters. In March 2022, Russian bombers felt unpunished in the skies over Kharkiv Oblast. They boldly crossed the combat line and dropped one and a half ton bombs on the positions of our troops. Being hit by such a blow is worse than being under artillery fire. We set ourselves the goal of protecting the infantry from aerial bombs. Therefore, they took positions as close as possible to the front-line units. This made it possible to shoot down Russian bombers earlier and at the same time made us extremely vulnerable to enemy attacks. But we still went forward. Infantry, tankers needed our cover from air strikes. The very fact that the -Buk- was standing nearby reassured the soldiers. We were very respected. They said: -It's good that you are here. We will have a little rest from the airstrikes.- They thanked us,- recalls Volodymyr. Anti-aircraft guns in that area discouraged the Russians from flying close to the line of battle and dropping unguided aerial bombs. In March 2022, four Russian front-line bombers and one helicopter were shot down by the combat service of Volodymyr Linnik in the Kharkiv region. In total, they destroyed 27 enemy targets in four months of operation in the area. After combat work in the Kharkiv region, the unit went abroad to master new weapons — the modern German anti-aircraft missile complex IRIS-T, which demonstrates impressive efficiency in destroying air targets. -The German instructors were surprised at the high speed with which we learned new weapons. We had one answer for them: time means people's lives saved, important objects protected,- says Volodymyr Linnik. Now Chief Sergeant Volodymyr Linnik is the head of maintenance of the IRIS-T air defense system launcher. -Our task is to transfer the launcher to the combat position and connect it to the command post. After the completion of the combat work, transfer the installation to the transport position and leave the position in time,- says Volodymyr Linnik. The combat record of the unit in which Volodymyr Linnik is currently serving is no less impressive than the previous one: anti-aircraft guns from IRIS-T destroyed 49 enemy targets. For his heroism and saved lives, chief sergeant Volodymyr Linnik was awarded the orders -For Courage- of the first, second and third degrees and the medal -For Military Service-. -I am ready to work for both Buk and IRIS-T. These two complexes are suitable for us to destroy the invaders and their missiles. Of course, IRIS-T is many times more perfect and effective. It's like the Mercedes of the car world. But the well-known truth remains unchanged. It is not the complexes, no matter how modern they are, that destroy the enemy, but the people who work for them. And I am glad that I was and am a part of strong collectives that bravely, professionally and loyally beat the aggressors. It happened that I shared one can of -stew- a day with the combat service. They risked their lives. They lost combat friends. A lot has already been passed. And we will go through a lot to take revenge for everyone and win,- assured Volodymyr Linnik. As reported by ArmyInform, Germany handed over to Ukraine another IRIS-T air defense system.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/05/nimeczki-instruktory-dyvuvalysya-nashij-shvydkosti-zenitnyk-volodymyr-perejshov-z-buka-na-iris/	2025-01-05T02:38:00-08:00

Today, our partisan movement is distributing instructions to the occupiers on how to do it so that it looks like a factory defect, and not deliberate sabotage,- said Serhiy Bratchuk. Although these cases are not yet widespread, it is already noticeable that they are not isolated and are becoming a trend among the Russian military.

Who was the first in the Armed Forces to hit a flying target using FPV: the story of -Ajax- and -Kry...	-Ajax- is balanced, careful, attentive to details, obviously likes systematicity and clear organization of processes. -Krysha- is tenacious, energetic, proactive, a locomotive of new things, ready to take risks and experiment. Probably, in non-military life, they would not have had any chance to cross paths. -Ajax- held an administrative position in production, -Krysha- managed business in the field of dentistry. Different cities, professions, social circles. However, the war changed their destinies and life plans. -Ajax- and -Krysha- got into the same unit and are currently a super-efficient and well-coordinated FPV crew in the 126th Separate Aviation Brigade of the 30th Marine Corps. Their tandem can boast of a huge number of successful sorties and even a successful -invention-, because they were the first in the Armed Forces of Ukraine to hit a flying target with the help of FPV. The following is a joint story by -Ajax- and -Krysha- for ArmiyaInform about how they started working with unmanned systems, which targets were most memorable, why failures are a valuable experience, why they nailed the Russian reconnaissance drone -Zala- to the ceiling and what it's like to be emotionally synchronized over several years enough to speak the same phrases. Ajax: When the full-scale invasion of Russia began, it was clear that the first priority was to keep the family safe. Civil cases were taken away for about two weeks, at that time I had already made up my mind that I would take part in hostilities and defend my country. -Krysha-:I also took my wife and child to a safe place, closed the business with my friends and went to the Military Commissariat. Everyone got to one department. He was a machine gunner, a gunner, a combat medic. Kim just wasn't (laughs). -Ajax-: At the beginning of March, recruitment was announced for the newly created 126th brigade, I went there on March 9, learned the necessary information, and on the 10th I already arrived at the brigade with things and a shaved head. At first he was a shooter. Then there was a need for platoon combat medics. It turned out that I became a combat medic in my platoon, and -Krysha- in mine. And we passed the first rotation in these positions. -Roof-: At one time, I worked a little with the guys who flew Maviks - I was in the cover group, accompanied them to -zero-. I watched how they worked, it was very interesting. Then numerous videos of FPV drone crashes began to appear. I started to get our company commander, saying let's do the drones. In the end, I was able to convince him and I was sent to study as an unmanned aerial vehicle operator. -Ajax-:And I already followed -Krysha-. Even then it was clear that unmanned systems are a very promising direction. As they like to say, a game changer in war. At that time, there were a large number of units using drones, and it was obvious that we could not be rear-ended, at least within our unit. In fact, we succeeded. -Ajax-:One training smoothly flowed into another, because the direction is very capacious, a lot of information. And if as of a year and a half ago it was quite static, then it began to rapidly improve and change. It's a constant race now. The enemy is progressing, we are progressing - who outplays who. Boring never happens. Our main direction is FPV, but it is combined, let's say, with the application of other types of UAVs. Because, as they say, one in the field is not a warrior. Given that the quality of the camera and video communication does not allow conducting reconnaissance, for example, or searching for a target in free flight. Therefore, in any case, our work is related to the work of scouts, because the -mavik- has a better picture, which allows you to search for targets and film the results of the damage accordingly. -Roof-: Even if you work with FPV, in order to perform the task as efficiently as possible, you need to understand not only these systems, but also the work of reconnaissance Mavics, EW, PEP. Must know what the enemy uses and how to counter it, what frequencies it flies on, how to intercept video or control frequencies. It is also important for general awareness - where you are, at what point, what are its features, whether something threatens you or not. Many nuances. -Ajax-: Even after the first training, we joked that FPV is a direction in which there is only one answer to any question - you have to try. That is, no one will usually give you a specific answer, and you really should not be afraid to experiment. We started the FPV direction with bombers. FPV-kamikaze began to be used in half a year. The first application, I remember, was exciting, but not with the desired result. The solutions weren't always effective, but at a certain point we reached a level where our unit's efficiency in using FPV kamikaze reached somewhere around 80 percent. -Krysha-: I will add that we could not immediately dive into the work with the FPV-kamikaze, because we did not know how to work with ammunition. That is, it took us about half a year to acquire and improve knowledge in this area. -Ajax-: Yes, given that we are civilians, before the war we did not have professional knowledge in engineering and mining, work with explosives. But we had a great desire to work and it pushed us forward. -Ajax-:The operation on the left bank of the Dnieper had several stages, accordingly, there was different intensity, different units were involved. When you understand that the person with whom you had coffee yesterday is now on the left bank, and your task is to cover it with all available means, motivation increases many times. At the first stage, we worked in resets. -Roof-: It was different&#8230; Both misses and misses. Then we were gaining experience. -Ajax-: Speaking of Krynyk, we managed to take part in the active phase of this operation. We worked from the front and on the enemy's infantry and on the equipment that was still actively used by the enemy at that time. They worked on tanks, BMPs, guns. -Roof-: By mortars. -Ajax-: For all the means of defeat, which did not allow our brothers to advance. Once in Krynyk, scouts from a neighboring unit discovered the 120th mortar, which caused many problems for the infantry. We managed to disable it, it did not work for about a week. And it was a really nice result. In general, the intensity of work was quite high. In addition, there was a large concentration of neighbors - our FPV colleagues - in the direction. It was interesting because everyone has their own style, experience. And there was an opportunity to meet, correspond, exchange knowledge. At the same time, I must say, even negative work experience had value. -Roof-: Do you remember the dance? Ajax: Yes! This is one such example. The enemy planned an assault with infantry and two tanks. One distracted, the other performed the main task. Our task was to figure out which tank was the main one, and therefore the priority to hit, which was not easy because both were chaotically circling the streets. At that time, we were working as bombers with ammunition not equipped by us. From a professional point of view, it was not quite right, because you have to work with what you are sure will work. But then we did not yet know how to equip ourselves with ammunition. In the end, we determined which tank to hit first, flew with a reset, hit. However, the result was not seen - there was no gap. Dropped the second ammo, same story. -The Roof-: It was such a disappointment&#8230; But it helped us to draw the right conclusion: we need to learn to prepare ammunition ourselves or to interact with the sappers of our battalion. Ajax:This experience showed that a bad result can also be useful. It allows you to analyze the error and develop further. If you don't make mistakes, you don't grow professionally. -Ajax-: If we recall the first experience of hitting flying targets&#8230; It was an impact wing in February 2024. Before that, in the history of war, there were no cases of hitting a flying target with the help of FPV-kamikaze. At the beginning of 2024, the enemy began to use attack wings. And at that moment, thanks to our neighbors, we had the opportunity to track their routes. At a certain point, we realized that we had to try. If you don't try, you won't be able to understand whether this is your goal or not. We had some ideas about how to do it, but there was no certainty that it would work. But already the first flight was effective. We caught a wing flying in our direction. Then -Krysha- said&#8230; -Roof-: Well, let's try the board? The commanders replied: -Well, let's try!- Tried and managed to hit the enemy wing. Ajax: It was, of course, a free target, because it is effectively a wing made of primitive means. Despite this, it was dangerous for our brothers and something had to be done with it. Then the second and third wings were shot down. The understanding came that it is necessary to somehow scale this experience, to share it. They met with various departments, consulted - everything worked out in them too. And it was very nice to realize that you are the first, but not the only one, who can share knowledge and skills. Instead, colleagues shared their experiences. This is called synergy. Well, then they moved on to more valuable goals - -Zala-, -Superkami-, -Orlany-. Given the nature of our work, we have almost no opportunity to seek out the targets we hit. Somehow, our comrades presented us with an enemy reconnaissance UAV -Zala-, found in our area of ​​responsibility. We nailed it to the ceiling(points up - ed.), every morning I wake up, show the -fak- to the Hall and remind myself why we have to keep fighting. Setting myself up for a working day (laughs - ed.). -Roof-: In addition, this is a reminder that you should not be afraid to do something extraordinary. Ajax: Yes. I am thankful to -Krish-. He often pushes me to do something new. By nature, I am very cautious, I often play it safe, I prefer the usual, already proven format of work. And -Roof- is the opposite. And it often works. I love that we complement each other. That's cool. -Roof-:Our team is already like a family - we understand each other, we -read- each other's words. -Ajax-: To be honest, it's getting ridiculous. Sometimes it happens that we finish the phrases one by one. A kind of synchronization. And it's really cool. If it were otherwise, it probably wouldn't be my person. And we wouldn't be able to work together. In the beginning it was just the two of us. Over time, they began to recruit people into the team, already understanding on what principles we will build it. Staff safety, professionalism, mutual respect, mutual assistance and support. Our task is to share our experience and give people the opportunity to learn. Because, well, let's be honest, nobody knows what tomorrow will bring. Some of us may die. And if you build a team in such a way that each person is irreplaceable, then the loss of even one will make the unit unviable. We can't afford that. -Roof-: Has the war changed us? We should probably ask our loved ones about this. -Ajax-: Stop using my words already! I changed, and I personally would like to think that it is for the better. Priorities have changed. Material things took a back seat. The time that can be spent with relatives has become the most valuable - something that I did not pay attention to before, because it was mostly enough. Lost the value of words, instead gained - actions. There was an understanding of who your real friends are. People you met already in the army are a powerful motivation not to give up, to continue fighting, no matter how tired you are. -Roof-:We hold each other. Because if, for example, I leave, then I will constantly think about how Ajax is here, like the guys. I will not feel safe in the rear because my brothers are here. -Ajax-:If you have already taken up this matter, then you need to move on. The choice is made and it is the right one! Nobody is ironclad. No one said it was easy, that you don't want to go home. -Roof-: Really want it. Ajax: However, I have never regretted my decision to go and defend my country. And I sincerely believe that every person should honestly admit to himself whether he is just an observer or an active participant in something really important and powerful. No matter how difficult it is, the fight for freedom is worth it. -Roof-: I support! Now you said it in my words (smiles - ed.).

How to save life at zero: a report from the takmed school of the DSHV about the fight against combat...	Oleksandr became a combat medic in 2023, also graduated from the same School of Tactical Medicine. After graduation, he was sent with his instructor to the 79th separate Tavrian Assault Brigade to help wounded soldiers at the front. -I remember once I even had to help my mentor. We worked in the forward positions, 200 meters from the contact line, a fierce battle was going on. The enemy was hitting with artillery, the infantry and drones were advancing. My instructor, as a combat medic helping our wounded paratroopers, was himself seriously wounded. Fortunately, it was possible to quickly evacuate him and the other boys to a stabilization point. The instructor and the boys survived. And this means that he prepared me well,- Oleksandr says. Vitaly comes from Sviatohirsk, Donetsk region. He was a combat medic in the 80th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Galician Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He took part in battles in the Kherson region, in the Sviatohirsk region, twice near Bakhmut and in a counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region. Wounded twice.-The most difficult was near Bakhmut. Opposite us were the Pskov paratroopers of the Russian Federation and the -Wagner- PVK. It was very tough, the intensity of hostilities simply went off the scale. Very often during intense shelling, when it is not possible to approach, crawl up and do everything yourself, when the wounded person has not yet managed to help himself, the combat medic from a distance must analyze his condition and, if he is conscious, control the process by voice, indicating what to do. As soon as the situation became relatively more or less safe, we immediately crawled to our wounded guys and worked according to the protocol given the circumstances. In such difficult conditions, they mostly worked under Bakhmut,- says the sergeant-instructor. Vitaly explains: under no circumstances should a combat medic be in a stupor, because he will not provide help to his comrades in time and may die himself. -At the School of Tactical Medicine, training is carried out in two directions - the training of combat medics and the training of paramedics. The main idea of ​​training courses is to teach cadets all the necessary skills that they will need on the battlefield to preserve the life and health of soldiers, sergeants and officers. The training programs necessarily take into account the experience of conducting combat operations. Look, we probably won't tell you a big secret, but a combat medic is not a doctor, as many people think in society. The main task of a combat medic is to save life and maintain the condition of the wounded until the moment when he gets to the doctor, in -hospital- conditions. Another interesting point: as the experience of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation demonstrates, it is easier to train a person from scratch than, for example, to retrain a person with extensive medical experience to become an effective combat medic. Tactical medicine is very different from conventional medicine in its protocols. Both the protocols and the circumstances in which combat medics work differ from those in which ordinary medics work. Combat medics work with what they have. What you took with you to the front, what you specifically have at hand. With this, you save the life of a comrade on the battlefield. Evacuation is very difficult on the front line, when our defenders are constantly under fire from the enemy, under the attack of FPV drones. Here, as it is written in the book, it will not work. Evacuation is carried out mostly by luck, at one or another moment of hostilities. And it depends on whether the car can reach at least some point in the area where it is already possible to evacuate more or less safely. Combat medics are trained according to the generally accepted MARCH algorithm. This is an abbreviation for the sequence of actions in the provision of pre-medical and medical care in combat conditions. Taking into account who is wounded and according to this algorithm, the instructors teach the cadets the actions they need to take in order for the wounded to survive. How the MARCH algorithm is built: the sooner death can come, the sooner you need to act. Therefore, the first letter M in the algorithm is massive bleeding. It is necessary to act immediately. The next A is patency of the upper respiratory tract, from which a person dies in about 5-6 minutes without assistance. Next, R is trauma (injury) to the chest. These are what we call the three -most dangerous letters-. Then there is work with injuries, let's say, which do not bring quick death. These are problems with blood circulation (with the loss of a large volume of blood) and problems with hypothermia and head injuries. In these cases, the main thing is to evacuate to the stabilization point as soon as possible. What do we focus on during classes? Using our own examples, we tell the boys that they should prepare for the most difficult. In battle, it is very difficult, shelling, constant danger, and a combat medic must be -with a cool head- and work under any circumstances, even in conditions of complete chaos and uncertainty. The training of combat medics at the School of Tactical Medicine is divided into conditional zones of the battlefield: red (in the firing zone), yellow (providing assistance on the battlefield when there is no fire, or in the shelter zone) and green (the place where the evacuation of the wounded takes place). Instructors work alongside the cadets. All of them went through combat operations. So they have experience working in extreme conditions. The first training block is an initial medical examination and stopping of critical bleeding. Close by is restoring patency of the upper respiratory tract and providing care for chest injuries. At other training sites, combat medics train to overcome stress, provide care to the wounded with brain injuries and hypothermia, and learn to work with fractures. A separate tent for ligation of body parts. Here, they also master the skills of helping with burns and other injuries, teach how to numb wounds. Another important training block is triage of the wounded. The duties of a combat medic also include instructing soldiers on how to act during shelling or direct combat. It is very important to work on the front lines, when there is a mass application of FPV drones, this should also be taken into account in the training of cadets. The guys emphasize: hand motility and memory are extremely important in battle. The combat medic himself must work out his own -algorithm of actions- with his own hands, he must -feel- the moment, what, how and for what. Cadets are trained to work with soldiers who have psychological problems. There are actionable algorithms, what should be done in a stressful situation, when a military man has suffered some kind of psychological trauma, what to do with him, how to properly get him out of this state? During hostilities, we use the ICOVER protocol, which consists of 6 simple steps: Probably one of the few areas in this war, where the Ukrainian army is head and shoulders above the Katsap army, this is, of course, tactical medicine. The daily level of losses of raschits is a clear confirmation of this. The occupiers do not take away their wounded on the battlefield, do not provide first aid. The Russians do not have turnstiles like ours, which work very efficiently. How many people have we seen captured, killed, they don't even have first aid kits. Instead there are Esmarch harnesses. It's rubber that stretches, cracks due to the heat. Such a turnstile simply kills a person. The occupiers do not care about the lives of their soldiers, for them they are just -cannon fodder. Oleksandr says: -from my experience, I saw only one time, when the soldiers pulled out a wounded officer from among the torn corpses of infantry groups. Wounded and destroyed bodies, the occupiers simply threw them into a pit so that they would not be seen by the next assault groups, which were thrown back into the offensive.- the Russians are inferior to us in medical supply and training of combat medics. All our servicemen undergo a course of tactical medicine before being sent to a combat zone, because they know that their lives and the lives of their comrades in the trenches are the most important. Instead, wounded Rashists, who act according to the prescriptions of Soviet textbooks, die.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/05/yak-zberegty-zhyttya-na-nuli-reportazh-zi-shkoly-takmedu-dshv-pro-borotbu-z-bojovym-stresom/	2025-01-04T20:23:34-08:00
-Psychological terrorism- at ZANP: propaganda again turns reality into absurdity	One of the latest -creations- of the occupiers is the allegation of alleged -psychological terrorism- that Kyiv is directing against the workers of the Zaporizhia NPP (ZAEP). This fake needs detailed analysis, because it not only distorts the facts, but also tries to hide the real crimes of the occupiers at the station. According to Russian narratives, the Ukrainian authorities systematically exert -psychological pressure- on ZNPP employees, in particular through alleged -threats, blackmail and intimidation of families.- This campaign, according to the propagandists, is designed to destabilize the work of the station and disrupt its -normal functioning.- But as with most Russian fakes, the narratives are based on an absolute lack of evidence and a brazen disregard for context. The Zaporizhzhia NPP has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. The station has been turned into a military base: the Russian military has placed equipment and ammunition on its territory, and the workers are actually kept under control. The Ukrainian side does not have physical access to the station, and any statements about Kyiv's direct influence are absurd in view of reality. Propagandists, accusing Ukraine of -psychological terror-, do not provide any confirmation. There are no recordings of the conversations, nor the testimony of the employees themselves, which could testify to the reality of such actions. Instead, there is ample evidence of Russia's crimes at the ZANP, including the testimony of Ukrainian workers who managed to escape the occupation. The occupation administration systematically intimidates the station's employees, forcing them to sign contracts with Russia's Rosatom. Workers are in a state of constant stress due to threats of arrest, torture and even family violence. Such methods are a common practice of the occupiers. russia has already used the nuclear power plant for nuclear blackmail on several occasions, including shelling the plant and creating risks of a large-scale accident. Narratives about -psychological pressure- from Ukraine divert attention from these actions and are designed to create a false impression of the aggressor. Russian disinformation about the ZANP is aimed not only at discrediting Ukraine, but also at creating informational noise that hides the crimes of the occupiers. At the same time, such fakes are aimed at an international audience, which may not be sufficiently familiar with the context and perceive these fabrications as part of the -objective- picture. Kyiv's fake -psychological terrorism- is another example of how Russia distorts reality to justify its crimes. Instead, the real source of terror at the station is the occupiers, who endanger not only ZNPP workers, but also millions of people in Ukraine and abroad. In addition, the Russians damaged and stolen hundreds of computers, software, 1,500 dosimetry devices and fire-fighting equipment. And this is real, not fictional terror. Ukraine continues to make every effort to de-occupy the station and ensure its safety. The world community should clearly understand who the aggressor really is and not succumb to the provocations with which the Kremlin tries to hide its crimes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/05/psyhologichnyj-teroryzm-na-zaes-rospropaganda-znov-peretvoryuye-realnist-na-absurd/	2025-01-04T20:08:20-08:00
They were scared with grenades - two of our paratroopers captured 14 occupiers	The video of the combat work was made public on January 4 on the brigade's channel. An assault group of paratroopers approached one of the Russian positions. Before that, the pilots of the attack drones successfully worked against the enemy. After an intense and long raid, the invaders hid in a tight dugout and did not stick their noses out. At this time, two paratroopers managed to get close. They threw grenades right at the entrance to the enemy dugout. The frightened occupiers immediately shouted that they were ready to lay down their arms. The paratroopers had no idea that as many as 14 occupiers were crammed into the dugout. -They chose life, not death - and our paratroopers did not refuse them. In the unique footage from night drones, we can see how two of our paratroopers are actually taking Russian soldiers into captivity in formation. Brilliant and heroic work,- the team commented on the video.

The Russians left the foresters at the TOT of Ukraine without salaries	This is reported by a> Center of national resistance. Local collaborators appropriated at least 55 million Russian rubles, which were supposed to be paid to foresters. This is not the only reason for non-payment. the Kremlin is no longer able to fully subsidize the Ukrainian regions it occupied and practically destroyed.

Moscow spreads its propaganda abroad through higher education	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The federal project -Export of Education- is used to increase the number of foreign students. Often, the education of foreigners is financed by large state corporations, such as Rosatom or RUSAL. That is, foreign students study at the expense of the Russian state. The Russian Federation seeks to create a -single educational space with Africa.- The Russian-African Network University and the People's Friendship University of Russia (RUDN) are working on this. The goal of the Russian Federation is to educate foreigners who are loyal and dependent on it. After completing their education, graduates of Russian universities open -cultural centers- in their countries and launch other -Russian cooperation- projects. In fact, such projects are just a cover for information operations and the promotion of ru-propaganda in other countries. As reported by ArmyInform, at the end of 2024 the Russian economy showed a number of negative indicators: the acceleration of inflation growth to double-digit values ​​in annual terms, the fall of the ruble exchange rate, the reduction of the balance balance of payments.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/moskva-poshyryuye-svoyu-propagandu-za-kordonom-cherez-vyshhu-osvitu/	2025-01-04T10:11:00-08:00

Prohibited tactics of rashists: the enemy drops tear gas on the positions of our military	How does the enemy attack the positions of our defenders in the Lymano-Kupyan direction and what tactics does it use in on the air the press officer of the brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine told the -Yedini Novyni- telethon -Rubizh- Maxim Taran. -The enemy does not stop trying to break through our defense line. He is trying to destroy our positions by all available means: airstrikes, drops from -maviks- and strikes from FPV drones. For example, enemy infantry in the amount of 5-10 people is coming, we start to destroy them and thereby unmask our positions. The enemy sees this and then begins to attack us with drops from Maviks, use artillery, as well as kamikaze drones,- &#8211; the officer said. According to the press officer, the enemy's infantry is created only to -light up- our positions and die. -Also, the enemy has recently increased the number of tear gas discharges. the Rashists seek to -smoke- us out of our positions. But the personnel of our brigade has all necessary means of protection,- said Maksym Taran. the Russians in this direction began to use -maviks- more, since they are not as sensitive to the EW system as, for example, a simple FPV drone. -The enemy has also started using fiber-optic FPV drones. This allows it to avoid the operation of our EW tools. The best way to destroy these drones is with a shotgun,- he said. At the same time, in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Rubizh- brigade, there is slightly less use of enemy armored vehicles with weapons. -Even earlier, there were attempts to break through our defense line with the help of heavy equipment, but thanks to the effective actions of our artillery support units and anti-tank units, the enemy suffered heavy losses,- the press officer added. As reported by ArmyInform , in the Vremiv direction, the main task of the Russian troops remains the cutting of logistical routes units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/zaboroneni-pryjomy-rashystiv-vorog-skyduye-slozoginnyj-gaz-na-pozycziyi-nashyh-vijskovyh/	2025-01-04T08:49:58-08:00
-Chain of life-: Guardsman -Dentist- about the evacuation of the wounded in the Pokrovsky direction	The story of the fighter published by the National Guard of Ukraine. The medic says that the -chain of life- for wounded comrades at the front has three basic elements: -case-evac-, -med-evac- and -stabilization point-. -Dentist- and his colleagues work on medical evacuation. — There are several stages of evacuation. Case-evac works from the positions of our comrades where the injury occurred - they are taken to us by armored vehicles. We stabilize the wounded, provide him with all the necessary medical assistance and transport him to the stabilization point as soon as possible. We have several duty stations. If we receive a signal about the wounded, we try to find out as much as possible about the condition of the fighters - light, medium, heavy, as well as about the nature of the wound. We make decisions according to the situation. At the same time, they should be accepted quickly, - explains -Dantist-. During a medical evacuation, speed is very important, but the professionalism and coordinated work of the evacuation team are no less important. Injuries are different. The boys say that, in contrast to the Zaporozhye direction, near Pokrovsk the number of gunshot wounds from small arms has increased. The enemy is also actively using poisonous gases. All this makes adjustments to the work of doctors. One of the principles that the evacuation team tries to follow is constant communication with wounded soldiers. — We maintain not only visual, but also auditory contact: we communicate, we say that the fighter should not relax. Usually, when an injured person gets into our car, the brain thinks: -I'm safe, now they'll save me.- It relaxes a person. We encourage her, tell her not to sleep, ask questions. We leave her in consciousness, - says the guardsman. -Dentist- admits that the hardest thing is when you have to save a loved one. In this case, it is important to keep a cool head and not let emotions get the better of you. There are no easy evacuations, but if this is your brother with whom you shared a piece of bread yesterday, then it is really more difficult. But you have to approach it with a cold mind and understand that his life depends on your actions, so we go beyond these emotional details and work with a cold mind, says the doctor. One day, the guardsman received news of the death of his brother, with whom he had been side by side since the first days of the full-scale invasion. - It was very traumatic for me. In the evening, we received information that we had a seriously wounded person. We drove to the evacuation point and it turned out to be my brother, whom I thought was dead. He was in a very difficult condition, but he was alive, and it already depended on us whether he would live in the future. We made decisions very quickly, did everything possible. He survived. This motivates to work in this direction and to treat one's work responsibly, - the -Dentist- shares his memories. As reported ArmyInform, fighters of the 71st Hunter Brigade of the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed 2 Russian attack aircraft with one blow, and then burned several units of equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/lanczyuzhok-zhyttya-gvardiyecz-dantyst-pro-evakuacziyu-poranenyh-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-04T08:27:41-08:00
the Russian economy in 2025 awaits -import inflation-	About this reports the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Despite the efforts of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, these factors are a reflection of the unbalanced growth model of the Russian wartime economy. At the same time, the monetary policy of Russia demonstrates the transition to the -mode of manual management-. This is confirmed by the regulator's decision not to raise the discount rate in December in exchange for the government's promise to limit preferential lending programs. Further strengthening of Western sanctions and a decrease in the price of oil will have a noticeable negative impact on the economy of the Russian Federation. Challenges that will affect the Russian economy in 2025: - a possible resumption of -trade wars- between leading countries. This can complicate global logistics and limit the production of goods, which will negatively affect the demand for Russian export products; — increase in production and export of oil in countries that are not part of the OPEC+ agreement and, accordingly, a noticeable decrease in world oil prices. Brazil, Canada and the USA can provide an additional 1.5 million barrels per day. In addition, from the II quarter of 2025, an agreed increase in production is also possible in OPEC+ countries, which do not want to give up market shares; — strengthening of sanctions restrictions and control over trade transactions and payments of Russian companies; — a reduction in the harvest of agricultural crops in 2025 due to unfavorable natural conditions in 2024 will weaken Russia's position on world agricultural markets. The combination of the above factors will create the effect of -inflation import-, in which the increase in the prices of goods in the world due to trade and currency wars, the lengthening of delivery routes and the increase of transport tariffs will lead to an increase in prices, which does not depend on domestic economic policy. As reported ArmyInform, People The Bank of China (NBC) announced plans to reform the country's monetary policy in 2025.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/rosijsku-ekonomiku-u-2025-roczi-chekaye-import-inflyacziyi/	2025-01-04T08:11:57-08:00

-Advancing by corpses-: what are the tactics of the enemy near Velika Novosilka	The head of the communications department 48 told about this in the broadcast telethon -Edyny Novyny- Bohdan Petrenko of the separate artillery brigade. -The situation in Vremivsk direction is really difficult. The enemy is trying to capture territories and advance. In addition, the enemy wants to control the supply routes to Velika Novosilka and the route that goes to Kurakhovo. But the Defense Forces are putting up quite a powerful resistance to the enemy's intentions and are not allowing him to realize these intentions, the officer said. Bohdan Petrenko reported that the enemy's tactics in this direction are unchanged. -This is the application of small tactical groups. In some places, mechanized equipment is also used to transport the rakes. How it happens: The infantry enters the gray areas and tries to advance towards our positions. But at all stages of their movement, they are monitored from the air and fire damage is carried out in a timely manner,- he emphasized. According to him, the enemy will suffer heavy losses, but at the same time, he will not stop trying to advance further. -Russians do not spare people, unlike military equipment. Detection and destruction of the enemy takes place practically 24/7. Small infantry groups climb up, they are destroyed, then other Russian servicemen follow, who step over the corpses of -their comrades- and die themselves,- Bohdan Petrenko added. As reported ArmyInform, the situation at the front remains tense, particularly intense fighting continues near Pokrovsk in Donetsk region. This direction is the point of concentration of the enemy's main efforts.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/prosuvannya-po-trupam-yakoyu-ye-taktyka-voroga-poblyzu-velykoyi-novosilky/	2025-01-04T07:26:28-08:00

China is reforming its monetary policy, focusing on international standards	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The main instrument of regulation will be the seven-day reverse repo rate. In this way, the regulator will abandon the traditional practice of setting -quantitative targets- for credit volumes and will reduce the use of a large number of different interest rates currently applied in the country's financial system. The changes are aimed at reducing the level of the discount rate, which is currently 1.5%. The reform will reduce the risks associated with overcapacity, when businesses produce more goods than the market needs, leading to lower prices and losses, problems in the real estate market due to excessive vacancies and financial instability due to high debts construction companies and inefficient use of loans, which are often provided for unprofitable or excessively risky projects. In addition, the NBK purchased government bonds on the open market for the first time in twenty years, which made it possible to introduce additional liquidity into the financial system. The success of the reform may bring China's monetary policy closer to international standards. Transitioning to a more transparent and efficient system based on international standards will enable the PRC to attract more foreign investment, increase confidence in the financial system and contribute to a more predictable economic environment. As reported ArmyInform, the Russians are actively preparing for another illegal election in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine during a single voting day.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/kytaj-reformuye-svoyu-monetarnu-polityku-oriyentuyuchys-na-mizhnarodni-standarty/	2025-01-04T06:11:33-08:00
The Russian officer who was involved in the murder of 59 Ukrainians was seriously injured	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on January 4. According to the GUR, on January 3, an explosion took place in the Shuya settlement of the Ivanovo region in Russia, at the epicenter of which was the battery commander of the 112th missile brigade of the 1st tank army of the Western Military District of the Russian Federation (military unit 03333), Captain Nagayko Konstantin Vladimirovich. -He was on duty in his military unit, and now - at death. -Nagaika has multiple fragmentary lesions of practically all organs, in particular the brain - he underwent skull trepanation,- the HUR said in a statement.

The spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. -Fighting the enemy is a constant search for counteracting its influence on Ukraine's actions at sea. the Russians, like us, are looking for different options for using their forces at sea. We all remember how the appearance of manned naval systems began to significantly affect the presence of Russian warships in various parts of the Black Sea and Crimea. And at some point the rules of the game were changed. the Russians were actually forced to suspend their permanent activities in the open Black Sea,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. The enemy was also looking for ways to counter our naval drones. -And for them, aviation became this solution. But now Ukrainian naval drones are not only hunting for Russian ships, but also for enemy helicopters. And I hope that similar tactics will be used on a much larger scale in the future. This moment is a turning point in the war at sea, and the Russians are now forced to seek countermeasures again,- Dmytro Pletenchuk added.

The EU seeks to localize defense production	This is reported by Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Such a decision will help strengthen the defense capability of the region and create new partnerships between European manufacturers. An example is the German company -Hensoldt-, which benefited from the growth of defense investments in Germany - the company's shares have almost tripled since 2022, and the order book in 2024 has reached a record 6.5 billion euros. European manufacturers expect that even after the end of the Russian-Ukrainian war, defense spending will remain high due to the need to contain Russia's military potential. NATO member countries' plans to increase defense spending from 2% to 3% of GDP will contribute to the development of the EU's defense sector. In this context, EU member states are already discussing the creation of a joint fund worth 500 billion euros for defense projects and arms purchases.

Surround Pokrovsk and cut logistics: The enemy's plans were reported to OSUV - Khortytsia	Viktor, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, told about this in Edyny Novyni marathon air Tregubov -The plan of the enemy &#8211; this is the encirclement of Pokrovsk and the entry of Russian troops there. They are trying, first of all, to interrupt the communications and logistics chains that the Ukrainian army currently has. In order to do this, they try to stick together in small groups in settlements south of Pokrovsk. According to the principle, a small group first got involved, got a foothold, and the next one approached. That is, simply promotion with impregnation. Of course, at the same time, they do not climb directly into the city, because these are heavy urban battles. And Pokrovsk is unlikely to be too much for them. Especially since they have already engaged in urban battles in a number of other settlements,- &#8211; says Viktor Tregubov. The Ukrainian Defense Forces are trying to prevent them from doing this (cut communications - author) and strike at the enemy, including with drones and other weapons. According to him, the enemy is no longer using anti-aircraft missiles as actively as it was, for example, a year ago. -It should be understood that this weapon is very inaccurate, but causes serious destruction. The best way to counter KABs &#8211; this is the destruction of enemy airfields, the planes of the Russian Federation, even before they took off, and the destruction of the stocks of aerial bombs themselves,- &#8211; he added. As ArmyInform reported, over the past day the enemy attacked 40 times in the Pokrovsky direction. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/otochyty-pokrovsk-i-pererizaty-logistyku-u-osuv-hortyczya-povidomyly-plany-voroga/	2025-01-04T01:23:15-08:00
-Baba Yaga- stole the wounded man! — the Russians are so afraid of our bomber drones that they inven...	About the fighter his brigade told on January 4. -Oak- and his boys are sponsors of the night terrors of the enemy. The occupiers shudderingly call the -Vampire- bombers -Baba Yaga-. Among the enemies, there is even a legend that once -Baba Yaga- kidnapped their wounded soldier. But this, as -Duba- says, is folklore. -Of course, the -Vampire- can raise a person, but it will not carry him far. I know there are already drones that can lift up to several hundred kilograms, but we don't have them yet. And they cost a lot of money,- notes -Duba-. -Constructively, the Vampire is an ordinary agricultural drone, equipped and improved to perform combat tasks. It is large and very loud, so it is impossible to fly to enemy positions on it during the day - it will be shot down immediately. But at night it's a different matter,- says -Duba-. The volume of the drone is its advantage. -When the -Vampire- flies, the sound of the engine can be heard from a kilometer away. It is audible, but the drone itself is not visible. The sound seems to be approaching from all sides, and the enemy simply does not understand where in the sky to look for it. That's why he starts shooting in different directions, chaotically. And we fly there and do our work,- says -Duba-. -Vampire- can perform many tasks. The guys from the unit say that two crews are enough to -open- even a well-protected enemy dugout. In addition, often with the help of heavy drones, pilots deliver parcels to the positions of our infantry: they drop food, medicine, batteries for walkie-talkies, fuel for generators. The capacity of the -Vampire- is impressive. According to -Duba-, all its pilots are professionals, versatile specialists. -There are no unmotivated, random people here. The peculiarity of our work is that, in order to be successful, a person must be a hunter at heart. That's why I'm turning to civilians who are currently choosing a specialty in the army: if you want to fight fun, with excitement, with courage, welcome to us. Neither gender nor age is a limitation. The main thing is motivation and desire, and we will teach you how to throw a 9-kilogram bomb into a small crack in an enemy shelter,- -Duba- assures. As reported by ArmyInform, the tankers of the 58th motorized infantry brigade named after Hetman Ivan Vyhovsky managed to reach the position of the Russians under enemy fire and close to shoot her.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/baba-yaga-vkrala-poranenogo-rosiyany-tak-boyatsya-nashyh-droniv-bomberiv-shho-vygaduyut-pro-nogo-legendy/	2025-01-04T01:04:04-08:00

All the reserves, all the reinforcements from Russia, everything that is recruited and trained, everything goes in two directions: this is the Kursk region and the south of the Donetsk region. Some experts say that Russia has a deadline of January 20 to liberate Kurshchyna from us, and the Rashists are working very actively on this. But I won't say that they have great success, because we keep the defense and our art works very tightly and repels the enemy,- said Kyrylo Sazonov. The defense forces in Kurshchyna are in active defense and are successfully counterattacking. -You see how the artillery destroys the locations of the 810th brigade of the Russian marines, the headquarters and communication nodes.

According to Kyril Sazonov, the enemy uses the same tactics as in Donbas. -The enemy is trying to advance to our positions in small assault groups, gather there and then attack further. They also use any technique to quickly break through to our positions. They use light cars, motorcycles, buggies and even scooters. We call this area the -buffer zone of death.- But we destroy them,- said Kyrylo Sazonov. As reported by ArmyInform, the aerial scouts of the 41st mechanized brigade showed footage of the defeat of a column of Russian armored vehicles and a bunch of loaded enemy vehicles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/vybyty-do-20-sichnya-rosijskomu-komanduvannyu-vstanovyly-dedlajn-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-04T00:41:58-08:00

Released from captivity: what the military is entitled to	ArmyInform tells what other rights and opportunities those who went through captivity have. Servicemen released from captivity may resign from service. This provides for Art. 26 of the Law of Ukraine -On Military Duty and Military Service-, amendments to which entered into force on May 18 of this year. At the same time, it does not matter when exactly the serviceman was released from captivity. If a serviceman decides to use the right to discharge, he can also count on one-time assistance upon dismissal. It is 50 percent of the monthly allowance for each full calendar year of service. If a serviceman who has returned from captivity wishes to continue his service, he has the right to 90 days holidays. Such leave is not divided into parts, and during it the allowance continues to be accrued. Such leave can be revoked only with the consent of the serviceman. Those released from captivity are entitled to one-time assistance of 100,000 hryvnias. This applies to both civilians and military personnel. It also provides for the payment of anannualfinancial aid for those who were in captivity. This is 100,000 hryvnias for each year of stay in places of detention. How to get? In order to calculate such payments, it is necessary to establish the fact of deprivation of liberty as a result of armed aggression against Ukraine. The establishment of this fact is handled by a special commission under the Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories. One of the mandatory documents that must be provided to the commission is a certificate of imprisonment. It can be obtained from the National Information Bureau. The request should be sent to the bureau's e-mail address: info@nib.gov.ua, or fill out the form on the site. Citizens released from captivity have the right to legal aid. And given all the bureaucratic factors that exist in our country, such help will definitely not be superfluous.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/zvilneni-z-polonu-na-shho-mayut-pravo-vijskovi-2/	2025-01-03T21:07:15-08:00
Eleven birthdays of Anastasia Shevchenko: direct involvement from the occupation, storming of the TC...	When she talks about how she got into the army, how she -stormed- the military commissariat in the spring of 2022, how she likes to work in positions with soldiers - there is fire in her eyes. She joined the army from civilian journalism. Since 2016, she has worked in newspapers and on television. She taught college students, has a master's degree in journalism. Immediately before the large-scale invasion, she was a journalist for -Suspilne Zaporizhzhia-. Behind her are several weeks of life in the occupation, stubbornly -standing- under the Military Commissariat, receiving the rank of officer and building the work of the communications department of the newly created brigade from scratch. Anastasia is sincerely proud of this success. The ArmyInform correspondent met with the officer at a time when the brigade was taken away for recovery. We asked the servicewoman about mobilization and motivation, fear and death, injury and the front, and more. Anastasia recalls that around February 23, 2022, she already understood that there would be a large-scale invasion: she had just arrived to visit her parents in Zaporizhzhia and stayed the night with them. — In the evening, when the meeting of the State Duma of the Russian Federation was broadcast, and later - a video of the Russians entering our territory, I once again understood that the Russians are brazenly, no longer hybridly, violating our state sovereignty. In the morning, she woke up to the fact that there were the first flights in her hometown, at the airport, the windows were shaking. It was difficult to understand the questioning: whether it was a dream or whether it was all real life, she says. On the same day, she went to the local military commissar, but returned - because she was officially in the hospital. Therefore, they went with their family to one of the settlements where Anastasia's grandparents lived, to help with the household, etc. But in a few days, the Russians occupied this settlement. — I went to the window, it was not clear what was happening. You won't be able to get into the city, because there is continuous intense shelling&#8230; It was not clear what to do - and this is the first such experience. They watched the marathon almost around the clock. In the window they saw people in military uniform with white bandages on their hands. And once a tank with the letter Z drove by, — Anastasiya analyzes her memories. Then there was life under occupation — and live phone calls for Ukrainian television about Russian war crimes, round-the-clock shelling of civilian infrastructure, etc. I saw everything with my own eyes. - There was no gas, electricity, or water in the house. We went to the basement. Sometimes they sat there around the clock. But: they ate lard, it's good that grandparents sealed it in three-liter cans&#8230; Then some humanitarian aid began to arrive. We went to get bread with my mother, at our own peril and risk. Because it was not clear how they react to men on the streets, for example, says Anastasia. They went to the territory controlled by Ukraine at the beginning of March. After returning, says Anastasia, she decided to go to the RTCC. — Because even before the start of the full-scale invasion, I told my parents that I wanted to be as useful as possible to my country — but already in pixels. No one believed that someone would call me, so small and fragile, but it was important for me: to be part of the team that would liberate the occupied territories; part of a team that stands with weapons in hand and has a clear motivation, says Anastasia. However, he adds that the Military Commissariat -boiled- for a long time and did not want to call up. - The application was accepted back in March with words like -I have a daughter your age, I don't really want to call you up, but you have the right to do so.- Yes, they saw that I was, of course, not Johnnick, not Rambo, but I was serious. That's why they said to wait. And they also say: -Well, look, you have such an education that we recruit journalists as lieutenants immediately to officer positions. Currently, all vacant positions of press officers are filled, there are no vacancies in public relations services, please wait.- But I didn't need an officer's rank, I just wanted to be useful, I wanted to go to study. The wait lasted for two weeks. In the end, they called and said to arrive at 8:00 with the things. Among the crowd of men there were only two girls - two Anastasias. Recruits were selected for the gunner training center. No matter how much the two Anastasias raised their hands, they seemed not to be noticed. Then the soldier said, -Girls, there are artillery pieces the size of you. Maybe harder. This is not for you, wait.- The wait continued for several more weeks. Then there was a selection for the -study- of signalmen. — And again we stood in the first row. In the eyes of the soldier, a silent -well, where did they get my head?- was read. And he said to come next time. I was already irritated, I thought that the wrong one was attacked! I approach and say: -Mr. Major! I understand everything! We are girls! But give us the opportunity to go to this -tutorial-. It's not artillery anymore, it's communications!- He asked if we were ready to haul coils of wire or if the satellite dishes were large. We answered that if necessary, then yes. He understood that we will not let go of him. And that this scenario will repeat itself tomorrow morning. He went to the head of the TCC. I left - and we went by bus to the training center in the Lviv region, - Anastasia says in one breath and with excitement. And he adds: - We were happy. We understood that this is a new stage of our life. One of my motivations for joining the Defense Forces was the occupied settlement where I grew up. Where did she visit her grandparents for the holidays, where did she eat the most delicious dumplings, where did she break more than one knee while riding a bicycle. These are childhood memories that are poisoned by the fact that the Russians are there now. The educational center had theory, practice, and physical training. After the training center, he was assigned to the 5th separate communications regiment in the Chernihiv region. There she worked with document management. But the desire to become a part of the combat brigade did not fade. In the end, after a year of such service, Anastasia did fulfill, as she says, her dream: she was transferred to the 44th separate mechanized, newly created combat brigade. It was in June 2023. Anastasia had the rank of senior soldier. - It was just a new life! A radically different lifestyle! Coordination, photo reports, interviews. We developed an archive, then there was no Facebook page, YouTube channel, - says Anastasia, and again with fire in her eyes. In July 2023, Anastasia went to officer courses - and in August she already received a rank. And immediately to the Kupyansko-Svativ direction. At first it was in the communications department of the brigade itself, but now they have expanded. Working on the front lines, in the Kharkiv region, says Anastasia, is -one solid pleasure-: — &#8230; When you don't sit still, but go around the units every day, you communicate with servicemen. Well, it is also support for them. Yes, most of all I like to work on positions with boys. We have incredibly motivated people in our team. There are older soldiers, there are those with six concussions. And they say: -I'm here until the end.- These people return even when they can leave the army. But they understand that if they do not stop the enemy there now, then the enemy will have to be stopped here, on peaceful territory. Anastasia says that in April 2024, she fell asleep for the first time precisely at the positions of the mortars. - I have never slept so soundly as there. It was very cozy. I heard how the dancer was working nearby, I heard that the RSZV was flying in, cassettes&#8230; And you are so cool and cozy that you are next to these people&#8230; Although there was an awareness of danger and risks, there was no fear. But once an enemy shell exploded very close - Anastasia got a concussion. It was in the place where they spent the night on May 27, 2024. - If it happened in the positions, it would not be so offensive. Emergency services said the next morning that it was either a Hurricane or a Tornado. The rocket fell 10 meters from my window. I remember very clearly this sound, the flames, how the plaster fell. I have a total of 11 birthdays since the start of the large-scale invasion. For example, an S-300 flew 50 meters from me, and I was working with documents at the window. And it flew across the road, but the projectile got stuck in the sewer and did not explode. Anastasia works with both Ukrainian and foreign media. He says that everyone is in good faith. — But still, my personal opinion is that our Ukrainian journalists adhere more to the standards. But among the foreign audience there are both fixers and journalists chasing sensation. Ukrainians, on the other hand, understand that it is necessary to adhere to standards, not to ask too much, because this is, first of all, the safety of our servicemen. It is comfortable for Anastasia to work in the communications of the military unit due to the fact that both the brigade command and the units directly understand the importance of popularizing the military unit in the context of information warfare and information confrontation with the enemy. Further plans for the development of communications are to create a film about the servicemen of the brigade. — We are currently shooting documentaries, 20-minute films, shooting from the positions. But we want, of course, more content, more stories from the front lines. Yes, they understand that artillery, mortar or FPV may come, but they still go and do their duty. I remember very well the phrase of one soldier, an infantryman in the Kupyansk direction: -I will not kneel before the enemy. But I will stand only in two cases: in case of victory - to kiss the ground. And in front of my mother.- Press officers have different approaches, says Anastasia, but her priority is work in combat positions, moral support of the military: - It is important that they understand that we are not sitting somewhere in the rear. Because there is a contrast between 17 km from zero and 2 km from zero. You know, when you drive into a front-line village, it's as if death reigns there: there isn't a single whole house or surviving tree; the air there seems to be permeated with death. And everyone, as if by an invisible signal, quiets down in the car, as if crossing some kind of portal to another world. And this is felt even when we drive into such settlements at night. These are very elusive and unexplained things, but they are there. From the distance of time, remembering how she -stormed- the TCC, Anastasia claims that she was not disappointed in her choice. — I understand that I am in my place. Although I understand that at the moment I do not see myself in civilian life, in the sense of work. So today demobilization — and what tomorrow? Build your life from scratch? Yes, sometimes there is a desire to stay in the army - and then you see fragments of civilian life - and so you want this well-being, a family nest and for the war to stop, - the servicewoman shares. Now the military unit is under reconstruction. I wonder what civilian joys Anastasia allowed herself the first time the brigade left the war zone. - Marigolds. And dyed her hair. Because there is no time for that at all. Gulka-style — and left — smiling coquettishly, she says. We ask a military servicewoman what she would advise civilians who have not yet joined the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, in particular, because of fear. Here is what Anastasia Shevchenko answers: - No matter how strong the Defense Forces are, they are not in a position to take everyone by force. It should be a conscious choice. Previously, there was no such visible gap between the civilian and military worlds, everyone worked together against the enemy. Now, unfortunately, this gap is already being felt. I can't say it's bad. We are there so that civilians can live peacefully here. And it's great that this life continues - despite shelling, missile strikes and the fact that, unfortunately, the front is advancing. Therefore&#8230; What is my advice to civilians? Try. Yes, now everyone is tired of the war - both civilians and military. But if they cannot be stopped there now, then they will have to be stopped here. — What will be the end of the war for you? — At least the announcement of a cease-fire regime&#8230; But for me personally, the war will end only when my native region and not only is freed from enemy occupation. And the return of territories and restoration of borders is not a matter of one day, not even a month.

Put on new armor: Turkish Altay tanks will be equipped with new active protection systems	How informs Istanbul-based news portal Türkiye Today, Abdulmenaf Erdem, a project engineer at the Turkish Defense Industry Secretariat (SSB), said: -The Akkor system has successfully completed the testing stages and will be available to equip the Altai main battle tanks in 2025.- informs ArmyInform. Let us remind you that the very concept of -Active protection system (APS), Defensive aids system (DAS)) is the definition of defense systems of military equipment, the essence of which is to influence weapons released by the enemy (missile, projectile) in order to change their trajectories, reduce the probability of hitting the target, significantly reduce the effectiveness of their action. In case full implementation of the APS Akkor project, which, according to according to the defense portal from Ankara Defense Turkey, the company Aselsan developed with In 2008, the Republic of Turkey will become the third country in the world to have a full-fledged active defense system (SAZ) of its own production. Currently, Germany (AMAP ADS project) and Israel (Iron Fist and Trophy projects) can boast of such equipment, which is placed on military equipment. How notify experts of the Army Recognition website, the Akkor system includes a high-resolution radar, ammunition for interception of incoming threats and rapid response launchers, providing comprehensive 360-degree protection. In addition, Turkey implemented the Pulat APS program on an entire battalion of modernized M60T tanks under the Fırat project, completed in 2020 . Pulat has countermeasure modules, a control panel and a power distribution unit, which is a transitional stage in the active protection capabilities of Turkey's production. modern operational requirements, while increasing the defense independence of Turkey. It is equipped with a 120 mm smoothbore gun that is highly accurate against moving targets, a twin 7.62 mm machine gun, and a remote-controlled battle station for either 7.62 mm or 12.7 mm machine guns. Its an advanced fire control system combines a thermal imager, a laser range finder for target tracking and stabilized optics for high accuracy. Powered by a locally produced Batu V12 BMC Power 1,500 horsepower engine, the Altay has a top speed of 65 km/h with a range of 500 km, making it highly adaptable to various terrains. The tank's protection includes modular composite armour, developed by Roketsan, enhanced by Akkor APS, which intercepts threats in real time. It also includes CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radioactive and Nuclear) protection, fire suppression systems and 360-degree situational awareness capabilities, etc. These systems work together to significantly increase Altai's survivability in combat scenarios. In addition to integration into the Altai MBT, the Akkor equipment will also be installed on the Turkish Defense Forces' Leopard 2A4 tanks and Korhan light armored vehicles, reflecting its modularity and adaptability to various platforms. The Akkor deployment follows wider efforts to strengthen Turkey's military capabilities caused by recent military conflicts where anti-tank weapons have posed significant challenges. Modernization of Leopard 2A4 tanks began in 2023, and the first deliveries of Akkor-equipped tanks are expected by the end of 2024. Having signed an initial contract for the production of 250 Altay units and plans to increase their number to 1,000, Turkey is positioning Altay MBT as the cornerstone of its capabilities in terms of armored vehicles.

Pseudo rallies in Europe -against Ukraine-: another illusion of the Russian Federation	Let's analyze this fake in detail. Russian media and social networks are actively spreading information about alleged mass protests in various European countries, which, according to propagandists, demonstrate citizens' disagreement with Ukraine's support. It is claimed that Europeans took to the streets because of the -economic crisis caused by the war- and -human rights violations by Ukraine-. Such statements are especially actively accompanied by photos and videos, which, at first glance, seem convincing. Propagandists add fictitious quotes from -eyewitnesses- and lengthy articles that misrepresent the mood in Europe. I want to explain why the truth is based on the fact that it is all a lie. Most of the images and videos distributed by Russia have nothing to do with anti-war or anti-support actions. For example: Russian special services are known for organizing pseudo-rallies. Extras are hired to hold placards with anti-war slogans, playing into the hands of Kremlin propaganda. These actions are filmed and presented as -real citizen reactions-. Propagandists actively use fake profiles in social networks, where posts about support for these rallies are distributed on behalf of the -people of Europe-. However, a detailed analysis of these accounts reveals that most of them were created recently and have signs of bots. No authoritative European publication confirms large-scale actions -against Ukraine-. On the contrary, there are numerous materials about actions to support our country. In real life, most Europeans support Ukraine, understanding that Russia is the aggressor. Firstly, public opinion in Ukraine can be manipulated in this way. Propagandists are trying to lower the level of morale of Ukrainians, convincing them that their struggle allegedly does not have international support. Secondly, the Russian propaganda machine is trying to influence Europeans. the Kremlin seeks to sow doubts among EU citizens about the expediency of supporting Ukraine, hoping for a change of heart in European governments. Third, again, this is a distraction. The spread of fakes about -anti-Ukrainian rallies- is designed to divert attention from real problems, such as Russian aggression, war and economic sanctions against Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/psevdomityngy-v-yevropi-proty-ukrayiny-chergova-ilyuziya-rf/	2025-01-03T20:02:40-08:00
He defended himself with a carpet and sacks, but missed from the rear - the comedic death of a Russi...	The video of the defeat appeared on January 3 on the brigade channel. The invader camped in a dugout, the main entrance to which he covered with sacks and a stolen carpet. But the Russian forgot about the -black- entrance to the dugout, where our kamikaze drone flew. Next, finishing off the enemy was already a matter of technique. -An exciting video for evening viewing from the Kupyansk direction called -Zamuravali, demons!- We promise: you'll like it!-, commented the personnel in the brigade. As reported by ArmyInform, defenders of the 14th mechanized brigade named after Prince Roman the Great showed a spectacular reflection of a powerful enemy assault.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/03/zahyshhavsya-kylymom-ta-mishkamy-ale-propustyv-z-tylu-komedijna-zagybel-rosiyanyna-na-kupyanshhyni/	2025-01-03T11:58:43-08:00
They thought that they would cross the border quickly and inconspicuously without things in winter: ...	About the State Border Service of Ukraine informs January 3. Information about a possible attempt to illegally cross the border was provided in advance by the officers of the operative and investigative department. In the direction indicated by operatives, the response group detained three residents of Lviv Oblast and two residents of Volyn. During the detention, the men reported that they were enjoying the mountain scenery, but later admitted that they had come to Transcarpathia to illegally cross the border. -Travellers- independently planned a route through the mountainous section of the Ukrainian-Romanian border in advance. They decided not to take proper equipment with them. According to the plan of the violators, without things they will be able to go faster on the intended path,- the message says. For the commission of offenses provided for in Article 204-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Article 202 of the Code of Administrative Offenses, the border guards drew up administrative protocols for the men. The court will soon provide a legal evaluation of the men's actions. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/03/dumaly-shho-bez-rechej-vzymku-shvydko-i-nepomitno-peretnut-kordon-zatrymano-grupu-cholovikiv/	2025-01-03T11:38:50-08:00

And my friend is a shotgun — the Defense Forces opened an anti-drone course	on the ArmyTV stream on January 3, the head of the media group 413 of the Raid unmanned systems battalion, sergeant Oleksiy Godzenko, told about this . -Our subdivision has its own school. And there we opened a shotgun course. Exactly how to counter a threat from the air with shotguns. We have success in this direction and are increasing them. Shotguns, in fact, are not the only way to fight off -efpivishoks-, both radio-controlled and those that work on fiber optics. Because it is extremely difficult to shoot down such a small and such a fast target with a machine gun,- said Oleksiy Godzenko. As ArmiyaInform reported, the 413th battalion of unmanned systems -Raid- said that the occupiers are increasingly using buggies to transport their attack aircraft and are trying to protect equipment from our drones. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/03/i-drug-mij-drobovyk-v-sylah-oborony-vidkryly-antydronovyj-kurs/	2025-01-03T11:21:36-08:00
DITA is killed - Czech self-propelled guns destroy Russian guns in the Toretsk direction	This was told by on the Army TV stream January 3 the commander of the DITA gun with the call sign -Trader-. -Our gun is primarily used for counter-battery fighting, as it has a long maximum range of up to 39 kilometers.

The commander of the Armed Forces Navy told how the enemy made it difficult to use the base in Sevas...	About this he wrote 3 January. -During the past year, units of missile launchers and maritime unmanned systems of the Navy carried out dozens of successful strikes on about 50 military objects of the enemy, including in the temporarily occupied Crimea. These were military airfields, storage warehouses for ammunition, fuel and other military property, storage and production sites for -Shakheds-, objects of air defense and surveillance systems, logistics hubs and military enterprises of the Russian military industry,- said Oleksiy Neizhpapa. According to him, the actions of the Navy made it much more difficult for Russia to use its main naval base in the temporarily occupied Crimea, Sevastopol. -the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation was forced to withdraw most of its warships, including all carriers of Kalibr missiles, to Novorossiysk. Our defenders stopped the free maneuvering of Russian ships in the Sea of ​​Azov, forcing them to withdraw to bases in the Krasnodar Territory,- noted Oleksiy Neizhpapa. Separately, he heard a report on the use of air reconnaissance. -Over the course of a year, our scouts flew almost 700 hours, during which they discovered about 400 enemy targets. It was their data that became the basis for planning military operations. This underscores the importance of introducing new technologies and expanding the use of unmanned systems for both reconnaissance and strike missions. At the same time, a significant increase in the number of trained UAV pilots — 7 times compared to last year — allows us to implement these opportunities more effectively,- noted the Commander of the Armed Forces Navy. Another achievement he called ensuring the functioning of the sea corridor and the stable movement of ships, which made it possible to export millions of tons of Ukrainian grain, support our economy and strengthen food security in the world. -I determined the relevant tasks for this year. One of the key directions is ensuring quality training of our servicemen, this is an important condition for saving their lives. Also, the priority task remains the search and destruction of enemy objects. Our goal is to weaken the enemy's combat potential as much as possible. Thanks to all our soldiers for their resilience. We work together to win! Glory to Ukraine!- wrote Oleksiy Neizhpapa.

But such a -thump- was not too strong when they hit the military town hard. At 11 o'clock — at the beginning of the 12 o'clock. I went out, came here - the door was broken. And small sparks began to fly from here and there, - he said. Local residents say that the house was more than 100 years old. It is wooden, covered with bricks. The old, dry wood caught fire instantly, causing a fire that was extremely difficult to put out. - The guys put out the fire - they did a good job.

Another attacker lived in the city of Rodynske and hoped for the complete capture of the region. He made public posts in support of military groups of the Russian Federation fighting in the Pokrovsky direction, and also advocated the complete disarmament of Ukraine. a resident of Pervomaisk was detained, who was spreading calls for a coup d'état in our country on the Internet.

About this in an interview with ArmiyaInform said the head of the Secretariat of the Coordination Staff for the Treatment of Prisoners of War Bohdan Okhrimenko. The Main Directorate of Intelligence, the Security Service, the Armed Forces, the National Guard, etc., are involved in the project. -We give the Russians the opportunity to familiarize themselves with information on how they can surrender. We have organized chatbots in which they can contact and describe the situation, indicate which direction they are in. We simulate the process of their crossing the contact line without harming them,- said Bohdan Okhrimenko. He recalled the successful special operations when, thanks to this project, the Russians went over to our side even with weapons or even entire platoons, with tanks, with helicopters, with equipment. -In total, if we take all of them together, then probably even more than a battalion has already surrendered,- the Coordinating Staff said. Bohdan Okhrimenko noted that those who transfer are divided into two categories. The first category: they do not want their story to become media and want to return to Russia on the terms of exchange. But, apparently, they don't understand that upon their return they will be interrogated, possibly jailed. If not prison, then again sent to the front. And this is one hundred percent, especially if he has two whole arms and two legs. -And there are servicemen of the Russian Federation who were forcibly mobilized and who transferred to us under this program, surrendered as prisoners, and, for example, do not want to return. This is their right: until the end of hostilities or before the change of power in Russia. And Ukraine guarantees this,- the Coordinating Staff emphasized.

According to the investigation, a 19-year-old boy, previously convicted of purchasing narcotics, stole money from the mother of a missing serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The woman rented a house from the suspect. In July 2024, she asked for help in sorting out the bank account to which the state cash assistance for her missing son was supposed to go. The young man, taking advantage of the victim's trust, installed a mobile application on his phone to manage the account through Internet banking. In this way, he gained access to the card where the payment was received. Almost 20 facts of withdrawal of funds from the woman's card in the amount of almost 100 thousand hryvnias have been established. The suspect spent the received money on his own needs. Under the procedural leadership of the Chudniv District Prosecutor's Office of the Zhytomyr region, a local resident was notified of suspicion based on the facts of theft, legalization of property obtained through crime, as well as unauthorized interference in the operation of information systems (Part 4 of Article 185, Part 1 of Article 209, Part 1 Article 361 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine).

The Armed Forces spoke about the enemy's use of fiber-optic drones in the Toretsk direction	The press officer of the 28th Yevhen Alkhimov of the separate mechanized brigade named after the Knights of the Winter Campaign, commenting on the situation in this direction. According to him, the enemy continues to use the tactics of small attack groups, which include two to 20 people, but the biggest -headache- is currently created by drones controlled by fiber optic cable, because they cannot be silenced by means of radio electronic warfare. -This creates some problems because this drone can only be shot down with small arms. And also they constantly improve them and try to increase the range of work. The advantage of such drones is that it is essentially an anti-tank missile, but which can be stopped in the air, and can be changed at any time. And it is not affected by electronic devices. Therefore, this is a serious advantage,- emphasized Yevhen Alkhimov. He also added that the fiber optic coil itself is not so expensive, and thanks to it, the enemy drone is able to cover a distance of more than 10 kilometers. As reported by ArmyInform, as part of the programs for the implementation of innovations and development of the army, the Main Department of Defense Innovations of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine conducted presentation testing of domestic FPV drones controlled via fiber-optic cable, a number of which are in the final stage of codification and will soon be delivered to the needs of the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/03/u-zsu-rozpovily-pro-vykorystannya-vorogom-optovolokonnyh-droniv-na-toreczkomu-napryamku/	2025-01-03T00:29:51-08:00
Ukraine received requests from the Russians regarding 50,000 missing persons — Koordshtab	About this in an interview with ArmiyaInform said the head of the Secretariat of the Koordshtab Bohdan Okhrimenko. -We allocated a telephone line for this first, and then we realized that this is a separate project, and it is quite large-scale. Today, we can state that the number of missing persons for whom we have received inquiries is more than 50,000 Russians. And these are only those who are not afraid to contact us,- said Bohdan Okhrimenko. He added that recently, at a closed meeting in the State Duma, a Russian politician disclosed the figures of 48,000 missing Russians. And whoever was conducting that hearing said not to give that information to anyone else. -According to our calculations, the Russians have a total of more than 100,000 missing persons, and this does not include those who we already know have died. Many missing Russians are scattered in our fields, their remains are scattered by dogs. Their identification is not interesting for the Russian Federation,- Bohdan Okhrimenko explained. According to him, thanks to the -I want to find- project, it is now possible to show the world community in numbers how exactly the work in the Russian Federation with the citizens of their country is organized, that they are not interested in recognizing them as dead in order to pay the appropriate monetary support for their population. -It is profitable for them to consider the missing soldiers as missing. Commanders continue to receive financial support for them. The family receives nothing,- he added.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/03/ukrayina-otrymala-vid-rosiyan-zapyty-shhodo-50-tysyach-znyklyh-bezvisty-koordshtab/	2025-01-03T00:18:49-08:00

This is connected with logistical problems, it is also the result of Ukrainian strikes deep into the territory of the Russian Federation,- said Vadym Mysnyk. He added that the enemy has certain restrictions on the use of weapons. The troops of the Russian Federation use an aviation component, drop anti-aircraft missiles, but mostly use drones. Vadym Mysnyk also noted that the number of attempts by enemy sabotage and intelligence groups to penetrate into Ukraine has decreased.

The Defense Forces spoke about the tactics and the main task of the Russians in the Vremiv direction	The head of the communications department 48 told about this on the air of the telethon -Edyny News- Bohdan Petrenko of the separate artillery brigade. -Recently, the main task of the Russians remains to exercise control over logistics channels, attempts to cut off supplies for our forces, who are on the one hand in the Kurakhiv direction, this is the Kurakhiv highway, and on the other, who are in Velika Novosilka,- Bohdan Petrenko said. He emphasized that these attempts have been going on for quite a long period of time, and this shows that the Defense Forces are putting up serious resistance to the occupiers. -But the Russians do not stop trying, sometimes the Russian infantry simply steps over the remains of their predecessors. And they actually become predecessors for those who will follow them. That is, there is a rather strong fire influence from our side,- the spokesman added. Bohdan Petrenko said that one of the traditional tactics of the Russians is small tactical groups. The infantry enters the gray areas and tries to advance towards our positions. -But at all stages of their movement, the observation of them and the influence of fire on the destruction of the Russians takes place,- he concluded.

North Korea sends soldiers to fight against Ukraine to gain combat experience: notebook of a dead No...	This follows from another entry in the notebook of a North Korean special agent whom dictator Kim Jong Un sent along with thousands of others to fight against the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine, notified in the SSO. At the same time, the North Korean military is ordered to carry out tasks even at the cost of their own lives thousands of kilometers from home for the sake of the party and the interests of Kim Jong Un, which shows the real attitude of the dictator to his own troops. Meanwhile, the bloodthirsty dictator Kim himself continues to hide the fact of sending his troops to help Russia in the war against Ukraine. The following is a translation of an entry from the notebook of the military SSO of North Korea, Gyong Hong Jong, who was destroyed in Kurshchyna by the operators of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: -[triangle subsection] Task: At the same time, the most important of them (fronts) is the front of anti-imperialist and class struggle, and the most important task is combat readiness . I will emphasize once again that the most important, vital task for our armed forces is readiness in case of war. The slogan -All forces - to complete preparations for war!- - this is what the revolution demands, this is what the current circumstances demand, this is a battle slogan that should be raised high on the banner of our armed forces of all levels. Some of the information cannot be made public because it is sensitive and classified. -To be not a battalion that makes commitments only in words, but a battalion that knows how to act and fight immediately after receiving an order, to train universal battalions that can perfectly perform any task even at the cost of death - this is the goal, which every battalion in our armed forces must achieve, this is the spirit of this congress,- wrote Jong. We will remind you that in the first part Decrypted Notebook's author, Gyeong Hong Jong, wishes another soldier Song Ji Myung (or Yong) a happy birthday. In the second part, he reveals quite interesting methods of struggle with Ukrainian drones and artillery used by the North Korean military.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/03/kndr-vidpravlyaye-soldativ-voyuvaty-proty-ukrayiny-dlya-otrymannya-bojovogo-dosvidu-notatnyk-zagyblogo-pivnichnokorejczya/	2025-01-02T22:05:34-08:00

He said this in an interview , which was broadcast on the telethon -Edyni Novyni- in the evening of January 2. French President Emmanuel Macron took the initiative to place European peacekeepers on the territory of Ukraine. -But France alone is not enough. We would not like it to be one or two countries if it comes to this initiative. It should definitely be on its way to NATO. This does not mean that the deployment of European forces excludes a future in NATO,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. The President of Ukraine believes that Great Britain and some other countries can join the French initiative. He noted that he cannot name them, since there is still such an agreement. Volodymyr Zelensky also said that this initiative was discussed at his meeting with Emmanuel Macron and US President-elect Donald Trump. -I saw that Trump is positive about this idea. But I raised the issue that among these forces we have not yet heard which specific countries and whether the USA will be among them,- added the President of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/03/prezydent-pidtrymav-rozmishhennya-yevropejskyh-myrotvorcziv-ale-ne-zamist-chlenstva-ukrayiny-v-nato/	2025-01-02T21:53:45-08:00

How are our people being returned from captivity and how many Russians are in the -I want to live- p...	Specialists of the Coordinating Staff are engaged in the search for servicemen who were captured and civilians who were forcibly detained by the Russian occupation authorities. How does the Coordinating Staff return our citizens from captivity? How many Russians surrender and replenish the exchange fund? How many bodies of the missing occupiers lie in the Ukrainian fields? All these questions were answered by Bohdan Okhrimenko, head of the Secretariat of the Coordinating Staff on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. — How is the system for notifying relatives, in which a loved one will return from captivity, for example, built? How does this happen? — First, we verify citizens who wish to open a personal account in our Information System. Through the Ministry of Digitization portal -Diya- verification of the citizen and confirmation of kinship takes place. Because we comply with the law and act in the manner prescribed by law. This is primarily a law on the protection of personal data. Therefore, we can only share information with those who fall within the scope of the Personal Data Protection Act. A relative, drawing up a personal account, indicates who is in charge (to the prisoner. — Ed.), submits supporting documents. We verify and understand that we are communicating with a real relative. After negotiations, exchanges, we confirm that the Russian side really handed over the people it previously spoke about. We are taking everyone, but we have developed such a mechanism: we do not tell anyone about our relatives in advance, because there have been cases when Russia either did not bring a certain number of prisoners that it promised to return, or brought the wrong people that it promised to bring back. After the exchange and verification of the personnel of the returned servicemen and civilians, a command is given to our analysts and employees accompanying the Information System about SMS notifications. And relatives receive a notification in the -Action- application. If a citizen does not have the -Action- application, he receives a simple SMS notification to his phone. And within half an hour, employees of our counseling centers will call each family personally and provide the necessary information. — How is the work of conducting personal meetings with relatives? Especially in the regions, if a person is not able to come to Kyiv. — I would like to note that our media platforms are functioning: Telegram channel, YouTube page, Facebook page, site. All the necessary information can be found there. And our reception is done on an individual basis. Group meetings are available. This takes place in our reception rooms located in the city of Kyiv. There are regional offices -South-, -Center-, -West- and -East-, which cover the entire territory of Ukraine. -West- is the city of Lviv, and, accordingly, all the regions closest to Lviv. -Center- is Vinnytsia, -East- is Kharkiv, -South- is Mykolaiv. Our website has absolutely all contact information. Admission is by prior appointment. Why? Because the person must come, and the counselor must already know their story. A person can choose any convenient day and hour, come to any convenient counseling center. There is a road map, counselors help the family walk it together, provide clarification. There is information on sample applications for relatives to complete. The consultant will also help to transfer all the necessary information that is in the family to the personal account, especially if the person, for example, does not have the technical ability due to the lack of a smartphone. We record this data from relatives, add it to the card of a serviceman or a civilian and take it into account when forming a negotiating position carried out by our specialists. Analysts, who then process this information, give it the appropriate rank: for example, reliable or unreliable. Because there are cases when, for example, a mother and a wife voice completely different information. In any case, we record the information, and our experts, whenever possible, check it. After our citizens - both civilians and military - return from captivity, we spend some time with them: we clarify who they saw, in which places of detention they were, with whom they communicated, whether they saw this or that person. In this way, we are trying to search for the missing persons, because the Russian Federation does not, unfortunately, confirm to international organizations the fact that our people are being held captive for many of our citizens. After a certain time, the guys sometimes call our employees, with whom they communicated after the release, even at night. Well, suddenly they remembered something. Therefore, we can say that work continues around the clock. The information we receive is diverse. Our Information System allows you to do any analysis based on the number of prisoners, places of detention, religion, and place of birth. On a weekly basis, we receive information from the Armed Forces about missing persons and those who have been captured. But, unfortunately, we receive it only in this form: military rank, surname, first name, patronymic, position, military unit number, date of birth. All. And we need more to work with. Therefore, as we receive information about a serviceman, we create his card in the Information System. If relatives join the Information System through the site, they open a personal account, and this card is linked there. Unfortunately or fortunately, I state that not all the information contained in the card is available to his relatives. Because there can be both sensitive and unverified information, for example, about a death. But if there is no body, we continue until we either find and return the body, or until we return a living warrior. Unfortunately, there is also such a status that no one likes, it is -personal search-. The situation is that we do not have any information about this person. That is, there is a recorded fact according to the report of the commander of the military unit that the specified person is missing. And that's it, there is no more information about him. The situation with the missing persons is so dramatic that we understand the condition of the relatives of these people: both military and civilian. Unfortunately, there is still a -deceased- status. After the repatriation of the bodies or remains of our heroes, after conducting all laboratory tests and DNA tests, we establish the identity of the person. Because usually the Russian Federation gives us a certain number of bodies or remains without specifying surnames or anything: there is simply -neizvestny muschina-, -neizvestnaya zhenschina-. And then the difficult path of identification begins. As soon as we identify, it is synchronized with our database accordingly, and if this person had the status of -missing-, we display the information that the death is confirmed. Until this happens, all missing persons belong to the -search for person- category. I also have to say about the problem, which we have already reported several times to the Prosecutor General's Office and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. So, there is a principle of territorial jurisdiction. What is it? This is when a family lives in Khmelnytskyi region, files a missing person report in Donetsk region, and a criminal case is opened in Khmelnytskyi. The investigator communicates, takes DNA samples from the family, and then through the Office of the Attorney General, this criminal case is transferred to the place of the crime, that is, the place where the person disappeared. And so it turns out that in the Donetsk region, for example, in the city of Kramatorsk, one investigator can have a large number of criminal proceedings related to missing persons. And the issue of communication between investigators and families is complicated by the fact that there is a large amount of work for one person. But I hope that this problem will be solved in the near future. We at the Koordshtab have created the -single window- principle. We have representatives from the Main Investigative Department of the National Police of Ukraine, there are representatives of the SBU, types, branches of the military. That is, if communication with a military unit is required, then the consultant calls a representative, for example, TrO, if the serviceman served there. The TrO representative provides advice, contacts the military unit, clarifies this or that information, helps with writing an application for receiving a military serviceman's financial support for family support, because there is a corresponding regulatory approval. — Tell us a little about the special projects of the Coordinating Staff. What areas do they cover? — We launched the People of the Future project. It is aimed at social support of family members: mainly children, younger brothers, sisters of military personnel. Today, we have cured more than 2,500 children in different parts of the world. It was Bulgaria, Great Britain, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey. Currently, we also have many programs for 2025 within the country: in the Carpathians, in Prykarpattia, children's entertainment camps are planned for the summer. All information about it is available on our media resources. I would like to emphasize that all services provided to citizens are provided absolutely free of charge: legal, psychological or any other consultation and support. In fact, the state does not provide for us at all. Although we are an auxiliary temporary body under the Cabinet of Ministers. Organizational, informational, material and technical support of the activities of the Coordination Headquarters is entrusted, in accordance with the resolution, to the Main Directorate of Intelligence. Yes, when patrons find out about such initiatives of ours (children's recreation. — Ed.), they can also help. — The Coordinating Staff has other projects. Perhaps the most famous -I want to live- - ​​this project was created to encourage Russians who did not want to go to war, who did not want to commit war crimes, who did not want to kill - to surrender and save own life That is why it is called -I want to live-. It is very complex in its organization, its certain stages are hidden from public view. Many are involved in this process: the Central Intelligence Agency, the Security Service, the Armed Forces, the National Guard, etc. We provide the Russians with information on how they can surrender to captivity. We have organized chatbots in which they can contact and describe the situation, indicate which direction they are in. We simulate the process of them crossing the contact line without harming them. You have probably heard about such special operations, when, thanks to this project, they were transferred to our side even with weapons or even entire platoons. With tanks, with helicopters, with equipment. In total, if you take all of them together, probably even more than a battalion has already surrendered. Accordingly, we honor everyone who agreed to join our side for such a project. Those who transfer fall into two categories. The first category: they do not want their story to become media and want to return to Russia on the terms of exchange. But, apparently, they do not understand that upon their return they will be interrogated, possibly in prison. If not prison, then sending to the front again. And this is one hundred percent, especially if he has two whole arms and two legs. And there are military personnel of the Russian Federation who were forcibly mobilized and who transferred to us under this program, surrendered as prisoners, and, for example, do not want to return. This is their right: until the end of hostilities or before the change of power in Russia. And Ukraine guarantees this. There is also the -I want to find- project. We encountered the fact that relatives of missing Russian soldiers began contacting our phone line for the -I want to live- project: they wanted to find out the fate of a loved one. And we first allocated a telephone line for this, and then we realized that this is a separate project, and it is quite large. Today we can state that the number of missing persons for whom we have received requests is more than 50,000 Russians. And these are only those who are not afraid to contact us. Recently, at a closed meeting in the Derzhduma, a Russian politician disclosed the figures of 48,000 missing Russians. And whoever conducted that hearing said not to give that information to anyone else. By our count, the Russians have a total of over 100,000 missing, and that's not including those we already know have died. Many missing Russians are scattered across our fields, their remains are scattered by dogs. Their identification for the Russian Federation is uninteresting. Thanks to the -I want to find- project, it is now possible to show the world community in numbers how the work in the Russian Federation with the citizens of their country is organized, that they are not interested in recognizing them as dead in order to pay the appropriate monetary support for their population. It is profitable for them to consider the military missing as missing. Commanders continue to receive financial support for them. The family receives nothing. And the third project -I want to my own-. Many expressed certain fears about him, that, they say, he limits the rights of Ukrainian citizens in one way or another. But I will emphasize right away: this project was developed jointly with the Verkhovna Rada Commissioner for Human Rights. First of all, when forming the main approaches of this project, we consulted with the ombudsman, where we had to comply with both international and domestic norms. This project aims, firstly, to identify collaborators who cooperate with the enemy. These citizens are identified and brought to justice. And the question arises, what to do with them next? The state does not need such citizens, because they are traitors. We do not have the death penalty, we are a civilized country. If they so wanted the arrival of the -Russian peace-, we asked the question: yes, maybe you will go to Russia then? And we offered the Russian side: if you say that you will not abandon your own, then we will give you such citizens and hand them over. The second goal is to shut down these collaborators. We give the opportunity to go to, so to speak, a deal with the conscience. Stop this activity to avoid further damage. Therefore, law enforcement agencies will be more lenient towards such citizens. Well, and the third point - if our other citizens who are responsible and see that someone is committing a crime, they can report it. Accordingly, all this information is sent to the Security Service, law enforcement agencies. That is, a person does not contact us directly at the Coordinating Headquarters, he goes to a law enforcement agency. Appropriate measures are taken there, collaborators are detained if everything is confirmed. Many citizens have already stopped cooperating with the enemy, giving information that they were targeted, forced to provide some intelligence or, for example, plant explosive devices. And people who understood the consequences of their illegal activities turned to this project and stopped cooperating with the enemy, received support from the Security Service, from law enforcement agencies. In this way, we identified employees of the FSB or special structures of our enemy. Among those convicted today, we already have a case of his transfer. He is the first one so far. We offered to the Russian side, and there they agreed to take the said person. We handed it over. Instead, the Russian side released our civilian. It is already on the territory of our state. He is provided with appropriate medical care and rehabilitation. — Digitalization of many processes is actively underway in Ukraine. What has been done in this regard at the Coordination Headquarters? To what extent have you gone -digital- and does it really facilitate work processes? — In May 2022, after certain successful special operations of the Main Directorate of Intelligence, the higher military-political leadership of the state decided to transfer the chairmanship of the Coordination Staff from the Vice Prime Minister minister, at that time Iryna Vereshchuk, to the head of the Ministry of Education and Culture of Ukraine Kyryl Budanov The first thing we wanted to do was to establish communication with the families. And the first records were kept in Excel tables. We realized that without some quality software, without some digitalization of this process, we will not be able to process or use the received materials. Therefore, Kyrylo Budanov set the task of creating a digital product that would have the ability to keep records, do analytics, compare information, save videos, photos. According to the contract concluded by the Main Directorate of Intelligence, the IT company developed an Information System for us. And then, due to the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers, it was recognized as state. It is filled with various resources, such as: the register of the National Information Bureau, the register of persons missing under special circumstances, the registers of the Ministry of Justice, the records of the Joint Center under the SBU and many others. A separate issue is the accounting of enemy prisoners of war held by Ukraine. The camps are open today, in accordance with the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law.

Weapons of Victory: what is known about the updated variant of the Oncilla armored car	Currently, the fleet of specialized special vehicles of the Defense Forces of Ukraine includes armored vehicles of both foreign and domestic production. The history of the creation of one of them - the Dozor BBM family was discussed in the first part of our conversation with a researcher of military equipment and armaments, Doctor of Historical Sciences, Professor of the Department of Humanities of the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny Andriy Kharuk. Today is the continuation of the interview. — Professor, our agency notifiedo that recently the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine codified and allowed an updated version of the Oncilla armored personnel carrier is in service. And how was this machine created? - In 2013, a modernized version of -Dozor-B- was produced in Kharkiv, which attracted the interest of the Polish company Mista. The latter bought one copy manufactured at the Kyiv Armored Plant, which was displayed under the name Oncilla at the MSPO-2013 exhibition in Kielce. For production in Poland, Oncilla was significantly redesigned. The German engine was replaced with an Italian Iveco NEF 4 with a capacity of 210 hp. Unlike the -tractor- low-revving Deutz engine, the Italian engine is a high-revving car engine. Thanks to this, the dynamic characteristics of the car, in particular, acceleration, improved. In addition, Iveco NEF 4 turned out to be cheaper than the German engine. The transmission was radically redesigned, and instead of a five-speed automatic transmission, a six-speed one was installed. Ballistic protection corresponds to level 3 of STANAG 4569 (circular protection against armor-piercing bullets of caliber 7.62 mm and fragments of shells of caliber 152-155 mm when detonated at a distance of up to 60 m). Mine protection corresponds to level 2. Theoretically, level 3 could also be provided, but this was rejected, because the weight of the car would then increase too much. — What other design features did Polish gunsmiths add? — The Oncilla armored car is equipped with a Polish FONET radio station. Armament consists of a 12.7-mm NSVT-12.7 machine gun on a manually operated turret. The machine gunner is protected by armored shields with mounted armored windows - as on the HMMWV. As a result of the modernization, Oncilla acquired better operational properties compared to the basic Dozor-B. However, the armored car did not achieve significant commercial success. Six copies were sold to Senegal in 2016 or early 2017. In addition, Oncilla was also supplied to Ukraine. I would like to add that with the beginning of the large-scale invasion of Russia on February 24, 2022, Dozor-B and Oncilla armored vehicles as part of units of the Airborne Assault Troops are participating in battles against the invaders. In particular, in the second half of May 2022, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine announced the successful operation of Oncilla armored vehicles by the Ukrainian military. However, no details were reported. In March 2023, information appeared about the transfer to the units of the Main Intelligence Directorate of a new batch of Oncilla armored vehicles, purchased by Polish entrepreneurs. Further refinement of the Oncilla design is carried out by the Ukrainian Design Bureau -Beryl- together with the Polish company Mista. At the Egypt Defense Expo in 2022, the Oncilla Mk 2 project was presented in various variants, including one armed with a 90 mm cannon. - What can you say about the updated Oncilla armored personnel carrier? - The Ministry of Defense has put into service a new variant - Oncilla-Shturm. The armored car received a new remote-controlled module with a large-caliber machine gun, as well as, in my opinion, a rather strangely located 7.62 mm machine gun. I believe that the decision to supplement the BBM with a second machine gun looks quite logical. - Well, let's return to the -Dozor- family again. - In the Armed Forces of Ukraine, -Dozor-B- is classified as a tactical wheeled combat vehicle (TBCM), since it does not fall under the classic definition of an armored personnel carrier. Prototypes of the armored car were manufactured in the research workshop of the KhKBM. In July 2013, one of them was transferred to the Military Academy in Odessa. This institution, among other specialties, also trains military motorists, so it was considered the best place for operational tests of Dozor-B. However, -Dozor-B- really interested the military only after the Russian annexation of Crimea and the beginning of aggression in Donbass in 2014. At that time, the Ukrainian army did not have modern light armored vehicles, with the exception of the outdated BRDM-2. The need for machines of this class during the Anti-terrorist operation was felt extremely acutely. The head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs announced the possibility of purchasing -Dozoriv-B- for the National Guard of Ukraine, and a little later the Acting President of Ukraine Oleksandr Turchynov announced his intention to purchase 200 such armored vehicles. However, for this, the issue of mass production had to be resolved. — And how was it implemented? — They decided to establish the production of -Dozoriv-B- at the State Enterprise -Lviv Armored Plant- (LBTZ). In September 2014, the production of armored car bodies began here, but there were problems with the supply of engines - the German side did not give permission for a long time. However, even after the engines arrived, assembly of armored vehicles slowed down. Due to the inability to solve the problem, in June 2015, the director of LBTZ was fired, and after that the case moved from a deadlock. The first Dozor-B from the ordered batch of 10 units were ready in August 2015. On December 5, 2015, on the eve of the Day of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, five serial -Dozorov-B- were presented in Kyiv. - And what were the first assessments of these machines from the operators? - In August-November 2015, -Dozor-B- underwent state tests, during which a number of shortcomings were revealed: insufficient specific power (due to the increase in total mass machines from the calculated 7150 to the actual 8560 kg), problems with driving and using the regular weapons, malfunctions of the brake system, fire protection system, wheel gearboxes, poor ergonomics, etc. It was possible to eliminate some of the shortcomings, and on July 20, 2016, the installation batch of ten -Dozor-B- TBCM was handed over to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Due to the poor quality, the question of transferring -Dozorov-B- not to the line units, but to the training centers in Odesa and Lviv was raised. However, in the end, all ten armored vehicles were transferred to the 95th separate amphibious assault brigade (Zhytomyr). - That is, the first -pancake- in the form of serial BBMs turned out to be lousy&#8230; - Plans to manufacture 50 serial -Dozor-B- in 2015 and another 100 in 2016 went into oblivion. But the Armed Forces and the Ukroboronprom State Company did not lose hope of bringing the armored car to mass production. Since LBTZ was unable to solve this task, they tried to establish production at another enterprise of Ukroboronprom, the Kyiv Armored Plant. In August 2016, the first instance of -Dozor-B- (with the -Viy- module) manufactured at this enterprise was demonstrated. However, the case did not go further. - So the -surveillance- story could end on this minor note? - In order to bring -Dozor-B- to a condition suitable for use in combat units, we decided to turn to foreign partners. On December 17, 2015, Ukroboronprom signed a memorandum of cooperation with the Czech state company VOP CZ s.p., within the framework of which it was planned to bring Dozor-B to NATO standards and certify the armored vehicle in European countries. But nothing was reported about any practical results of this agreement. Instead, the Polish clone attracted the attention of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. In July 2017, there were reports of the start of testing of the Oncilla armored car in Ukraine. They were successful, and the state defense order for 2020 included the purchase of 24 armored vehicles of this type (according to some reports, funds for the purchase of Oncilla armored vehicles were also included in the budgets of the Ministry of Defense in 2018 and 2019). — That is, history brings us back to Oncilla&#8230; — The first two Oncilla armored vehicles were handed over to the Armed Forces of Ukraine on August 23, 2020. In the future, such machines consisted of units of Polish production at the enterprise of the Scientific and Production Company -VK Sistema- in the city of Vasylkiv. On May 12, 2021, the last batch of nine copies was transferred. As well as -Dozor-B-, Oncilla are supplied to the Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to the Military Balance guide, as of the beginning of 2022, units of the Airborne Assault Forces had 10 Dozor-B armored vehicles and more than 27 Oncillas. - And in general, how did our military evaluate the -Dozors- after their use in combat conditions? - Isn't the first evidence of the use of -Dozor-B- in the area of ​​the Anti-Terrorist Operation dated to December 2016. Then, one armored car of this type was spotted in a convoy escorting the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Oleksandr Turchynov, who arrived with an inspection to the front during the escalation of fighting on the Svitlodar arc. In January 2017, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported the first results of the vehicle's use: -Dozor-B- has proven itself as a reliable combat vehicle, and in general, the armored vehicle meets the requirements of the Ukrainian army. The ministry noted that the car has -childhood- diseases. And in November 2017, the magazine -Army of Ukraine- published an article about the experience of using machines in the area of ​​the Anti-Terrorist Operation. Among the advantages were named high cross-country ability, good armor protection, and a large power reserve. The operation of -Dozor-B- in combat conditions also showed a slight imperfection of the turret installation and the inconvenience that this causes for the shooter. There were also complaints about loud noise in the undercarriage. In addition, the braking system also turned out to be imperfect. As of September 2018, the experimental operation of -Dozor-B- was completed. These cars averaged 15,000 to 20,000 miles. km In July 2020 TBKM -Dozor-B- was officially adopted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. —The defects you indicated, recorded in the first periods of operation, could only be corrected through further modernization work. What did they consist of? — Engineers took measures to eliminate the identified shortcomings, as well as to expand the combat capabilities of the armored car. In particular, in 2020, information appeared about the research and development work of -Tournir-, which provided for increasing the capabilities of -Dozor-B- to overcome water obstacles. And even earlier, in January 2016, a full-scale model of the Hort armored car was demonstrated - a further development of Dozor-B with a wheelbase increased by 300 mm (up to 3400 mm).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/03/zbroya-peremogy-shho-vidomo-pro-onovlenyj-variant-broneavtomobilya-oncilla/	2025-01-02T20:51:54-08:00
-Fatal mala-: Taurian paratroopers showed how to destroy the enemy with the L119 gun. ArmyInform rep...	The latter is very important, since the guns need to stay close to the line of battle. ArmiyaInform correspondents visited the position of one of the calculations and saw combat work. In order to get to the gunners' positions, we left during the night, in the morning at a designated point we met with the escort - cheerful and nimble paratroopers - and rushed off-road, under the cover of EWs, to the positions. They had to make it before dawn. The fighters were happy about the fog and mist, because they were supposed to interfere with enemy drones. But they are still being watched. So we hide the car under nuts and run to the cellar. In order to survive, it is better to stay underground here. We go downstairs and get ready at the threshold, because ahead is not dampness, the smell of mice and darkness, but the bright lights of New Year's garlands and the pleasant aroma of air freshener. And the cheerful smiles of calculation are inspiring. The boys offer tea or coffee. Many joke, they say that it is difficult to survive without humor, especially if you work alongside the enemy all the time. -Nearby- is not a figure of speech - the enemy is already in the neighboring village. Shelling and assaults are constantly being conducted from there. The guys hold on bravely, they pile on the katsapam nicely in response. They are proud of their cannon and a well-coordinated unit. Four men of different ages and personalities, two from the East, two from the West, but it is felt that they understand each other not even with half a word, but with one look. Together, they are a powerful fist that beats the enemy well and not only. The guys are fighting on a British L119 gun that rolled off the assembly line in 1989. The caliber of 105 mm seems small, but the guys say that you should not underestimate this -small-. The firing range depends on the projectiles, there are different types. The ones that are used now fly to a distance of 11.4 km. And there are active-reactive projectiles that can be fired at a range of up to 19 kilometers. A fairly modest range of fire forces the guys to stay close to the line of battle. And here the L119 dimensions become a trump card. It is light, small and mobile, so it is easy to hide from enemy drones. And there is no flash of fire at the exit of the projectile from the barrel, only a small smoke. Because of this, it is difficult for the enemy observing our positions to calculate where our L119 is hiding. And she conducts her fire work, moreover, quite accurately. When you need to change the firing position, you don't need a truck or a tractor, just an ordinary Hummer, which easily pulls a two-ton howitzer. In general, the L119 was developed for air transport, in particular on the external suspension of helicopters. But in our war L119 do not fly. At least for now. Regarding the accuracy of the L119, the guys say that this spring they first hit an enemy tractor and then a tank. There were even cases of hitting moving targets — quad bikes and motorcycles of the Russians. Accuracy is very dependent on ammunition. On new high-quality shells, the L119 works like a sniper rifle. But when they bring -boars- from 1945-55, then it is difficult to work accurately. But the guys say that they don't learn about every hit they make. Only the enemy, whom L119 really bothers, knows about something. The gunner, who now acts as the commander, is a fighter with the call sign -Lithuania-. He is 35 years old and comes from the Rivne region. I was very worried when I found out that they were taking the VAT. But when I got to the brigade, I quickly got used to it, and it became much easier. — I am such a person that I will worry before something, but after I get into the team, I quickly get used to it - and already the mood is completely different. Or maybe it's because of confidence in siblings, or maybe it's self-confidence that appears. And this plays an important role if you have reliable brothers and sisters near you, you know them, you know that they can cover your back, and you theirs. This confidence is very influential. -Lithuania- is very calm, smiles gently and shyly. Considers each answer. When asked about civilian life, he says that he never intended to be a soldier. Before the full-scale war, he went to Poland to earn money, then worked in a private company. But the war forced him to master a new profession, first as a rifleman in a training center, then as a gunner. — I was already learning to work with a gun in a brigade. They just entered the calculation. They learned quickly, not just quickly, but very quickly. As it turned out, it is not so difficult to learn it, the main thing is to have the desire to do your job well. A few weeks to study TTX, features of weapons, and most importantly — practice during combat work. -Lithuania- says that they like the service, the team is like a family. But there are also difficult moments. - They don't like to roll over. Rollover is when you need to change the firing position. Even if the front line doesn't change, we have to move so we don't get tracked. This is the third time in the last month. And every downfall is a great gloom. First, it is necessary to arrange a position for the gun, to disguise it. Secondly, you need to arrange a home for yourself. Mostly, these are basements. And they, to put it mildly, are not very adapted for life. Look, it was an ordinary cellar, a cellar where vegetables were stored. It was full of mice. — But now they have arranged everything in such a way that it looks like a good place to live. We try to quickly bring everything to order, to the minimum comfort and convenience. They even hung a garland, somehow it became pleasant and cozy. You see, war, especially in a combat unit that is constantly on the front line of defense, is very hard both morally and physically. Therefore, we try to support each other, to create human conditions. As a commander, I simply say to the boys: -The boys are gathered, everything will be fine.- And we joke a lot, because jokes are a very important thing, they encourage and support fighting spirit. Mother and brother are waiting for -Lithuania- at home. - I am single, not married yet. -Sometimes it's difficult, but you pull yourself together with the thought that you need to go to the end so as not to lose the country,- says the soldier. The chief sergeant of the platoon, call sign -Kros-, is from Mykolaiv, he is 44 years old. Greets us, constantly jokes. — At one time, I served in the border troops. In civilian life, he worked in Mykolaiv port, had armor. When the invasion began, I went to the Military Commissariat, I thought they would be taken to the border guards, but my unit had already left, so they were taken to the State Security Service. Ten days of -training-, which took place very intensively: shooting and training every day. It gave me good survival skills. When I got to DSHV, there was a feeling of some kind of intrigue, something new every day. Especially since I got into combat almost immediately. What I saw only on TV, then I saw in reality: terrible arrivals, broken equipment. Then we go to the villages, and you get goosebumps when you see what happened in the territories where the enemy was. People run out to meet, pray, cry that they are finally freed. And I also had the opportunity to meet military guys who understood military affairs, kept up with them, learned from them. - And how did they get to the cannon? - But how! They gave a tablet, showed how it works, practiced, if they see, a person succeeds, a person goes to the gun. Accordingly, so with everyone, let's see who can do what better. The initiative must come from the person himself, there is a big difference — when a man has a desire to do something or when he does not. — And what do you not like about your job? — But I like everything, except for rolling. And you have to do everything quickly, very quickly. Because it's still a -cannon-, it's not a mortar for you. The equipment must arrive here, it must be prepared. And FPV, constant shelling, we still need to organize the work of EW. And the KABs are flying in, because we are priority targets for the enemy. - Does it get scary? - Of course! But the fear passes very quickly, because you think that you have to do the work. You see, the body is already so hardened that it can not sleep or eat for 2-3 days, in such a mode, it adapts itself, the instinct of self-preservation is activated. Everyone can be afraid, but fear should not cloud the mind. So I talked to the -evader-. I say, it's your turn, we're tired, we need to be replaced. And he says: I'm afraid. And I tell him that if the Muscovites come, they will not ask you whether you are afraid or not, but will send you to the penalty box, they will drive you into an attack at gunpoint. Do you want it to be? What are you waiting for? That's how I explain to them. My wife and son are waiting for me at home. Friends worry and help. This is very supportive, because I know who I am fighting for, it gives me the strength to hold on to victory, because there is no other way out. We have one country, we defend it. It's time for us to go. Thank you guys for your hospitality, we wish you less crashes and more new shells. We run to the car, we drive away at speed. The tension subsides only after a while. You understand how difficult it is for the boys there, at the front, under the constant threat of attacks. But our artillery works and helps the infantry to hold the front&#8230;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/03/fatalna-mala-tavrijski-desantnyky-pokazaly-yak-nyshhat-voroga-z-garmaty-l119-reportazh-armiyainform-z-pozycziyi/	2025-01-02T20:25:00-08:00
Fakes of the Russian Federation about -Azov-: from myths to heroes	After the creation of -Azov- in 2014, it immediately became a bone in the throat of the Russian authorities. His military achievements, patriotism and motivation did not fit into the narrative about a weak Ukraine, which is allegedly -under the control of the West.- In response, the Kremlin began to fabricate myths about Azov: first about its members, and then about their ideology. In 2015, the Russian media began to mass-distribute stories about -neo-Nazis-, basing it on symbols and isolated statements of individual representatives of the unit. In the West, these myths found a response among certain groups that did not understand the real situation in Ukraine. The discrediting of -Azov- has become a separate front of the information war. In 2022, during the heroic defense of Mariupol, the Russian mass media repeatedly tried to convince the world that the Azov people allegedly -hid behind civilians.- Instead, the world saw something else: the fortitude, humanity, and indomitability of the fighters who defended the Azovstal plant to the last. These attacks reached a special peak after the mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners in Olenivka. Russian propaganda tried to justify this act of terror, claiming that it was -the work of the Ukrainians themselves.- Recently, the occupiers again tried to play their favorite card. The first thing they invented was an absurd fake about the alleged -recruiting campaign- of -Azov- in France. Interestingly, even the details in this fake show haste and lack of logic: the contact details on the fake website do not lead to France, but to Germany. But do they need logic? They need a sensation so that at least someone believes in this fairy tale. The second maneuver is a classic of the genre: -&#8221;Azov&#8221; is hiding behind the backs of the civilian population.- This is their old trick that has long since become a pattern. This time they were -hiding- in the shopping center of Kharkiv, where one of the battalions of the brigade supposedly had a military base. But in this way, by launching rocket attacks on shopping centers, as a result of which there are numerous victims among the civilian population, Russia is once again trying to cover up its war crimes with the same rhetoric: -there was a base of neo-Nazis, that's all.- Every time we hear these accusations, we see one thing: it's not Azov hiding, it's them being afraid. They are afraid to admit that behind every freed meter of our land is not propaganda, but the real courage of Ukrainian soldiers. These fakes are like paper castles: loud, bright, but washed away by the first rain of truth. Russian propaganda fights with words, because it cannot cope with reality. But the truth is that the Azov regiment remains steadfast. And this is a fact that they will never be able to rewrite. -Azov- is not just a subdivision. It is a symbol. A symbol of indomitability, strength and devotion to the fight for freedom. And it is symbols that are always the targets of tyranny. Russian authorities are not afraid of weapons in the hands of Ukrainian defenders as much as they are afraid of their inspiring idea. Despite all the Kremlin's attempts to denigrate Azov, the world is gradually beginning to see the truth. From international investigations to recognition of the unit as part of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the truth breaks through the veil of disinformation. This is not just a story about information warfare. This is a lesson for all of us: even the biggest lie cannot destroy someone who fights for truth and freedom.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/03/fejky-rf-pro-azov-vid-mifiv-do-geroyiv/	2025-01-02T20:10:23-08:00
The General Staff of the Armed Forces named the three directions in which the enemy attacks the most	Operational information as of 22:00 January 2 was published by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Since the beginning of this day, 118 combat clashes have taken place. The Russian invaders launched two missile and 38 air strikes, using two missiles and 65 anti-aircraft missiles. In addition, the Russians used 691 kamikaze drones to attack and fired about three thousand shots at the positions of our troops and populated areas. In the Kharkiv direction, our troops repelled two enemy attacks in the Vovchansk area. Today, in this direction, Ukrainian defenders neutralized 37 occupiers, destroyed 32 unmanned aerial vehicles, a storage place for ammunition and a means of communication, and also damaged an artillery system and three units of automobile equipment. In the Kupyansk direction, the enemy stormed the positions of our defenders three times in the Zapadny, Dvorichna, and Kruglyakivka districts. Ukrainian defenders have repelled one attack, two more are currently ongoing. In the Lyman direction, Russian invaders attacked Ukrainian positions 16 times during the day in the vicinity of Nadia, Makiivka, Terni, Hryhorivka and in the Serebryan Forest. There are currently four battles. In the Siversky direction, during the day, the enemy made one attempt to attack the positions of our units in the area of ​​Bilogorivka. There was no success. In the Kramatorsk direction, six combat clashes have been recorded near Chasovoy Yar and Stupochky, four attacks were successfully repelled by our defenders, and two combat clashes are ongoing. In the Toretsk direction, the Russians attacked the positions of the defense forces eight times. The occupiers concentrated their main offensive efforts near the settlements of Toretsk, New York and Shcherbynivka. Currently, two military clashes continue. Since the beginning of this day, in the Pokrovsky direction, the invading units have tried 27 times to break through our defenses near the settlements of Myrolyubivka, Lysivka, Novy Trud, Pishchane, Shevchenko, Uspenivka, Solone, and Novovasylivka. So far, one battle is ongoing. The enemy is suffering significant losses - today in this direction Ukrainian soldiers neutralized 259 occupiers, 113 of them - irreversibly. An armored personnel carrier, two cars, an UAV control antenna, a satellite communication device and a motorcycle were also destroyed, and two enemy vehicles were also damaged. In the Kurakhiv direction, the enemy is also active — he attacked our positions near the settlements of Slovianka, Petropavlivka, Shevchenko, Dachne and Kurakhove 22 times, five battles are ongoing. In the Vremivsk direction, the invaders carried out 20 offensive actions near Yantarny, Vremivka, Velika Novosilka and in the direction of Konstantinopol, Rozlyv and Novosilka. Six clashes are still ongoing. In the Orihiv direction, our troops repelled two enemy attacks near Novoandriivka. In the Dnieper direction, the enemy attacked the positions of our troops twice to no avail. In the Kursk region, Ukrainian defenders repelled seven enemy attacks, two clashes are still ongoing. In other areas, the situation has not undergone significant changes. Today, it is worth celebrating the soldiers of the 108th Territorial Defense Brigade and the 406th Artillery Brigade named after Colonel-General Oleksiy Almazov, who steadfastly restrained the onslaught of overwhelming enemy forces on the eastern front. As reported by ArmyInform, the Defense Forces of Ukraine strike on the command post of the Russian army in Kurshchyna. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/02/genshtab-zsu-nazvav-try-napryamky-na-yakyh-vorog-atakuye-najbilshe/	2025-01-02T12:11:49-08:00

Alien vs. Predator — in Kurshchyna, the Russians tried to hit Bradley with a KAB	About this on the ArmyTV stream on January 2 the commander of the 47th mechanized brigade company with the call sign -Aeneas- told. -KAB strikes are happening around the clock. Many KAB parishes, especially in the rear units. There was a case when our Bradley infantry fighting vehicle was returning from a combat mission, and in front of it, somewhere a hundred meters away, a KAB flew. The enemy uses them en masse. -Bradley went around the ravine from under the KABU and drove on,- Eneis said. According to him, the Russians are also actively using drones. -These are both ordinary drones and fiber-optic drones. The enemy uses them en masse, because he has a huge number. Enemy drones constantly fly over our positions. Those that are on the fiber optic are mostly used against our equipment and on our logistics routes,- said -Enea-. According to him, the Russians are constantly attacking, but the intensity of these attacks decreases after our strikes on headquarters and communication centers. As reported by ArmyInform, the fighters of the 47th mechanized brigade -Magura- conducted a heavy operation with rescue of a wounded soldier.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/02/chuzhyj-proty-hyzhaka-na-kurshhyni-rosiyany-namagalysya-urazyty-bradley-kabom/	2025-01-02T10:51:31-08:00

Five myths about sniping - the fighter -Roxy- tells how snipers fight now	The conversation with the soldier was published on January 2 on the brigade's channel. In particular, -Roxy- refuted several myths about snipers. Myth No. 1: A sniper must have 100% vision. Vision does not matter here at all. This is just a Soviet stereotype, because the PSO (sniper optical sight), which was developed in 1963 specifically for the Dragunov rifle, did not have a diopter. All modern optics have it - adjust it as you need. Myth #2: The main thing for a sniper is to shoot accurately. You need to be able to navigate the terrain, camouflage yourself, understand the essence of ballistics, read the wind, and observe at all levels of the distance. Pulling the trigger is the easiest, the tip of the iceberg. Myth #3. A sniper must freeze for hours. It is impossible to lie down and look into the optics for 8 hours, because after 40 minutes the eye will -swim-. But we can look at the tablet as much as we need. You have a long-range surveillance system, a thermal imaging camera, and there are rifles nearby. Something has moved - you go out and work. Myth #4. Snipers are lonely Another stereotype of the cinema. A pair works - the first and second numbers. But they will not leave without the escort of shooters, machine gunners, those who will mine, cover, observe. Now snipers must have a drone for reconnaissance. Myth #5. Equipment and weapons are incredibly expensive. It's true, but every member of our newly created team will receive everything for free, including state-of-the-art rifles and training in a special training center. You don't need to buy anything. On the page of the brigade, everyone is invited to join the sniper platoon.

He added that the results of this work are already visible, the enemy has somewhat reduced the intensity of its attacks. -We observe less use of armored vehicles.

A few minutes ago, our scouts reported that 20 occupiers were eliminated today only in our defense zone,- the spokesman said. At the same time, according to Orest Drymalovskyi, the enemy is constantly raising reserves, throwing in new units, often these are fresh contract workers, former civilians who sign contracts for money. -And after two weeks of training, they are thrown into advanced positions. And the occupiers have almost no chance to survive in this circle of death. The occupiers' losses in equipment are so great that they are unable to use it in the same quantity as it was in October or November,- concluded the representative of the 79th ODSHBr.

MOU: Thanks to competitive bidding, more than UAH 2 million was saved on the purchase of lubricants ...	About this notified in the MOU. Savings of 14.3% of the announced cost became possible thanks to an effective procurement strategy, early announcement of tender procedures and active participation of suppliers. The first announced purchases included: The total cost of purchases amounted to UAH 13.52 million instead of the planned UAH 15.78 million. The average number of participants in DOT procurement was 4.17. This is higher than the average market indicators (2.6 participants) in the field of public procurement of the lubricants market. -The results of the work of the DOT show that thanks to transparent and effective procedures, we can not only meet the needs of the Armed Forces, but also achieve significant savings of public funds. More than four participants in the tender is not just a statistic, but an indicator of business confidence in the Ministry of Defense,- said Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. Involvement of a wide range of participants at each stage of procurement allows DOT to ensure the best ratio of price and product quality. This approach is particularly important for providing the Armed Forces of Ukraine with critically needed resources, in particular lubricants for various types of equipment. DOT continues to actively attract companies to participate in public procurement. For this, a series of educational materials -Tangent.

He added that it was a serious logistical branch for the Russians, as the ferries could carry up to 25 fuel tanks and wagons. -After that, they only had car ferries, which they also use for military purposes. Therefore, in fact, Russian naval logistics by sea have been interrupted thanks to the efforts of the Defense Forces of Ukraine,- explained the spokesman of the Armed Forces of the Russian Armed Forces. Dmytro Pletenchuk added that the occupiers will continue to use the so-called Crimean Bridge, as it is the only stable connection with the Russian mainland. -They cannot use the railway there in full due to the damage to the bridge.

No money: Russia sells uranium business in Kazakhstan to China	About this reports Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The share of -Kazatomprom- (Kazakhstan) in JSC -JSC -Zarechnoye- has not changed and is 49.979%. In addition, -Uranium One Group- JSC plans to sell 30% of the shares of the Kazakh companies -JV -Khorasan-U- and -Kyzylkum- to the benefit of -China Uranium Development Company Limited-. -Kazatomprom- will keep its shares in these enterprises at the level of 50%. One of the reasons for Russia's decision was the negative impact of sanctions due to the war against Ukraine and reduced profits. Moscow's decision to sell its share of uranium deposits in Kazakhstan to China is a consequence of the impact of Western economic sanctions and limited resources for further investment in the development of these projects. Such a decision strengthens the influence of the PRC in the Central Asian region and changes regional politics in the energy sector: Beijing's control over uranium supplies is a strategic loss for Russia in the future.

Training of F-16 pilots, digitalization of VLK and -Package of the wounded-: interview of Serhiy Mel...	In his busy schedule, he found time to talk with ArmyInform correspondents. What did Serhiy Melnyk remember about the defense of Kharkiv in 2022, in which he took a direct part? What radical changes have taken place in the army? How many Ukrainians visited recruiting centers last year? Read the answers to these and other questions in our interview. —You took a direct part in the defense of Kharkiv. What made it possible to defend a regional center important for the country at the beginning of a large-scale invasion? - Kharkiv survived thanks to the incredible courage, determination and self-sacrifice of our military, volunteers and ordinary residents of the city. From the first hours of the large-scale invasion, everyone was united around one goal: to stop the enemy. Residents of Kharkiv massively joined the defense: they helped at checkpoints, provided the military with food and necessary things, and worked under constant fire. The clear organization of the city's defense system also played an important role. The enemy advanced from all directions, carried out massive attacks on key infrastructure facilities, tried to destroy the air defense system and the command posts of our units. We operationally divided the city into seven defense sectors, and each sector had clear tasks and coordinates for defense. The first morning of the war was indicative. At 9:30 a.m. on February 24, enemy tanks had already appeared on the outskirts of Kharkiv, but at 9:43 a.m. they were destroyed by our forces. The enemy suffered heavy losses and was unable to advance further. Over the next few days, Russian sabotage and intelligence groups tried to enter the city in stolen civilian cars. They were in ordinary clothes and attempted to establish themselves in residential quarters before the approach of the main forces. However, this plan failed. Our mobile fire teams effectively identified and destroyed saboteurs. In the first five days alone, there were dozens of combat clashes between our units and Russian forces. Each fighter, each officer and each volunteer understood that not only the fate of the city, but also the future of the entire country depended on his actions. It was thanks to this unity, determination and effective organization of defense that Kharkiv held out and did not allow the enemy to achieve their goals. — Many military observers spoke about the moral superiority of our soldiers at the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. And what other advantages did our army have in February and March 2022 - technological, tactical, etc.? - The main advantage of our forces was that we fought on our soil. This is not just a territory - it is our home, every corner of which is familiar to the smallest detail. Our military protected every patch of land, every street, every house. And in each of these houses, the enemy could be met not only by a military man, but also by a civilian, ready to resist. The second important factor was non-standard, bold and proactive decisions of Ukrainian commanders. They acted in advance, used maneuverable tactics, struck at the enemy's vulnerable points, not allowing him to gain a foothold in important positions. Another advantage is the high level of cohesion of Ukrainian society. In the first weeks of the war, the country united in a way that rarely happens in history. This was felt by the military on the front lines, it gave them the strength to stand to the last. Every Ukrainian, regardless of their status, played an important role in the common cause. Special mention should be made of volunteer assistance, which came almost from the first days of the war. Volunteers provided the military with medicines, necessary equipment, means of communication, transport and equipment. International aid also began to flow in very quickly, and this became an important factor in strengthening our defense capabilities. The combination of these factors—motivation, flexible tactical decisions, public support, the volunteer movement, and international assistance—became the basis of our resilience in the most difficult first months of the war. — Today there is an opinion that our Western partners are not helping our army enough or are doing it too slowly. But still, to what extent did the help of partners contribute to the fact that Ukraine is holding on, that our state did not fall under the blows of the aggressor? - International aid was and remains critically important for our struggle. Yes, we always want faster delivery and higher volumes. But without the support of our Western partners, especially in the form of modern weapons, air defense equipment, intelligence and technological equipment, holding the front line would be much more difficult. Western weapons saved tens, and possibly hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian lives. Modern anti-aircraft systems, artillery, armored vehicles, long-range missiles and drones allowed us to effectively oppose much larger enemy forces. But partner support isn't just a weapon. Financial stability, humanitarian aid for war victims, as well as political support in the international arena are important. The world continues to show that Ukraine is not alone in its struggle for freedom. Every tranche of financial aid, every package of military support, every diplomatic statement is an investment not only in Ukrainian victory, but also in global security. The entire democratic world understands that the success of Ukraine is the success of the entire civilized world. And we are grateful to each partner for this support, continuing to work on strengthening and accelerating it. —Ukraine has been holding out for the third year since the start of a large-scale invasion. But we cannot discard the war period before it. What can be recorded in the achievements of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during this period? - During this time, radical changes took place in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which fundamentally transformed the army. It was not only overcoming Soviet stereotypes, but also building the foundations of a modern army. An innovative, flexible personnel training system was introduced, personnel selection and recruitment processes were improved, a transparent system of career growth was created, as well as opportunities for self-realization of servicemen. It is important to emphasize that these changes are based on the experience of the world's leading armies and NATO standards. This brought the Armed Forces of Ukraine closer to achieving a high level of interoperability with the Alliance forces, which is an important factor in joint operations and strategic partnership. Experience gained in the years before a large-scale invasion became decisive in February 2022. The Ukrainian army already had battle-hardened commanders, trained fighters and experience of effective defense, which made it possible to stop numerous attacks by superior enemy forces. In addition, these years helped to mobilize defense resources and organize an effective resistance to the army, which had a significant numerical advantage. The first months of the war became a vivid example of how hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians — military and civilian — were able to unite for a common goal. It was not only a military, but also a spiritual and national union. It was at these moments that Ukrainians realized their identity, national uniqueness and the right to be masters of their land. This unity has been the foundation of resilience and continues to inspire us to fight on. - Moving to a new position in your case is not only about scaling, but also about a significant transformation of the scope of authority and responsibilities. Are there any successful practices or developments that were useful and effective in your previous places of service and you plan to implement them in your new position? - My competence in the Ministry of Defense includes strategically important areas: military education and science, rights protection military personnel, recruiting, training, physical education, humanitarian support and social support. In fact, it is almost every aspect related to the support and provision of our military. The experience of organizing the defense of Kharkiv gave me an understanding of how the Defense Forces should work effectively in critical conditions. This experience allows me to better see the real needs of the military and to orient the ministry's work to solving specific tasks. One of the key principles that I have always emphasized and continue to implement at the state level is quality training. Not only the success of individual operations depends on professional training, but also the effectiveness of the army as a whole. A systematic approach to training, modern training methods and an individual approach to each serviceman are what we are actively developing. It is important that military personnel, veterans and new recruits feel the constant support of the state, both during and after their service. Among the specific examples of such support is the-Wounded Package-, which will begin to be issued to military personnel already next year. We are also working on the development of adaptive clothing for wounded servicemen and specialized clothing for military womenthat will provide comfort and functionality. Another important direction is the improvement of the food system and the introduction of additional financial incentives for the military, which will increase motivation and improve service conditions. These initiatives are only part of the systemic changes we plan to implement. They are designed not only to support our military today, but also to create the basis for their protection, development and a secure future. —During communication with many military personnel, we hear the following thesis: in the spring of 2022, we were constantly and a lot more creative and reported less. The initiative and the ability not to coordinate every step paid off then. But then the state began to demand that every step be coordinated. How to combine initiative and output with accountability and responsibility? - In the early days of a full-scale invasion, initiative, flexibility, and speed of decision-making were key factors in stopping the enemy advance. Then each commander, each unit acted as autonomously as possible, relying on their own experience and the situation on the ground. But warfare has changed—it now requires clear coordination, coordinated solutions, and integrated approaches. This does not mean that the initiative should be completely limited. On the contrary, the main challenge today is to find the right balance between freedom of action, accountability and accountability. It is important that commanders have the ability to quickly respond to challenges and make decisions, but at the same time be able to ensure transparency and accountability of their actions. To achieve this balance, we are actively implementing digitalization of processes and electronic document management. These tools not only reduce bureaucratic pressure, but also allow better control and optimization of processes. In particular, the -Reserve+- platform has already demonstrated its effectiveness. It greatly eased the administrative burden for both the military and civilians. Now updating data, extending deferrals for certain categories of citizens can be done directly in a mobile phone, without the need to visit territorial collection centers. The Army+ application is also constantly being improved. Now servicemen can submit reports for transfer, as well as order train tickets from the special reserve through a mobile application. In 2025, large-scale digitization of the process of military medical examination is planned. Both Reserve+ tools and general bases of the healthcare system will be applied here. This will not only reduce the burden on doctors, but also significantly simplify procedures for military personnel and citizens. The goal of these reforms is to create an effective, transparent and flexible management system, where initiative and responsibility do not conflict with each other, but work together for Ukraine's victory. —The recruiting process is gaining momentum in Ukraine. What interim results are already available today in this direction? What difficulties do we face? And can we announce the number of open recruiting centers? - We continue to improve the system of staffing the Armed Forces and the Defense Forces with motivated and trained personnel. Today, recruiting activities are carried out in two main directions. The first direction is the civilian component. As of now, 47 recruiting centers of the Ukrainian army have already been opened in Ukraine. This is just the beginning, and this network will continue to expand in the coming year. These centers are an innovative form of interaction between state structures with local self-government and the Ministry of Defense. Our goal is to create an extensive network of recruiting centers in different regions of the country, which will make it possible to maximize the opportunities for voluntary involvement of citizens in the ranks of the Armed Forces. An important feature of these centers is their location at TsNAPs, which ensures a comfortable and transparent process for citizens. They are not related to the territorial centers of recruitment and social support (TCC and SP). Qualified civilian specialists provide comprehensive information about military service, help choose a specialty and place of service, and also accompany the candidate at all stages of document preparation. For 10 months of operation, these centers have consulted more than 32 thousand citizens, and every fourth of them is already being selected for military service. An important indicator is that 20% of candidates are women. The main advantage of admission through the recruiting center is the opportunity to choose a specialty that corresponds to the candidate's abilities and desires, as well as to receive an extended package of benefits and social guarantees, which also apply to family members of a serviceman. The second direction is the recruiting centers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Currently, 5 specialized recruiting centers have been established in different types of Armed Forces: Ground Forces, Naval Forces, Airborne Assault Forces, Special Operations Forces and Territorial Defense Forces. Another center is being formed in the Unmanned Systems Forces. These structures are actively acquiring the necessary capabilities and are staffed with qualified specialists. In the near future, we will see their effective work in practice. In addition, the capabilities of commanders of combat units were expanded to independently select candidates for military service. Separate combat units already have their own recruiting units, which demonstrate effectiveness in attracting motivated military personnel. At the level of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff, appropriate structural units have been created to coordinate and direct recruiting activities throughout the country. These steps allow Ukraine to systematically approach the Armed Forces recruitment process, ensuring quality, transparency and flexibility at all levels of recruiting. Military education in Ukraine should be implemented according to NATO standards. To what extent is our military education already compatible with the Alliance? What areas are being most actively reformed? — Military education in Ukraine is currently undergoing a large-scale transformation in order to achieve maximum interoperability with NATO standards. But this process is not simply copying Western approaches. We adapt NATO standards to our own realities, combat experience and current needs of the Ukrainian military. These changes are not only about tactical or technical aspects - they are also about changing the culture of thinking, strategic planning and training new military leaders. One of the key tools of transformation is the NATO DEEP (Defence Education Enhancement Program), which has been operating in Ukraine for more than 10 years. Thanks to this program, Ukrainian military educational institutions gained access to advanced Western methods and educational technologies. Main achievements in this area: Special attention is paid to the training of military pilots. The process of obtaining private pilot certificates by cadets has been optimized, which allows to reduce the training time of F-16 pilots by almost three months. This provides an important operational advantage in the air. However, the war demonstrated that victory is ensured not only by modern weapons, but also by strong leadership. Therefore, one of the main goals of military education is to educate a new generation of military leaders who are able to make effective decisions in the most difficult conditions and lead their units to victory. This approach especially applies to officers and non-commissioned officers, who are a key link in the Armed Forces. The concept of transformation of military education of Ukraine is a strategic plan until 2032. It includes a systematic approach to training, implementation of best global practices and close cooperation with other government agencies and international partners. This reform is not just an update of standards, it is an investment in the future of the Ukrainian army, which will be able to effectively respond to modern challenges and ensure national security.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/02/pidgotovka-pilotiv-f-16-czyfrovizacziya-vlk-ta-pakunok-poranenogo-intervyu-sergiya-melnyka/	2025-01-01T21:10:32-08:00
How a combatant -Hetman- and his soldiers retook positions in Krynk and captured a scout from Moscow	-When I entered the military school, I was not yet 17. I dreamed that I would serve 25 years, keep bees&#8230; But here it is already 31 years of service, and I'm still in the army and somehow not into beekeeping,- -Hetman- laughs. In 1996, Oleksandr Getmachenko graduated from the Kharkiv Higher Command Tank School. Then there were the steps of the army career: from the commander of a tank platoon to the chief of staff of a tank battalion. Rotation in Iraq as a rifle platoon leader, serving in the 27th and 28th Separate Mechanized Brigades. 10 years of work in law enforcement agencies, returning to the army in 2016, three rotations in ATO/OOS. The next step would probably have been to fulfill the dream of a quiet life as a beekeeper, but a great war had begun. In March 2022, the officer had to form a territorial defense battalion from scratch: there was a huge queue at the military commissariat in Yuzhny, so the unit was formed in literally three days. The battalion performed tasks in Odesa region, Mykolaiv region, and since the end of 2022 has been holding defenses on the right bank of Kherson region. The commander of battalion 126 told ArmyInform about the rescue of civilians after the Russians blew up the Kakhovskaya HPP, the work on the left bank of the Dnieper, the specifics of the enemy's actions in the South, the destroyed settlements on the coast, as well as the decision to personally lead the operation to repel enemy positions and the -combat moped- of a separate brigade TrO of the 30th Marine Corps: -November 22 of this year marked two years as a battalion here in Kherson region. Constantly on the front edge of the defense. During the liberation of the Right Bank in the positions left by the enemy, we managed to take a large number of trophy weapons and ammunition, which came in handy when we deployed the defense line. Opposite us stood an -unbeaten- military unit of the occupiers, which had not previously participated in active hostilities. At that time, they also equipped positions and built fortifications on the left bank - brazenly, especially without hiding. But we quickly corrected it, forced them to calm down, hit the enemy with everything we had - both trophy weapons, our own, and weapons provided by foreign partners. In the intercepts, it was constantly heard: -They are working with this Biden crap again!- They worked with ATGMs, LNG, then connected 120 mortars. We did everything possible so that the Russians could not freely and calmly equip positions. I always told my guys this: everything should work against the enemy. It doesn't matter whether the weapon is old, whether it is modern, whether it is ours, whether it is Western. Even stones will agree if there is nothing else left. The enemy must not be at rest for even a second. I vividly remember the day when the Russians blew up the Kakhovskaya HPP. The water rose before our eyes, carrying with it mountains of garbage. Cars, animals, trees, pieces of buildings - everything. Heavy water blocked almost all roads. There was only one road left at that time, along which my guys evacuated civilians, helped them transport pets, things. At that time, I was very worried that the battalion would not be cut off by water from the only logistical artery at that time, because at the peak moment the height of the water rise reached 8 meters. Fortunately, everything worked out. From the intercepts, we learned that the Russians, who were then sitting on the Dnipro Islands, drowned. That is, the enemy did not even warn his own about the detonation of the HPP. In the summer of 2023, our brigade began an operation on the left bank of the Dnipro River. First, the assault units came in, and the units of my battalion were already supposed to start holding positions. During the third rotation, already in September, I myself went to the left bank. We were given the task of recapturing the lost positions and getting a foothold there, I decided that I should go with the guys. Well, I could not set a task for the staff, draw something on the map without visualizing it. We went there very nicely, quietly. Fortified, inflicted fire damage on the enemy. Two were killed, one was taken prisoner - a mother of such a scout from Moscow. In total, we managed to recover 750 meters of land during that exit. They were supposed to take 800 meters of the area, but 50 meters could not be taken. A total of ten came in. The same number came out - and this is the greatest happiness for me as a commander. Only one fighter was lightly wounded. The experience of going to the left bank later helped me a lot when planning combat missions and making decisions. I already know the specifics of the terrain, the specifics of movement, camouflage, and combat, where it is possible to gain a foothold and where it is not possible. To be honest, the operation on the left bank, on the islands, in Krynyky was difficult for me. I commanded a rifle platoon in Iraq for half a year, I did not have any losses, there were wounded in the anti-terrorist operation, but no one died. And here I was losing guys. And this is my biggest pain. In general, when my fighters go out, all the forces and means of the battalion work for them - drones, mortars, rocket launchers. And I still worry about people every time. I actually know all of them. Here, for example, a group of 8 people went to one of the extreme exits to the islands - very strong fighters, half - experienced scouts, my personal guard, as I call them. One of them is a young guy, a cool fighter, who recently returned from training in Germany. So, at that time, his fourth child was to be born. I did not force him to go, on the eve of leaving I asked if he was sure that he was ready to go on the task. Said he was sure. The boys stayed there for three weeks - due to difficult weather conditions, we could not get them out earlier. Of course, they had no contact with their relatives. Therefore, we relayed the news about the birth of a son to the soldier by radio. Well, the wife was also informed that the young father is alive and well. When the group left, I gave this warrior leave so that he could go to the family, see the youngest. Look, he could have already been released, this is already the fourth child, all minors, but he does not abandon his siblings, performs difficult tasks. I really respect and appreciate such people. Sometimes, you know, I'm surprised how unpredictably people show themselves in extreme situations. Those you don't expect suddenly do incredible things on the battlefield, and others you hope for -blow off-. Strange human psychology, you won't guess. We have a fighter nicknamed -Cunning-. All the time he was so quiet, an unremarkable, mediocre soldier. And he showed himself heroically in Krynyk. He pulled out the wounded, led the battle, encouraged, motivated. We took a close look at -Cunning-, made him a squad leader, then a platoon sergeant major. He copes with the tasks, it is nice that we were not mistaken. The war has changed dramatically in the two years that we have been in Kherson region. Now it is dominated by unmanned aerial systems - drones, FPV. They are actively used both by us and by the Russians. It's kind of, you know, a constant race. The enemy cannot be underestimated or considered weak. The Russians are improving, changing frequencies so that we can't hit them or suppress them with our EW. Recently, the enemy has begun to use dense mining, especially on the roads where we travel. Scatter -petals-, spikes. The rubber is punctured, as soon as the car stops to change a tire, the mavics with resets start working. In this way, the enemy is trying to destroy our logistics. Also, in the last few months, the enemy began to use aviation more, in particular, helicopters. They do not cause special damage, but morally, of course, they pressure. It is not pleasant when two -pinwheels- come out at you and launch 28 rockets each. FPV is not the most annoying. At the same time, the Russians do not care who to hit - civilians or military. A woman is walking, in ordinary clothes, in rubber boots, and an FPV is flying behind her. It's good that she managed to fall under a tree and the explosion hit the branches, it saved her. The enemy is constantly terrorizing the civilian population, enemy FPVs are chasing civilians, destroying their vehicles, houses. It pains me to watch how the Russians turn once rich coastal villages into an apocalyptic wasteland. When we just drove into Kherson region, I was in for a pleasant shock. Wealthy, beautiful villages, where people were mainly engaged in agriculture, earning a penny with their work. I have never seen fields like here in my life, although I myself come from sunny Bessarabia. Peach, pear, apple, cherry orchards, hectares of strawberries, raspberries, grapes, all under irrigation. How much human labor and money is invested here! It was all destroyed because of the Russians. Villages and towns along the Dnieper look like something out of a horror movie. Everything is burnt, broken. They simply methodically destroy street after street, house after house for two years. It is no longer possible to move during the day. Any car becomes a target. Man is the same. It got to the point that I had to take the moped from Yuzhny and drive it around the positions at night with a headlamp. There is no other way to move through a large area of ​​responsibility. It's normal - I ride, check the positions, familiarize myself with the situation, talk to the guys, ask what help is needed, what problems there are. If at the beginning of a full-scale war I had a lot of people and few weapons, now the situation is completely different. There are weapons, not enough people. It's no secret that very few motivated and, most importantly, completely healthy people who are able to fight come to the army, in particular, to my unit. You understand, to fight is to wear a bulletproof vest, a helmet, some kind of weapon, equipment. You have to have some health to lift it all. And when 55+ men come along, well, they can't physically be effective even if they want to. I speak personally with everyone who comes to the battalion. I ask what he did in civilian life, I try to find a position that would take into account a person's knowledge and skills. If you know about technology, like to turn nuts - here is the position of a repairman, please. A gamer - I have a boyfriend, a European champion in computer games - let's take it to drones. A fitness trainer means you can be a doctor. There is a great need for a personnel - now I will say rudely - with eggs. Who can not only sit in the trenches or in the basements, but also go out, move forward, inflict fire damage on the enemy. It's okay to be afraid. It's scary sometimes, to be honest. I want to live, I want to see my grandchildren. But there is a task to be done. It is necessary to save the country, so fear must be overcome. People are also needed because those guys who have experience and have been fighting for a long time are very tired, very tired. However, they do not give up their arms and weapons. I have an extremely good team - battalion management, company commanders, sergeants, sailors. Despite the fatigue, they work, they say: -Combat, we are with you.- They believe me, I believe them too. We cover each other's backs and continue the fight.

The German standard of accuracy: which long-range sniper rifles were included in the next package of...	According to statements from the German government, the total number of these special weapons will increase to 340 units with the November delivery, ArmyInform reports. Official portal manufacturer characterizes Haenel HLR 338 as a new precision bolt-action rifle that combines excellent long-range qualities with a modular concept and a significant weight reduction compared to the authoritative RS class from CG Haenel. Officially this rifle presented in 2023. The Bundeswehr has already managed to take it into service. This sniper rifle is designed for high-precision engagement of long-range targets. It is the most powerful rifle in the HLR series. This series also features HLR 308 Basic rifles in .308 Win and 6.5 Creedmoor. This rifle has an adjustable two-stage trigger with 10 to 20 N pull (equivalent to approximately 1.0-2 .0 kg). The trigger force can be adjusted. The 3-stage trigger guard prevents an accidental shot. The rifle weighs 7.5 kg. The length of the barrel of the weapon is 600 mm, and the diameter is 22 mm. The total length is 1275 mm, and when the butt is folded, it is 1020 mm. Picatinny 4694 and M-LOK rails are integrated in the forend. The rifle has 10 rounds in its magazine. This is another plus, because you don't have to reload the weapon all the time. The 22mm cooled match barrel is made by Haenel and has an M18x1.5 muzzle thread for a muzzle brake and/or silencer. German gunsmiths, creating this era, took care not only of equipping army snipers, but also of sports shooting enthusiasts. Two variants and several calibers are currently available from Haenel. Basic and Pro differ mostly in equipment. The HLR Basic has a controllable stock length with an adjustable cheek rest, which creates ideal ergonomic conditions for safe operation. The rifle is compatible with AR-15 class examples. HLR Basic is available in calibers: – .308 Win. (barrel length 600 mm with a twist of 12 inches); – 6.5 Creedmoor (barrel length 600 mm with a twist of 8 inches); – .338 Lapua Magnum (barrel length 690 mm with 10- twist). The HLR Pro, in turn, features a folding RS8/9 stock that can be quickly and easily adjusted in height and length without tools. This variant also comes standard with a muzzle brake. HLR Pro caliber selections include: – .308 Win. (600mm barrel length with 12- twist); - .338 Lapua Magnum (690mm barrel length with 10- twist). Basic and Pro are also offered as flagship compact versions .308 Win. caliber with a short barrel of 510 mm and a twist of 12 inches. If we talk about the cartridges used in this weapon, then we are talking about .338 Lapua Magnum (8.6×70 mm or 8.58×70 mm). It is a center-fire cartridge with a bottle-shaped case, without a protrusion at the edges, designed for military snipers for effective shooting at long distances. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq proved its effectiveness in practice and contributed to its significant spread. .338 Lapua has a dual purpose: combating enemy manpower and equipment. But the possibilities of combating equipment are limited by the lower kinetic energy of the bullet, especially compared to .50 BMG. The diameter of the flange is 14.93 mm, and the total length of the bullet is 93.5 mm. The bullet is able to penetrate better than standard body armor at a distance of up to 1000 m, and the maximum effective distance of fire reaches 1750 m. The initial speed of the bullet depends on the temperature and composition of the gunpowder and varies from 880 m/c to 915 m/c for a civilian bullet weighing 16.2 g, and the initial energy of the bullet is about 6525 J. In general, long-range sniper the HLR338 rifle combines incredible functionality and impressive accuracy. It has an ergonomic design and modular construction. That is, it can be easily and quickly adapted to a specific task. Exhibition presentation of long-range sniper rifle Haenel HLR 338.

Leopard and -Santa Barbara-: how the -Shaggy- NATO tank protects tankers	The crew of the Leopard 2A4 tank with the call sign -Lokhmaty- of the 33rd separate mechanized brigade told ArmyInform about all this. The commander of the tank -White-, the driver-mechanic -Tokmak-, the gunner -Paly- and the loader -Chechen-. Not so long ago, they all had civilian professions, but with the beginning of a large-scale invasion, they joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and mastered a formidable combat vehicle - the Leopard 2A4. This crew is fully interchangeable - each member can fill in for another in an emergency. At the basic level, this was taught during training in Spain, and then tankers independently improved their skills after returning to Ukraine. — Here, Ruslan has already fought as a gunner, and as a loader, and as a driver-mechanic—whatever he was. And he worked as a commander. Someone who, for example, was a charger from the beginning, can become both a mechvod and a gunner, if it is necessary in combat conditions, says -White-. It is not difficult to learn to fulfill the responsibilities of a brother, they assure. Of course, the one who fights as a gunner or mechvod longer will be more skillful, but everyone should know the basics and it is unnecessary to relearn for a long time. - There is nothing complicated, the main thing is to understand. The crew should be interchangeable, because if, God forbid, something happens, then the loader takes control, the gunner takes control. -Everybody rides our tanks, and they know everything about charging and guidance,- the tank commander assures. Tankers remember training in Spain with gratitude and, smiling, say that they would gladly go to study more. Two of them came from the infantry, two more, including the tank commander, transferred to the Leopard from the T-64. — Did you go on -Zhiguly-? And then they switched to a foreign car - a BMW or a Volkswagen? So it's the same as changing from a bogie to a normal car - here everything is made for people: handles, footboards, -sandpapers- on the armor so that the feet don't slip and the nose doesn't get stuffed, -White- points to the special coating on the tank's armor. However, the T-64, on which he served conscript service and fought in 2022 in the 4th separate tank brigade, is fondly remembered. It was on this Soviet tank that he took part in the Slobozhan offensive operation, when the Russians were hastily fleeing from the Kharkiv region. — They tarred the Russians so much that their fur coats turned upside down. Kupyansk, Tabaivka - we then chased them and beat them so much that if we had given the order, we would have reached Belgorod, but we crossed the border - and they are standing! That's how we didn't enter Russia then, - the tanker driver is happy and sad at the same time. Now fighting on the Leopard, he and his brothers note that the 64 does not stand a chance compared to him and is only suitable for shooting from closed positions as ersatz artillery. And in this, they add, the T-64 can be quite effective, because its gun provides a significant range and accuracy of shots. — If 40 years ago the Soviet Union and NATO had -bited down-, then Soviet tanks with -Leopard- would not have stood nearby. -Leopards- are very good, they are good now, but they were made back in the 1980s and they were good in the 1990s. And now drones have changed everything, -White- is convinced. However, even now -Leopard- has significant advantages over obsolete Soviet tanks already 40 years ago. It is not only noticeably larger and significantly heavier, but also significantly more powerful, faster, more maneuverable, more spacious. And also, despite more than 60 tons of weight and a 1,500-horsepower engine, it is quieter. Already 50-70 meters away in the forest, the hum of a tank engine can be heard as the work of a large, but quite calm agricultural mechanism. When the tank is 120-150 meters away, you need to listen carefully to hear it. And no wild roar at start-up or crazy growl while driving. It is almost impossible to audibly detect the Leopard on the battlefield among other numerous noises, shots and explosions. And with the simplest masking, it becomes inconspicuous visually. The tank shown to us is covered with camouflage -kikimora- and it becomes inconspicuous already at a distance of 30-40 meters. - We call him -Shaggy- because he has such a disguise. It has already broken off in some places, so the armor is visible. But when we attach everything back, it is almost not visible, says -Tokmak-, who is in the combined crew as a mechvod, but was also a gunner. For a war machine of this size, the Shaggy Leopard's camouflage looks really amazing. When the tank that was standing on the lawn drives deep into the forest, we see its dark silhouette only because we know its location. — This particular tank was standing on a mowed field of yellow color, covered in the same way as this net, — shows -Tokmak- on the -kikimora- on the -Leopard-. — And it's not even visible if you don't know it's there. And he stands and works on the enemy, he is especially not even disguised, he stands and just works. And one hundred percent that the people who saw the video of his work did not even understand that he was shooting like that. Before driving back into the forest, the Leopard rotates the turret with the barrel of the gun in the direction of the stern. This is a transport position, the tankers explain, this is how the tank moves on the march, how it is driven onto railway platforms or trawlers. Therefore, an uninformed civilian should not approach the tank from any side - the direction of the gun barrel does not at all indicate that the mechvod sees you. — There were incidents when cars were left a few meters behind the tank, believing that the direction of the gun barrel pointed to its front. While everything was quite the opposite - it was the stern, -Tokmak- explains. In general, everything is thought out - the tank even has rear-view mirrors, side and stop lights. Thanks to this and rubber pads on the tracks of the tracks, the Leopard can easily drive around the city, fitting into traffic flows and not damaging the asphalt. In the set of equipment provided with the tank, there is even a special flashing beacon, which is used to mark large-sized equipment when driving on public highways. — The rear-view mirrors were not made of glass, but of metal, polished -stainless steel- so that you can see plus or minus like a mirror. Not super clear, but enough to see what's behind, says -White.- He speaks favorably of how the Leopard is adapted for transportation on trawls or by rail in EU countries. The German armored car clearly stands on the platform, while the Soviet tanks have half of the tracks hanging on both sides during rail transport. - It will run 80 kilometers on the dirt road - just like that! And on the asphalt, the -hundred- will go for a sweet soul. If all the components work perfectly, then this is a great car. 40 years ago it was basically a tank - fire! - enthusiastically says about the -Leopard- of the -White- tank commander. Mehvod adds that the automatic transmission allows you to -not worry- about gear changes. -Sat down, -started- and drove away- - the tank does not need any warm-up and long acceleration time to gain speed. Also, the -Leopard- is extremely maneuverable, and the steering wheel of the armored vehicle can be controlled with one hand. Mobility gives the tank important, often decisive, advantages on the battlefield when time is counted in fractions of a second. - We are always moving - through lowlands, forest strips. There were cases when the enemy was approached at close range - at a distance of several hundred meters. We stick the barrel into the enemy's dugout and shoot, - laughs the tank commander. The tank easily goes off-road - mud, mud, dry sand. The only problem for him can be wet sand, on which during a turn the Leopard can -take off his shoes-, losing the track - it slips off the tracks. However, returning the -goose- to its place is not a problem - it does not require significant effort and time. Tankers call the main threat to a tank in battle barrage ammunition such as -Lancet- and FPV-kamikaze. ATGMs and mines are also a significant threat, but much less so than drones. — If it weren't for these -efpivishkas-, we would have already broken the -star- from the Kremlin with the -Leopard-. Mines, dumps, grenade launchers - everything that can be survived, escaped or maneuvered. And when the FPV is -hugging- at 180 kilometers per hour - how can you escape from it? says the commander of the -White- tank. -Tokmak- emphasizes that one cannot underestimate the enemy and consider him stupid and weak. Everything is dangerous on the battlefield, but Lancet calls it the most dangerous. - It's even cooler than FPV - it's like ten FPV flying into you. As soon as the weather is good, the sun will shine - right in the Supercam sky, and the Lancet can fly. The enemy cannot be underestimated, because he knows a lot and learns well, there are many of them, they have a lot of resources, he notes. Tankers recall the devastating effects of Lancets and FPV hits on armored vehicles and show the places where the cumulative jet was hit - the -skin- of this -Leopard- already has some scars. Instead, the mines, they say, do not pose a danger to the lives of the crew. - It holds mines like peanuts. The crew just climbs out like a plague, the light flashes. Contused, but alive and whole. We have those here who have been blown up several times. It feels like the head was stuck in the bell and the bell was hit with a sledgehammer. My ears are ringing, but 80% of our staff here are already a bit contused, so this is a normal thing, says -White-. Tankers are critical of -sheds-, -barbecues-, protective nets and gratings. It is said that any extra structures greatly impair the tank's maneuverability. They are difficult to install so that they do not interfere with the rotation of the turret, and they also prevent the crew from quickly leaving the armored vehicle in case of need. — She only gets in the way. Well, you can plaster, weld this grill. But if you boil otaku halabuda on top, then this is also a disadvantage in terms of masking - especially since you cannot hide it. We covered the engine compartment, put it in the front, but it all doesn't hold well - it's enough to drive into the landing and it will be demolished. This is such a tank that the grill just gets in the way, explains the commander of the -Shaggy-. On the other hand, tankers respond favorably to the dynamic protection blocks installed on the armor, recognizing their feasibility. Even a thick rubber collar on one of the tank's vulnerable spots is useful because it dampens the cumulative jet. -Leopards-, they say, came from Germany -naked-, so they had to install a dynamic defense already in Ukraine. Unlike protective grills, these additional -accessories- in no way affect the advantages of the tank in battle, such as speed and maneuverability, do not expose it and do not endanger the lives of the crew in the event of an emergency exit of the combat vehicle. Recognizing the importance of EW devices, which are also installed on tanks, tankers still rely more on the tank's mobility, camouflage and smoke, shooting which -Leopard- can so -fog- the battlefield that it itself makes its way almost by touch. Fighters consider the so-called -Santa Barbara- to be one of the biggest advantages of the -Leopard- over old Soviet tanks - a special compartment of the tower, which houses an ammunition kit of 15 shells, which are stored in special tube drawers. The name of this part of the tank tower comes from the legend of Saint Barbara, a great Christian martyr who is considered the patron saint of gunners, sappers, military engineers and rocket launchers. It is she who, according to established tradition, provides protection against death due to explosions, thunder and lightning. In Spanish, French and Italian, the word -Santa Barbara- means an artillery cellar or a place for storing gunpowder and ammunition on a warship or in a fortress. Previously, statues of the saint were placed near them as a talisman against the explosion. In the -Leopard-, the -Santa Barbara- is arranged in such a way that it is completely separated from the main part of the turret, and in the event of an ammunition explosion, the blast wave and debris are directed and scattered outside, not inside the tank. This is what allows you to save the lives of tankers. — Even in the event of an ammunition explosion, the crew will definitely survive and the tank itself will survive and remain on the move. You have definitely seen on the video how Soviet tanks explode from the inside, how the tower is torn off. This can never happen on the Leopard if the ammunition is placed only in the Santa Barbara, says the tank commander. The last clarification is important, because the tank also has a magazine rack, on which you can store additional shells, increasing the tank's ammunition to 42 rounds. However, now tankers do not do this, because then the danger of detonation due to hitting enemy ammunition is too high. — It is bad that there are few bullets, only 15 pieces. But we don't put shells in the BC rack, because it's too dangerous. same Now they cannot be used under any circumstances, except to store stew or something else, because additional space appears inside the tank, - explains -White-. In addition to -Santa Barbara-, Leopard has a few more -chips- that help save the lives of tankers. One of them is the ability to continue driving in a special emergency mode even if the engine compartment is hit by enemy ammunition. - To survive, it has many functions. For example, when the FPV engine is flying, the crew switches it to emergency mode and can continue to drive for some time. Another 5 or even 7 kilometers can be driven until everything leaks out of the engine and it burns out completely, says -White-. In addition, excess pressure is created in the closed body of the tank, which allows you to protect the crew from harmful penetration from the outside - a chemical, biological or even nuclear threat. It also allows the -Leopard- to -swim- well - more precisely, overcome water obstacles by wading. Tankers note that the main thing is that the bottom is hard enough and the tank does not get sucked into the mud. — You check all the nodes completely so that everything works. One click lever and everything is completely hermetically sealed. You turn on the drainage pumps, bilge pumps. You turn on the ford crossing system, the driver-mechanic has a pressure gauge that shows whether the pressure is maintained, whether the system is working - and forward, says the tank commander. Unlike Soviet tanks, which need to be caulked for a long time before diving, everything is done automatically in the Leopard. The armored -predator- can easily overcome a water obstacle up to three meters deep. Enemy dugouts and fortifications, infantry and armored vehicles - Leopard crews had to work on a wide variety of targets. Tankers tell about the destruction of a column of enemy armored vehicles from 8 units and a skirmish with a Russian tank, which ended in a shameful defeat for the enemy. — With one -Leopard- the guys from our company -dismantled- this entire moving column. And it is this -Leopard- - you can find a video on the Internet - clearly put a -crow- in the stern of a Russian tank, which we encountered in one of the villages in Donetsk region, and it ran away from us. -He was turned around after being hit,- says -Tokmak-. Tankers call an armor-piercing projectile a -scrap-. Thanks to the laser rangefinder and clear aiming, this accurate shot was made at a distance of 3 km 200 m. However, then the rangefinder failed, and the enemy tank began to maneuver and leave the affected area. — Of course, we released the entire BC on it. It fell next to him, fell in front of him, fell behind him, but without accurately measuring the distance it became very difficult to hit. But then we asked him kindly, says the tanker. -Leopard-, he emphasizes, is a great fighting machine, but, like any other equipment, only if all nodes, units and devices work flawlessly. In case of breakdowns, the quality of the tank's combat performance drops. However, in any case, it remains much better than the old Soviet tanks on which the Russians are fighting.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/02/leopard-i-santa-barbara-yak-lohmatyj-tank-nato-berezhe-tankistiv/	2025-01-01T20:15:40-08:00
A new masterpiece of Russian disinformation: the fake that Ukraine is -destroying- its own GTS	Let's imagine for a minute that Ukraine decided to destroy its own GTS. It is like a farmer burning his crops to salt his neighbor. After all, the GTS is not just pipes, but also a strategic asset that brings income from gas transit. The destruction of this infrastructure would cause harm, first of all, to Ukraine itself. The purpose of spreading such fakes is to discredit Ukraine in the eyes of European partners, to sow doubts about its reliability as a transit point, and to justify Russia's own actions. After all, if you believe this nonsense, it turns out that Ukraine is depriving itself of income and undermining Europe's energy security. The Ukrainian side has repeatedly denied similar statements, emphasizing its commitment to obligations to European consumers and its desire for energy cooperation. However, it seems that Russian propaganda does not tire of inventing new ways of discrediting. The fake about Ukraine's -destruction- of its own GTS is another example of how the Russian disinformation machine tries to manipulate facts and mislead the international community. However, as practice shows, the truth always comes to the surface, and such attempts only undermine the credibility of the very sources of disinformation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/02/novyj-shedevr-rosijskoyi-dezinformacziyi-fejk-pro-te-shho-ukrayina-znyshhuye-vlasnu-gts/	2025-01-01T20:04:16-08:00

President: Stopping transit of Russian gas is one of Moscow's biggest defeats	This is stated in the statement of the head of state in the telegram channel. -When Putin was given power in Russia more than 25 years ago, the annual gas pumping through the territory of Ukraine to Europe amounted to 130+ billion cubic meters. Today, the transit of Russian gas is 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats,- the President said. The transformation of energy carriers into weapons and cynical energy blackmail of partners is what deprived Russia of the most attractive and geographically accessible market for Russia, added Volodymyr Zelenskyy. -Considering the circumstances, the absolute majority of European countries have successfully adapted to such changes. Today, our joint task is to support Moldova in the period of energy transformation. We also have to withstand the hysteria of some European politicians who prefer mafia schemes with Moscow instead of a transparent energy policy,- the head of state said. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also expressed hope for an increase in the supply of American gas to Europe, which was already mentioned by US President Donald Trump. Cooperation and maximum offers from partners on the market will make it possible to make prices more comfortable. -The more gas there is on the market from Europe's true partners, the sooner the last negative consequences of European energy dependence on Russia will be overcome,- concluded the President.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/prezydent-zupynka-tranzytu-rosijskogo-gazu-odna-z-najbilshyh-porazok-moskvy/	2025-01-01T08:14:55-08:00

We worked on it before, I was part of the working group, and it is almost finalized. I think that in the coming days the final version will be presented to the President and I hope that we will be able to submit it to the parliament,- she said. The second task is to solve the most pressing issues. -Immediately after the appointment, I received a huge number of complaints that need to be responded to and we are already doing it. There are complaints of an individual nature and there are more general problems that require a systemic solution,- said Olga Reshetylova. She gave an example of a system for collecting DNA analysis during military service. There are relevant regulations, but this work is not systematically established. -I want to emphasize that both now and after the adoption of the law, we are talking exclusively about active servicemen. And about everything related to passing the service. And this is important, because when entering the service, military personnel voluntarily give up some of their rights and freedoms, and in return do not receive any protection. This applies to issues of social, legal protection, etc.,- emphasized Olga Reshetylova.

-Bath day- and -army games-: a Russian who tortured people during the occupation of Kharkiv Region w...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this on January 1. The accused is a citizen of the Russian Federation from the Belgorod region. In recent years, he lived in the village of Strelecha in Kharkiv Oblast. Already during the full-scale invasion, the man performed the duties of the head of the self-proclaimed people's police body in the temporarily occupied territory of the Lipetsk OTG of the Kharkiv region in the position of precinct chief. -He had information about local residents in the community, so he knew with whom it was necessary to -conduct prevention- for a pro-Ukrainian position. the Russian military forcefully detained people and took them to the prisons that were set up in the building of the MPP -Hoptivka- and in the basement of a high-rise building in the village of Shooting in the Kharkiv district,- the message says. The occupiers, together with the accused, inflicted chaotic blows on people with rubber batons, stun guns, and hit them on the head with a wooden hammer. They also poured water on the faces of the victims through a towel, thus blocking the access of air. The accused cynically called this execution procedure -bath day-. In addition, the person involved forced the victims to participate in -army games-, which involved dressing up as border guards or police officers and performing certain tasks. Detainees were fed rations after the military of the Russian Federation. It was established that one of the victims of Russian terrorists was a civilian man suffering from cancer, who has the most severe stage of cancer. -The figure, disregarding everything, beat him almost to half-death, trying to -beat out- information about the Armed Forces. Such hatred towards the victim was caused by the fact that his son is a Ukrainian serviceman,- the law enforcement officers said. The prosecutors of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office have approved and sent to the court an indictment against a 41-year-old man for the fact of brutal treatment of the civilian population, committed by a group of persons based on a previous conspiracy (Part 2 of Article 28, Part 1 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (as amended to 24.10.2024)). The accused is wanted. He will be tried in absentia in the Dergachiv district court of the Kharkiv region. The sanction of the article provides for punishment in the form of imprisonment for a term of eight to twelve years. The establishment of all Russian military personnel involved in the abuse of the civilian population of Kharkiv region is ongoing. As reported by ArmyInform, the Security Service and the National Police detained two more groups of henchmen of the Russian Federation, who military cars of the Defense Forces were burning. The extras got into the field of view of scammers when they were looking for quick earnings on Telegram channels. However, instead of the promised money from the Russian Federation, the arsonists received suspicion and the prospect of imprisonment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/bannyj-den-ta-armijski-igry-sudytymut-rosiyanyna-yakyj-katuvav-lyudej-pid-chas-okupacziyi-harkivshhyny/	2025-01-01T05:48:00-08:00

On New Year's Eve, the occupiers left the residents of Mariupol's construction center without heat	About this reports Center of National Resistance. The situation in temporarily occupied Mariupol is particularly critical. The reason for the situation is the criminal activity of local collaborators. They are unable to organize the work of communal enterprises due to a banal lack of personnel. After all, the majority of housing and communal services workers in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine were sent to their -homes-, and those who managed to avoid -service- in the enemy's army are not paid their salaries for months. We remind you that due to the increase in tax pressure, the government the Russian Federation is trying to find funds for the continuation of the Russian-Ukrainian war, namely, to finance the defense expenditures included in the federal budget for 2025–2027 years.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/u-novorichnu-nich-okupanty-zalyshyly-bez-tepla-meshkancziv-to-mariupolya/	2025-01-01T02:48:41-08:00
A soldier who came on vacation was robbed: two men were detained in Kharkiv	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this on January 1. According to the investigation, on December 27 at around 5:50 p.m., two men were near an underpass in Kharkiv, where they saw a 45-year-old military man who had come on vacation. -Having caught up with him, one of the criminals punched the victim in the face, and when he fell down, he continued to kick him with his accomplice. Having overcome resistance in this way and inflicting physical injuries on the man, the robbers took his property,- the message reads. The men took the phone, documents, cash and other things that the soldier had with him, and then fled the scene of the crime. The law enforcement officers promptly identified the perpetrators and detained them in accordance with Art. 208 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. At the request of the prosecution, preventive measures in the form of detention were chosen for both suspects. Under the procedural guidance of the Slobid district prosecutor's office of the city of Kharkiv, two 38-year-old men were notified of suspicion of robbery combined with violence, committed by a group of persons based on a prior conspiracy, under martial law conditions (Part 4 of Article 186 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). For the crime, the suspect faces up to ten years in prison. As reported by ArmyInform, the Security Service and the National Police detained two more groups of henchmen of the Russian Federation, who military cars of the Defense Forces were burning. The extras got into the field of view of scammers when they were looking for quick earnings on Telegram channels. However, instead of the promised money from the Russian Federation, the arsonists received suspicion and the prospect of imprisonment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/pograbuvaly-vijskovogo-yakyj-pryyihav-u-vidpustku-v-harkovi-zatrymano-dvoh-cholovikiv/	2025-01-01T02:34:21-08:00

Worthy of attention is the fact that the personal income tax for participants in the Russian-Ukrainian war will remain at the level of 13-15%.

The President of Ukraine commented on the Russian shelling on New Year's Eve	This is in the message of the head of state in the Telegram channel. -even on New Year's Eve, Russia was only concerned about how to hurt Ukraine. One hundred and eleven strike drones against our cities,- the President said. According to him, most of them did not achieve their goals thanks to Ukrainian air defense equipment, mobile fire groups and EW systems. -But, unfortunately, at this time it is known about one dead person. My condolences to family and friends. There are also casualties and destruction. All services are engaged,- he informed. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked everyone who, regardless of the circumstances, every night and every day on duty, at work, protects Ukraine and Ukrainians. -Our army, which holds back the assaults.

Received Russian documents regarding the plane crash in Baku	This is reported by Center of National Resistance. It shows the degradation of the Russian regime, total mendacity, and rapid loss of foreign policy influence. It is also quite likely that the Russian dictator will not punish his faithful vassal Kadyrov or anyone from the Chechen administration in general, and will appoint someone completely insignificant as the culprit. The so-called head of the Chechen Kadyrov has an extensive network of representatives throughout the Russian Federation. The document, which will be discussed further, was developed and sent on behalf of the representative of the head of the Chechen Republic in the Ural Federal District, Turpal Akhmedovich Ilyasov. The source that handed over Ilyasov's letter to the CNS received it from the mail of Ilyasov's son, Adam, who also works at this representative office, is the head of the secretariat and is responsible for interaction with the media. The document itself is a kind of -darkroom- with instructions on what should or should not be commented. As it follows from the text, it reflects the position of Kadyrov and the head of his administration, Galas Taymaskhanov. In particular, in the letter you can see how in Russia language becomes a tool for building a parallel reality. For example, it is suggested to ignore any mention of a plane being shot down. Instead, it is recommended to call it a tragic incident - because that is what Russian dictator Putin called it in his address. However, the letter further contains interesting details of the behind-the-scenes intrigues of the Russian ruling elite. For example, it is claimed that the Russian Federation will never admit its guilt and this is a clear position of Putin. So this is just a tragic accident that happened in the -airspace of Russia-. The letter also shows that Putin depends on the loyalty of his Chechen vassals and oprichniks. Putin's official apology, which he expressed to President Aliyev, was of a general nature and demonstrates how dependent the Russian Federation is on maintaining relations both with Azerbaijan and its partners in the region. In fact, Putin is in a weak position to ignore this incident. If earlier, as in the case of the downed Malaysian flight MH-17, Russia could afford to ignore and silence the facts for years, to overload the information space with mutually exclusive false versions, then in the case of the Baku-Grozny flight, no matter how much Putin wanted to, he had to apologize. Of course, this was a -half- apology - because Russia still does not want to admit its guilt. And that's why they play -newbie- with -tragic incidents-. However, such an apology does not suit the Azerbaijani side. The latter requires finding the culprits and bringing them to justice. Here it is worth mentioning that on December 24, Khamzat, the secretary of the Chechen Security Council and Kadyrov's nephew, announced on Instagram that all drones in the sky over Chechnya had been destroyed. He became practically the only official who confirmed that Chechnya was attacked by drones. -The information that the drones hit some object is not true, everything has been shot down!- - he wrote in a comment to the video of the destruction of one of the drones. The next day, when it became known about the downing of the Azerbaijani plane, Kadyrov awarded his nephew the medal -For services to the Chechen Republic.- Obviously, this gave rise to versions about the involvement of Kadyrov's relatives in instructing controllers to divert the plane so that it would crash into the sea, thereby hiding all evidence of the crime. It is also worth mentioning here the fact that Chechnya and the Kadyrovs are a kind of Putin's henchmen. Moscow does not touch the Caucasus, Chechnya has one of the lowest rates of involvement in the Russian occupation army, as well as the level of casualties. Other, more distant regions (such as Bashkiria or Tatarstan) bear disproportionately greater human losses. So, in this situation, when Putin is tied to the loyalty of the Caucasus, but has to find those responsible for the downing of the plane, he will most likely choose the traditional option of appointing a scapegoat. And from the letter it becomes clear that it will be the dispatchers, not the Chechen administration. Therefore, Kadyrov's nephew can receive a dozen more orders named after Kadyrov and not worry about the consequences. The temnik sent by Turpalov clearly shows the rapid degradation of the Russian Federation. After all, a regime built on lies and crimes cannot give the world anything but the suffering of innocent people. We remind you, at the end of December, seven teenagers blew themselves up with an explosive device in Lysychansk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/otrymano-rosijski-temnyky-shhodo-katastrofy-litaka-u-baku/	2025-01-01T01:43:16-08:00

Energy security of the world: TOP-25 forecasts for 2025	-In 2024, the global energy map of the world has undergone significant changes. At the same time, before identifying the main factors of influence, it is worth first of all to outline the very concept of energy security, which is a sufficient amount of energy resources that are transported through a stable infrastructure to transparent markets, to which a paying consumer has equal access. The global portfolio of energy resources, in the part of oil, can be considered practically balanced, because the global level of consumption of 102.8 million barrels per day is covered by the production of 102.6 million barrels. Such an indicator indicates the balance of the market, despite military tensions in the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East. In this context, it is appropriate to mention that in the third quarter of the current year, Iran repeatedly resorted to public statements of various nature, expecting, in particular, changes in the global oil market. In fact, the supply and demand situation has been balanced by the increase in oil production in the United States and the decrease in demand from Chinese consumers. Thus, for the second year in a row, the American oil industry demonstrated a record increase in black gold production by 2% to 13.2 million barrels per day. At the same time, China reduced its oil consumption by 10%, which made it possible to reduce the growth rate of global demand to 1%, compared to the previous year. In addition, the Chinese market reduced its consumption of Russian oil by 7%, replacing it with black gold from Saudi Arabia. This trend occurred due to the increase in the cost of delivery of Russian raw materials against the background of sanctions, which are not enough to bleed the aggressor's economy, which mostly sells its black gold on the markets of China and India. Unfortunately, during 2024, the aggressor managed to export about 4.8 million barrels of oil worth $320 million. Taking into account the current level of activity on the oil market, in 2025 we should expect a further increase in the production of black gold to 104.5 million barrels per day. Taking into account such a forecast, it is possible that there will be a surplus of oil supply in the global dimension next year. At the same time, it is worth paying attention to the indicators of the enemy's oil production industry and not to allow violations of international law, in particular, UN Resolution No. 2375 of September 11, 2017, which imposes a ban on the supply of oil and petroleum products to North Korea. Global demand for natural gas grew by 2.4% during 2024 and returned to pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, the driving force behind growth was the Asia-Pacific region and liquefied natural gas, the market share of which increased to 40%. Notably, Qatar, the United States, and Australia remain the leaders in the supply of liquefied natural gas, while the EU and Asia remain key sales markets. At the same time, there is a rather dangerous tendency for the aggressor to increase gas production, by more than 9%, compared to the indicators of the previous year. At the same time, in the next year, the aggressor may increase the production of liquefied natural gas to 40 million tons, which once again indicates the urgent need to introduce new sanctions. This trend is connected with Russia's attempt to increase natural gas supplies to China. At the same time, total Russian gas exports to the EU by all routes rose to 32 billion cubic meters, down from 28.3 billion cubic meters in 2023, falling to the lowest level since the 1970s. Despite this growth, the volume of Russian gas supplies to Europe remains significantly lower than in previous years. For comparison, in 2018-2019, the annual flow of gas to Europe reached 175 to 180 billion cubic meters. The global coal market in 2024 was characterized by stable supply and demand, but consumption remained at the level of the previous year, amounting to approximately 8.7 billion tons, which contributed to a record increase in street carbon dioxide emissions to the level of 41.6 billion metric tones. At the same time, the Russian coal industry faced serious financial difficulties in 2024, which was reflected in its main indicators. First of all, the aggressor reduced the volume of coal production by 4.4% in annual terms, which determined the decrease in export supplies and the loss of sales markets. For example, one of the largest importers of Russian coal in Taiwan, Taiwan Cement Corporation (TCC), completely stopped cooperation with the aggressor. Overall, the income of the Russian coal industry fell by 97%, and the vast majority of mining companies suffered losses. Concluding the resources section, it is worth paying attention to the mining of uranium and the production of nuclear fuel from the overview of the development of low-carbon energy sources. In the current year, there was a 3% increase in the volume of uranium mining to the level of 50,000. tons Despite the fact that Kazakhstan is the largest producer of uranium, the aggressor continues to control more than 40% of the world's uranium enrichment. In the next year, Russia's share in this segment may decrease due to the development of its own capacities in the USA and the EU, as well as the attraction of investments in fields in Canada and Namibia. In the past year, many significant infrastructure projects in the energy sector were implemented, which affected global energy and contributed to the development of sustainable energy systems in the world, in particular: 1. Projects in the field of low-carbon, renewable and hydrogen energy. 2. Network integration and infrastructure of liquefied natural gas 3. Energy storage and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions As we can see, in 2024, the implementation of large-scale energy projects around the world demonstrated the growing interest in sustainable, integrated and decarbonized energy. These initiatives have significantly strengthened the position of renewable energy sources, liquefied natural gas, hydrogen and innovative technologies in the global energy system. Speaking of quotations on the global oil market, during 2024 there was a tendency for the price to decrease, for example, at the beginning of January one barrel of Brent was sold for $76.3, and at the end of December it was 3% less. Taking into account the forecast for the growth of oil production in 2025, it is possible to assume a further decrease in quotations to the level of 65 dollars per barrel. The opposite is the case with natural gas prices. In 2024, natural gas prices in Asia and North America have risen by nearly 50% and look set to continue rising in the first quarter of next year due to active storage depletion. At the same time, the level of liquefied gas price growth will be determined by seasonal demand and storage capacity. In 2024, coal prices remained relatively stable. For example, in Australia, prices remained at the level of about $203 per ton. The price situation on the global market of primary energy carriers led to the fact that during the current year the electricity market in the European Union underwent the following changes. First, after significant price volatility in the previous two years, electricity prices have declined in 2024 due to stable gas supplies, full gas storage facilities and favorable weather conditions. Thus, in Germany, France, Italy and Spain, average electricity prices were 30-40% lower than in 2023. This trend, in particular, was influenced by the slowdown in the economic growth of the EU, for example, the demand for electricity decreased by 5%. Second, the share of renewable energy sources (wind, solar, hydro and bioenergy) has exceeded 50% in many EU countries, including Germany, Spain and Denmark. This was also facilitated by a new investment-attractive pricing model for energy produced from alternative sources. This approach has created the conditions under which the European Union has completed large-scale investment projects in solar energy, providing more than 50% of electricity generation from RES in many member states. Actually, such changes affected the fact that the average price of electricity in the EU for household consumers during the current year was about 12.67 hryvnias/kWh, which is equivalent to approximately 0.29 euros/kWh at the exchange rate of 43.85 hryvnias for 1 euro . Despite the development of network infrastructure and the decentralization of power systems, blackouts have occurred in various parts of the world this year. The most common cause is natural disasters, in particular In the United States, powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico region caused damage to energy infrastructure, especially in the states of Louisiana and Texas. At the same time, in Southeast Asia, typhoons caused power outages in the Philippines and Vietnam. The stability of energy supply this year has been affected by extreme heat, for example in the EU and Asia, abnormal heat waves led to an increase in electricity consumption for air conditioning, which caused local blackouts in Italy, France and India. Secondly, the short-term disconnection of consumers from electricity was caused by cyber-attacks, for example in the USA there were outages due to external influences on the IT infrastructure of electricity grid operators. Third, technical failure and wear and tear of networks. For example, the Republic of South Africa continued to suffer from large-scale blackouts due to the failure of the state-owned energy company Eskom to ensure stable grid operation. Periodic -load-shedding- (planned outages) have become part of everyday life. A similar situation took place in Pakistan, in early 2024, a large-scale failure in the national power grid left more than 200 million people without electricity. The stability of energy networks was also affected by the sufficiency of primary energy carriers, for example, in Cuba there was an energy crisis due to a lack of fuel and wear and tear of thermal power plant nodes. Fourth, military conflicts. One such example, the escalation of conflicts in the Middle East region has affected the power systems of Syria, Lebanon and, in part, Israel, causing power outages. Fifth, high demand and unpreparedness for a full energy transition from fossil to renewable energy sources. In the first quarter of 2024, cold weather and delays in renewable energy sources (such as insufficient wind for wind farms) caused short-term blackouts in selected regions such as Germany and Poland. In the past year, Russia has continued to commit war crimes, having carried out 13 massive attacks on energy infrastructure facilities in Ukraine. According to various calculations, the enemy used more than 1,200 rockets to carry out these crimes alone, causing damages of $56.2 billion. One of the largest attacks occurred on August 26, 2024, when the aggressor used 236 drones and missiles. In general, the Kremlin's war crimes against the energy infrastructure of Ukraine were aimed at creating a humanitarian crisis, undermining the economy and reducing the defense capability of our state. Despite these actions, thanks to international support, the prompt restoration of damaged facilities and the resilience of fellow citizens, Ukraine's energy system continues to function even in the face of large-scale challenges. Russian war crimes must be condemned both at the international (International Criminal Court, UN International Court of Justice, European Court of Human Rights) and national levels. In the next year, the sanctions pressure on the aggressor should be significantly increased for several reasons. First of all, the aggressor is the biggest threat to global energy security, as in particular it actively uses sophisticated schemes of transshipment of oil at sea, -shadow flotillas- and hides the final destination of cargoes to avoid sanctions. However, unfortunately, not all countries or companies comply with the sanctions due to difficulties in verifying supply chains and a lack of strict controls. Along with this, China, India, Turkey and other countries of the Global South have not joined the sanctions regime and are taking advantage of reduced prices for Russian resources, providing the aggressor with financial opportunities for a war against the democratic world. It is clear that there is insufficient pressure associated with Russia's adaptation to sanctions and the lack of a unified global approach to countering its energy expansion. Increased control and the establishment of secondary measures of influence on companies and countries that help the aggressor to circumvent restrictions can increase the effectiveness of sanctions. In addition, in the next year, the role of the aggressor in the energy security of the world should be reduced, in particular by imposing sanctions and introducing new political restrictions on the nuclear fuel market. Energy security in 2025 will remain a multidimensional challenge and will depend on geopolitical stability, adaptation to climate change and the pace of innovation. Countries investing in the diversification of energy sources, decarbonization and strengthening of infrastructure will have an advantage in ensuring the stability of energy supply. 1. Reducing dependence on fossil fuels, increasing the role of nuclear energy. 2. Intensification of competition for resources 3. Diversification of energy supply and infrastructure development. 4. Digitization of the energy industry. 5. Environmental policy.

- Occupant cutter - near Kurakhov: ArmyInform report from the position of one unit of drones	Correspondents of ArmiyaInform managed to get to the positions of one of the units of FPV drones of the 148th separate artillery brigade of the Zhytomyr DSHV of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and record one day of heavy combat work of our drones. Get to the positions in the Kurakhovo district &#8211; it is always risky and dangerous. Night, the moon in the sky is breaking through the clouds, our car is moving towards the front line, the rumble of explosions is getting louder. We leave the car in the -hideout- and get into the unit's pickup, which is equipped with a REBU device. It has begun to dawn a little, the traditional -sirak- is the safest time to leave. We drive on broken roads. The paratrooper-driver begins to turn on the red switches one by one. This is REB, because where we are going, there is, unfortunately, a lot of enemy deadly debris flying. A settlement can be seen on the horizon. We drive closer, the picture is depressing: everywhere destroyed houses, torn down fences, cut with splinters of wood, in a word all around -complete desolation-. Let's go further. We stop near the plantation, the car leaves us while it is still dark, and we quickly go to the dugout, which is well camouflaged from the outside. A few steps underground, then the door, and the positions of our drones are hidden there. From here, it is only a few kilometers to reach the Katsap troops. In the dugout, everything is arranged so that our guys have work as comfortably as possible. Excavated room 3 by 4 m: operator area (pilot and gunner), place of miner who charges drones with ammunition and place for coffee break. There is a narrow passage between the self-made work table and the couch, there is also a small bench, and the ammunition boxes are used as chests. In general, everything here is very practical and ascetic. There are no extra things, only things that will definitely come in handy for the boys. -The days when you could drive a car along the -front- are long gone. Now the drones are hunting a single rashist and he cannot evade, &#8211; says Yuriy, the commander of the FPV-drone unit with the call sign -Sparta-. &#8211; Look here (Yuri shows a video on a smartphone - author): this is video evidence from the front, where our crew attacks the invaders in the middle of the field, under trees, in houses, now you can get the enemy almost everywhere. The occupiers will not hide anywhere from us. On the right in the dugout we see already charged drones standing ready. The boys prepare them in advance. The military uses FPV drones as a kamikaze drone with various combat parts and to drop ammunition on the enemy with the subsequent return of the drone. For each target there is a drop: there are shrapnel (grenades or other explosive surprises) for enemy manpower , -cumulatives-, incendiary ammunition and -bombs- for enemy equipment and defensive fortifications. Weather conditions significantly affect the operation of drones: cold, rain or strong wind make flights difficult. The duty of the UAV operator is to be ready for such tests. Regarding the tactics of the Russian Federation in the Kurakhiv direction. The enemy attacks both in small infantry groups, and in some places uses BMP, armored personnel carriers, motorcycles, buggies. The guys say: armored vehicles are mostly used at a considerable distance from the battle line, for logistics or rotations. The enemy is trying to quickly drop the landing party and escape from the affected area. But our drones get the Rashists there too. Each meter of the enemy's advance is very expensive. Usually ordinary Russian infantrymen go on assaults. This is the tactic of -bloody collective suicides.- Using the topography of the area, the invaders advance in small groups of 5-8 people. Armed only with assault rifles, another group of Rashists is already 50-60 meters behind them. They carry BC, some have machine guns, they are accompanied by drones. So, the first group of -suicides- lands on Ukrainian soil almost immediately. Our FPV drones instantly destroy the bodies of Muscovites. Then other rashists climb over their corpses. The picture is almost the same, the occupiers are also destroyed. Some try to escape from our drones, but they don't succeed for long. Small enemy assault groups especially try to infiltrate in the morning &#8211; -gray- when the weather is foggy. That's when our reconnaissance drones can't always work effectively. -Sometimes one gets the impression that the occupiers are high. They do not pay attention to our resets, move chaotically, but continue to break through to our positions. There are days when the enemy moves without stopping and suffers simply incredible losses. Once we destroyed up to 80 rashists in one full day of combat work. Perhaps there were more of them, of course, no one counted them. The human resource of the Russian Federation is unlimited. People are just meat for the Kremlin and there is no such price that the Russian people would not pay for the destruction of Ukraine. Rashists will continue to climb, and we have to stop them,- &#8211; says the commander of the unit Yuriy. Yuriy from Volyn, former commander of the BM-21 -Grad-. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the Russian Federation mobilized the 95th separate assault-assault Polish brigade. He was the commander of an airborne assault unit, he was seriously wounded in battle. It happened in the Izyum direction in the village of Dovgenke during an enemy assault. The shrapnel tore the back and arm, severed the nerves in the arm and the arm did not work normally. He underwent treatment and rehabilitation, according to the conclusion of the VLK, he could receive a disability group. But he refused to undergo MSEK. The man says: -I will beat the occupiers until Victory.- He was an instructor in the 95th brigade, then transferred to the rocket artillery unit of the 148th artillery brigade. They carried out combat missions in the Zaporozhye direction. Somehow, for almost a week, the -Grad- of paratroopers did not go into combat, then Yuriy was asked to become the driver of the UAV unit for that time. -. I tried it, it went in and started working on -maviks-. He studied on the go, -on combat-. There was reconnaissance all the time in Zaporozhye, we worked without resets, there were quite intense actions, storming of enemy positions, there were a lot of flights in a day. And when they moved to the Donetsk direction, they began to work against the enemy already with discounts. Then switched to an FPV drone and never regretted it. There is more emotion and drive here,- &#8211; says Yuri -Sparta-. ...Finally dawn, combat work begins. The boys are told by walkie-talkie that the Russian infantry is advancing, supported by tanks and armored vehicles. Commander Yuri commands -before the battle.- Everyone takes their position. -Sparta- works as an operator, takes the control panel, puts on glasses, and the gunner -Tarantino- instantly fills in the coordinates of the target on the tablet, displays the video broadcast on the monitor, makes a report on readiness for departure. Miner Yevgeny on the call sign -Johnny - with a drone, which is equipped with ammunition, comes out of the shelter, puts the -bird- in position. He removes the fuse, and not a few minutes pass as the drone flies into the sky to bring justice to the occupiers. By the way, -Johnny- worked as a driver of the Kyiv subway until February 24, 2022. On the first day of the invasion, I took the minibus to work from Vasylkovo to Kyiv as usual. The metro has been working since 2010. It is very interesting to watch the work of the crew, they act as one mechanism, guide the drone to the target. After a few minutes, we can already see the plantation. An enemy tank was lurking 7-8 kilometers away, and it is the goal of the operation. As it turned out, the EW works on it, this is a problem, the connection is lost for a few seconds, the screen flickers, the video from the drone has disappeared. for afforestation. The guys managed to set up the broadcast quickly. The barely noticeable movements of the pilot's fingers are conjuring over the drone control panel, the tension on Sparta's face is clear, we can see the next maneuver to defeat. -Fpvishka- flies to the tank. Boom! The video has disappeared, and we are all overjoyed. The commander gives the command - -launch the next drone.- It is necessary to check whether the enemy tank is on fire. A few minutes later, on video, we see the Katsap tank on fire. And this means that the work was carried out meticulously. -We were lucky today. Usually, we spend more time and drones on such a -fat- target as a tank,- &#8211; says -Sparta-. We ask: how many attacks by drones on the enemy can usually be made in a working day? -It depends on the actions of the enemy. If there are assaults, we can make up to 20 sorties. The other day, during the Russian offensive, there were 19 sorties in one day. When needed, drones are brought to us additionally, there is no such thing as a lack of drones, we always have enough and that makes me happy. After defeating the equipment, we can burn one unit of the enemy's combat equipment in one day of work, sometimes we manage to destroy 3-5 units. It depends primarily on the work of their REB. And it is possible not to impress anything in terms of technique. Then we work in small assault groups,- &#8211; notes the gunner of the FPV drone -Tarantino-. Russians actively use EW tools to suppress the operation of our drones. We do the same. The -combat of frequencies- occurs constantly. During flights, we try to quickly switch to other frequencies when we see that the enemy is suppressing our -video picture-. Of course, there are -own chips- that the enemy does not know about. This helps us a lot in destroying racist targets. In general, shooting down an FPV drone with small arms is extremely unlikely, it is very maneuverable. It is also important not to -burn- your positions. Drone crew for the occupiers &#8211; priority goal. He is constantly looking for our location. As we are theirs. Somehow, one of our points was -burned- by the Rashisti, and we were then covered with artillery for more than 5 hours. They started around 11:30 a.m. and finished around 5:00 p.m. They fired cannons, covered with mortar fire, even the tank was working. Fortunately, the shells landed next to the dugout. Survived We waited until it got a little dark, collected all the things, the car arrived and we quickly left the position,- &#8211; the guys say. We ask: how often do you have to change positions? -During this month, we moved a lot. It all also depends on the intensity of the enemy's assault actions. In autumn, for example, we worked at one point for more than a month,- &#8211; says -Tarantino-. … Evening. We say goodbye to the boys and leave the positions of our drones -in the dark- in cars. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/okupantoriz-pid-kurahovym-reportazh-armiyainform-z-pozycziyi-odnogo-pidrozdilu-dronariv/	2024-12-31T20:55:18-08:00
Armored vehicle of a united Europe: what is known about the project of a joint system of armored veh...	As reported by portal of German broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW), four EU member states - Finland, Latvia, Sweden and Germany, will implement the project on the common system of armored vehicles (Common Armored Vehicle System, CAVS) - the purchase of modern armored personnel carriers for the protected transportation of troops, ArmiyaInform reports. In general, as DW reporters note, the purchase of new armored personnel carriers for the armies of the above-mentioned EU countries is part of a large defense project implemented within the framework of the European Instrument for Strengthening the Defense Industry through Joint Procurement (EDIRPA). The EDIRPA program is a short-term instrument adopted after the start of Russia's aggression against Ukraine and designed for the period until 2025 with the aim of stimulating cooperation in the field of the most urgent defense goods, the EU emphasizes. -The program supports the purchase of defense equipment by the armed forces of EU member states and Norway. The EDIRPA budget does not pay for defense products, but compensates member states for additional administrative costs associated with joint procurement,- stated in the notification of the European Commission. As for the direct implementation of the armored vehicle project within the CAVS (Common Armored Vehicle System), according to the experts of the defense site Army Recognition it is aimed at supporting the joint acquisition of modern 6x6 armored vehicles as part of a multinational program for the development, procurement and life cycle management of modern armored vehicles. This project builds on the similar capacity needs of participating states, thus creating a basis for enhanced cooperation and added value. The CAVS program has already activated serial production of 6×6 wheeled armored vehicles in Europe and continues to build production capacity on the continent. The project is directly supported by four organizations from EU member states: the Defense Forces of Finland, the Ministry of Defense of Latvia, the Swedish Defense Assets Administration and the German Bundeswehr. The initiative receives a maximum EU contribution of €60 million under the EDIRPA instrument for 2024. The main goal of the CAVS project is to develop and produce a common armored vehicle optimized for protected troop transport that meets the diverse operational needs of participating nations. This machine will integrate advanced technologies to provide reliable protection against ballistic threats, mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Its modular design will allow the vehicle to be adapted for various tasks, such as troop transport, medical evacuation, logistical support, reconnaissance and combat operations. In addition, its high mobility, which is ensured by a design adapted to difficult terrains and optimized off-road capabilities, will ensure high autonomy of the BBM in difficult conditions. The CAVS project also aims to promote a standardization approach that will reduce the current fragmentation of military equipment in the European Union. By opting for a shared vehicle, participating states will benefit from economies of scale through centralized production and coordinated maintenance. This standardization will also contribute to increased interoperability between the armed forces of different countries, facilitating joint operations and materiel exchange. In addition, the project will support the European defense industry by promoting the development and production of the vehicle in the EU, thus contributing to the strengthening of Europe's autonomy in this strategic area. The development of CAVS is also consistent with the broader context of strengthening European strategic sovereignty, particularly highlighted by geopolitical tensions related to Russia's aggression against Ukraine. This large-scale invasion highlighted the need to modernize the EU's military capabilities and reduce its dependence on external suppliers. It is within this dynamic that the EU has decided to invest heavily in projects such as CAVS, symbolizing a commitment to strengthening collective defense capabilities while defending sovereignty in the face of external challenges. Once developed and deployed, the CAVS armored vehicle will not only enhance the operational capabilities of the four member states, but will also create a common standard for future cooperation between EU member states. This project is a key step towards a more integrated and sustainable European defense capable of addressing current and future strategic challenges in a coherent and coordinated manner. As part of the international Common Armored Vehicles System (CAVS) program, the Finnish defense company Patria, about whose armored wheeled products our editors repeatedly told in its materials, will be the main contractor if Germany decides to buy machines from this manufacturer. Patria will lead the design and development of the system, while DSL in Freizen and FFG at its units in Flensburg (FFG) and Kirchen (JWT) will provide local design, manufacturing and life cycle support in Germany. Along with the start of more detailed preparations for localization, the production team will also involve other German companies to work on the program. It is interesting that the machine developed under the CAVS project can be based on a proven platform such as Patria 6×6, which is already used by several European armies. This armored vehicle, produced by the Finnish company Patria, is known for its reliability, modularity and ability to perform a wide range of tasks, making it the ideal basis for a European standardization project. The Patria 6×6 provides excellent protection against ballistic threats and mines, while being able to overcome difficult terrain thanks to its independent suspension and high off-road mobility. In addition, its modularity allows the vehicle to be easily adapted for different tasks, such as troop transport, armored ambulance, or even configurations for command or reconnaissance missions. By choosing an already proven and widely used platform, the EU could accelerate CAVS development using existing technology and materiel, thus easing the transition to a common armored vehicle for its armed forces. The goal of the CAVS program is to develop a 6×6 armored system to meet the needs of participating nations. Sweden joined the CAVS program in 2022, followed by Germany in 2023. Finland has ordered 164 armored personnel carriers (APCs) under the project, and also signed an agreement on vehicles HAPC (Heavy Armored Personnel Carrier), intended for crisis management situations Latvia, which has participated in the program since its inception, has ordered more than 200 APCs and recently signed a contract for 56 C2 vehicles (Patria 6×6 command-and-control). Last spring, Sweden signed an agreement to supply a total of 321 CAVS armored vehicles. Patria 6×6 stands out for its modularity, which allows it to be adapted to various military and security tasks. It can be configured for troop transport, designed to accommodate 10 fully equipped soldiers, or for medical evacuation via an ambulance module equipped with stretchers and patient stabilization equipment. The BBM can also serve as a mobile command post, combining advanced communications systems and workstations for strategic operations. Performing the role of logistical support, it can transport up to 8.5 thousand kg of equipment with the possibility of integrating a transport crane. To perform combat missions, it can be equipped with a remotely controlled turret, anti-tank missiles or air defense systems. Its reconnaissance capabilities include optical and infrared sensors, surveillance radars and even airborne tactical drones. Finally, technical support configurations allow for maintenance and towing of damaged vehicles. This versatility makes the Patria 6×6 an essential platform to meet the diverse needs of European armed forces while increasing interoperability and effectiveness.

Autocivilka for UBD: what will change in 2025	If previously combatants were exempted from mandatory civil liability insurance, then from now on you need to issue a civil liability insurance. In particular, Article 13 of the Law suffered certain changes. And now there are no categories of citizens who are exempt from compulsory insurance. In return, combatants will receive a discount. In particular, for them, -the amount of the insurance premium under the domestic insurance contract is reduced by 50 percent.- But there are also certain nuances. The discount is provided for a vehicle that has an engine displacement of up to 2500 cubic centimeters or an electric motor power of up to and including 100 kilowatts and is owned by a combatant /strong>, provided that such vehicle is driven exclusively by the insured or by a person who also owns to preferential categories, and using a vehicle without the purpose of providing paid services for the transportation of passengers and/or cargo. Another important nuance — the amendments to the Law indicate that the reduction of the insurance premium can be applied simultaneously only regarding one vehicle of the insured.

Liquidation of MSEK: How a serviceman can get the status of a person with a disability in 2025	In Ukraine, there are no more medical and social expert commissions (MSEK) that established disability statuses. In their place, expert teams will work to assess the daily functioning of a person, created at health care institutions. The Ministry of Health notes that the path to disability status will be much easier for a person, as most processes will be shortened and digitized. And all evaluation stages will be recorded in the electronic system. And what will change for the military? ArmyInform tells what military personnel must do to obtain the status of a person with a disability. And also who needs to be re-evaluated. If an injury or illness significantly limits the functioning of a serviceman, he may be referred to a facility with expert teams to assess daily functioning, clarifies the Ministry of Health. This can be done by the attending physician or the head of the VLK. At the same time, there is no need to wait 120 days from the moment of injury. After stabilization of the serviceman's state of health, the head of the VLK has the opportunity to immediately form an electronic referral for the assessment of daily functioning. The evaluation is carried out by an expert team of doctors who specialize in determining the degree of limitation of a person's functioning due to injuries or diseases. The expert team works on the basis of multidisciplinary healthcare institutions. The doctor and the serviceman can choose a medical facility together from the list available in the electronic system for daily functioning assessment. The choice depends on the serviceman's place of stay, as well as the chosen form of evaluation: The evaluation of daily functioning must be carried out within up to 30 days from the moment of submission of the electronic referral by the head of the VLK. The administrator of the health care facility where the expert team works must review the submitted case within 5 days from the moment of receiving the referral to either put the case in the queue and the system will determine the date and time of the evaluation, or return the case for revision due to inaccuracies. If the case is added to the queue, the serviceman will receive a notification via e-mail (his or a representative's e-mail) about the form, time and place of the assessment. If there is no e-mail, the information will be sent by registered mail to the military serviceman's physical address. The expert team analyzes the documents, and in the case of face-to-face, remote or on-site assessment, conducts an additional review or examination. Attention is paid to the degree of functional impairment, the impact of the injury or disease on daily activities, as well as the need for social support or rehabilitation. Based on the obtained results, the expert team must make a decision on the establishment of disability, determine the terms of re-evaluation (if necessary), and must provide recommendations for rehabilitation. The decision will be entered into the electronic system, and the serviceman will receive a copy of it by e-mail or, if necessary, in printed form. The document will also be available in the electronic office of the referring physician for evaluation. All data will be transferred to social security authorities responsible for further assistance. On the basis of the adopted decision, the serviceman may: The serviceman may appeal the decision of the expert team. To do this, you need to submit a complaint to the Center for Assessing the Functional State of a Person. Considering the large number of fakes of enemy propaganda, in particular, that from January 1, people with disabilities will be mobilized due to the fact that MSEKs were liquidated, and instead special commissions will cancel previously received statuses, the Ministry of Health emphasizes: -all people who have the status of disability continue to receive benefits, services, assistance and, in particular, deferment from mobilization, on the basis of the conclusion of the SCEC during its period of validity-. The Ministry of Health also clarified who and when should undergo repeated examinations: 1) all those who have limitations in daily functioning, i.e. legal grounds for the status of disability, will be evaluated by an expert team of medical practitioners within the prescribed period; 2) if the disability is established indefinitely, it is not necessary to pass the assessment, only at your own request: all benefits, guarantees and payments remain in force; 3) if a person during the years 2022-2024 had to undergo a re-examination, but could not undergo it for good reasons and in accordance with the exceptions provided for in the legislation during the martial law, then it will be necessary to undergo it: men aged 25-60 from 2 or 3 by the disability group - until November 1, 2025; to all other patients by April 1, 2026. Exceptions are the impossibility of re-examination for the following reasons: people are in hostilities or temporarily occupied territories; patients with severe disorders of body functions (do not have a limb or any of the paired organs, cannot hear or see, have an oncological or mental illness); active servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations - for them, the disability status remains valid during the period of military service and within 60 days from the date of discharge from service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/likvidacziya-msek-yak-vijskovosluzhbovczyu-otrymaty-status-lyudyny-z-invalidnistyu-v-2025-roczi/	2024-12-31T20:12:46-08:00
Propagandists cry about the flow of refugees from Ukraine: the border guards reassure	The border guards reassure: there is no outflow from Ukraine, the usual Christmas and New Year traffic. The border service of Poland recorded the traditional increase in traffic, which occurs every year during the New Year holidays, said the spokesman of the -Richka Bug- border unit Dariusz Senicki, who quotes edition PAP. The highest traffic on the Polish-Ukrainian border is usually recorded in the summer, when Ukrainians travel through Poland on vacation, and also during Christmas, when many Ukrainians return to their families in Ukraine. Since December 20, longer queues than usual began to form at the border with Ukraine, but traffic is evenly distributed in both directions, with a predominance of departures from Poland. The peak day was December 22, when almost 89,000 Ukrainian citizens crossed the Polish-Ukrainian border, but most of them, almost 49,000, left Poland. The spokesman emphasizes that the figure of 150,000 citizens of Ukraine, who allegedly want to enter Poland, has not been recorded at the border for a single day. So the report about the so-called -escape of Ukrainians- is a deliberate misinformation of the Kremlin, which serves to incite panic in Ukraine and anti-Ukrainian sentiment among Poles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/propagandysty-volayut-pro-potik-bizhencziv-z-ukrayiny-prykordonnyky-zaspokoyuyut/	2024-12-31T20:00:04-08:00
Rustem Umyerov: 2024 was full of challenges, but at the same time it showed how strong we are	ArmyInform provides the full text of the greeting. -Dear Ukrainians! 2024 was full of challenges, but at the same time it showed how strong we are. Together we have come a long way and achieved significant success. We have moved the hostilities to the territory of the enemy, and the long-range operations of Ukrainian drones reach the most distant points of the aggressor country. We have prepared a Victory Plan and have a clear understanding of what needs to be done together with our partners to achieve success. This year, Ukraine laid the foundation for the creation of the army of the future — Future Force. In cooperation with partners, we have built 8 coalitions of capabilities to support our state. This format of working with allies this year ensured a significant strengthening of our army, in particular, in aviation. F16s in Ukrainian skies are already successfully attacking the enemy and repelling enemy missiles. The next step is the French Mirage in Ukraine. We have moved to long-term planning for years ahead to strengthen our power on land, sea and air. It is important that working in coalitions strengthens Ukraine's compatibility with NATO and brings us closer to membership in the Alliance. We launched the process of digitalization of the Defense Forces, so that our army would be even more effective, and state structures would be faster and more transparent. Army+, Reserve+, our Ukrainian Delta have already become revolutionary products in the world. Ukraine attracted record financing for its own defense production - more than 5 billion dollars. The result of the rapid development of domestic industry is drones and missiles that are already hitting targets thousands of kilometers from our border. We have produced and delivered more than 1.5 million drones to our soldiers. Through joint efforts with our allies, we have systematically strengthened our defense capabilities. We attracted 10 countries to finance the Ukrainian defense industry, now it is more than 2.6 billion dollars for 2024 and 2025. And this number is constantly growing, and the number of partners is increasing. In the state budget for defense in 2025, the government laid down a whopping 2.23 trillion hryvnias. These funds will be fully directed to the support of our soldiers and the development of the Defense Forces. We will spend UAH 739 billion on the purchase of weapons and military equipment, and another UAH 55 billion on the modernization of Ukrainian industry. We aim to make the budget for next year a budget for changes on the battlefield. I sincerely thank our military, volunteers, medics, engineers - everyone who is working to defeat the Russian invaders. Eternal memory to the heroes who paid the highest price for the freedom of Ukraine. We do not forget those who meet the new year in occupation and in captivity. We will make every effort to free everyone from Russian oppression. May the new year be bright for all of Ukraine.

The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces congratulated the soldiers on the New Year: Thanks to you...	ArmyInform provides the full text of the greeting. -Dear brothers-in-arms and sisters-in-arms! Happy New Year 2025! Thank you for this year of fierce and uncompromising struggle! And thank you for the independence of Ukraine, which we preserve thanks to your strength. The eleventh year of Russian aggression against Ukraine is coming to an end. And for the third year, Russian troops tried to -take Kyiv in three days-, and some already wanted to see Ukraine erased from the political map of the world, and our people - destroyed. All of them underestimated the strength of Ukrainians — our heroic people, of whom one can only be proud. In 2024, we managed to stop the enemy's offensive in Kharkiv Oblast and protect Sumy Oblast from capture. The enemy wanted to create his -buffer zone- on our land, but we prevented this and began to return the war to where it came from - to Russian territory. I want to especially mention all our units, all our soldiers who perform combat tasks in Kurshchyna: guys, thank you! Thank you to everyone who fights in the most brutal areas of Donetsk region, to everyone who defends Zaporizhzhia and Kherson region. Thank you to each of our soldiers who destroys the occupier and chooses life for Ukraine. This year, the Russians paid the highest price for the war against Ukraine, because our army and all our Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine destroyed more enemy equipment and manpower than in any of the previous years of the war. We defend our state. Ukraine must preserve its life and independence. And win an honest peace for yourself. What Ukraine definitely deserves. We will never forget all our boys, all girls, each and every one who gave his life for the sake of Ukraine. I bow my head, honoring every warrior, every fallen hero. War dictates its difficult realities. But YOU, Ukrainian soldiers, YOUR bravery and resilience inspire all our Ukrainian people and fill the hearts of Ukrainians with faith. We have to win. We must preserve Ukraine and independence. Let 2025 be the time to realize our goal. I wish all our soldiers and their relatives health, warmth, comfort and a quick meeting — at home, with victory and in peace. Happy New Year!

This was reported by /a> Deputy Minister of Defense for Digitization Kateryna Chernogorenko In this way, she commented on the changes, which provide for the simplification of the mechanism of obtaining officer ranks for soldiers and sergeants with combat experience. Kateryna Chernogorenko noted that an officer rank will be assigned simultaneously with the appointment. For this, servicemen no longer need to undergo a military training course under the officer training program and do not need to enter into a contract for military service. -Why is it important? Many strong specialists were mobilized to the army. After vast experience in management positions. After dozens of implemented projects. Previously, without an officer's education, they could only hold soldier positions. We must replenish the army with professional personnel and give managers with great experience all the opportunities for development. The army must be technological and modern,- explained Kateryna Chernogorenko.

Members of the Russian intelligence network who helped launch strikes on the Armed Forces received 1...	This was reported by the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor's Office. Prosecutors proved that in July 2022, employees of the FSB of the Russian Federation offered so-called confidential cooperation to a citizen of Ukraine who had been in the territory of the aggressor state for four months. Supporting the Kremlin regime, the man agreed to establish an agent network in Ukraine to collect intelligence on the whereabouts of our defenders. To implement the criminal plan of the enemy, he involved an acquaintance from Kharkiv, who has been living in Moscow since 2014. The latter, in turn, took an equally -ideological- colleague from the city as his assistant. Druzhkivka, who is already serving a 12-year prison sentence. Following his instructions, the recruited -reconnaissance officer- sought out the locations of personnel, checkpoints, fortified areas, and firing positions of Ukrainian servicemen. At the same time, he added fragments of maps, coordinates of buildings, trenches, trenches and other fortifications to the messages. The agents paid special attention to the places of concentration of equipment of the units of the Defense Forces in the Kramatorsk district. They also gave a -task- to the man to report on the consequences of shelling to adjust the fire by the Russian troops.

The enemy forced Ukrainian children to give gifts to the occupiers	This is reported by a> Center of national resistance. Elementary school children in a number of captured schools of the occupied Kherson region were forced to make -garlands- for the occupiers and write poems. At the same time, parents had to rush to buy gifts for the fighters of the Soviet Union. Of course, propagandists highlight this as the desire of the children themselves. In this way, the enemy uses children for its own purposes, and at the same time tries to change their self-identification, heroizing the occupiers. We remind you that on temporarily occupied territories, the Russians conducted another wave of confiscation of cars from the civilian population.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/31/vorog-zmusyv-ukrayinskyh-ditej-skydatysya-na-podarunky-okupantam/	2024-12-30T21:56:38-08:00

Colombian-style action: a report from Donetsk region about the training of foreign volunteers	ArmyInform visited the training of foreign volunteers in one of the front-line cities in Donetsk region. What we see in the empty dilapidated building, which was once a multi-story building, resembles the shooting of an action episode of an expensive Hollywood blockbuster about special forces. Silhouettes of fighters with weapons at the ready emerge from the empty window openings of the building, which is divided into numerous rooms and corridors. Shouts in Spanish and simulated gunshots are heard. From time to time, the soldiers, at the command of the instructor, stop and listen to the remarks. After that, they change roles and return to their starting positions to play the scene, that is, to practice the exercise again. Instructor -Hulk- acts like an experienced director, repeating the same scene take after take to get it as close as possible to the ideal. The movements of the fighting actors are precise and lightning-fast, but he notices flaws and demands perfection. — We work out the approach to the house, cleaning the building, moving, -cutting- corners with a change of hands. That is, we go to the right corner, to the left corner and enter so that the enemy does not notice you, but you see him first, he explains. Moving through the building, the fighters seem to -fence- with automatic weapons, covering corners and quickly changing hands on the pistol grip and forend. Those waiting for them in the next room do not see the threat until a conditional shot is fired. This means that the enemy is destroyed before he had time to react in any way to the coordinated actions of the fighters. After that, the -actors- change roles and -play the scene- again - the repetition continues several times. — When you approach one corner and are comfortable from the left, the machine shifts to the left shoulder. When we need to clear another corner, we transfer the machine gun to the right shoulder, -Hulk- explains the essence of the exercise. He praises the foreign fighters, saying that they are motivated and responsible, ready to learn and want to do it, always listen carefully to the instructor and conscientiously do what is required. - Some of them have experience of military service and participation in hostilities, but for modern warfare, they are not enough, so they are constantly studying. There has never been such a war and no one has such experience, the military officer explains. The weapons of the volunteers from Colombia, who practice storming and clearing the building, are still unfamiliar to the Ukrainian eye. This is a CZ BREN 2 assault rifle, which has already proven itself as a reliable machine gun. Working with BREN 2 from Česká zbrojovka is easier and more convenient than with the usual AK-74. A high degree of modularity allows you to quickly adjust the machine to a specific fighter and task. - BREN 2 is a very good machine gun. It has been with us in the Legion since 2024 and has already proven itself to be extremely reliable and accurate. Compared to the AK-74, it is like the Mercedes of 2020 versus the Zhiguli of the 1970s. There were never any problems with it - no delays, no sticking - the instructor praises the weapon. Some of the fighters have additional front handles, sights, silencers installed. The BREN 2 makes it easy to do this, making the assault rifle even more convenient and versatile. Among the advantages of BREN 2, one can also count the caliber 5.56 × 45 mm for the standard service rifle cartridge for NATO forces. The instructor says that in a little more than a year, infantry tactics on the battlefield in urban areas have changed very significantly due to the proliferation of drop-bomber drones and kamikaze FPV drones. - They are like flies everywhere now. Therefore, the tactics of approaching the buildings, accumulating strength before the assault, have changed. If earlier it was possible to storm in eights or fours, now we act only in twos. Because where more than two fighters gather at the same time, something is guaranteed to fly, -Hulk- explains. Now, when smaller forces have to fight a more numerous, well-prepared and well-secured enemy, the level of training of fighters plays an important role. — We need to defeat a strong opponent with smaller forces. And whoever says that the Russians are stupid and do not know anything, do not understand anything, is deeply mistaken. We are fighting a very skilled enemy who learns quickly, he says. Therefore, now, he is convinced, it is necessary to learn faster and better than the enemy, to pay as much attention as possible to training. It is for this reason that when leaving their positions for rest, the fighters of the 2nd International Legion are always training, improving their skills and learning new techniques. -Hulk- tells about new methods of combating enemy drones, which have begun to be implemented in the unit and have already proven their high efficiency. — We practice working with 12-gauge, that is, with smooth-bore rifles that shoot shot. -Through trial and research, we have selected the numbers of meal that are the most effective,- says the instructor. In most cases, destroying an enemy UAV at such a distance is safe for the fighter, even if the drone explodes in the air. Therefore, the main task is to spot the enemy aircraft in time. In view of this, one of the skills that fighters practice is observing the airspace of the battlefield. — I started doing this when I was in the Serebrian Forest last winter. When a real influx of enemy drones began, something had to be done urgently about it, and there were very few anti-drone guns. Smoothbore rifles with shot became a good solution, recalls the soldier. Now he implements this experience also in the 2nd International Legion, and Colombians and other foreigners are happy to learn it. After all, constant training, training and innovation on the battlefield is the way not only to survival, but also to victory over the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/31/ekshn-po-kolumbijsky-reportazh-z-donechchyny-pro-pidgotovku-inozemnyh-dobrovolcziv/	2024-12-30T20:48:42-08:00
They will deal with it without a person: French engineers have created an unmanned all-terrain vehic...	As informs the Zone Militaire portal, the HE 441 is a small all-terrain vehicle of the Fardier/mule type (Fardier /mule, Fardier is an old French military term for a wheelbarrow used to transport heavy artillery, but this designation was later adopted in France and for all-terrain vehicles, ed.), designed according to the 4×4 scheme, which can be remotely controlled and/or move autonomously, ArmyInform notes. The key -feature- of the new machine of the company Soframe is not its high maneuverability and modular design, but the HELNA-P laser installation from Cilas, capable of shooting down fast-flying drones. In turn, the experts of the defense portal Army Recognition, who investigated the new product, claim that the HE441 off-road robot was created for the army work on various and difficult terrains, has a light but strong construction that allows it to move over uneven areas and off-road at high speeds. This mobility, combined with an open cockpit, allows the self-driving vehicle to function as a multi-purpose platform suitable for rapid deployment in high-stakes combat scenarios. The open cab layout provides flexibility, allowing operators to load the vehicle with special equipment, including weapons systems, communications or sensor arrays. With such modular upgrades, the HE441 all-terrain vehicle can be adapted to meet a wide range of defense mission requirements, from reconnaissance and troop transport to convoy protection and direct armed support. An important aspect of JNI's demonstration of the HE441 was its integration with the HELMA-P laser weapon system, an advanced anti-drone technology developed by Cilas. This laser-based anti-drone solution reflects the growing need for advanced countermeasures against the use of UAVs for surveillance, reconnaissance and even offensive attacks. Thanks to the HELMA-P system, the HE441 ground unmanned vehicle is capable of providing precise non-kinetic engagement of enemy drones, using high-energy laser beams to disable or destroy critical drone components. This allows ground forces to respond quickly to air threats without the use of conventional munitions, making the system cost-effective and sustainable for long-term operations. Thanks to the high-energy HELMA-P device, the ground robot HE441 turns into a mobile defense vehicle that moves. This mobility is critical because it allows infantry units to carry anti-drone equipment wherever they go, rather than relying on fixed or stationary air defense systems. Traditional anti-aircraft measures may be limited against small, fast-moving drones. And HELMA-P's fast laser targeting closes this gap, neutralizing drones silently and with minimal collateral damage. This silent strike capability is especially valuable for infantry and reconnaissance teams operating in sensitive areas where stealth is essential. The peculiar symbiosis of the HE441 unmanned mobile platform and the high-energy HELMA-P system represents a significant advance in modern combat readiness. Their combination offers a tailored solution to the rapidly changing threats faced by military forces, especially as drones become increasingly common in combat arsenals. For infantry units, the ability to move with a mobile anti-drone solution increases both security and operational flexibility, as they can respond to enemy UAVs in real-time without the delays or limitations of traditional stationary defenses. This combination is also economical. Unlike projectile-based anti-drone systems, which can incur significant costs due to ammunition consumption, the laser-based HELMA-P can neutralize multiple kamikaze drone threats with minimal resource expenditure. This system is designed not only for current needs on the battlefield, but also to adapt to the rapidly changing demands of modern warfare. HE441 tactical all-terrain drone.

The enemy is manipulating the numbers again: only the estimates are Chinese	Yes, at least since April 2024, seemingly Chinese estimates of the losses of the Armed Forces have been roaming the Internet. The figure is estimated to be more than 1.8 million dead. However, in open sources there are no and there have never been any official comments of the PRC regarding the losses of the Defense Forces. This is an outright fake, because according to official data, the total number of military casualties of Ukraine is many times less than claimed in Russian channels. Since the first days of the war, the Kremlin has been manipulating numbers — significantly reducing its own losses and significantly exaggerating Ukraine's losses. However, no one in the world believes in any Russian statistics. That is why, in order to convince someone, Russians from time to time refer to fictitious sources from other countries.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/31/vorog-znovu-manipulyuye-czyframy-tilky-oczinky-vzhe-kytajski/	2024-12-30T20:18:21-08:00

A new wave of confiscation of civilian cars for personal use has been recorded at TOT	About this reports Center of National Resistance. Officially, cars are confiscated from offenders for their own needs. However, the enemy is actually looking for a reason to confiscate, because the road inspectorate has a plan that it is trying to carry out. There have been recorded cases when a car was confiscated for minor debts due to non-payment of fines. In the future, the cars are handed over to the occupation units, which use the stolen cars during the assaults on our positions. We remind you, Russian dictator Putin signed a decree approving a new strategy for combating extremism in the Russian Federation, where Ukraine is identified as one of the -main sources of extremism-. The document aims to legitimize the Kremlin's aggressive policy towards our country, shifting the emphasis to -external provocations- and diverting attention from internal problems.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/30/na-tot-projshla-nova-hvylya-konfiskacziyi-czyvilnyh-avto-na-potreby-svo/	2024-12-30T11:42:25-08:00

They captured eight occupiers and freed captured Ukrainians: how the Rangers stormed the Russians	informs the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine about this. -A morning that started with tension. The enemy broke through to our positions, occupied the dugout and began to entrench. The task was clear and urgent: to destroy the enemy or force him to surrender,- the statement said. The fighters, together with the platoon commander, quickly assessed the situation, determined the route and developed an assault plan. The main problem is the unknown: how many of them, what kind of weapons, are they led by drones? Therefore, they decided to act decisively and in the most coordinated manner. Scouts set off to land. Drones closely monitored the situation, and commanders adjusted actions in real time. On the approach to the dugout, the group split: the machine gunner and his partner remained in cover, the others bypassed the position from the flank. Heavy fire and grenades did their job - the enemy began to retreat in confusion. The order from the commander sounded clear: to offer the Russians to surrender. -It's always more difficult than just destroying. It is necessary to convince the enemy that surrender is the only reasonable solution,- says the platoon commander with the call sign -Groundhog-. And they gave up. However, in a moment it turned out that there were Ukrainian prisoners among them. -There was no information about who they are and how many there are. -Rangers- acted clearly: they forced the enemy to leave one by one, without weapons and armor. They counted 10 people, including ours. This created a new problem: there was not enough space in the -box- for everyone,- said the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Some of the prisoners with an escort were sent immediately, the rest were left under the guard of two soldiers. The irony of fate: I had to hide from Russian artillery fire in the same dugout that was stormed a few hours ago. The General Staff of the Armed Forces noted that the operation was completed successfully. Not one wounded among our people, two freed Ukrainians and a priceless chance to exchange prisoners. -The main thing is to save the lives of loved ones and to return home those who are waiting for freedom.

Russia's new strategy for countering extremism should divert attention from domestic problems	About this informs the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The strategy states that threats from -radical neo-Nazi formations- are supported by external forces. The -Ukrainian crisis- is being used by -unfriendly states to launch hybrid wars against the Russian Federation and inflame aggressive Russophobic sentiments in the world.- It was determined that the elimination of threats originating from the territory of Ukraine is one of the main goals of the strategy. For the first time, the term -Russophobia- is introduced, which is defined as -an unfriendly, prejudiced, hostile attitude towards the citizens of Russia, towards the Russian language and culture-. Discriminatory actions by the authorities of -unfriendly- countries are also considered Russophobia. Among the factors of destabilization are uncoordinated protest actions that -deliberately- turn into mass riots, as well as the illegal activities of migrants and the destructive work of international non-governmental organizations. The strategy provides for prosecution of persons engaged in extremist activities (without the possibility of avoiding punishment), and keeping records of all those who travel outside Russia to participate in extremist organizations or to undergo training in -centers of unfriendly states.- As part of preventive measures, the document suggests developing migrant adaptation programs, creating patriotic social advertising for young people, publishing the consequences of violent crimes on extremist grounds, implementing the capabilities of -artificial intelligence- technology to deanonymize extremists, and also organizing -Saturdays- at the graves of World War II veterans. -svo-, the Afghan war and the war in Syria.

Aviation instead of the fleet: the spokesman of the Navy explained why the number of Russian ships i...	The spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain 3rd rank, told about this on the air of the Edyny Novyny telethon Dmytro Pletenchuk. Currently, Russian planes patrol the Black Sea and coastal waters instead of ships and boats. -Russian aviation remains active, a fairly large part of the functionality has actually been transferred to it, including from the ship and boat fleet. Airplanes patrol both the water area and the coastal zone, these issues mostly depend on aviation now,- he said. According to Dmytro Pletenchuk, such changes were caused by the destruction of several ships near the occupied Crimea during the year. As a result, the Russians were forced to leave their bases in Crimea and focus on preserving the remnants of their naval fleet. As reported by ArmyInform, as of the morning of December 30 in the Black Sea, one enemy ship, which is a Caliber cruise missile carrier, missiles are missing.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/30/aviacziya-zamist-flotu-rechnyk-vms-poyasnyv-chomu-zmenshylas-kilkist-rosijskyh-korabliv-u-chornomu-mori/	2024-12-29T23:53:05-08:00

Liquidation of MSEK: How a serviceman can get the status of a person with a disability in 2025	In their place, expert teams will work to assess the daily functioning of a person, which will be created at health care institutions. The Ministry of Health notes that the path to disability status will become much easier for a person, as most processes will be shortened and digitized. And all evaluation stages will be recorded in the electronic system. And what will change for the military? ArmyInform tells what military personnel must do to obtain the status of a person with a disability. If an injury or illness significantly limits a serviceman's functioning, he may be referred to a facility with expert teams for daily functioning assessment, explains the Ministry of Health. This can be done by the attending physician or the head of the VLK. At the same time, there is no need to wait 120 days from the moment of injury. After stabilization of the serviceman's state of health, the head of the VLK has the opportunity to immediately form an electronic referral for the assessment of daily functioning. The evaluation is carried out by an expert team of doctors who specialize in determining the degree of limitation of a person's functioning due to injuries or diseases. The expert team works on the basis of multidisciplinary healthcare facilities. The doctor and the serviceman can choose a medical facility together from the list available in the electronic system for daily functioning assessment. The choice depends on the serviceman's place of stay, as well as the chosen form of evaluation: The evaluation of daily functioning must be carried out within up to 30 days from the moment of submission of the electronic referral by the head of the VLK. The administrator of the health care facility where the expert team works must review the submitted case within 5 days from the moment of receiving the referral to either put the case in the queue and the system will determine the date and time of the evaluation, or return the case for revision due to inaccuracies. If the case is added to the queue, the serviceman will receive a notification via e-mail (his or a representative's e-mail) about the form, time and place of the assessment. If there is no e-mail, the information will be sent by registered mail to the military serviceman's physical address. The expert team analyzes the documents, and in the case of face-to-face, remote or on-site assessment, conducts an additional review or examination. Attention is paid to the degree of functional impairment, the impact of the injury or disease on daily activities, as well as the need for social support or rehabilitation. Based on the obtained results, the expert team must make a decision on the establishment of disability, determine the terms of re-evaluation (if necessary), and must provide recommendations for rehabilitation. The decision will be entered into the electronic system, and the serviceman will receive a copy of it by e-mail or, if necessary, in printed form. The document will also be available in the electronic office of the referring physician for evaluation. All data will be transferred to social security authorities responsible for further assistance. On the basis of the adopted decision, the serviceman may: The serviceman may appeal the decision of the expert team. To do this, you need to submit a complaint to the Center for Assessing the Functional State of a Person.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/30/likvidacziya-msek-yak-vijskovosluzhbovczyu-otrymaty-status-lyudyny-z-invalidnistyu-v-2025-roczi/	2024-12-29T20:53:46-08:00
300 combat and salvo to repulse the assault: the shooting intensive at Interflex continues until the...	The correspondent of ArmyInform tells about the training repulse of an enemy assault, which completes rifle training during the BZVP within the limits of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. Marksmanship training with live ammunition is the final stage of intensive training and daily intensive training during basic military training within the Interflex mission. In our case, it lasts nine days. Shootings take place in a number of locations - on a specially equipped shooting range, on a range with structures for practicing shooting from awkward positions, and in several places in the middle of forest plantations, which we would call forest plantations. In a few days, we go from conducting fire at the shooting range exclusively from stationary positions under the strict control of instructors to simulating fire contact with the enemy while patrolling and moving across the field or in wooded areas. We shoot a lot, without regretting and without counting cartridges - there are plenty of them. It is the norm, not the exception, to shoot several dozen or even more than a hundred shots in a school day. In recent days, especially active enthusiasts are allowed to shoot even more. However, the biggest daily attack will come on the last day of training, when we no longer work in twos or fours, but act simultaneously in two divisions. On this day, everyone fires at least 300 live rounds. Having entered the positions, we will hold the defense until the last cartridge - until all magazines and all zincs with cardboard boxes for storing cartridges are completely emptied. The instructors are interested in us shooting everything -to zero-. Our task is to repel a conditional enemy assault and hold positions in two nearby trenches. The greatest responsibility rests with the department commanders who organize the defense and coordinate the opening and cessation of fire. It all begins with an imitation of artillery shelling, during which instructors scatter explosive charges--firecrackers- literally a few meters from the chances. In terms of volume, it is similar to mortar fire, but unfired fighters need to start small. We are already familiar with such explosions, because during the previous classes on throwing grenades in trenches and defending positions, instructors used such charges. But now the simulated artillery fire is particularly intense, with several dozen explosions near both trenches. During the -artillery fire- we literally squeeze into the smallest gaps of chance, and after it in pairs we check weapons, equipment and ourselves for possible injuries. Instructors monitor how we communicate with each other and follow the algorithm. Thanks to previous training, such checks have already been brought to automaticity. The fighter with the call sign -Italian- with whom I work in a pair does it almost twice as fast as me - due diligence and previous experience. After completing the check, we send a signal of readiness to the unit commander and take a waiting position. The commander or a fighter designated by him conducts observation and maintains contact with an observer from a neighboring trench. Established and well-practiced communication within the department and between departments is perhaps the most important key to the successful completion of a combat mission. It is given no less attention than the rules for handling weapons. At the beginning, we were literally forced to shout loudly to each other, duplicate commands and inform the commander and comrades about what was discovered. By the last day of training, this is already a firmly learned habit. Foreign instructors do not understand what we are saying to each other, but they hear the communication and see the correct actions. This is enough to see that we are saying the right things. Only occasionally do they ask for the help of translators. Having noticed the appearance of the enemy, the observer reports to the commander. Having quickly received a signal of readiness from each of the fighters of the unit and coordinating actions with his comrades, he orders to open fire. It is necessary for all shooters to do this at the same time in order to cover the enemy with the first shots and force him to lie down or retreat. A joint volley of 16 machine guns of both divisions and rapid fire after that gives the impression of the fire superiority of the defenders of the positions. It will be possible to achieve the desired effect of simultaneity only with the second attempt - coordinating the actions of such a large number of shooters from two departments in neighboring chances turns out to be a difficult task. However, then we easily repeat it several times in a row. When conducting fire, we change positions after every 3-5 shots. Targets repeatedly rise and fall rapidly, hit by well-aimed shots. Everyone covers their sector, firing first at the nearest and then at the distant targets. The instructors are happy with our communication - working in pairs during reloading, checking weapons and equipment is firmly in place. Accuracy does not suffer either - the targets fall one after another, proving a hit. The brothers with the call sign -Grandfather- show special effectiveness, knocking out distant targets with the first shot. I'm left to shoot my neighbors and cover my neighbors while they reload. During the day, we manage to repulse an enemy assault six or seven times, alternating our actions with other units. Fortunately, the weather cooperates - in the midst of constant rain, Misty Albion is unexpectedly warm and sunny today. Our ears are ringing with explosions and shots, and our arms and legs are tired, but we are ready to go on when it turns out that there are no more cartridges left - we have fired everything, firing at least three hundred rounds each. Thousands of shell casings crunch underfoot in the trenches and sparkle in the evening sun next to the trenches. It takes more than an hour to collect them, but we are already almost stretching the pleasure, looking for bright cylinders even 10 meters from the positions. The last day of training at Interflex ends earlier than planned and we return to the camp even more enviable. This is perhaps the first case during the entire training period, because usually classes and training lasted until late in the evening.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/30/300-bojovyh-i-zalp-dlya-vidbyttya-shturmu-strileczkyj-intensyv-na-interflex-tryvaye-do-ostannogo-patrona/	2024-12-29T20:39:35-08:00
Karma will catch up with the enemy: a well-known German manufacturer of AI-based solutions in Ukrain...	According to the Army Recognition (AR) defense team, the HX-2 Karma is a new generation of ammunition, designed for high accuracy and adaptability in difficult combat conditions, ArmiyaInform reports. AR experts reported that according to Helsing GmbH, which has been operating in Munich since 2021, a drone equipped with state-of-the-art features, including the ability to navigate and perform missions even in areas where global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are jammed or unavailable, solving critical problem of modern electronic warfare. With Helsing's Altra Recce-Strike software, multiple HX-2 drones can operate simultaneously in coordinated missions, using swarm tactics to overwhelm enemy defenses. Integrated artificial intelligence allows autonomous identification and hitting of targets with an accuracy of up to 50 centimeters. This capability minimizes collateral damage and maximizes mission effectiveness. However, according to experts of site IKK Defense Express (DE), information about these drones is extremely limited. It is only noted that they have developed -artificial intelligence- for autonomously hitting targets and ignoring EW, have a range four times greater than Ukrainian kamikaze drones and are cheaper than the American Switchblade or the Russian Lancet. -The latter directly indicates that the drone itself is a barrage munition for hitting targets at a range of 40-60 km,- DE stated. In turn, the authors portal of the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle indicate that Helsing drones work on the basis of software, which makes them virtually invulnerable to electronic warfare. A defense expert familiar with the situation told the German publication Bild that this drone is capable of -learning by itself terrain- and recognize from thousands of landmarks where it is, thus helping the operator stay on course even in adverse weather conditions or in bombed-out areas. -After the target has been found and the operator has given him instructions, the drone flies to it by itself,- the publication quotes. Bild's interlocutor's words. According to Bild, we are not talking about ordinary kamikaze drones controlled by operators, but about high-tech aircraft controlled by artificial intelligence, which are also called -mini-Taurus-. However, the latest claim of some kind of technological kinship with the -Taurus- has already caused critical statements. In particular, the Ministry of Defense of the Federal Republic of Germany disagreed with the journalistic comparison of German drones with AI elements to long-range missiles. This was said by the representative of the Ministry of Defense Natalie Jenning at a briefing in Berlin, Ukrinform reports. The spokeswoman noted that these are -tactical drones with a limited range.- She criticized the fact that the drones were called mini-Taurus and said that these drones cannot be compared to Taurus missiles. At the same time, Jenning refused to provide specific technical details regarding the drones. The position of the German Defense Ministry and DE experts are supported, citing the fact that a barrage munition with the ability to hit targets at a range of 40-60 km cannot be compared to a powerful cruise missile. -Already on the basis of this, it is possible to immediately understand that these drones are not talking about any -mini-Taurus- or at least a fraction of the capabilities of Taurus. Because the task of this German cruise missile is to destroy highly protected objects with the help of a 480-kg warhead at a range of more than 500 km. And any drone, even if it has a similar range, cannot physically destroy similar targets with the help of a warhead weighing several tens of kilograms,- Defense Express emphasized. However, as Western military experts emphasize, the use of unmanned munitions with the capabilities attributed to the HX-2 Karma reflects a broader trend in modern military operations, where unmanned systems and technologies controlled by artificial intelligence are becoming indispensable. The ability of the drone to operate in conditions where GNSS is not available and to use swarm tactics is aimed at solving two of the most important tasks: defeating electronic warfare and countering massive enemy forces or equipment. It should be noted how reported ArmyInform, at the beginning of May this year, Deputy Minister of Defense Kateryna Chernogorenko met with representatives of the Helsing company, which is engaged in integration of artificial intelligence in defense technologies. Together with the CEO and co-founder of Helsing Gundbert Scherf, they discussed the possibilities of integrating solutions with the use of artificial intelligence into the existing software of the Ukrainian army. In turn, in February of this year, the heads of the Ministry of Strategic Industries of Ukraine and Helsing GmbH signed a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation in the field of security and defense. The purpose of signing the memorandum is to strengthen Ukrainian defense technologies. It is about the implementation of artificial intelligence technologies in drones, in particular UAVs, manufactured in Ukraine. Presentation of HX-2 UAV capabilities.

Propagandists regularly make the same accusations against Ukraine that we once made against Russia. In this particular case, we are dealing with a photo fake. The screenshot of the original post of the charitable foundation has been edited. The original publication talks about Kharkiv Oblast, not Kursk Oblast. And the military received a washing machine from a family of volunteers. In a real post, the military thanked the volunteers for their help. The time of publication also indicates a forgery. The original post was shared on December 4, 2024 at 01:04, and the fake one at 02:04 on December 4. Such inaccuracy is obviously caused by different time zones in Ukraine and the Russian Federation. That is, the fake was created from the territory of Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/30/propagandysty-znovu-vzyalysya-za-viddzerkalennya-fotofejk-pro-vykradennya-pralnoyi-mashyny/	2024-12-29T20:11:00-08:00

Fighting is taking place in the border strip from the Dand Wa Patan district of the Afghan Paktia province and the Pakistani North Waziristan province, as well as in the border strip from the Alishir district of the Afghan Khost province and the Pakistani Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The Taliban claim that the reason for the conflict is a Pakistani airstrike earlier this week on four districts in Barmal district in eastern Paktika province. Taliban representative I. Khorezmi said that he does not consider Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to be part of Pakistan's territory.

On December 29, a representative of the 110th mechanized brigade named after General Khorunzhoi stated this on the air of the -Edyni Novyni- telethon Marka Bezruchka Serhii Volkov. -Mechanized columns regularly march to positions and are destroyed by all means: artillery, drones, remote and other mining. The Russians have a tank with REBs going forward, sewn up as much as possible so that our FPV drones don't hit them, but it doesn't save them. Sometimes it happens that 5-7 hits plus mines don't help,- said Serhiy Volkov. According to him, the enemy's advantage in personnel remains the biggest problem. -If the enemy's infantry is not destroyed, they run around the landings, and then it's a lot of trouble to knock them out. Therefore, the enemy is now trying to cut off the logistical routes to Velika Novosilka, and this is one of the very difficult directions,- said Serhiy Volkov, whose brigade is fighting hard and is even trying to counterattack. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 110th unmanned systems battalion of the mechanized brigade named after Colonel General Mark Bezruchka destroyed a column of Russian equipment. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/29/kolonamy-bronetehniky-ta-natovpamy-pihoty-okupanty-namagayutsya-prorvatysya-do-kordoniv-dniprovshhyny/	2024-12-29T10:17:48-08:00

But there are quite expected changes to these barrier systems that they have been building so enthusiastically for almost the entire warm period. As of now, it is likely that quite a large number of these barriers are not functional. Storm season isn't over yet. For another 2-3 months, rather harsh weather at sea will continue. And I hope that soon we will see even more results of the intervention of -General Storm-, who mostly helps us,- noted Dmytro Pletenchuk.

Due to the price regulation of TOT, there was a shortage of products	This is reported by a> Center of national resistance. Such a price policy leads to logical consequences, namely a shortage of products. This is primarily about oil, because the fixing of its price has led to the fact that it is now being sold from the -showcase-, because the fixed price does not correspond to the market price. Russia is synonymous with the word deficit. Therefore, the result of the reign of each king is necessarily the disappearance of goods from the shop windows. Currently, the Russians are trying to impose cash registers on sellers, which will become mandatory from February 1, 2025, and this will only increase fines, and the goods on the shelves will not be returned.

Since June 2024, the exchange rate of the dollar and the euro has been determined on the basis of over-the-counter data due to US sanctions, while the exchange rate of the Chinese currency is based only on the results of trading on the Moscow Stock Exchange. This decision of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation indicates the transition to manual regulation of the currency market and the growing role of the political component in the activity of the regulator. We remind you that the situation on the labor market in the Russian Federation will continue to deteriorate. Today, the shortage of personnel in Russia is about 1.5 million people with an unemployment rate of 2.3%. The reason is stagflation processes in the economy of the Russian Federation due to the war against Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/29/rosiya-vyznala-kolaps-ekonomiky/	2024-12-29T03:12:36-08:00

About this on the air of the TV channel -Social News- narrated representative of the press service of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo Andriy Polukhin. According to him, the enemy is trying to take the city by storm. Both mechanized frontal attacks and small infantry groups are used. -In particular, infantry groups are trying to infiltrate through the positions of our defenders and impose a battle in the rear. But they do not succeed. Because these groups are revealed very quickly. And thanks to the guys from intelligence and the battalion of unmanned systems, the enemy is effectively destroyed,- noted Andriy Polukhin. In this direction, the servicemen of the Royal Brigade oppose the Russian paratroopers, who are constantly reinforced by motorized rifle units. -The 98th Airborne Division is fighting against us. And motorized rifle brigades are sent to it. It is difficult to say exactly which ones, because they often change.

The enemy is looking for land plots whose owners left the TOT	This is reported by Center of National Resistance. It is about captured lands of the Kherson region. Currently, the local -grain operator-, which was created to forcibly take grain from local farmers, forms lists of lands whose owners left the region because of the -liberators-. Next year, the occupiers plan to put these plots up for sale, that is, they actually want to take them away from their rightful owners. However, we note that any documents issued by the ROA are legally null and void and have no legal force. We remind you that due to the refusal of the majority of local doctors to cooperate with the enemy, the occupiers cannot cope with the personnel shortage in the temporarily occupied territories of the Zaporizhzhia region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/29/vorog-shukaye-zemelni-dilyanky-vlasnyky-yakyh-vyyihaly-z-tot/	2024-12-28T23:53:07-08:00
In Russia, there is a growing shortage of personnel	This is reported by Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. In 2022-2024, the number of labor force decreased by 1 million and today it is about 76.3 million people. A particularly rapid reduction is observed in the groups that are most in demand on the labor market - persons aged 19 to 40 years. Only during July-September 2024, employers posted 3.3 million vacancies. By the end of the third quarter, the ratio of open vacancies to unemployed Russians was 5 to 1. Throughout 2024, the largest shortage of personnel was observed in the field of retail trade and the IT sector. In the construction industry, the deficit in general can reach more than 400,000. persons By 2030, the shortage of personnel may increase to 4 million people. Given the Kremlin's intentions to continue the Russian-Ukrainian war, it will not be possible to solve the personnel problem in Russia thanks to internal reserves. Improvement of the situation on the labor market at the expense of foreigners is unlikely given the strengthening of the migration policy and double standards for labor migrants. We remind you that due to the refusal of the majority of local doctors to cooperate with the enemy, the occupiers cannot cope with the personnel shortage in the temporarily occupied territories of the Zaporizhzhia region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/29/u-rosiyi-fiksuyetsya-zrostannya-deficzytu-kadriv/	2024-12-28T23:29:33-08:00

-The gun -Bogdany- is our 155-caliber sniper rifle-: the Russian locust is fired by the -Artist- fro...	Currently, -Artist- serves in the 48th separate artillery brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the position of service number of the self-propelled artillery installation -Bohdan-. — Served, as theatergoers say, 20 years. Retired, had another civilian profession. And then he was mobilized and went to this damned war. Since then, I have been in the army for the second time, says Yuriy. This is not Yuriy's first time in the army - he served in the military at the end of the 1990s. Even then, he was recognized as visually impaired, so based on this and his acting talent, he served a year and a half in the Song and Dance Ensemble of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, performed on the same stage with many Ukrainian celebrities. — However, now I feel that it is suitable, because it is necessary for the defense of Ukraine. Therefore, when the summons was served, he left without hesitation. He was mobilized on March 1, 2024, trained in the Poltava region, says the soldier. Having the right not to serve on account of his health, he decided not to use it and willingly went into service as soon as the need arose. After all, he says, when the war is going on, everyone who is ready to defend the country is healthy and fit. — Everything was polite, cultured. They served a summons and the next day I arrived at the TCC, filled out the documents, went through everything and went to the training center, says Yuriy. - Before that, I volunteered - this is also an important job, because it is necessary to hold the rear and provide for the army. He was engaged in the delivery of food to the military and volunteers, helped his wife, who was weaving camouflage nets with her friends, he recalls how the first two years of the large-scale invasion passed. Yury fondly recalls how he once came across a video recorded by the military, in which they thanked for the products transferred from the company in Cherkasy, where he worked. — They recorded tiktok and it had our brand, our company! The guys ate exactly our products - this greatly inspired everyone at the time, because it showed that we are doing an important, necessary thing - the artist does not hide his emotions. After the war, he seeks to return to the friendly team from which he was forced to go to the army because of the war. Yuriy is sure that they are waiting for him there, because over the years of joint work and volunteering, his colleagues have become a single family. -We need a strong rear, but there are not enough hands in the army, so when I was called, I immediately left,- he says firmly. — In the -textbook- we were called -validators-. The youngest was 40 years old, the oldest was 58. Of course, compared to the younger guys, it was difficult for us, - he says about the training center. However, they were taught qualitatively - in a month, the -Artist- learned significantly more about military affairs and in a much better quality than he had once during a year and a half of military service. — So what happened before? Overcoat, -hem-, edging, boots - and to make everything rub and shine. We painted more squares and painted curbs than we shot and learned to fight, he says. Now they teach the practical things that are really needed in the war, and they do it not for formal reporting, but to prepare the soldier for combat operations. - -Training- was a great experience. There were experienced instructors, qualified, who had already gone through the war themselves and knew what we would really need. It was necessary to be with them like a sponge - to soak up everything they gave, what they taught, -Artist- notes. When the -buyers- came for the graduates from BZVP, Yuriy was selected as an artilleryman. A motivated responsible soldier was selected after a short interview and was sent to study a profession. — The colonel who came after us was primarily looking for those who had a technical education. But when I found out that I was a ballet dancer, I became interested and invited him to join the artillery. I agreed because they promised to work on a combat vehicle, -Artist- recalls. The second stage of training was less physically exhausting, but extremely responsible, because it was necessary to master subjects completely unknown to the former theater actor. However, persistence and responsibility quickly yielded the desired result. — At first you don't know from which side to approach this technique. But the main thing is to start and not be afraid. When a harmonious crew is formed, everything will go as it should. Because in combat conditions, the main thing is coordination — for the machine to arrive, for us to quickly -decompose- it, prepare it for battle and shoot accurately, says the soldier. After training in a specialty from May to today, Yuriy serves as a maintenance officer of the -Bohdana- ACS. - There are a lot of combat sequences, but this is just work. The most important thing in the war is my brothers, my crew, the guys I work with. People are always the most important thing. When we are confident in each other, everything always works out even in combat, says -Artist-. He by no means wants to leave combat work at the SAU for another position, because he is sure that this is where his place is during this war and this is where he can be of the greatest benefit. Yuriy does not consider the inability to see as an obstacle, because he is not a sniper and he has to shoot with a completely different -rifle- - the 155th! — caliber. - We shoot from the cannon exactly at the target. Our gun is our sniper rifle. The acuity of my vision does not affect this. If the Komgar (gun commander - ed.) orders, then we will make our doll, and we will bang, hit, and burn that Russian locust! — a confident gunner. Yuriy says that the main motive for him is not ostentatious patriotism, to which he is skeptical, but responsibility for his family, brothers, and country. — I have responsibility from my father. And my family motivates me. Because the family is the motherland. My mother-in-law lives in the Dnipropetrovsk region. So where should I go next? She is part of my family and I have to protect her, he explains. In the same way, he is convinced, everyone should think about taking responsibility for themselves and protecting their family, country, Ukrainian people and the state of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/29/garmata-bogdany-nasha-snajperska-gvyntivka-155-kalibru-rosijsku-saranu-vypalyuye-artyst-z-baletu/	2024-12-28T20:50:37-08:00
A new addition to the cat family: the Bundeswehr received a new version of the Leopard 2 tank	The German defense company KNDS Deutschland presented the Leopard 2A7A1 main battle tank equipped with an Israeli active defense system Trophy (APS). The prototype was presented at the company's plant in Munich during a demonstration attended by representatives of the German Bundeswehr and an Israeli delegation, ArmyInform reports. According to the information shared by the defense resource Defense Industry Europe, we are talking about equipping the serial tank of the latter, for this time, modifications with the active protection complex (KAZ) Trophy, from the Israeli companies Rafael and IAI. Previously, the Leopard 2 was equipped with Trophy armor only on research and demonstration models, but now the Bundeswehr has become the first customer of this version. This system, according to the experts of site Army Recognition, provides reliable protection against anti-tank missiles and rocket launchers, detecting and neutralizing incoming threats before they hit the tank. The Trophy system includes radar antennas and launch platforms externally, while internally it includes a control unit and power supply integrated into the turret and chassis. According to the Defense Industry Europe portal, the Leopard 2 A7A1, intended for active service starting in 2025, will strengthen Germany's 203rd Armored Battalion. It is planned to deploy this unit in the German combat brigade stationed in Lithuania. The German Defense Procurement Agency (BAAINBw) has confirmed that the tank will soon begin testing, with final approval expected by the summer of 2025, after which the first units will go directly to the troops. Integrated with the Leopard on-board computer and battlefield management systems, the Trophy system includes an advanced targeting locator. This system identifies the source of incoming threats, transmitting precise coordinates to the tank control system for rapid automated countermeasures, significantly improving defense response times. In 2021, the Bundeswehr agreed with Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (now KNDS Deutschland) to produce 17 Leopard 2A7A1 tanks and a test vehicle, deliveries of which will begin in 2024. A simultaneous contract was also signed with Israel for Trophy components, munitions and special equipment, part of a €120 million program jointly funded by Germany and Israel. The new KNDS Leopard 2 chassis meets the power requirements of the Trophy system with modifications including a 20 kW power supply and improved cooling for the updated MTU Friedrichshafen engine, ensuring optimal mobility despite increasing the tank's weight to 70 tons. The Leopard 2A7A1 is expected to be an interim solution until the more advanced Leopard 2A8 enters service in 2025. Incorporating an improved, lighter Trophy system optimized for drone protection, the A8 represents the next evolution of the Leopard series with the Trophy fully integrated into its turret, contrasting with the optional A7A1 system setup. Currently, Trophy in the Leopard 2A7A1 version is not designed to combat kamikaze drones, but Israeli engineers plan that this function will appear in future models. In October, Rafael announced the successful completion of development, which gives the ability of the Trophy complex to protect against modern threats, including FPV drones. These drones pose a serious threat that exceeds the risks from ATGMs and anti-tank grenade launchers, which the Trophy was originally designed to combat. Currently, only two countries in the world have serial tanks with KAZ - these are Israel and the USA.

Maksym Bilousov, the head of the communications department of the 60th Ingulets mechanized brigade, told on the ArmyTV stream about this. -According to my feeling, there have been fewer CABs.

President: It seems that Putin has instructed to open a second energy front against Ukraine	This is stated in the statement of the head of state. -It seems that Putin instructed Fico to open a second energy front against Ukraine at the expense of the interests of the people of Slovakia. Only this can mean Fico's threats to cut off the emergency supply of electricity to Ukraine in the winter in the context of Russian attacks on our power plants and distribution network,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He explained that Ukraine's need to import electricity arose only because of Russia's occupation of our Zaporozhye nuclear power plant and the purposeful destruction by Russian missiles and Shaheds of a significant part of Ukrainian thermal and hydrogen electricity generation. Thanks to the heroic work of our energy workers and life-saving cooperation with the EU, USA, Great Britain, Norway, Japan and our other partners in Ukraine, we managed to prevent a blackout. -Now Fico is also involving Slovakia in Russia's efforts to hurt Ukrainians,- the President said. The head of state reported that the share of Slovakia in the import of electricity to Ukraine is about 19%. The Government of Ukraine is working with our neighbors in the EU to maintain the necessary amount of electricity supply. -Slovakia is part of the single European energy market, and Fico must respect European rules. Any arbitrary decisions in Bratislava or orders from Moscow to Fico regarding electricity will not lead to a halt in the import of electricity to Ukraine, but can definitely lead to a break between the current government of Slovakia and the European community,- the President emphasized.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/28/prezydent-shozhe-putin-doruchyv-vidkryty-drugyj-energetychnyj-front-proty-ukrayiny/	2024-12-28T04:24:52-08:00

ArmyInform wrote about possible tasks -Mirage- in Ukraine, but did not mention that in 2024 these aircraft had already successfully shot down two enemy Kamikaze UAV Shahed-136 in combat conditions. However, not in Ukraine. Since the transfer to Ukraine, the F-16 Fighting Falcon multi-purpose fighters have convincingly demonstrated their -bojovi-sokoly-pid-chas-neshhodavnogo-obstrilu-ukrayiny/->efficiency as a means Air defense, shooting down dozens of Russian cruise missiles and kamikaze drones during massive combined air and missile strikes on the Ukrainian energy infrastructure. -Fighting Falcons- began to -learn- to shoot down -Shakhed- - more precisely, small-sized unmanned aerial vehicles at low altitude - at the end of 2019, when the USA and other NATO countries realized the threat from the Russian Federation and Iran due to their active use of cruise missiles and kamikaze drones. French Mirage 2000 multirole fighters are also capable of shooting down UAVs and cruise missiles. At the same time, unlike the F-16, they proved it not only during tests, but also in combat conditions even before they appeared in the Ukrainian skies. They had to act not against training targets, but against Iranian-made Shahed-136 combat UAVs. This happened during the Prosperity Guardian operation, which the coalition of states led by the United States is conducting from the end of 2023 to the beginning of 2024 with the aim of restoring the safety of shipping in the Red Sea. The operation is directed against the pirate actions of the Houthi paramilitary group, which operates from the territory of Yemen. Despite the fact that France has refused to participate in Operation Prosperity Guardian, its armed forces take part in patrolling the waters of the Red Sea as part of the European Union Operation Shield (EUNAVFOR Aspides) and interact with the US-led Prosperity Guardian coalition forces. Acting together with allies within the limits of both operations, French warships and aircraft patrol the waters of the Red Sea, repulse Houthi attacks on civilian vessels, and also provide the necessary self-defense in the event of a threat from enemy weapons at sea and in the air. On the morning of March 9, 2024, the Houthis launched four Shahed-136 kamikaze drones against the Barbados-flagged commercial vessel True Confidence. Their route lay in close proximity to and posed a threat to the French Navy's Aquitaine-type multipurpose frigate -Alsace- (FS Alsace, D656). Acting in self-defense and protecting a civilian vessel, the French armed forces opened fire on air targets and shot down four enemy UAVs. Two Shaheds shot down the frigate's 76 mm cannon, the others destroyed two Mirage 2000-5F fighters patrolling the airspace between the ship and the coast. Overall, during a Houthi airstrike on March 9, 2024, the armed forces of France, Great Britain and the United States jointly shot down 15 enemy UAVs. The significant contribution of Mirages has convincingly demonstrated their ability to effectively shoot down small air targets, such as drones and cruise missiles, at low altitudes in combat conditions. This allows us to believe that French fighters can become no less effective means of air defense in the defense of Ukrainian skies than the F-16.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/28/vynyshhuvachi-mirage-2000-vzhe-zbyvaly-shahed-136-ale-shhe-ne-v-ukrayini/	2024-12-27T20:57:01-08:00
117 brigade -gained weight-: what tanks are capable of on the modern battlefield	Spoiler alert: From point-blank fire to an evacuation vehicle, tanks can do just about anything. The chief of staff of the 117th separate heavy mechanized brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Oleksandr Shaptala, told ArmiyaInform about the role of tanks in modern warfare and the unique tank operation to evacuate soldiers from positions half-surrounded by the enemy. Tanks, as a means of maneuvering combat and powerful fire damage to the enemy, have shown high efficiency during modern warfare. In interaction with mechanized units, they are used both during offensive actions and in defense. — We have widely used tanks where the enemy is conducting offensive actions in the direction we are in. It was thanks to the tank units that we effectively restrained the enemy's offensive and inflicted maximum damage on him with the help of tanks, going into direct fire, Oleksandr Shaptala says. The military is convinced that, despite the development of anti-tank weapons that damage tanks, heavy tracked gun armored personnel carriers have not lost their importance and can and should continue to be used on the battlefield, as they provide effective and tangible support for infantry who are on the offensive or on the defensive. . - During defensive operations, they are used as a general military reserve, as armored groups that go to the border for direct fire and deter the enemy, reducing the pace of his offensive actions and completely stopping his advance - explains the main role of tanks on the modern battlefield. This led to the reformation of the 117th brigade into a heavy mechanized one with an increase in the weight of the tank component in the compound. At the same time, it is not just about a simple increase in the number of tanks, but also about new approaches to the use of armored fighting vehicles on a tracked chassis based on the challenges of the modern battlefield. Tanks are mainly used for direct fire after a quick and unexpected exit to the line of fire by the enemy. Instead, they try to resort to fire from closed firing positions less often. — We don't have as much ammunition to fire tanks as we do artillery. That's why we try to use tanks for direct fire as much as possible, because it gives a hundred percent hit, - explains Oleksandr Shaptala. Shooting from closed fire positions is also possible, as it provides a level of damage to targets commensurate with high-precision artillery fire. However, taking into account the resource of the crew, the gun barrel and the amount of ammunition, it is more profitable to use the tank not as a substitute for artillery, but for the direct purpose of an armored vehicle. - Using a tank for direct fire is much more effective than from closed fire positions. So, if possible, when the enemy already discovers our routes of advance for direct fire, we try to use tanks to fire from closed firing positions. But direct fire remains the most effective, the officer emphasizes. At the same time, the chief of staff notes, it is important not only to perform a combat mission, but also to preserve military equipment and, especially, the crew. Therefore, when planning operations, they try to take into account all hazards and avoid excessive risks. Among the main threats to tanks, the military mentions UAVs, barrage munitions and anti-tank guided missiles. The biggest problem of all is kamikaze FPV drones. You can effectively protect tanks from them by installing powerful EW devices that cover a wide range of frequencies and protective grids. — The tank saves, first of all, the -scalds- that the repair and restoration units of the regiments, our repair and restoration battalion, do on their own. It is very effective. First, it is necessary to cover the engine compartment, and secondly, to cover the space between the body of the machine and the tower, the military calls the most vulnerable places of the armored vehicle. However, at the same time, he emphasizes, one should not lose such advantages of the tank as speed, maneuverability and the ability to fire in any direction due to the rotation of the turret. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible to abuse -burning- by building real -sheds-, -barbecues- or -garages- on the tank, like the Russians. — If it is done correctly, and not as the butchers do it. They will wind around the tank there so that the tank can just drive straight and shoot straight. And our equipment is so -boiled- that the tank moves and the tank turret rotates 360 degrees, it can fire in any direction. The enemy doesn't do that, the officer explains. Currently, the enemy uses tanks primarily as a vehicle to deliver infantry as close as possible to the battle line during assault operations. This makes enemy armored vehicles ineffective and vulnerable on the battlefield. The officer reminds that protective grilles are by no means the latest invention for the protection of armored vehicles. Installation of them on armored vehicles was resorted to already in the days of ATO/OOS, but then they were intended to counter rocket-propelled grenade launchers. — This appeared for the first time, probably back in 2014, when armored personnel carriers and BMPs were -boiled- with these -barbecues-, let's call them that, so that when the enemy's grenade launchers inflicted fire damage with RPG cumulative shells, the cumulative would work earlier. That's why it started back in the 14th year, says Oleksandr Shaptala. With the proliferation of FPV drones, protective grids have also proven effective against a new weapon. After 2022, when kamikaze aerial drones and UAVs with dropouts first appeared, and then became widespread, the well-known -boiling- of armored vehicles was the first response that the military resorted to. — But it must be done so intelligently so that the equipment does not lose its combat capabilities, so that even in this form it can be used for its original purpose, the officer emphasizes. The Ukrainians succeed, he continues, but the Russians have reached a dead end in this regard. Their solutions to protect mostly obsolete armored vehicles are not effective on the battlefield, as they fail to protect armored vehicles and at the same time deprive it of important advantages in maneuverability and greatly limit its capabilities as a means of infantry fire support. However, the military officer notes, it is not necessary to underestimate the enemy, because in other spheres the occupiers manage to achieve an advantage, not so much thanks to innovative development, but due to the scaling and building up of ideas and solutions that they have spied on and borrowed from the Ukrainians. — All the products that were made by Ukrainians, inventions, innovative technologies - everything is completely picked up by the enemy and built up in itself. At the beginning of a full-scale invasion, he had the advantage in shells, the advantage in people. He still has an advantage in shells and people. But he realized that at the rate he was losing it, he needed to catch up with our innovations, the military man explains. At the beginning of a large-scale invasion, the enemy had practically none of the inventions that are now common on the battlefield - FPV drones, UAV-bombers with drops, electronic warfare equipment to protect equipment, etc. Now the Russians have made significant progress and have even begun to overtake the Ukrainians in certain issues. This applies, for example, to the appearance and mass distribution of FPV drones on fiber optics, against which EW devices are powerless. — The problem with optical fibers is that they do not work from a radio signal, and EW does not affect this. The signal is transmitted through an optical fiber and the drone flies as far as the coil can reach. It can be up to 6-10 kilometers, says the soldier. The already mentioned protective grids are capable of protecting against kamikaze drones on fiber optics. The Ukrainian military is also beginning to actively implement this innovation, so the enemy is quickly losing its advantage in this means of defeat. Returning to the topic of tanks, the officer tells about a unique evacuation operation, during which tankers broke through to the semi-circled positions of the Ukrainian military and rescued four soldiers, including a wounded company commander. — The tank, driving into the settlement, evacuated four people, including the company commander, who had a bullet wound. They effectively drove in, took people, left, covered themselves with smoke, provided help with artillery so that the enemy's artillery was also suppressed, - says the Chief of Staff. Therefore, Ukrainian tankers not only hit the enemy with direct fire in maneuver defense and offensive, but also can, if necessary, carry out evacuation measures and rescue fighters on the front line. - Our tank crews, I believe, are real rexes. They are going to the end and they have a lot of experience in the Zaporizhzhia direction, in the Pokrovsky direction, Oleksandr Shaptala notes. — So when was the decision made to evacuate by tank. The tank entered the firing line, inflicted fire damage on the enemy, drove right up to our guys, the guys picked up the company commander and three men directly on the tank, on the armor and left under the smoke. The evacuation took place at night under conditions of limited visibility and intense fire contact with the enemy, but thanks to careful planning and the extraordinary courage and skill of the tank crew, it was successful. Because in the hands of experienced professionals and under competent command, tanks can do almost anything on the battlefield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/28/117-brygada-nabrala-vagy-na-shho-spromozhni-tanky-na-suchasnomu-poli-boyu/	2024-12-27T20:48:42-08:00
MLRS is a priority: what are the latest missile systems ordered by the Republic of Korea army	As state the authors of the South Korean portal DealSite, the local defense corporation Hanwha Aerospace signed a contract for 342.3 billion won (approximately $245 million) with the Defense Acquisition Program Administration of the Republic of Korea (DAPA) for the third stage of mass production of the K239 Chunmoo missile complex, reports ArmyInform. The contract represents 3.7% of Hanwha's annual sales for the previous year and runs through 2026. This phase involves the production of Chunmoo launchers and ammunition vehicles to replace aging systems in the South Korean military, such as the American M270 MLRS delivered to Seoul in 1998, which are nearing the end of their service life. The K239 Chunmoo, designed to replace the K136 Guryong, is a self-propelled multiple rocket launcher, capable, as at one time noted our editorial, fire with different types of ammunition. Among them are 230 mm unguided missiles with a range of 45 kilometers and 239 mm guided missiles with a range of 80 kilometers. The system can also use larger missiles, such as a 400 mm model with a range of 200 kilometers and a 600 mm missile called the CTM290 capable of reaching targets 290 kilometers away. Guided munitions include cluster warheads for 300 bombs and high-explosive fragmentation warheads designed to penetrate bunkers. These functions provide flexibility in the operational use of projectiles. The Chunmoo launcher is mounted on an 8×8 wheeled chassis designed by Doosan Infracore. The vehicle has a 450 horsepower engine, Run-Flat tires and digital fire control systems. The combat platform is designed for mobility, allowing it to engage targets and quickly redeploy to avoid counter-battery fire. Reloading is facilitated by interchangeable missile blocks, which allows for a firing configuration of up to 12 missiles per launcher. The ammunition transport vehicle, which uses a single chassis, can carry up to four missile units, which simplifies logistics operations. The Ministry of Defense has not disclosed the exact number of K239 Chunmoo MLRS installed under the contract by South Korea. However, according to analysts of the defense portal Army Recognition, it is expected that 218 to 367 units will be purchased. As of 2024, South Korea's multiple rocket launcher (MSR) fleet includes approximately 40 K136 Guryongs equipped with 130 mm rockets, 58 M270 MLRS systems using 227 mm rockets (48 standard M270 units and 10 upgraded M270A1 ), and approximately 200 systems K239 Chunmoo configured for 239 mm rockets. The system has been in service with South Korea's military since 2015 and is part of its efforts to modernize its artillery capabilities. Each battalion operating Chunmoo systems has 18 launchers. The platform is integrated into South Korea's Kill Chain pre-emptive strike defense scheme, which is designed to counter potential threats. The Chunmoo fire control system includes GPS-assisted INS guidance, which provides a 15-meter circular error probability for guided missiles. Chunmoo is also exported. 12 systems and vehicles were delivered to the United Arab Emirates under a confidential agreement. Saudi Arabia also acquired the system, deploying it during Yemen's civil war, reportedly against Houthi positions. According to the 2022 agreement, Poland is to receive 290 systems localized as Homar-K, which combine Polish command systems and domestic chassis. These complexes are equipped with Korean guided missiles and tactical ballistic missiles. Development of the K-239 Chunmoo began in 2009, and the system entered service in 2015. It was developed as a replacement for the K136 Kooryong and incorporates technological advances such as electric cylinders for rapid response and reloading. The Chunmoo has been continuously upgraded, including extended-range guided missiles and tactical ballistic missiles aimed at further increasing range and versatility. This third production phase reflects ongoing efforts to modernize artillery units in South Korea and meet changing operational requirements. It also highlights Chunmoo's role in regional security and its growing presence in international defense markets. K239 Chunmoo MLRS installation.

In Russia, anti-aircraft fire shoots down Santa and an Azerbaijani plane: it seems that the propagan...	After that, the racist Santa Claus comments on this: -we don't need anything foreign.- The essence of this -masterpiece-, bordering on schizophrenia, is -let's hit damned Western values ​​(it's the same Santa Claus) with an anti-aircraft missile.- Although maybe it's not just about values? By a very strange coincidence, the appearance of the video coincided with the downing by Russian anti-aircraft defense of the Azerbaijan Airlines plane, which the Russians wanted to sink in the Caspian Sea, not giving permission for an emergency landing after the incident. Rosavia cynically stated that the plane was unable to land in Grozny due to fog, and the pilot allegedly refused to land at other nearby airports and allegedly made an independent decision to fly to Kazakhstan. And the users of Russian publics are frankly happy about what has happened: -less churk is more of a good thing-&#8230; Meanwhile, propaganda launched a version about the downing of the plane allegedly by a -Ukrainian drone-, trying to shift the responsibility for the actions of the Russian air defense to Ukraine. But while the Kremlin propaganda machine tries with all its might to justify itself with the help of -alternative facts- and pseudo-analytics, the world understands everything correctly. The Azerbaijani airline, whose plane failed to land in Grozny and crashed in Kazakhstan's Aktau, announced the suspension of flights to seven Russian cities from December 28: Mineralnye Vody, Sochi, Volgograd, Ufa, Samara, Grozny and Makhachkala. It also became known about the cancellation of the Qazaq Air flight on the Astana-Yekaterinburg route until the end of January 2025 for security reasons, and about the suspension of flights to Moscow by the Israeli airline El Al. It is difficult to think of a better advertisement for refusing to fly to Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/28/u-rosiyi-ppo-zbyvaye-santu-i-azerbajdzhanskyj-litak-zdayetsya-propagandysty-perestaralysya/	2024-12-27T20:12:55-08:00
6 tanks and BMP each — the defeat of a powerful assault by the Russians in the Klishchiivka area	The video of the battle was released on December 27 on the brigade's channel. Kholodnoyartsi, together with neighboring units, repelled one of the most large-scale assaults in recent times in the Bakhmut direction. One and a half dozen heavy vehicles and up to three platoons of attack aircraft - that's how the Russian occupiers went to the brigade's position in the area of ​​the village of Klishchiivka. The forces of the Cold War soldiers, in cooperation with their comrades from neighboring units, succeeded in defeating the enemy and holding their positions. The offensive took place in two directions at once. From heavy equipment, the enemy used BMP-2 and T-72 tanks. However, with the joint efforts of the crews of the Black Raven unmanned systems battalion, the 2nd and 3rd mechanized battalions, supported by artillery, the enemy was completely defeated. The result of the brilliant work of the Cold War soldiers, which lasted about four hours, was the destruction of 6 T-72 tanks and 6 BMP-2 tanks. Another tank was damaged. Enemy manpower losses are being refined. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the Black Raven 93 unit of the mechanized brigade -Cold Ravine- hit the occupiers, who were going to our positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/27/po-6-tankiv-ta-bmp-rozgrom-potuzhnogo-shturmu-rosiyan-v-rajoni-klishhiyivky/	2024-12-27T11:57:06-08:00

There may be several reasons for this. First, they tried to launch classic attacks: in columns, they created armored -fists-. They lost a lot of equipment, a lot. And after that, we don't see the technique anymore. Maybe they don't have it left, or maybe they realized that it's not worth attacking like that anymore,- said Serhiy Dibrov.

Details regarding Kurshchyna — battles with the participation of the North Korean military. They have many losses. Very. And we see that the Russian military and North Korean supervisors are not at all interested in the survival of these Koreans. Everything in them is done in such a way that it is impossible for us to capture the Koreans: they are killing their own people, there are such facts,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. According to him, the Russians send the North Koreans to the assaults so that they have a minimum of protection. -Today there were reports about several soldiers from North Korea. Our soldiers managed to capture them. But they were very badly injured, and they could not be resuscitated. This is one of the manifestations of the madness that dictatorships are capable of,- the President said. . In his opinion, the Korean people should not lose their people in the battles in Europe. -And this can be influenced, in particular, by Korea's neighbors, in particular China. If Kiai is sincere in his statements that the war should not expand, an appropriate influence on Pyongyang is needed,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The head of the communications department of the 21st mechanized brigade, Captain Serhiy Dibrov, told on the ArmyTV stream about this. -Somehow people behave strangely. They walk one after the other, like in a kindergarten with a teacher. They follow each other in a chain, and move around. They are very afraid to be left alone. If they rest, they huddle together very tightly around a fire or a tent. This strange behavior is compounded by the fact that these people have never seen drones and do not know what to do if -Baba Yaga- is buzzing nearby. Russians quickly run away in such cases, and they just look at the sky in surprise,- said Serhiy Dibrov. According to him, on average, the new enemies are shorter than the Russians. These differences give reason to conclude that these are North Korean mercenaries of the Russians.

According to him, in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, Russia continues to violate the rights of children, turning them into tools of propaganda and war. Children are forced to take an -oath of loyalty- to Russia, promise to -protect its interests- and -foster great patriotism.- After that, they are taught fire and tactical training, drone control. -These youth movements are used by Russia as a tool for violently re-educating Ukrainian children, depriving them of their national identity and preparing them to participate in a war against their own country. This is a gross violation of international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions!- - says the message. Dmytro Lubinets noted that, according to them, children are guaranteed protection from coercion, violence and involvement in military formations in the temporarily occupied territories. -I call on the international community to take decisive action: strengthen sanctions, intensify diplomatic pressure and draw attention to Russia's crimes! We will never stop fighting for the rights of children who have suffered from Russian aggression.

First, one of the women ordered the production of forged medical certificates that confirmed the alleged birth of two children in 2019 and 2021, stating that her accomplice was their mother and the named man was their father. Later, these documents were submitted to the Department of State Registration of Civil Status Acts, where children were registered with relevant data, on the basis of which the man managed to cross the state border several times. The organizers received a reward of $1,000 for their services. The doctor, who was involved in illegal equipment, was also informed of the suspicion, the investigation is ongoing. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/27/tretya-treba-na-odeshhyni-zhinky-prodavaly-ditej-uhylyantam/	2024-12-27T09:34:58-08:00

The Ministry of Defense explained how coalitions of partner states strengthen the Defense Forces of ...	About this reported on December 27 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. In September 2023, the format of providing international aid to Ukraine was transformed into the so-called -Ramstein 2.0-. This means that Ukraine's allies move to providing military aid mainly not on a bilateral basis, but in the activities of the respective coalitions. Their goal is to strengthen coordination, systematization and, as a result, increase the volume of international military aid. All needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in weapons, military equipment and personnel training are divided into 8 directions of coalitions:• aviation capabilities;• sea capabilities;• integrated air and missile defense;• artillery;• armored vehicles and maneuverability;• drones;• mining;• IT. Each coalition was headed by the leader countries that coordinate their work. At the same time, some allies assumed leading commitments in several coalitions at once. For example, the United States is the leader of the Air Capability Coalition and the Artillery Coalition, France - the Integrated Air Defense and Missile Defense Coalition and the Artillery Coalition, Germany - the Armored and Maneuverable Coalition and the Integrated Missile Defense and Missile Defense Coalition, Great Britain - the Maritime Capability Coalition and the Drone Coalition. Also, the leading countries in various coalitions became: Denmark, Estonia, Italy, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Poland. Priorities remain: The Drone Coalition has involved 16 countries working in the field of unmanned systems. The IT coalition, which provides communication tools, software solutions and computer equipment, has united 14 countries. The Demining Coalition has 21 countries that focus on military and humanitarian demining. Efforts to attract new countries to participate in coalitions are ongoing. France, in addition to chairing the aforementioned coalitions, joined 5 more initiatives. The Czech Republic and Spain also became members of 6 coalitions, in particular the Coalition of Integrated Air Defense and ABM. Denmark, Belgium and Sweden joined 5 coalitions, including the Air Capability Coalition. The ultimate goal of all coalitions is to provide the fighters of the defense forces of Ukraine on the front line with Western equipment and weapons. In addition, working in coalitions involves strengthening interoperability with NATO, which brings us closer to membership in the Alliance. As reported by ArmyInform, the IT coalition for Ukraine accumulated 482 million euros in 2024.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/27/u-minoborony-poyasnyly-yak-koalicziyi-derzhav-partneriv-posylyuyut-syly-oborony-ukrayiny/	2024-12-27T04:03:41-08:00

Transferred from a tractor to a tank -Nadyukha-: how a mechanic-driver who grew champignons -tamed- ...	ArmyInform spoke with the serviceman when the brigade was taken out for recovery after more than a year in the active combat zone. In December 2022, he joined the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. He first mastered work on the T-72 tank, and then went to study in Germany, where he got to know the Leopard 1A5 tanks. Originally from Cherkassy. 48 years old. He had military service behind him. -I learned about technology in civilian life - that's how I switched from a tractor to a tank,- the interlocutor says with a smile. But, recalling his civilian life, he notes with nostalgia: — And he also grew champignons in boxes for sale. That was my main income, I had about 20 thousand every month, - Stepan shares. Studying in Germany lasted one and a half months. Understanding with foreign instructors and the teaching level is at a high level, the interlocutor states and adds: - Before that, we traveled on the -72s-. And when they switched to Leopard, it was as if they switched to a foreign car! I liked it. Better in operation. Worked comfortably. There was nothing complicated. After training in Germany, immediately to the area of ​​combat missions, to the Kupyan direction, it was September 2023. The most difficult thing, Stepan recalls, was when the positions were shelled with a 120-caliber mortar: - We went to work, we worked. Only the dugouts were approached - and they began to cover us. Not far away, two meters away, there were 20 parishes. You are sitting, your heart is pounding, the dugout is shaking. Stepan continues to share his memories: — Once, when we were leaving for the position, we were heavily covered. It was in the summer of 2024. We exchanged -Nadyukha- in the Kupyansk direction. Mostly they worked from closed positions. The sky was almost clear. But as soon as they left, -Lancet- immediately arrived. Everything worked out. But from half past five in the morning to 4:30 p.m., we crawled along the landing. A total of 12 hours, - says Stepan about one of the difficult departures. And the most delicious practice against the enemy was on November 7, 2024 - they repelled an enemy counterattack. — From 5:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., six units worked, one after the other. We didn't even have time to serve the -zucchini-. But they fought back. And they did not go further. Then, during two weeks, the total consumption of ammunition was 222 shells. It is a lot, very much&#8230; Fortunately, there were no losses to the crew of the tank with which Stepan works. I ask what is the secret of such survivability of the crew. The military man answers succinctly: - We understand each other, we work harmoniously. Or maybe it's just flattered&#8230; After a year and two months of rotation in the area of ​​combat missions, the brigade is on a well-deserved rest, assigned to recovery. Stepan calls it succinctly: -you are going to fresh land.- The military man managed to spend a few days at home, in his native Cherkasy region. — Most of all during the war, I wanted to see my family&#8230; My youngest child turns four on January 3. Daughter Ulya, - Stepan says warmly. Meanwhile, I realize that this man joined the Defense Forces when the child was only a year old. Stepan is the father of three children. He has two sons — 28-year-old Volodymyr and 13-year-old Oleksandr. -And there's Alina, I'm already a grandfather,- the serviceman smiles. Traditionally, we ask what a serviceman would advise civilians who, for various reasons, did not join the ranks of the Defense Forces. He answers as follows: -If everyone left now, as we left then, instead of hiding in bars, then we would have already won this war,- the army man says with sadness in his voice, but states that the army needs both people and equipment . In the end, the military man recalls the most difficult and the most frightening sortie, his first sortie in the Svativ region: - The order came to work out the enemy's position, which was in the shape of the letter Z. They dug in there - we had to cover them. They drove in, covered up, drove back. And then it was very scary. I can't stand it and ask: - And what helped you fight, in the end, with this fear? — -Our Father.- I read the prayer and drove on. - he says with a smile.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/27/peresiv-z-traktora-na-tank-nadyuha-yak-mehanik-vodij-yakyj-vyroshhuvav-shampinjony-pryruchyv-leopard/	2024-12-26T20:55:56-08:00
The weapon of victory. What is known about BBM -Dozor-: about the evolution of domestic armored vehi...	Currently, the fleet of specialized special vehicles of the Defense Forces of Ukraine includes armored vehicles of both foreign and domestic production. About the history of the creation of two of them - the Dozor BBM family and the updated version of the Oncilla armored personnel carrier, which was recently codified and put into operation by the Ministry of Defense, about which reported ArmyInform, the correspondent asked a researcher of military equipment and weapons, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the department of humanitarian sciences of the National Academy of Ground Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny Andrii Haruk. — Indeed, Andrii Ivanovich, it seems paradoxical to a certain extent, but while producing powerful tanks and the world's largest aircraft, the Ukrainian SSR could not boast of mass production of wheeled vehicles for the Soviet army. Well, we can only recall the LuAZ-967M amphibious vehicles manufactured at the Lutsk Automobile Plant, a kind of relatives of the civilian -Volyn girls-, which in the Soviet army witty jokers called -BMW- - -Volyn combat vehicles-. - The situation began to change after the collapse of the USSR and the restoration of Ukraine's independence. Already in the 90s, using the technical documentation of the BTR-80 wheeled armored personnel carrier, improved BTR-94 and BTR-3 armored personnel carriers were created. But the development of light wheeled armored vehicles had to be started from scratch. The state of affairs was simplified by the presence of a powerful design center in Ukraine — the Kharkiv Design Bureau of Mechanical Engineering named after O.O. Morozova (HKBM). Here, in the early 2000s, the design of a family of special-purpose vehicles for both the military and civilian sectors began. At the same time, two options were created: a multi-purpose non-armored vehicle for dual purposes for civilian and military use (-Dozor-A-) and a military armored vehicle (-Dozor-B-). — And how much time passed from the design idea to the presentation of the prototype? How original were they? — The first demonstration samples of Dozor-A and Dozor-B were first demonstrated in Kyiv at the exhibition -Weapons and Security - 2004- in October 2004. Parts of the BTR-80 suspension were used in their design, but in all other respects the machines were completely original. -Dozor-A- was demonstrated as a pick-up truck with a four-door cabin designed for 5 people and a cargo platform that could carry 2 tons of cargo or 6 people. In the roof of the cabin there was a hatch on which a machine gun could be installed. The curb weight of the equipped car was 3.5 tons. Three engine options were offered — diesels with a power of 122, 136 and 197 hp. The maximum speed of the four-wheel drive car reached 120 km/h. On the Dozor-A base, it was proposed to create a whole series of special purpose vehicles - police, collector, sanitary, technical assistance vehicle, etc., as well as trucks with a carrying capacity from 2 to 6 tons. But Dozor-A never found buyers. But -Dozor-B- developed further, and its evolution before the start of production lasted 10 years. — And in what, Professor, did it consist? Reveal the details. — From a technical point of view, Dozor-B is a two-axle all-wheel drive armored car with a hood layout. Its body is divided into two compartments: engine and transmission and crew. The motor-transmission compartment is located in the front part of the case. It houses the engine with its service systems, the transmission, the main steering elements, the braking system, as well as elements of the air conditioning and heating systems of the crew compartment. The crew compartment occupies the central and aft parts of the hull. In front of it are the driver's and commander's workplaces, behind them - the gunner's workplace, and in the stern - a landing compartment designed for 6 people. The hull has two side doors (for the driver and commander. — Ed.) and one aft door (for the landing party. — Ed.). In the front wall of the hull there are windows made of armored glass, and in the sides of the landing compartment there are six embrasures for firing from small arms. Airborne soldiers have periscopes to observe the battlefield. - And how did the designers take care of the protection of the crew and paratroopers? - The Dozoru-B hull is made of Polish-made Armstall 500 armor steel. It protects against armor-piercing small arms bullets fired from a distance of 30 m, as well as fragments of a 152-mm high-explosive projectile from a distance of 50 m. From the inside, the armored case is additionally reinforced with several layers of Kevlar. Armored window glass provides the same level of protection as the body. The bottom of the case has a rounded shape, which increases protection in the event of a mine detonation. However, in general, the level of anti-mine protection of -Dozor-B- does not fully meet modern requirements. The armored car is equipped with a filter ventilation unit, air conditioning and a heating system. - Now it's logical to move on to the propulsion system. What engine is installed on this BBM? - The engine is a four-stroke four-cylinder liquid-cooled Deutz BF 4M 1013 FC 190 hp diesel. The gearbox is a hydromechanical five-speed automatic Allison LCT 1000. Problems with the supply of engines from the German company Deutz led to the search for alternative options for the power plant. Five engine options were considered, but in the end, all manufactured Dozor-B armored cars were equipped with Deutz diesels. The armored car was equipped with a R-173M radio station, an AVSK-1 intercom, and SN-3003 -Basalt- satellite navigation equipment. — You already mentioned above that the evolution of these transport platforms continued for a decade. What did it consist of? - The first version of Dozor-B, known as the -B1320 package-, appeared in 2004. In 2007, it was displayed at the IDEX-2007 exhibition in Abu Dhabi. The armored car was actively offered for export, but no buyers were found. In 2014-2015, -Dozor-B- was created in the second version - -B1320-1/B1320А assembly-. It is distinguished by a rearranged landing compartment (the capacity of the machine has increased from 9 to 10 people), a more powerful winch (6800 kg instead of 4100 kg), the presence of boxes for tools, spare parts and personal belongings of the crew on the sides of the body, increased from 146 to 180 l fuel tank capacity , the presence of a smoke curtain installation system, an automatic fire extinguishing system, an updated satellite system CH-3003M navigation system, Polish-made radio station and other improvements. —A combat vehicle cannot be unarmed. What options were offered to potential customers? — For Dozor-B, about ten weapon options were offered, some of which were actually tested, and some of which existed only on paper. The variant with a remote-controlled installation with a 12.7-mm NSVT-12.7 machine gun (or its Ukrainian -clone- KT-12.7), created on the basis of the commander's turret of the T-64A tank, was considered basic. The device has a PZU-7 periscopic monocular sight. The range of vertical aiming angles of the machine gun is from −3 to 68°. The ammunition includes 450 bullets (three tapes of 150 bullets). A simpler alternative was the installation of a 30-mm automatic grenade launcher KBA-117 (Ukrainian copy of AGS-17) on the turret. Two variants of remote-controlled Blik modules were tested on Dozor-B. At the ADEX-2014 exhibition, which took place in September 2014 in Baku, an armored car with the Blik-2 module armed with a 12.7-mm machine gun, a 30-mm automatic grenade launcher and 81-mm smoke grenade launchers was demonstrated. And in the spring of 2016, at the SOFEX-2016 exhibition in Amman, Dozor-B was shown with the Blik-2M module, which, in addition to the machine gun and automatic grenade launcher, also has the Korsar ATGM launcher. Another version of the remote-controlled module was the Cyborg ABM with a 12.7-mm machine gun and a 40-mm UAG-40 automatic grenade launcher. — As far as I know, the developers of these machines offered quite interesting and original solutions for their weapons. What did they consist of? — A rather interesting weapon option proposed for Dozor-B was the Viy module with a 23-mm twin-barreled GSH-23L aviation cannon (ammunition set of 250 shells) and an optical television sight OTS- 20.01. In February 2021, there were reports of the design of a tank destroyer based on the -Dozoru-B- base. It was supposed to be armed with the -Bar'er- ATGM (unified by the RK-2S and RK-2OF missiles with the portable -Stugna- ATGM). The ammunition of ten missiles was located in two drums. The drums were recharged through hatches in the sides of the machine. The two-charge launcher in the firing position was placed inside the hull, and in the combat position it was raised through a hatch in the roof. As far as is known, this tank destroyer did not leave the project stage. Instead, another missile system based on Dozor-B was embodied in metal. In the summer of 2021, a prototype of the -Speka- light jet flamethrower system was demonstrated. It uses rockets with a thermobaric warhead, and the principle of operation is similar to the Russian -Buratino- and -Solntsepek- systems, but it is much lighter than them. RS-122TB projectiles were created by the State Joint Stock Holding Company -Artem-. This 122 mm caliber projectile is 1450 mm long, has a starting mass of 28.5 kg (the warhead weighs 11.5 kg) and a firing range of 7 km. The State Enterprise -Shepetiv Repair Plant- became the integrator of the system. In the -Dozoru-B- building, which has no roof, a swivel cabinet with a package of guides for 10 RS-122TB shells was installed. A large hatch was made in the rear wall of the case, through which rockets are loaded and powder gases are released during firing. Under the aft part of the hull, two outriggers are added, which ensure the stability of the machine in the firing position. Potentially, the Dozoru-B chassis could also be used for other special purpose vehicles. In particular, in 2021, it was considered as a base for placing elements of the Obolon-A artillery battery (division) automated control complex.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/27/zbroya-peremogy-shho-vidomo-pro-bbm-dozor-pro-evolyucziyu-vitchyznyanyh-avtopanczernykiv/	2024-12-26T20:38:39-08:00
Destroys historical monuments, but blames Ukraine: a fake Russian video from UNESCO is circulating o...	However, UNESCO did not publish such a video on its official resources. And Mehtilda Ressler, who is no longer the director of the World Heritage Center, has never made such a statement. As it turned out, the video was created from content from open sources, which tells about something completely different. In addition, the acting governor of the Kursk region Khinshtein said that on December 22, as a result of rocket attacks in Rylsk, 17 objects of cultural heritage were damaged, accusing the Armed Forces of Ukraine. However, the extent of the damage that Hinstein says is actually minimal, and the circumstances of its occurrence remain unconfirmed. Contrary to these statements, Russia is actively destroying Ukrainian cultural heritage. As of December 2024, 1,222 damaged monuments in 18 regions were recorded in Ukraine. In November, Russia carried out 43 new attacks on historical and cultural monuments, in particular in Zaporizhzhia, Odesa and Khmelnytskyi regions. In the Kharkiv region, for example, the enemy damaged 322 such objects, in the Kyiv region and the city of Kyiv — 81. The most recent case was the shelling of the Mykolaiv Church in Kyiv on December 20. Ukraine insists on an international investigation of these acts of cultural vandalism, which is a violation of international law. Russia spreads this kind of misinformation for several reasons. First, in this way, the aggressor country is trying to shift the focus from the destruction it is causing to Ukrainian cultural heritage, to blaming Ukraine. This helps create the illusion of moral equality between the aggressor and the victim. Hostile propaganda appeals to emotions, using themes of cultural and spiritual heritage to mobilize support among its own population. Such disinformation justifies Russia's aggressive actions as -protection- of its historical and spiritual heritage. With such messages, Agitprop also wants to raise doubts in the international community about the credibility of Ukrainian accusations of war crimes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/27/rujnuye-pamyatky-istoriyi-ale-zvynuvachuye-ukrayinu-v-merezhi-gulyaye-rosijske-fejkove-video-vid-yunesko/	2024-12-26T20:19:18-08:00

The enemy is planning a propaganda campaign on the anniversary of the Yalta Conference	This is reported by a> Center of national resistance. For this purpose, the Russians plan to involve their agents of influence in the world, who, by their presence at these actions, should shape the image of the Russian Federation as a country that is the main fighter against Nazism. In such a narrative, the current fascist Russian Federation itself can determine who is a -Nazi- in the world, and this allegedly gives it the right to invade other sovereign states. In February, the Russians are planning a telecast in honor of the anniversary of the conference in Yalta. The telebridge should take place between the studios and Simferopol and the studios in Great Britain, France and the USA. On it, the occupiers plan to spread messages about Nazism in Ukraine and that the modern world order is outdated.

In this way, Moscow wants to increase the Russian Federation's competitiveness in order to expand sales markets and minimize the impact of Western sanctions. And by lowering the prices of goods, the Kremlin is trying to increase the dependence of African countries on Russian imports. Russia resorts to similar methods when it helps some countries of the continent to implement nuclear programs, turning these projects into a long-term dependence on Moscow's help. Subsidies can become part of broader agreements, which will include logistics investments, trade development, etc. Most likely, it is about countries that already have close ties with the Russian Federation due to the long-term presence of Russian mercenaries (CAR, Mali, Burkina Faso), and about states with respect to which the Russian Federation is taking another step towards rapprochement (Algeria, South Africa, Egypt and others).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/stalo-vidomo-dlya-chogo-rf-zaprovadzhuye-pilgy-dlya-pereviznykiv-produkcziyi-v-afryku/	2024-12-26T08:33:07-08:00

The investigation established numerous facts of the senior lieutenant's use of non-statutory measures of influence over his subordinates. In particular, in the last days of February 2024 in Dnipro Oblast, he beat a soldier because he was intoxicated. Having been kicked in the face, the officer did not calm down and ordered his subordinates to bring the drunken soldier into the room and strip him to humiliate him. -After that, the officer continued to beat the subordinate. A month later, while already in Avdiivka of the Donetsk region, the senior lieutenant beat the same soldier again and ordered the servicemen to lift the beaten man from the ground, place him on a wooden structure in the form of a cross, and tie his hands to it,- the SBI said. The latter was in this position for about four hours. Another case of a soldier being beaten was also recorded. This happened in February 2024 in Dnipro Oblast. The officer had a dispute with one of his subordinates due to the publication on the Internet of a video recording in which another soldier of this brigade talked about their improper living conditions. -After that, the senior lieutenant deliberately hit him in the face. Also, in May 2024 in Kharkiv Oblast, he beat another of his subordinates due to dissatisfaction with the form of addressing him as -you,- the report says. The investigation continues to establish other facts of violence against soldiers in the brigade. The senior lieutenant is suspected of the use of violence by a military official against a subordinate, committed under martial law conditions and of voluntarily leaving the unit (Part 5 of Article 426-1, Article 407 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). Currently, the officer is hiding from the investigation, after his arrest the investigators will forgive the court to send him to custody.

The latest development for the Armed Forces: The Ministry of Defense is testing the control point of...	About informs December 26 MoU. Among the requirements of the Ministry of Defense for the control center is maximum autonomy, equipping with modern means of communication and EW. The new model of equipment should provide control of units of unmanned systems under any weather conditions, both in stationary conditions and during movement. -The checkpoint cabin will be equipped with automated workplaces with an interactive panel. The commander will have the opportunity to quickly analyze the situation and promptly make decisions during the management of the units, which will increase the effectiveness of their use,- the statement said. The basis for this innovative development is planned to be a specialized vehicle with increased cross-country ability. An all-wheel drive car must solve the task of sufficient maneuverability and movement of the off-road control point. The stages of project implementation are supported by the Main Department of Defense Innovations of the Ministry of Defense. -Unmanned units have scaled up significantly and require specialized means of combat control. Domestic gunsmiths offered a technical solution to this request,- said the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Ivan Havryliuk. According to him, the new model of equipment will be tested and will be evaluated by commanders of combat units. -If the development meets the requirements, we will codify it and it will be able to go into serial production. We have to technologically outclass the enemy,- he said. As ArmiyaInform reported, one of the main directions of the reform of the Ministry of Defense in state procurement from the State Rear Operator was the digitization of processes related to the provision of the Armed Forces and the optimization of the internal work of the agency.

A cynical diversion scheme: the violators disguised themselves as a funeral cortege of a fallen sold...	This was reported by Western Regional Office of the State Border Service of Ukraine. The ferrying scheme was planned by two Transcarpathians living in the border region. For a monetary reward of $18,000, they undertook to deliver two residents of Uzhhorod to the border. The crossing of the state border was planned in the area of ​​Knyaginya settlement of Uzhhorod district. In order to transport the -clients- through the checkpoints, the shippers resorted to the most cynical plan. They pretended to be on their way as part of a funeral cortege that accompanied the body of a fallen soldier to the burial place. Offenders even hung a national flag from the window of the car in which the border violators were being transported. However, the tricks of the shippers were exposed. The operatives waited until the procession ended and began to arrest the offenders. During it, one of the smugglers did not comply with the legal demands of the law enforcement officers to stop and made an attempt to run into the border outfit. The -clients- of the dealer were thrown out of the car and ordered to run away. The response team, together with operatives, apprehended the fugitives and their smugglers and brought them to the border unit. In the actions of the shippers, they see signs of a criminal offense under Part 3 of Article 332 of the Criminal Code -Illegal transportation of persons across the state border of Ukraine.- The corresponding message was sent to the address of the Uzhhorod District Department of the National Police. They were also prosecuted under Article 185-10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure -Malicious disobedience to a lawful order or demand of a serviceman or an employee of the State Border Service of Ukraine or a member of a public organization for the protection of public order and the state border.- Both -clients- will have to answer to the law for attempting to illegally cross the state border. The court will make a decision in their case.

In the Russian Federation, inflationary processes are accelerating	reports this Service of foreign intelligence of Ukraine. Annual inflation is expected to peak in April 2025. We will remind that the October forecast of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation predicted inflation in 2024 in the range of 8–8.5%. At the same time, there is currently no inflation forecast from the regulator for 2025. Representatives of the Russian banking sector state that today the Russian economy is -developing in not quite normal conditions-: -We have large budget expenditures for defense, at least 30%, as well as a huge number of sanctions.- They also admit that the restrictions on the Russian Federation -complicate and make payments more expensive-, and the acceleration of inflation is associated with both the presence of a large money supply and the -increase in tariffs of natural monopolies-. Inflation rates (real inflation in Russia — 25–30%), as well as the lack of reaction of Russian banks to the decision of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation to maintain the discount rate, indicate a high probability of strengthening monetary policy by the Russian regulator as early as January 2025. However, any actions of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation will not save the Russian economy, since there are no more correct moves left. We remind you, employees of the State Bureau of Investigation reported about the suspicion of the director of an enterprise from Kryvyi Rih, which in 2023 supplied one of the military units with 20,000 sleeping bags of low quality.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/u-rf-pryskoryuyutsya-inflyaczijni-proczesy/	2024-12-26T01:52:27-08:00

-Kremlin mouthpieces-: 55 propagandists who incite war	About it announced on the website of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. GUR of the Ministry of Defense and the Center for Countering Disinformation of the NSDC announced the launch of a new section of the portal War &amp; Sanctions under the name -Kremlin mouthpieces-. This section contains a list of Russian propagandists and media managers who actively spread disinformation and manipulate public opinion. This move is part of a broader strategy to combat information warfare that the Kremlin is waging through media resources, Russian propagandists and media managers, who have global influence. Propaganda produced by the Russian government justifies violence, glorifies the armed forces and calls for aggression and war crimes. It also actively spreads hatred and dehumanization of Ukraine. In order to counter this, the GUR and the CPD publish the first list of 55 people to know and block in order to stop their activities. As reported by ArmyInform, Security Service of Ukraine collected evidence base for six more traitors who fought against Ukrainian troops in Donetsk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/rupory-kremlya-55-propagandystiv-yaki-rozpalyuyut-vijnu/	2024-12-26T01:21:09-08:00
Defense procurement from the Ministry of Defense: how the DOT-Chain system is changing the provision...	This is stated in messages MOU. In particular, significant work has been done to overcome the so-called -paper army- — redundant bureaucracy that takes away time and energy from the military. For this, the DOT IT department developed and implemented the DOT-Chain system from scratch. Currently, it operates in the field of providing the Armed Forces with food products. DOT-Chain has significantly accelerated and simplified processes for suppliers and the military, in particular: The system has a confirmation of compliance with the security level of KSZI. In addition, DOT is in the final stage of obtaining the ISO/IEC 27001 international information security certificate. -Digitalization does not just simplify processes — it radically changes approaches to the provision of our military. Thanks to modern technologies, such as the DOT-Chain system, we are already seeing concrete results today: reducing bureaucracy and improving the quality of service to the military. This allows the army to focus on the main thing - the defense of our state. Every hryvnia directed to the Armed Forces should work for our victory, and digital solutions are becoming our reliable ally in this direction,- said Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. Among the important achievements of the IT team, it is possible to single out the implementation of various accounting and document management systems, on the basis of which DOT is developing its own ERP system, as well as the development of infrastructure and information security systems. An important step was the implementation of ICS MOU SAP, which, together with other achievements, significantly improved the internal processes of DOT.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/oboronni-zakupivli-vid-minoborony-yak-systema-dot-chain-zminyuye-zabezpechennya-zsu/	2024-12-26T01:07:32-08:00
Professional brain eaters: - political tricks - drive Russians into attacks and force them to commit...	Oleksandr Borodin, spokesman, told about this on the air of the -Edyny Novyny- telethon Third Assault Brigade. According to Oleksandr Borodin, the occupiers' motivation to fight is really low. However, he notes the good professional level of work of their -politicians-. -They talk about the fact that Ukrainian captivity is the most terrible thing that can happen. About alleged torture and everything else. That is why it is very difficult to take prisoners,- said the spokesman of the Third Assault Brigade. Increasing the exchange fund is very difficult, he admits. Enemy infantry, fearing capture, often simply settle accounts with their lives. -Russian servicemen sometimes undermine themselves. That is, the internal propaganda work works for them. It is taken very seriously. Prisoners talk about it too. They tell how they are taught, how they are explained. Everything was done in order to minimize the number of prisoners on their side,- said Oleksandr Borodin. As reported ArmyInform, soldiers of the 80th Airborne Assault Brigade of the DSHV of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were captured four Russian soldiers in Kurshchyna, who shared their impressions of the Juche fighters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/profesijni-pozhyrachi-mizkiv-politruky-zhenut-rosiyan-v-ataky-i-zmushuyut-do-samogubstv/	2024-12-26T00:52:30-08:00

The cost of the sleeping bags was 30 million hryvnias, but the examination established that the product did not meet the technical requirements, which did not allow them to be used for their intended purpose. In particular, according to the conclusion of the examination, the composition of the fabric did not meet the stated requirements, the sleeping bags also lacked mandatory elements: a fleece lining and a layer of special fabric that does not allow air to pass through. The military unit filed a lawsuit in court for reimbursement of fines in the amount of 6 million hryvnias and replacement of sleeping bags with quality ones, which was fully satisfied. Currently, the director of the company is subject to preventive measures. A legal evaluation of the actions of military officials of the National Guard of Ukraine will be provided based on the results of the research of the collected evidence. The investigation is ongoing.

This is stated in his statement at sites of the White House. -In the early hours of Christmas, Russia launched waves of missiles and drones against Ukrainian cities and critical energy infrastructure. The goal of this outrageous attack was to cut off the Ukrainian people's access to heat and electricity in the winter and put the security of the power system at risk,- the US president said. Joe Biden emphasized that the Ukrainian people deserve to live in peace and security, and the United States and the international community must continue to support Ukraine until it wins victory over Russian aggression. He noted that the United States has provided hundreds of air defense missiles to Ukraine in recent months, and more are on the way. -I have instructed the Department of Defense to continue a sharp increase in arms supplies to Ukraine, and the United States will continue to work tirelessly to strengthen Ukraine's position in its defense against Russian forces,- the US president concluded.

About this on the air of the TV channel -We are Ukraine- spoke the spokesman of the Military Captain of the 3rd rank of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Dmytro Pletenchuk. According to him, the enemy used at least two units from the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, which produced -Caliber-. -It is impossible to say that it came as a surprise. Because when ships go out to sea, you have to look at the sky. And given that you could see the preparations for the strike, it was logical that the ships would also be used in this case. We were ready for this,- Dmytro Pletenchuk assured. He said that the occupiers operate according to a similar scheme. They leave the base point in order to strike, and immediately turn back, under the cover of their air defense on the shore. -We should not forget about this danger. However, so far I have not seen any information about the successful use of Calibers. And I haven't seen her for a long time. Which, in principle, confirms the thesis that the main purpose of using this tool is to load Ukrainian air defense and nothing more,- summed up the spokesperson of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. How reported ArmyInform, as of the morning of December 26, there is one enemy ship in the Black Sea, which is a carrier of cruise missiles Caliber with a total salvo of up to 4 missiles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/u-vms-zsu-rozpovily-pro-taktyku-strilyaj-i-tikaj-rosijskogo-flotu-v-chornomu-mori/	2024-12-26T00:00:08-08:00

The video of the combat operation was released on December 26 on the channel of the 28th OMBr brigade. After unsuccessful attacks by small groups, the enemy changed tactics and decided to advance in groups of up to 20 people. But the only thing that has changed is the number of losses. And the recent assault is a vivid example of that. Taking advantage of the fog, the enemy group approached the positions of the Ukrainian infantrymen. However, the -knights- of the 2nd mechanized battalion of the 28th OMBr met them with heavy fire. Constantly changing positions and effectively using the arsenal, Ukrainian soldiers destroyed most of the occupiers. Part of the occupiers were destroyed at close range, one was smoked out of the trench with grenades, and others began to run away or pretend to be eliminated, but the -Kurt&amp;Company- drones found everyone . The only one who decided to surrender turned out to be an Egyptian citizen.

Live bait and shelters from artillery: the SSO told about the tactics of the North Koreans in Kurshc...	About this told in the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The next part of the records of Private Gyeong Hong Jong reveals quite interesting methods of combating Ukrainian drones and artillery used by the North Korean military. In the notebook of the North Korean special forces officer killed in Kurshchyna, he describes how to shoot down a Ukrainian drone alive. In his notebook, when he was still alive before the meeting with the SSO operators, private Hyong Hong Jong wrote down tactics for shooting down a UAV and hiding places from Ukrainian artillery. It is currently unknown whether this is an authentic North Korean tactic, or the Russians taught them that way. But this tactic uses live bait. The SSO presented a full transcript of another entry from the trophy notebook. The recording is completed with illustrations from a soldier of the SSO of the DPRK: How to eliminate a drone When detecting a drone, you need to create a trio (3 people), at the same time, the one who lures the drone keeps a distance of 7 meters, and those who shoot - 10-12 meters. If the one who is baiting stands, the drone will also stop its movement. At this moment, the one who shoots — eliminates (the drone). How to avoid the zone of artillery fire In case of getting into the zone of fire, after appointing the point of the next meeting (group), you need to diverge small groups and get out of the firing zone. Another way: since the artillery does not fire at the same point, you can hide at the point of (previous) hit, and then get out of the shelling zone. -35-naslidky-rankovogo-masovanogo-obstrilu-harkivshhyny/-> in the first part of the deciphered notebook, author — Hyong Hong Jong — wishes another soldier Song Ji Myung (or Yong) a happy birthday.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/zhyva-prymanka-i-hovanky-vid-artyleriyi-u-sso-rozpovily-pro-taktyku-pivnichnokorejcziv-na-kurshhyni/	2024-12-25T22:41:20-08:00

How the self-propelled gun -Bohdana- demonstrates itself in battle: the gunner of the 48th brigade t...	The 48th separate artillery brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was one of the first in Ukraine to receive arming divisions SAU -Bohdana-. And now this formidable weapon is destroying the occupiers in the Donetsk direction. Chief Sergeant of the First Battery of the Self-Propelled Artillery Division of the 48th Brigade, Dmytro, told ArmyInform about the capabilities and combat work at the front, the number of shots fired per year, and whether the -Bohdan- can withstand the 203-mm blows of the Rashist -Pion- Dmytro: -Our division was one of the first in Ukraine to receive ACS -Bohdana-. This happened at the end of 2023, and the alignment of our unit began immediately. Before that, the crews underwent enhanced professional training, adopted the equipment and further practical tests. Our combat calculations actually -run-in- the self-propelled guns on the training ground from scratch, learned to aim and strike from weapons. After combat coordination, we were immediately sent to the front. -Bohdana- is accurate, reliable and modern. Its combat capabilities are impressive, especially here, in the Donetsk direction, in real combat conditions. Self-propelled gun - hits the target very accurately. Usually, the target is hit from the second shot. According to TTX, the declared fire range is up to 42 km with a high-explosive fragmentation projectile, and an active-reactive projectile can reach the enemy up to 60 km. Here in Donetsk region, our artillery calculations worked on the enemy up to a maximum of 30 km. They destroyed all the military targets of the Rashists, which were reported to us by intelligence. According to confirmed data alone, these are hundreds of combat vehicles, armored personnel carriers, BMPs, tanks, artillery systems, defense structures, warehouses with ammunition and armored personnel carriers. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, I have worked on the Soviet Pion self-propelled guns and the German Panzerhaubitze 2000 installation. I will say that these systems are far from Bogdana in terms of firing accuracy. Weight - 28 tons, range on the highway - 800 km, cross-country - 300 km. The car is quite lively: on the highway - 80 km/h, on the field, of course, the speed is a little lower. When working at the positions on the self-propelled guns, it is mandatory to install the REBs. To counter the operation of enemy FPV drones. There are special mobile fire teams that are armed with anti-drone guns and -shooting guns-. Artobsluga also with small arms. And of course, camouflage and anti-lance nets. Somehow an unpleasant situation happened. Bogdana was attacked by more than 5 enemy kamikaze drones. The armored cabin of the ACS took the hits. The armor survived, the guys inside, of course, were contused, but they will remain alive. Our -SAUShka- withstands even an explosion on an anti-tank mine. Everything was fine with the crew that day, just an injury. In war, different things can happen, you have to be ready for everything. -Bohdana- is really very well protected by reservation. Katsap 203 mm -Peonies- inflicted fire damage on us with cluster shells. Yes, the car was cut into pieces, but nothing critical. Guys are alive and that's the main thing. How does a typical working day of a -Bohdana- ACS service ideally go? The coordinates of the target are received, the combat mission is recognized. The crew practices deploying to a firing position, aiming, firing, adjusting fire, firing, firing again if necessary, and then quickly collapsing and moving to a -hideout- or to another position. This is a clear algorithm of actions. These skills are extremely necessary for the calculations of self-propelled guns, because after shooting you need not to come under enemy counter-battery fire and safely leave the area of ​​the combat mission. The safety of the crew and the preservation of the -Bogdana- in a combat-ready condition is a priority. It usually takes two to three minutes for the crew to practice one combat mission and the artillery makes the first shot. Gunners assure that they can do it even faster. In general, the speed of the ACS is also its big advantage. In one incomplete year of combat work, the -Bohdana- self-propelled guns, near which gunners worked, fired more than 3,000 shots. At other installations, the number has already exceeded 2,000 in some parts. Like any other equipment, -Bohdana- can break down. The crew is not allowed to do any repair and restoration work. After all, self-propelled guns are covered by the manufacturer's certification guarantee. Therefore, all -repair manipulations- are carried out by the manufacturer's representatives in a safe and designated place. The crew only delivers the car from the positions. Again, so that no one knew about it, let alone saw it. One of the common technical malfunctions of the -Bohdana- is the wedge of the engine and the replacement of the operational rings on the gun. Electronics hangs sometimes. But the factory workers promptly repair everything so that the machine can return to combat work as soon as possible. Recruitment for the brigade is also currently underway. Therefore, every Ukrainian can join the team and work on a modern Ukrainian-made artillery installation. -The situation with replenishment of personnel is not simple. But recently we managed to attract several talented people to our battery. This became possible thanks to changes in the legislation. Since the fall, conscripts and volunteer reservists can choose a military unit for service without going to the territorial recruitment and social support centers. It certainly helped,- says Dmytro. — We are looking for purposeful people who can learn quickly. Here, on the spot, we will teach them the specifics of working on the -Bohdana- air defense system, there are training centers where the military will receive professional training.

Alone at the position for 36 hours in a row, he repelled enemy assaults: the story of a soldier of t...	How Dmytro single-handedly repelled enemy assaults for 36 hours in a row? But how does he assess the enemy's infantry? The soldier told our correspondent about this: &#8220;Before the army, I worked at a metallurgical plant in the Zaporizhzhia region. Since 2021, he served in the 79th Brigade. Participated in the OOS. And he also met a large-scale invasion in the composition of the 79s. At that time, our unit in the area of ​​the city of Shchastya was performing tasks. I was a MANPADS anti-aircraft gunner and a unit commander. By the way, a soldier from our branch shot down an enemy Su-25 after the start of the invasion. In 2024, I transferred to the Third Assault Brigade. &#8230;There was a case when our department was in position for almost three days. And it so happened that on the first day, the enemy fired at us continuously from barrel artillery, and everyone in the unit was wounded, except for me. One fighter, although he was badly injured, helped me jam enemy drones. And before those who were supposed to replace us came to the position, I had to run to the position myself. Simply put, you do not sleep or eat for 36 hours in a row. You are constantly told which way the enemy is coming from, and you move there, take a firing position and shoot back. The enemy did not stop firing artillery even as their assault group approached. So the katsaps also helped me kill their people. We also had enemy crews with droppers and FPVs working against us. And, of course, enemy infantry stormed us. During that time, they had seven 200s. Some of them managed to run up to a distance of 20 meters to our position. And the last hours before we were changed were very difficult. Already once at night, the batteries on the electronic devices ran out. But they were not fully discharged. &#8230;Artillery fire was coming at us continuously, about every minute a plane arrived. And all this for 3-4 hours, then it fell silent for half an hour and then again. They stopped at night. In principle, we are already used to artillery fire, but we are still adjusting to such a huge number of enemy drones. And their infantry began to storm us from dawn. That is, they accumulated at night, and at dawn they began to climb. That opponent was not too prepared. He had a lot of firearms, but he was just drafted, fresh, literally 2-3 weeks in the service. Their whole tactic was that they would get lost in a bunch and go to the position, hoping that we were all already dead. Those who stormed us were mostly 35-40 years old. &#8230;I will say this to Ukrainian men who are not yet in the army. This is the same reason why you can't roll away from a position. You can't, because the enemy will kill you in the back. So here: these men can come. Only no longer TCC, but Katsaps.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/sam-na-pozycziyi-36-godyn-pospil-vidbyvav-vorozhi-shturmy-istoriya-voyina-tretoyi-shturmovoyi-brygady/	2024-12-25T20:48:52-08:00
-Sea Tiger- sharpens its claws: the German Navy bets on the newest NH90 Sea Tiger helicopter	The phase included various operational scenarios and tests of the aircraft's mission system, including sonar, electro-optical surveillance and targeting systems, as well as weapons. -A total of over 140 flight hours have been logged over the past 11 months and all the helicopter's capabilities have been validated- - Airbus explained Helicopters regarding the course of the tests. According to data by the authors of Defense Post, in 2020, Germany ordered 31 NH90 Sea Tiger helicopters. The value of the contract was €2.7 billion ($2.89 billion). The ordered helicopters will be based on German Navy frigates, thereby replacing the Sea Lynx Mk88A, which entered service in 1981. Currently, the German Navy already operates 18 NH90 Sea Lion military transport helicopters, which were delivered from 2019 to 2023. Sea Tiger is the newest version of NATO's carrier-based helicopter, designed specifically for the needs of the German Navy. The helicopter is designed to fight enemy submarines and surface ships. Distinctive features of the machine are a new electro-optical system and -enhanced electronic support measures-, as well as a submersible sonar, sonar buoys and armament represented by missiles and torpedoes. In addition to combating submarines, additional tasks of the NH90 Sea Tiger helicopters include reconnaissance, search and rescue, as well as the transportation of personnel and cargo. Experts of the defense portal Army Recognition reminded that the NH90, which is also detailed told in one of his publications by our agency, is a twin-engine multi-role medium-sized military helicopter designed in accordance with NATO's requirements for universal and a modern helicopter. It is produced by NHIndustries, a consortium of Airbus Helicopters, Leonardo Helicopters and Fokker Aerostructures. Designed for both land and sea operations, the NH90 is available in two main variants: a tactical transport helicopter (TTH) designed for Army missions such as troop and equipment transport, medical evacuation and utility missions, and a NATO frigate helicopter ( NFH), optimized for naval applications including anti-submarine and anti-sea warfare, search and rescue as well as maritime surveillance. A defining feature of the NH90 is its all-wire flight control system, the first of its kind on a production helicopter. This technology improves flight stability and reduces pilot stress. The airframe is built with extensive use of composite materials, providing a lighter and stronger structure with a reduced radar signature. Its spacious cabin can accommodate up to 20 fully equipped soldiers or 12 medical evacuation stretchers. Since entering service in 2007, the NH90 has been adopted in many countries, including Belgium, Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands. By the beginning of 2023, more than 500 units of aircraft with a flight of more than 400,000 were delivered. hours Despite the advanced design, the helicopter development program faced some challenges, including technical issues and concerns about maintenance and operating costs. In response, NHIndustries has implemented modernization programs to improve the helicopter's performance and reliability. A recent €600 million contract with the NATO Helicopter Management Agency highlights ongoing efforts to modernize the NH90 and extend its service life.

One of the leading actors is blogger Denis Khamov, known for his scandalous videos, including the -Nudist Manifesto- with the requirement to allow the publication of content with naked bodies. In 2022, he also appeared in a propaganda video urging Russians to join the army. Earlier ArmyInform reported about fake Santa Clauses from TCC in Odessa. The propagandists seemed to like this idea.

Someone from the military goes to the bathhouse, someone puts in the laundry or picks up washed clothes, another soldier drinks coffee while waiting for his turn. Volunteers are constantly moving between them - they put dirty clothes in washing machines, hang up washed clothes, take them off and put dry things in bags. There are only three volunteers at the site now - the married couple Serhiy and Elena, as well as a very young girl, Polina. They have to be in time everywhere, so they talk about the initiative to help the military almost constantly. — We have been working in this format for the second year, since November 2023. They saw that the boys needed somewhere to wash, wash their clothes, rest a little - and they organized it, says Serhiy Severyn. Resting here now are only bees that fall asleep for the winter. So the apikhatinka — a special house for bee therapy — is temporarily closed until spring. Despite this, it still smells pleasantly of honey and wax. The God's Couriers volunteer initiative has been active since the beginning of the large-scale invasion. At first, it focused mainly on helping the local civilians of Donetsk region, delivering them food, water and other necessary things, as well as organizing evacuation. Their name is connected with the story of the biblical prophet Elijah, who was fed by ravens during his stay in the desert at the Lord's command: -And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the stream.- (Third Kings 17:6). — That is why our chevron features a raven and the slogan: -At the right time, in the right place.- Because we are the messengers, the couriers who deliver to people what they need most - bread, food, water and everything they need for life, Serhiy explains. Together with Olena and Polina, he mentions dozens of people from all corners of our country who in one way or another joined the volunteer initiative - either by handing over necessary things or by coming to the east of Ukraine and helping here with their work. Pastor Andrii Malov from the -Light of Resurrection- Church, who stood at the very beginnings of this volunteer initiative and is the coordinator of the -Light in the East- mission, is most often mentioned. It was he who, from the very beginning, found things people needed and delivered them to Donetsk region. As soon as the volunteers saw the urgent need of the military in the organization of life, they immediately reacted to it as well. As early as the fall of 2023, they organized a bathhouse and a laundry for servicemen in one of the estates in the front-line town. Initially, it was a mobile -Chaplain's Bath- on wheels near the house, and within a year, thanks to the support of dozens of caring people and associations, a capital stationary building was built. It can accommodate more than 100 people per day. - This is a joint Christian initiative, because Christians cannot be indifferent. God teaches us to bear one another's burdens and to care for those in need. This is how unity between people is formed, because the enemy seeks to divide and, thanks to this, rule over us, instead, the Lord calls us to unity, says Serhiy. A volunteer explains how important community support is to the military. Therefore, this volunteer initiative is needed not only to meet their purely physical needs, but also to provide spiritual support to Ukrainian defenders. — We want boys to understand that they are not alone, that they are not alone. That ordinary people appreciate what they do for them at the front, that ordinary people sympathize with them and want to help. And when there is such a relationship, it becomes easier for the boys, the volunteer emphasizes. The military will find out about the bathhouse and laundry thanks to a billboard placed near the road with an announcement and personal communication, so the initiative does not need special advertising. The complex is already working at the limit of its capacity - about a hundred servicemen visit it every day. It is necessary to wash the things left behind mainly at night, because water and electricity may run out for everything at the same time. In order to dry the washed clothes in the autumn and winter period, the manor has a heated drying room. Everything is organized in such a way as to make the defenders' stay as comfortable as possible. - These are simple, elementary things, but defenders really need them. We have a lounge - you can drink tea or coffee, eat goodies. We don't have time to cook, but the -Volunteers from God- organization from the Church -Design of Christ- helps us, Serhii says. While we are talking, he himself, as well as Olena and Polina manage to put wood in the stove that heats the bathhouse, pour coffee for the guys, take off and hang the washed clothes, put new loads of laundry in several washing machines. The work does not stop even for a moment. A little later, more workers are added - Serhiy's daughter arrives with her husband and several other people. Their work is difficult, but grateful - a tired smile and a kind word of thanks from the defenders are extremely inspiring to work further. By Holy Evening and Christmas, the mood in the manor is particularly high. Volunteers strive to bring to the soldiers a portion of the warmth and kindness of the bright holiday of the incarnation of the Lord. - In the sorrowful time of war, it is a great joy to share the joy of the holiday with your loved ones. And it is a great happiness to be useful, to be God's hands and God's messengers for our defenders, says Serhii. He compares the sacrificial feat of Ukrainian soldiers with Christ's atoning sacrifice. After all, becoming defenders of good and light from the attack of evil and darkness, warriors are likened to the One who came to protect people, taking upon themselves all their faults. - The Lord was born in a simple barn, because there was no other place for Him then. Now our defenders also live in dugouts and dugouts, in which there is no comfort. But we can make them feel our love, our care and make sure that their sacrifice is important to us and that they are not alone in their wanderings, the volunteer emphasizes. Together with all his like-minded people and associates, he is sure of the presence of God in the midst of those who take upon themselves the burden of their neighbor and ease his suffering. For where two are gathered together in His Name, there He is in the midst of them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/25/apihatynka-zsu-bezkoshtovno-do-rizdva-i-povsyakchas-pro-ukrayinskyh-zahysnykiv-dbayut-bozhi-kuryery/	2024-12-25T01:44:37-08:00

Each of them had disposable grenade launchers, they had night vision devices, they had small assault backpacks with them,- shared the impressions of the chief sergeant of the 47th separate mechanized brigade company. According to Oleg Chaus, during the attack on our positions, one group was neutralized, and two groups were entrenched in front of our positions. -Maybe it's some new unit, or maybe it's some support coming to level some of their front lines. And it is very good that our drones, scouts, they noticed in time. And if one of those three groups had not been destroyed, they would have continued their movement,- Oleg Chaus summarized. As reported by > ArmyInform, fighters of the 17th heavy mechanized brigade with the support of other units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine repelled a powerful assault on Kurshchyna, the result of which was the burning of enemy equipment and the stacked bodies of soldiers of the DPRK.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/25/haosytiv-zminyuyut-profi-na-kurshhyni-pochaly-atakuvaty-dobre-pidgotovleni-shturmovyky/	2024-12-25T00:57:14-08:00

However, to issue a biometric passport, which is valid for 10 years, you will have to use this route in the future. Because the LNR will only issue foreign passports of the old model, which are valid for five years. But in both cases, these documents do not allow you to travel anywhere. Because in many countries they will not be accepted.

The data of a war criminal from -gru- annexed Crimea was received	This is reported by Center of National Resistance. Despite all efforts to hide his activities as much as possible and cover his tracks, it is known that Mr. Sadovnik has a military engineering and technical education, he signed his first contract with the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation on August 27, 1999, and at the beginning of 2014 he was transferred to military unit 43292 ( Moscow region, Solnechnogorsk, village of Redino) to the position of senior diving specialist of the group tests A morbid mania to prove his importance to the whole world already in 2016 led him to the special operations forces of the Russian Federation and later to the game of the Russian Federation. The data of the gardener are highlighted in the list of military unit 00317 (317th special operations center (marine), which is located in the city of Sevastopol, Crimea). It is from this time that the psychopathic gardener draws legends for himself, and even in the description drawn up of him by the commander of military unit 43292, a certain Colonel Fufurin appears as the year of birth -1979-, not 1980 as in the passport. It is also worth paying attention to the nationality -Ukrainian- specified in the document. Despite everything, it is worth noting that the captain-lieutenant of the 3rd rank of the gardener has special feelings for the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces. The man keeps a whole gallery of photos with the emblem of the SSO of Ukraine in his phone. Moreover, in 2016, a non-hero gets a werewolf tattoo. We have several volumes of compromising materials for the gardener at our disposal (weapons, numerous mistresses, fraud with funds, -work- with children in the combat sambo federation of the Russian Federation). However, the personal -complexes- of the gardener have no meaning for us and we will leave them for justice. It is important that this person takes a direct part in the so-called svo. This is confirmed by a letter of appeal addressed to the general director of JSC -Northern Press- Kruglikova V.Ya. In it, the gardener asks the mentioned comrade to help equip his unit with drones, which is participating in the war against Ukraine and signs himself as the company commander of military unit 00317, captain of the 3rd rank, I. Sadovnik. It is known that the 317th special operations center of the Russian Federation is involved in the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Moscow's participation in the Syrian conflict in 2015-2017, and a large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The servicemen of this unit are still shelling Ukrainian cities and villages with the help of missile and bomb weapons, which are based on the sea, in aviation and on the ground. In addition, they continue to carry out sabotage, intelligence and subversive operations, both in the real world and in cyberspace. We remind you, 266 combat clashes were recorded during the past 24 hours. The situation at the front remains difficult.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/25/otrymano-dani-voyennogo-zlochynczya-iz-gru-aneksovanogo-krymu/	2024-12-24T22:57:30-08:00

A gift for Christmas: what the Brazilian padre of the International Legion prays for	Before Christmas, he told ArmiyaInform about his service to Christ, comrades-in-arms and the Ukrainian people, and also told about his most desired Christmas present. Like many volunteers from Latin American countries, Father Makariy came to Ukraine following the call of his heart. He speaks Ukrainian well on everyday topics and confidently recites the Lord's Prayer and the Creed also in Ukrainian translation during joint prayer. This is not surprising, because the priest knew a lot about our people even before arriving in Ukraine, as he communicated a lot with representatives of the Ukrainian community in the south of Brazil. It was this good knowledge of Ukrainian culture and history that prompted him to serve as a military chaplain in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. — I grew up among Ukrainians, I know the history of Ukraine and feel the culture and spirit of Ukrainians. I know what evil the Soviet Union brought to your people - the Holodomor of 1932-1933. The archbishop who ordained me to the priesthood was from Poltava, and on the day of my ordination I promised to serve the Lord God, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and I also mentioned serving Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, says Father Makarii. So now the chaplain not only instructs and strengthens the Christian faith of the fighters of the 2nd International Legion from different countries of the world, but also tells them about Ukraine and Ukrainians, introduces them more deeply to the culture and history of our people. -I have a Ukrainian soul,- he smiles. The priest wanted to come to Ukraine back in 2014, but then the position of his parents, who were very worried about his son, prevented him. However, having stopped him from traveling then, they could not stop him now, because the priest felt that he should be here together with Christians from Latin American countries who came to help the Ukrainian people. — I knew that my place was here, that I should be in Ukraine. When I turned to the archbishop with a request to bless me for my journey and ministry, he gladly did so because he shared my sincere support for the Ukrainian people, says the holy father. However, the future military chaplain did not immediately dare to tell his parents about the decision and informed about it already during his stay in Ukraine. He is moved to show his vow and the response of his mother, an Arab Christian from Syria, who supported her son's decision. Over time, the strict father - a serviceman of the Brazilian army - softened. The priest arrived in Ukraine in May, after which he underwent training and training together with all foreign volunteers. Padre Makariy says that he wanted to become a military chaplain, but already in Ukraine he learned that foreigners do not have such an opportunity, so he was ready to continue his service as a medic, saving the lives of soldiers. - I decided that if I can't be a chaplain, I will become a paramedic, and in my spare time I will serve as a priest to everyone who needs it. Therefore, after training, I put on a cassock and served together with other soldiers, says the chaplain. This was noticed by one of the Ukrainian officers who introduced Father Makaria to the Orthodox priest. Together, they helped a padre from Brazil realize his desire to become an official military chaplain of the 2nd International Defense Legion of Ukraine. - It was like receiving a gift from heaven from the Lord himself, Father Makarii says emotionally. — When I was told that I was now a military chaplain of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and could officially serve Christ and my brothers, tears came to my eyes. It was one of the best days of my life. — I was born in Brazil, but for me Ukraine is also my country. When the war is over, I don't want to leave. I want to continue to be in Ukraine, to serve God and the Ukrainian people, because after the war we will have a lot of work, says Father Makarii. Now he instructs and strengthens the Christian faith of the fighters of the 2nd International Legion. Padre Makariy combines priestly service with a vocation to serve the Ukrainian people and does everything possible to convey his love for Ukraine to all soldiers. — We treat Ukrainians as brothers. We protect Ukraine with Christian love, because we love this land as sincerely as our own homeland. If someone thinks that this is just to make money, then they are deeply mistaken. We are going to war and are forced to fight for love and peace, the chaplain explains. After the coming of peace, he is convinced, everyone will have jobs, because it will be necessary to heal the wounds caused by the war. The priest will have his own special role in this, for which you should prepare now. - Now I am preparing the soldiers for the Christmas celebration. Often we can't be together because of combat and training, but every day I call or write to them, reaching out with a sermon and a prayer. This is very important for them, because no one yearns for peace more than a soldier, says the padre. He notes that not only the body of a soldier suffers from war, but also his psyche and soul. And together with him, his family and relatives also suffer, because they know in what danger their loved one is in. Therefore, the chaplain's task is to help and pray for everyone in need, even when they don't know it. Padre Macarius does this all the time, because he knows that a priest does not have days off - every day of his life should be dedicated to serving the Lord. - When Jesus Christ was born, His land was captured by foreigners. However, He came to us to bring us eternal salvation, no matter what. Therefore, it is very important that regardless of where we are, in this case at war, that we have love for God inside us, - Padre Makariy emphasizes. - When we celebrate our birthday, we get presents. When Christ is born, we ask for gifts and receive gifts. And the most important, the most precious gift today, when this terrible bloody war is going on, the gift for which I pray all the time, is peace! - the military chaplain from Brazil does not hold back his emotions. He calls on all people of goodwill all over the world to pray for this together, because, he is convinced, sincere prayer with true love from every heart is capable of creating a great Christmas miracle: - I ask everyone to pray for Christmas so that this war ends. That the Russians go away from Ukraine to their own country and stay there, that they leave the land of Ukraine forever. Because this is not their land and they should not seek it. Therefore, let's forget about our own selfishness and don't ask for any material gifts for ourselves. Let's pray together for peace in Ukraine and in the whole world. And according to our faith, we will definitely receive this most valuable gift from Our Lord Jesus Christ.

How to become an officer in 40 days as a medic	There is currently a retraining program for tactical-level medical officers in Ukraine. And according to the head of the training department of the headquarters of the Medical Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, medical service colonel Yaroslava Semirunchyk, this allows filling medical positions. The training and retraining of medical service officers for the needs of the Defense Forces is carried out by the Ukrainian Military Medical Academy. span> Military servicemen serving as non-commissioned officers and having a higher medical education must write a report to the name the commander that they wish to undergo additional training under this training program. Documents must be sent to the email address of the Ukrainian Military Medical Academy. The training lasts 40 days. The first block - 22 days takes place online and is completed with credits. After the successful completion of the first block, an invitation is given for an 18-day offline assembly. -These people pass the position in the military units that they hugged They are assigned to the position of an officer in the same military unit and arrive at the military medical academy. Enrolled as cadets. They study for 18 days. After completing training and passing exams, they receive the primary officer rank of junior lieutenant of the medical service,- &#8211; said Yaroslava Semirunchyk. Currently, the 12th recruitment for such a course is underway at the Military Medical Academy. In total, 251 servicemen have already been retrained. This made it possible to fill a significant number of medical positions. As ArmyInform reported, civilian doctors also have the opportunity get the rank of officer. But it will take them 4 months. In particular, doctors fit for service who do not have a military education can apply to military departments of medical higher education institutions. In four months of training, they can obtain the rank of officer for further service in the Armed Forces in positions of their own profile.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/25/yak-medyku-staty-oficzerom-za-40-dniv/	2024-12-24T20:46:14-08:00
Faster, higher, as far as possible: France and Italy created a new version of the Aster 30 missile, ...	Designed to provide advanced defense against sophisticated air threats, including ballistic missiles, this missile was presented as an important element of the European defense strategy. During a recent real-time demonstration at the Biscarross test site, the Aster 30 B1NT successfully handled complex threat simulations, demonstrating its capabilities in high-intensity scenarios. Portal Defense network disclosed some technical data of the newest charge. Designed for use with both the ground-based SAMP/T-NG system and naval systems such as PAAMS, the Aster 30 B1NT missile is capable of intercepting high-speed targets at ranges of over 150 kilometers and altitudes of up to 25 kilometers. Equipped with a high-precision Ka-band radar, this missile is capable of engaging both ballistic and hypersonic missiles. This capability positions the Aster 30 B1NT as a credible European alternative to comparable systems such as the US Patriot, which until recently was widely regarded as the world's leading anti-missile defense option. -Aster 30 B1 NT will be equipped with units of the armed forces of France and Italy, which will operate ground-based air defense systems of the new generation SAMP-T, which are planned to be put into service by 2026. This system is capable of intercepting hypersonic missiles, countering threats in 360 degrees and doing it in a multi-layered way,- emphasized the Minister of Defense of the French Republic Sebastien Lecornu, who was present at the first tests of the warhead. The comments of the Army Recognition site received from European experts indicate that while American Patriot, widely used by NATO armed forces and well known for its effectiveness against short-range ballistic and cruise missiles, the Aster 30 B1NT has greater versatility and intercept medium-range ballistic missiles and high-altitude targets including hypersonic missiles. Most of all, the SAMP/T-NG system, which can be deployed both autonomously and in addition to other NATO defense systems, provides increased flexibility in terms of interoperability and rapid response. Countries such as Belgium, which recently expressed interest in acquiring the SAMP/T-NG system, underline the appeal of the Aster 30 B1NT in Europe. By opting for a European system rather than an American one, Belgium intends to move to greater strategic autonomy while facilitating the integration of its defense capabilities with those of France and Italy, which are currently users of the system. In Brussels, it is emphasized that the adoption of the Aster 30 B1NT would also allow Europe to improve its defense capabilities and optimize the resources of the European military-industrial complex within the framework of the EU with the support of expanded cooperation programs. By participating in the development of the Aster 30 B1NT, the European companies MBDA and Thales demonstrate their ability to compete with the American leaders of such products, contributing to the technological sovereignty of Europe and promoting autonomous defense solutions. Thus, as emphasize European media, this missile meets Europe's goal of reducing dependence on American anti-missile systems by maintaining a high level of protection against complex threats. European commentary notes that as other European countries may soon join France and Italy in deploying the Aster 30 B1NT, this missile could become a cornerstone of European air defenses, strengthening the continent's security against various threats. As reported by ArmyInform , the government of the French Republic attached Aster 30 missiles to aid packages to Ukraine. Aster 30 B1NT rocket test launches.

Why did the Russian Federation launch the IPSO on the exchange of prisoners	In addition, propaganda telegram channels continue to spread fake news that Ukraine is allegedly disrupting the exchange of prisoners of war, citing fake lists of mobilized people who previously had no relation to the army. These are all fakes. First, the Institute for the Study of War did not publish this video on its resources. The video was edited from publicly available materials. In particular, the propagandists took the footage of the released commanders who led the defense of Azovstal from their first video statement after returning from Russian captivity in September 2022. And the footage of the return of the Ukrainian military from captivity was taken by fakers from a video published on October 19, 2024 on the official Telegram channel of Volodymyr Zelenskyi. Alan Scheinwald, who allegedly says that the Ukrainian authorities prefer soldiers of the so-called -nationalist battalions-, because they are more ideologically motivated, not a military expert, but an American investor. In addition, the footage where he seems to be commenting on the strategy of the Ukrainian authorities in exchanging prisoners of war is taken from a video from August 2019. In it, Sheinwald talks about his career as an investor, the company he founded, what services he provides, etc. And, of course, the divisions were incorrectly named in the fake. -Azov- is not a battalion, but a brigade, and -Kraken- is a special unit of the Main Directorate of Intelligence. With such fakes, Russian propaganda tries to discredit Ukraine and the prisoner exchange process. In particular, it is Russia that purposefully does not exchange captured defenders of Mariupol. However, Ukraine consistently advocates the exchange of prisoners, and President Zelenskyi's proposal to exchange -all for all- is ignored by Russia itself. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets noted that her statements about Ukraine's rejection of exchanges are part of an information and psychological operation (IPSO).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/25/dlya-chogo-rf-zapustyla-ipso-pro-obmin-polonenymy/	2024-12-24T20:09:11-08:00

Tourers will work in cultural centers and libraries. It is mostly about villages and towns. At the same time, there are not many people willing to move to TOT, despite the payment, because the Russians understand. that here they are enemies and their career may not be long.

Export volumes of Russian electricity are decreasing	reports this Service of foreign intelligence of Ukraine. During the winter, deliveries to China may stop altogether. In fact, the main problems of the drop in exports are the wear and tear of the infrastructure, high losses of electricity and insufficient flows between the energy systems of the Far East and Siberia. By 2030, the energy deficit in the Far East will reach 10 billion kWh and 3 GW of capacity, because the Kremlin does not have enough money to support the relevant infrastructure, and instead of developing its own country, it continues the war against Ukraine.

The professional standard -Military Accounting Inspector- has been registered in Ukraine.	Colonel Oleksiy Dudka, one of the developers of the mentioned standard and the chief specialist of the Department of the Central Department of Military Education and Science of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told the ArmiyaInform correspondent in more detail about this. -According to the current legislation, we must keep military records in every enterprise. There are more than a million enterprises in Ukraine, and there are still no specialists who know exactly what to do in this position. This standard, as a document, will from now on be a beacon to which you can orient yourself: what should a person in such a position do in all enterprises of Ukraine where military records are kept. And now it is everywhere,- noted Oleksiy Dudka. According to him, the professional standard -Military Accounting Inspector-, which was registered on December 19, is a national document: -Now, any company that plans to hire a specialist - a military accounting inspector - having read this, will know what kind of person needs to be hired, so that they have a military record, so that they have there were no fines. Because the state has taken this issue quite seriously.- The officer emphasized that before the large-scale intrusion into the military records, they did not receive as much attention as they do now. -Now, when the issue of mobilization and the availability of personnel is on the agenda, the state has seriously begun to think about it, and there are no real experts on this issue. The mentioned standard organizes these issues, both for employers who hire these specialists, and for ordinary citizens, conscripts, who work in all enterprises of our country. At the very least, the specialist who will occupy this position will be able to tell how to comply with the laws of Ukraine in the performance of his military duty, how to avoid fines from the TCC and SP, what needs to be done for this, and how to properly perform this duty before the state,- added Oleksiy Dudka. He emphasized that this standard is a guide for all people who, as of now, know too little to finally solve the mobilization issues in our country: -The first thing businesses that will familiarize themselves with this standard should do is send their specialist to training . Currently, about two dozen educational institutions conduct advanced training courses where this science is taught to one degree or another. And after completing such courses, a specialist from the enterprise will meet this standard.

The occupiers' base in Luhansk was exposed thanks to the imprudence of a Russian colonel	About this reports Center of National Resistance. Among the entire array of data, the Defense Forces received lists of Russian Guard personnel who participated in the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.

More than half of Russians dream of the return of the death penalty	About this reports the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Such a high level of support for the death penalty indicates the accumulation of aggression in Russian society. Residents of small towns and villages speak -for- - 58%. In large and medium-sized cities, 49% support the death penalty. 55% of men and 50% of women support the reinstatement of the execution. The biggest opponents of this initiative are persons under the age of 29 (61%). With age, the number of supporters increases — among people aged 60 and over, 65% support the death penalty. In support of the return of the highest degree of punishment, people without higher education are also more likely to express their support - 60%. Among respondents with a higher education, there are equal numbers of supporters and opponents (47% each). The purpose of updating the issue of the death penalty in the Russian Federation is the desire to strengthen the government's control over the population through intimidation and pressure, as well as the Kremlin's demonstration of its -activity- in the fight against terrorism and crime. We remind you that in the temporarily occupied territories, the Russians continue to organize lectures on -their heroes - for teenagers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/24/bilshe-polovyny-rosiyan-mriyut-pro-povernennya-smertnoyi-kary/	2024-12-24T05:32:59-08:00

The result is debts, lack of things and, in the best case, replacement of radiators with similar ones. Individuals in Lysychansk are allowed to conduct business prohibited for others. For example, for 25 thousand rubles, wealthier citizens are offered equipment for using the Internet, which is turned off by the Russians in the front-line zone. The option is unreliable, without a provider and guarantees. But the occupiers are unable to offer anything better than buying an antenna, and with it the opportunity to steal.

Now, according to Anastasia Bobovnikova, difficult battles are going on for the Tsentralna mine. The combat features constant changes in the urban landscape.

Because the banal house that serves as a reference may no longer exist. Nevertheless, we are doing the impossible to evacuate the wounded, and medics are literally saving the lives of soldiers under bullets,- Anastasia Bobovnikova said. Any seizure of a house, and even more so a street, is given to the occupiers with a huge amount of blood, Bobovnikova notes.
