The Ministry of Defense is updating the food supply of the Armed Forces: the pilot project will be l...	About this reported in the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The main task of the new approach is to ensure better quality of products supplied to the Armed Forces and to increase the efficiency of the supply process itself. It was introduced to potential suppliers, manufacturers and distributors. -From February 2025, two models will operate in parallel: the one under which DOT works now, and the new pilot model. This approach is used to ensure the stability of the system and the continuity of the supply process. Transformations in the food model for the military should increase the efficiency of supply and, at the same time, ensure compliance with high standards of product quality,- said Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. The pilot will operate throughout the year and will cover such regions as the city of Kyiv and the Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Cherkasy, and Kirovohrad regions. The main changes concern the financial model of interaction with the supplier, the product model and the quality control process. The supplier will receive compensation for the cost of goods and a fee for services (warehousing and transportation) subject to the SLA. The marginal cost of the catalog will be determined and fixed. For most types of products (75%) through open procurement platforms, the DOT will choose manufacturers who will be contracted by suppliers. For the remaining categories, suppliers will independently identify subcontractors. DOT, in turn, can block them for quality inconsistency and for violating integrity norms. All products will pass through the distribution center and only then be sent to military units. This is an additional stage of quality control, to which DOT specialists will be involved. DOT will apply a -black list- to suppliers and manufacturers - a new tool to prevent participation in the process of providing food for the Armed Forces in future periods of those entities that have already violated contractual obligations . -The idea of ​​the pilot model is to change the philosophy of interaction with suppliers and manufacturers due to the change in their incentives and the openness of the terms of cooperation. We see this approach as the basis of partnership. At the same time, our main goal is to ensure an increase in both the quality of products received by the Armed Forces and the efficiency of the supply process itself. So that, while observing the transparent rules of the game, all participants in the process are interested in ensuring a continuous and high-quality supply of the Armed Forces,- said Halyna Litosh, program director for the food sector of the DOT. Earlier, ArmyInform informed that The Kingdom of Sweden announced the 17th package of military aid to Ukraine in the amount of SEK 4.6 billion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/09/minoborony-onovlyuye-harchove-zabezpechennya-zsu-pilotnyj-proyekt-zapustyat-nastupnogo-roku/	2024-09-09T07:52:03-07:00

The goal of the occupiers was explained on the nationwide telethon by the spokesman of Kharkiv Technical University, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. — Unfortunately, the picture of the entire border area is not much different from Vovchansk.
